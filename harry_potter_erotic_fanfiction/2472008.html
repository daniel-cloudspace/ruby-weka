is intended no profit is being made off this site it is for entertainment purposes only this is my first fan fic i tried to write it so that the reader could truly envision the sixteen year old characters of ron and hermione going through the slow process of realizing that they may be more than friends enjoy i hope chapter 1 ron felt as though the summer had only just begun as he ran through the brick wall between platforms nine and ten to begin his sixth year at hogwarts as soon as he saw the hogwarts express heard the bustle of luggage trolleys and smelled the engine steam chills of excitement erupted on his arms he would miss sleeping in at the burrow and nights without homework but he was more than ready to see his two best friends seeing them was what excited him most about each new year at hogwarts he missed them both terribly although harry and hermione had each mailed him numerous times throughout the summer holiday he had not seen either of them since they left hogwarts last term as great as owl post was there were just some things you couldntget from a letter less than two months ago he and his friends had looked death in the face well death eaters in the face how do you discuss something like that with quill and paper and although harry and hermione both said that they were fine ron wasntso sure letters just werentsufficient in assuring ron that harry was coping with the death of sirius harry never mentioned him in his letters so ron felt it best to avoid the subject harry had mentioned however that this summer wasntall bad due to frequent visits to mrs figg she was harry neighbor who happened to be a squib a non magical witch or wizard hermione on the other hand had mentioned her concern over harry and how he was going to cope with the death of his godfather she continually insisted that she was fine and that it was harry that worried her but again ron had his doubts hermione had narrowly escaped the killing curse last term how could she be fine it was mainly because of that horrible fact that ron was not fine he probably worried about hermione as much as she worried about harry however hermione had apparently enjoyed her summer despite her worries she had visited france with her muggle parents and had sent ron a postcard of the eiffel tower personally ron couldntfathom why muggles adored visits to this gargantuan metal construction but hermione had had a blast she thought the tower was breathtakingly beautiful as ron approached the hogwarts express with his trunk of school things and a caged and squawking pigwedgeon he noticed something much more breathtakingly beautiful than the eiffel tower could ever hope to be hermione was talking animatedly to ginny who had come through the wall in front of ron hermione hair was pulled back in a loose bun with soft brown tendrils curling around her face had it only been six weeks since he last saw her he loved hermione and harry both but he didntfeel like this when he saw harry after summer holiday just the sight of hermione had made his body feel slightly numb and tingly ginny seemed to have outgrown hermione in height and was looking down at her friend with interest at their conversation ron was so taken aback at hermione beauty that he hadntnoticed fred and george standing directly behind him with looks of amusement on their faces ron twin brothers had come along to see ron and ginny off and pass out free samples of their newest joke shop merchandise so ron fred said suddenly causing ron to turn to his brother with surprise congratulations on making it through to the platform his comment was dripping with sarcasm but maybe fred and i should illustrate your next task george chimed in with the same mocking tone yeah little brother watch and learn watch and learn fred and george started making their way toward ginny and hermione watch closely now ron george yelled over his shoulder ron watched with apprehension after the twins had they seen him staring at hermione he hoped they hadn t but not as much as he hoped they werentabout to embarrass him further should he yell for them to stop whatever they were about to do no ron thought they wouldntlisten to me anyway a light sweat was beading along ron forehead they wouldnt say anything to hermione would they ron didntknow what had come over him hermione was his friend and only his friend he had been telling himself this over and over since their fourth year at hogwarts when hermione had become involved with viktor krum an international quidditch player her obvious attraction to krum had eaten away at ron like an acid definitely not the feeling he got when harry had something going with cho chang but hermione was nothing more to ron than harry was a best friend ron had come to the conclusion that any boy with a female best friend would at some point think of them in a more than friendly way eventually he would get over it he had to hermione was way out of ron league anyway as was krum it not like he had a chance with her the twins had snuck up behind hermione giving ginny a shushing sign before they each grabbed one of hermione arms and lifted her off the ground to kiss her on her cheeks hermione had gasped when she left the ground but her face had broken into a broad smile as the twins lowered her back down they were all laughing ginny smiling and shaking her head those two could make any task look like a walk in the park ron thought even picking up and kissing an outright gorgeous girl with a sigh ron decided to make his way toward them hermione eyes got suddenly wide as she spotted ron approaching and she practically ran to him and wrapped her arms around his neck ron stumbled back a step as he clumsily returned her hug ron hermione squealed in his ear before she released her viselike grip around his neck to look up into his face i ve missed you and wow i really like your hair ron smiled awkwardly as hermione reached up to poke at his flaming red hair ginny had convinced him to let her cut it over the summer it was now shorter than it had ever been and gelled all over into short scarlet spikes he couldntsquelch the excited feeling he got from knowing that hermione had noticed it ah yeah thanks and missed you too they smiled at each other for a moment before ron broke the stare with an awkward jerk of his head downward um have you seen harry before he could finish hermione let out another squeal ron waved at harry who was dragging his trunk and a caged hedwig toward them with a tired smile hermione gave him a quick sisterly hug before stepping back with a slightly worried look are you alright harry you look exhausted oh i fine this is just the look of someone who been trapped in a vehicle with the dursley for an hour harry said with a disgruntled look but then a small smile crept onto his face as his eyes drifted toward the train ron followed harry line of vision to see fred george and ginny talking to neville longbottom and luna lovegood they were all in pleasant conversation except ron noticed his sister she was looking over in harry direction with a coy smile ron raised one eyebrow so she doesntfancy harry anymore huh i can see through that he thought smiling to himself oh crap am i that obvious ron cast a nervous sideways glance at hermione as the train whistle blew shrilly through the crowd announcing boarding time lugging their heavy trunks hermione ron and harry managed to get a compartment with ginny luna and neville hermione felt an almost giddy feeling at the thought of going back to hogwarts finally her insides were screaming she loved her muggle parents and france had been great but she never felt truly at home unless she was with ron and harry plus she had much more access to informative books at hogwarts than she had at home her personal library was expanding quickly but she d already read all of those books at least twice hermione sat down next to luna who was wistfully telling them all about her summer in ireland with her father they had been studying a new breed of crumple headed snortflanks for an article in the quibbler just ignore her hermione told herself sternly she knew her other friends were thinking the same thing as she that there were no such things as crumple headed snortflanks however they didntseem to have any trouble just nodding politely and continuing in the discussion of what they d done for their summer holidays so why was it that such blatant disregard for reality drove her through the wall hermione glanced up and noticed that ron who was sitting directly across from her had been looking at her but quickly looked down once she caught his eye oh yes i remember now blatant disregard for reality causes girlish things like stomach butterflies to occur reality such as the fact that her friend ron weasley had simply been looking around the compartment and not purposefully at her was what one must hold onto people like luna living in dream worlds were only setting themselves up to be hurt dream worlds were just dreams this dream of being more than a friend to ron had been plaguing her for too long too long for hermione to actually kid herself into thinking that it would go away anytime soon it was just going to be one of those horrible crushes that wouldntgo away unless she found someone else to love love did she love ron yes of course she loved him as a friend but hermione glanced over at ginny she was really growing up the introverted yet jumpy little girl from a couple of years ago was almost unrecognizable hermione had always felt a deep emotional connection with ron sister because she knew that ginny felt the same way about harry as hermione felt about ron of course hermione had never told ginny about her feelings toward ron she hadnttold and wouldnttell anyone neville had started showing them his new wand 12 inches birch wood four hairs from a wemic tail his old one had been broken last term in the department of mysteries when they had all fought for their lives against voldemort death eaters apparently neville grandmother had been so pleased to have him back in one piece she had taken neville to a famous wandmaker in germany hermione knew that ollivander didntuse wemic tail hairs in his wands and she made a mental note to research their magic glancing over at harry she thought he looked more worn and sad than she had ever seen him he wasntreally acting any differently but she could see a change in his eyes she wished neville would stop talking about his wand she was afraid it was reminding harry too much of that awful night she d told ron over the summer that she was worried about harry he d lost his godfather his parents murderer was back and hermione wondered if he were still having those horrible dreams she had been more frightened than she had ever been in her life that night at the ministry that is before dolohov had attempted the killing curse on her she couldntremember anything after that she gave an involuntary shudder it was just luck that she had put that silencing charm on him right before he cast it yes she had been very lucky they had all been lucky except for one harry luna said suddenly breaking into hermione thoughts why do you think the war hasntstarted yet do you think mr voldemort was frightened into hiding by his encounter with headmaster dumbledore at the department of mysteries hermione mouth fell open there seemed to be a pregnant pause hanging over their heads how could she just ask him that as if she were asking the time mr voldemort she nudged ron foot with hers and he looked up with a nervous frown what in the world is she thinking hermione attempted to ask him silently with her wide eyes he shook his head slightly well harry began quietly i ve wondered the same thing actually i guess it possible that he frightened hermione caught a small glance that harry gave her and ron after these words the pregnant pause returned so luna neville would you two like to go with me to track down the food trolley i starving ginny said suddenly breaking the awkward silence she was looking at harry suspiciously as she left the compartment with the other two as soon as the door slammed shut harry scooted down to ron and leaned in toward him and hermione listen i think ginny could tell i wanted to tell you two something he paused with a brief smile before resuming in a serious tone i had another dream over the summer i told dumbledore and he told the order hermione heart felt as if it were being crushed by an invisible hand oh harry hermione whispered ron ran a frustrated hand through his hair dumbledore says the order is doing all they can but there no way of knowing if it were a real vision or not what was it about the dream ron asked tensely i was seeing it through his eyes voldemort s he was really angry because wormtail had failed at some important mission voldemort did the cruciatus curse on him and there was a woman in the corner laughing i i think it was bellatrix harry finished softly he had said lestrange name through clenched teeth hermione began reaching a hand out to harry but he stood up quickly and started pacing the small compartment look the mission had something to do with kidnapping a a muggle born hermione hand flew to her mouth ron head jerked away from harry to look at hermione a muggle born hermione felt suddenly sick to her stomach harry sat down slowly beside hermione and put an arm around her look hermione i donteven know if the dream was real and even if it was there are tons of muggle borns you really donthave anything to worry about he looked down briefly and released his arm from around her i shouldnthave told you you re going to worry no harry i want you to tell us about your dreams hermione said sincerely willing herself not to shed the tears that were stinging her eyes she took a deep breath okay she thought there are tons of muggle borns like harry said but there arenttons of muggle borns that are close friends with harry potter ron was still staring at her with a horribly fearful look it wasnthelping her nerves it not you hermione harry it not her what would he need with her nothing it not you ron said fervently he didntsound convincing at all and hermione wasntconvinced it not her it not her it not her ron felt like his heart had exploded in his chest and was slowly rebuilding itself harry was wrong that just one of those fake dreams from voldemort it had to be dumbledore has promised to teach me occlumency this term harry said plainly i wonthave to worry about these dreams after that oh harry that wonderful hermione said in approval she had gone ghostly pale after harry description of his dream but now her color was returning yeah i finally ready for these dreams to stop harry said gruffly ron thought there was something strange about his tone when he d said it something that made ron doubt his friend sincerity hermione hadntcaught it thankfully she was looking at harry with a relieved smile ron current feeling was nothing close to relief however he really wished that harry had not told hermione about that dream it not her anyway now she ll be worrying for nothing ron looked up at hermione now quiet expression maybe she not the one that will be worrying for nothing he thought miserably harry was looking at ron apologetically when he suddenly pulled his trunk down from the overhead luggage carrier he rummaged through it for a second before pulling out a large red envelope with gold lettering who wants to go first harry asked unexpectedly hermione sat up straight and smiled brightly oh yes o w l grades just a second hermione shot up from her seat to retrieve her o w l results from her own trunk as ron silently thanked harry with his eyes brilliant w ay to change the subject ron thought only exam results could take hermione mind off of that dream so quickly ron stood up to retrieve his red letter as well okay harry you go first hermione said happily after sitting down with her envelope resting in her lap ron had just sat down with his envelope when harry tossed his at ron who caught it just before it hit him in the face you read them out ron harry said turning a bit pink what did he look nervous for ron was pleased with his own scores harry must ve done well he opened up harry envelope and pulled out the thick gold paper inside ron cleared his throat hermione was sitting so close to the edge of her seat he was afraid she d fall out in the aisle if he didnthurry twelve o w l and an overall grade of outstanding blimey harry our scores are almost identical ron exclaimed excitedly he had been sure that harry would ve done much better than him hermione was glowing hey how d you get an outstanding in snape practical ron asked as an afterthought harry shrugged modestly twelve o w l s oh that wonderful you can choose any career path you want now she stood up quickly and hugged harry around the neck before sitting next to ron now your turn your turn she said hastily looking at ron and almost bouncing up and down on her seat with excitement ron smiled at her and handed her his envelope she opened it quickly her hands shaking slightly and then her eyes went wide as she squealed with delight oh ron thirteen o w l s and your overall grade is outstanding too she hugged him around the neck and ron had to resist the urge to squeeze her to him he was very excited about his o w l s and more so now that hermione was hanging around his neck he had never expected to do so well hermione pulled away from him and took both harry and ron hands i am so proud of both of you i probably would ve gotten all d if it werentfor your study schedule hermione ron said truthfully harry nodded enthusiastically as he sat down on the other side of ron hermione smiled at them turning a bit pink pink was a great color for her ron thought absently as hermione stood up and went back to her side of the compartment she opened her envelope and handed her gold paper shyly to ron ron looked down at the paper and stood up so quickly he hit his head on the bottom of the luggage carrier grabbing his head and rubbing it he exclaimed sixteen outstanding o w l s across the board hermione that probably a new record in hogwart history he looked down at hermione who was smiling sheepishly harry eyes were round as he stared at her open mouthed and and ron sputtered how in the bloody hell did you get an outstanding o w l in astronomy hagrid and mcgonagall were being attacked right under our noses he sat down slowly looking at hermione with pure astonishment she was now a deeper pink well i was already finished with my star chart when all that started and actually dumbledore holds the record for the most o w l s he received eighteen and ronald dontswear she finished holding back a smile ron just continued to stare at her shaking his head he wished he could kiss her he truly was proud of her well harry began matter of factly it feels pretty good to be best mates with the brightest witch at hogwarts eh ron that it does ron said smiling at harry hermione giggled a little well it probably feels about the same as being best friends with the two brightest wizards at hogwarts she said kindheartedly oh really ron began jokingly when do we get to meet these two geniuses hermione ron and harry enjoyed the rest of the train ride discussing their chosen career paths hermione had secretly been pleased that ron had received one more o w l than harry it was good for his self esteem to excel at something a bit better than his best friend of course harry would have gotten thirteen o w l if he hadntpassed out in agonizing painbefore finishinghis history exam but that was beside the point they each had worked hard for their grades and now they would be rewarded with the option of becoming aurors she was glad that the three of them had decided not to share their o w l results or chosen n e w t classes over the summer because it was much better seeing the excitement on harry and ron faces as they talked on and on about auror training hermione already knew that that was probably what they would each choose but she was excited for them nonetheless harry would be taking the field agent path while ron took the logistics path they would both be certified aurors if and when they made it through training but ron work would be done safely behind a desk coordinating missions hermione couldnthelp the fact that she had been relieved to hear that ron wouldntattempt the field agent path she knew he would have been great at it but she couldntstand it if something happened to him hermione on the other hand did not desire to be an auror it made her nervous beyond comprehension just thinking about the many dangerous missions she had heard about from tonks kingsley and mad eye no she wanted to take the administration path this offered many options her favorite being education maybe she could be a professor at hogwarts or even headmistress that was getting a tad bit ahead of herself though but the thought excited her nevertheless after reaching hogwarts they quickly descended the stairs of the train they spotted hagrid at the other end of the platform rounding up the first years hermione noticed that he didnthave any new cuts or bruises and she wondered if he were still seeing his brother grawp they waved at him excitedly before making their ways to the thestral drawn carriages although hermione couldntsee the thestrals she noticed harry neville and luna eyeing the empty spaces in front of the carriages with slight interest i sure they re beautiful but if seeing death is the only way to see them i prefer not to hermione whispered beside ron for only him to hear he looked down at her face and she felt a flutter deep in her stomach did he realize how piercing his stare was the moonlight was shining on his red hair and deep blue eyes hermione noticed that his features were beginning to get a more harsh edge to them and when he looked at her as he was doing now she could see a muscle working in his jaw how long was he going to stare at her it may not affect him but her face was beginning to feel on fire what hermione asked abruptly she silently cursed herself for sounding so breathless ron immediately looked away from her was that embarrassment she saw tinting his freckled ears sorry ron said quietly looking away fully aware of the increasing redness on his ears and neck he was really slipping well that canthappen again he told himself firmly he had been staring at her in a daze for at least fifteen seconds ron made a mental note to avoid looking at hermione when the moonlight shone on her face like that guys over here they both looked up to see harry waving at them from a nearby carriage they weaved their way through the crowd of students until they reached the carriage and ron was slightly surprised when he looked inside uh harry it a bit full already dontyou think ron said peering inside the coach at neville luna and ginny just get in you two ginny said exasperatedly ron stepped back to let hermione in who used his and harry shoulders to boost herself up into the carriage across from ginny and beside neville harry got inside next squeezing in next to ginny the only space left was beside hermione and it was hardly enough room for a small person much less a six foot tall boy ron hoisted himself into the carriage nevertheless and somehow managed to sit beside hermione ron had to put his arm over the back of their seat to accommodate himself and he could have sworn hermione shifted her weight away from neville to lean into his side was neville that disgusting to her or wishful thinking he thought but even so hermione seemed to fit so perfectly in the crook of his arm and he could smell her shampooed hair it was a lovely smell in ron opinion much better than the flowery perfumes most girls wore like the one he had given hermione last christmas what a dolt hermione shifted slightly and her leg rubbed against his own ron swallowed hard as he was brought out of his reverie it was an extremely enjoyable trip and ron found himself wishing the trail to the castle were much much longer author note i will continue to write chapters for this storyline even though jk hbp is coming out in a little over a week i already have a plotline and summary for my own story so hopefully my readers can enjoy my story regardless that it was written i promise a lot more romance is coming the characters and situations of harry potter depicted in this story are the legal property of j k rowling bloomsbury and aol time warner and have been used without permission no copyright violation is intended no profit is being made off this site it is for entertainment purposes only chapter 10 there was a cool bite to the late october air and a dense covering of white clouds the leaves were different shades of yellow brown red and orange a perfect day for a visit to hogsmeade hermione was very excited about spending some time with harry he was always so busy with homework occlumency flying and going for walks these days it was almost as if he were avoiding her and ron well this trip should be good for all of them they were all busy and tired from their schoolwork hermione dressed in some warm corduroy pants a sweater and a rainbow striped scarf that mrs weasley had knitted her one christmas she was now simply waiting on ginny to finish getting ready they were meeting in the girl staircase what was taking her so long she never took this long just when hermione had decided to go into the lavatory to check on her friend ginny came bustling out of the fifth year girl dormitory hermione was a bit taken aback at what she saw ginny are you are you wearing makeup hermione asked curiously ginny nodded smiling hermione didntknow why she was so surprised ginny was fifteen after all it was just that neither of them had ever worn makeup except for at the yule ball ginny wasntwearing a lot just enough to make her light brown eyes pop and her mouth appear glossy she looked quite pretty however hermione found that the time effort and money that it took to wear makeup wasnta good trade off for the improvement in appearance she wouldntmention that to ginny though you look very nice hermione said with a smile ginny simply shrugged in thanks ron and harry were waiting for them by the fireplace in the common room ron was wearing a maroon sweater he looked extremely handsome hermione then noticed harry do a double take in ginny direction hermione met ron eye and they had to look away from each other to keep from laughing harry was the only boy hermione knew of that ron would allow to look at his sister that way hermione thought that it would be great for harry to date someone again whether it were ginny or not he seemed so serious and bleak this term he needed something in his life that could make him forget his troubles something that would take his mind off of that stupid fake prophecy maybe she could give harry a small push in ginny direction then again after seeing the way he d just looked at her hermione wondered if she would even need to intervene the walk to hogsmeade was extremely pleasant the four of them walked at a brisk pace along the graveled path and talked about how great it felt to be outside of the stone walls of the castle now that they were outside of the grounds hermione felt as if she had been inside a fort for almost two months as soon as they reached the edge of town an aroma of homemade breads pumpkin pies candy and chimney smoke greeted hermione nostrils sounds of cheerful hogwarts students could be heard coming from the insides of every shop there were jack o lanterns in front of every building and hay bales set up in random corners with cornstalks and gourds adorning them something was different however the small wizarding town was not nearly as busy as it usually was around halloween time hermione wondered if it were due to the ministry recent acknowledgment of the rise of voldemort and his death eaters were people now afraid to leave their houses the thought made her shiver are you really all that cold harry asked her bemusedly as the four of them entered the three broomsticks hmm oh yes i mean no i fine hermione stammered out she definitely didntwant to mention voldemort around harry today she wanted this to be a worry free trip for him harry shrugged but hermione noticed ron raise his eyebrow at her the four found a booth toward the back of the bar after they d each bought a bottle of butterbeer hermione and ginny sat beside each other on the lacquered wooden bench with the boys across from them hermione opened her bottle and took a sip of the sweet liquid but ginny was having some difficulty she was leaned over her bottle slightly with her face scrunched up hermione was about to offer her assistance when ginny sat up quickly with a surprised look her bottle cap had disappeared harry was smiling mischievously from across the table tucking his wand back inside his jacket he flicked the bottle cap out of his hand with his thumb which clattered to a halt on the table in front of ginny hey ginny exclaimed smiling how d you do that harry ron asked with an impressed smile vanishing charm harry and hermione said together a dawning look appeared on ron face i could ve gotten an opened bottle myself with a bit of magic ginny replied playfully taking her wand from her sweater pocket harry took a sip of his own butterbeer set it down and then crossed his arms with a let s see then smile on his face ginny cleared her throat flicked her wand and whispered an incantation too quiet to hear suddenly harry opened bottle rose from the table and floated over to ginny where she snatched it proudly from the air to then take a small sip all four of them laughed at this and ron gave his sister a standing ovation hermione was elated to see harry acting so carefree suddenly however ginny eyes went wide and she grabbed a hold of hermione arm ron sat down quickly looking at his sister with confusion u u umbridge she whispered fretfully hermione ron and harry immediately looked toward the door to see a burly middle aged man with messy brown hair and a rather large mole on his nose walking slowly to the bar from the entrance harry and ron both turned back around wheezing with laughter ginny hermione reprimanded although she was giggling herself ginny just shrugged sorry i thought it was her she said innocently harry and ron were slowly recovering from their laughter harry was finally able to speak so what actually did happen to umbridge he said curiously his top lip rose in disgust when he said her name dad says she at st mungo s ginny said intensely what he didnttell me that ron said in confusion ginny shrugged he probably wouldnthave thought to tell me but i asked he says she has post traumatic stress disorder she cantsleep without powerful sleeping droughts but even then she wakes up with horrible nightmares she jumps at the slightest noise and sometimes has to be restrained with straps for fear that she might hurt herself or someone else dad says the healers doubt she ll ever be able to leave the hospital ginny glanced around the room before leaning in further i think she on the same floor as neville parents hermione ron and harry sat gaping at this unexpected news for a minute hermione couldnthelp but feel that her disorder was well deserved of course she wouldntsay this aloud it was such a horrible thought plus it seemed almost rude to say anything of the sort after the mention of neville parents well there goes my theory for the headmistress of that bloody school ron said plainly ginny nodded in agreement but hermione noticed harry face paling at the mention of the school hermione suddenly felt the need to say something about the weather or something as equally trivial to break the silence however the sound of a glass bottle shattering drifted to them from across the room an attractive fifth year girl with long curly blonde hair had stood up from the booth she had been sharing with seamus finnigan she had apparently thrown her bottle of butterbeer at his head because he was coming out from under their table and there was broken glass and butterbeer all around his seat everyone in the bar had turned toward the unexpected noise april love seamus called after the girl who was now stalking out of the bar you dontunderstan she just like a a buff an blister to me ginny snorted almost spraying her butterbeer on the table that complete idiot i wondered how long he could keep it up hermione turned to ginny after watching seamus run out of the bar after his angry girl what do you mean harry asked curiously his color returning well ginny said in a slight whisper causing the other three to lean in close to listen seamus has been dating april hannings for about a month now the same amount of time he been snogging with lavender brown under the quidditch stadium brilliant ron managed to croak through a wheezing laugh harry and ginny laughed too what was their problem hermione didntfind anything funny about the situation ron you are completely immature she spat focusing her frustration across the table at him that poor girl must be heartbroken ron rolled his eyes oh she hated when he did that it sent angry shudders straight through her hermione ginny began calmly she really had it coming i mean april is a bit of a flirt herself hermione just gaped at ginny she looked over at harry to see if she might have at least one ally but he was avoiding her eye by peeling the butterbeer label off of his bottle hermione stood up from the booth oh hermione please dontbe angry with us you re right seamus was very wrong ginny said grabbing hermione arm and attempting to pull her back down i just need some fresh air hermione lied i wontbe long hermione ron whined but hermione was already halfway out of the bar the wind whipped across her face as she stepped outside and it felt good on her burning cheeks she could spit she was so angry she didntreally know why either it had just bubbled up out of nowhere she didntknow april hannings and that girl romantic life was really none of her business she was beginning to feel a little guilty for leaving so abruptly she d really wanted to spend some time with harry hermione began taking in deep breaths of the cool air she would just walk off her unexpected anger and then go back to the others as if nothing had happened ron watched after hermione with his mouth gaping open what in bloody hell is her problem he asked harry who was staring after her as well i ve no idea mate harry said with a shrug ginny then let out a huge sigh and mumbled something that sounded like good grief ron go check on her ginny said in an almost bored voice what are you mad i staying away from her when she like that thank you oh stop being such a baby and go apologize apologize i not the one doing whatever with lavender brown under the bleachers well then at least be a good friend and go talk to her ron could not believe this when had his little sister become a copy of his mother it sounded just like something his mum would say go apologize for something you didntdo while carelessly throwing yourself in the path of an irate teenage girl ron was about to open his mouth and exclaim that ginny and harry were her friends too but then he remembered the look he had seen pass between harry and ginny that first day at the train station maybe ginny wanted him to leave so that she could be alone with harry well that made a lot more sense to ron than the rubbish she was feeding him now ron heaved himself up from his bench fine i going he turned around to leave just as harry called good luck ginny had the nerve to giggle and ron shot them both contemptuous glares after he d gotten outside he looked to his right and immediately saw hermione walking toward the back of town if he hadntgotten a sudden pang of worry he might ve turned and gone the other way however he really didntthink she should be walking around town alone so taking a deep breath he jogged up the road to catch up with her he slowed down as he came up behind her and decided not to let his presence known just yet he was only a mere two feet from her did she really not know he was there she was walking briskly toward the edge of town now what if he were a death eater they were now passing gladrags ron was sure she was about to stop and turn around but she continued to walk was she mental they d now passed the last shop dervish and banges she was walking right out of the town on her own hermione he yelled not being able to stand it any longer she stopped dead in her tracks with a loud gasp and he almost bumped into her she then turned around with both hands over her mouth her hands dropped fiercely to her sides ron you scared me half to death she said shrilly before unexpectedly pushing him hard on his chest with both hands he stumbled backward a couple of steps i dontcare what do you think you re doing walking all the way out here by yourself this was another one of those times when he was so angry with her he either wanted to arm wrestle her or kiss her hermione angry look faded slightly as she looked around as if just now noticing where she was i i didntrealize how far i d gone she said almost guiltily ron rubbed his hands hard over his face well let me show you he cried moving to stand behind her he grabbed her by her petite shoulders and turned her roughly to face the village leaning down so that his mouth was a mere two inches from her ear he growled with ridicule what you see in front of you is called safety what you see behind you is danger he was breathing heavily with frustration had she completely forgotten harry dream even if she hadn t she should never walk out of town alone especially in the opposite direction of hogwarts as he looked at hermione profile his frustration began ebbing away she had closed her eyes tight and was gnawing on the inside of her cheek she was absolutely beautiful he suddenly realized how close they were his jagged breathing was causing the hair around her ear to caress her cheek and his chest was only a few inches from her back what you see behind you is danger he thought yeah ron weasley if he didntstep away from her now he dropped his hands from her shoulders and turned around to look away from the village what got into you anyway back at the pub he asked quietly with his back to her she came around to stand in front of him and placed both hands on her hips me what got into me she scoffed and stamped one foot what what that you say oh some poor girl is being subjected to the effects of a disloyal fickle typical boy perverse affairs oh simply brilliant tell us seamus how do you do it ron simply stared at her for a moment with his mouth partway open he was almost certain he d never seen a person head move from side to side while looking straight ahead and keeping eye contact it was quite scary hermione what in the you are really overreacting ron immediately became aware that that was the wrong thing to say hermione mouth dropped open and her eyes went round overreacting i suppose you think all boys are two timing well they aren t and i i feel awful for the dolt that falls for you she brushed past him to make her way back into the village ron heart clamped painfully he felt as if she d just slapped him straight in the face he turned around quickly and lunged forward to grab her right arm he caught her right above the elbow and turned her around to face him grabbing hold of her other arm now wait wait just just a damn minute he sputtered she was glaring at him with her amazing brown eyes and trying fruitlessly to pull herself from his grip we can do this all day or you can stop a minute and listen to me he said calmly she wriggled around some more using what ron guessed was all her strength to break free of his hold before stopping she blew her hair out of her face fine just let go of me she finished with a defeated note in her voice he dropped her arms and took a deep breath she wasntlooking at him she was peering out over the hill before them listen hermione seamus finnigan is daft he likes firewhiskey too much and every week he in love with a different girl about a year ago he kind of started eyeing you wait til i done to yell at me but i threatened him not to go near you you you deserve more than that and probably every girl does so i think it brilliant that he finally been caught in the act it brilliant that he narrowly missed a glass bottle to his big thick head she was looking at him now her expression wasntreadable but at least it didntlook angry anymore she looked more sad than angry which surprised ron he had expected her to scream at him for threatening seamus from dating her he was sure she would have if he had added that he would ve done the same thing even if seamus were the nicest and most loyal guy in the world ron i really sor she began in an almost whisper dontapologize ron said coldly not looking at her we should go find harry and ginny he stepped around her and started back into town he suddenly wished he were back at the castle alone in his dormitory hermione was lying awake in her four poster bed with the curtains drawn around her she was absolutely miserable she hadntspoken to ron since their dispute actually she hadnthad a chance he was completely avoiding her they had found harry and ginny right where they d left them she knew they could both tell something was wrong as soon as she and ron had returned to the pub ginny had almost immediately suggested they all go back to the castle she had tried to talk to hermione once they d gotten back and were safely up in the girl stairwell but hermione had refused to talk about it she just hadntfelt up to confessing oh i just bombarded your brother with unfounded accusations i think i may have physically pushed him and oh yes i told him i felt sorry for his future love hermione shook her head before rolling over still fully dressed and forced herself to try and go to sleep it was only about five o clock in the evening but she couldntfind the energy to leave her bed what was it with this year hogsmeade visits it was as if they were cursed after another hour of brooding over her earlier behavior she drifted off to a fitful sleep the following week classes dragged on as brightly colored leaves began to cover the grounds classes were odd because harry now sat between her and ron in every class and ron still wouldnteven look at her hermione spent a lot of extra time studying in the library and she was thankful that there was double quidditch practice for this saturday game the first game of the season she couldntstand to be around harry and ron it was just too awkward with ron avoiding her at all costs she could tell that harry didntknow how to handle it she and ron had fought numerous times before but they had never gone a week without speaking ginny seemed to have grown tired of ron angst toward hermione the moment she recognized it before she even knew what caused it the day after the hogsmeade visit hermione had thought it only fair to tell ginny about the foul comment she had made toward ron hermione had been expecting ginny to reprimand her and go comfort her brother but instead she had begun attacking ron with her fierce mother like tongue at every opportune moment ginny had told hermione he knows you didntmean it he just being a child it seemed that harry was trying to spend an equal amount of time with each of them so as not to choose sides he even came with her to the library one night while ron insisted on turning in early the only good thing about her and ron dispute was that she had seen harry more than she had in a long while though she hated the extra stress this was surely putting on harry and by the end of the week she was losing her patience with ron childishness and beginning to agree with ginny assessment of the situation anytime she tried to find a moment alone with ron to apologize maybe grovel a little he would immediately remember something he had to do she had now decided to just stop trying if he didntvalue their friendship enough to forgive her she would just ignore him too ron you cant do this anymore you just can t it not right to hermione it not fair you know she would never mean something like that she spoke out of anger you re being ridiculous think about harry he must feel like he lost his two best friends this week you re acting like a moping little brat just like percy ron was sitting in the corner of the empty common room in a plush armchair staring blindly at the fire while ginny voice droned on it was almost time for him to dress out for the first quidditch match of the season and ginny was making him even more nervous than he usually felt before a big game she had been fussing at him all week the first time she had compared him to percy he had stood up and screamed back at her but he d heard it so many times now it only made his eye twitch slightly when she said it he couldntreally say anything to ginny that would make her understand his behavior unless he told her how he felt toward hermione and that was not an option i feel awful for the dolt that falls for you hermione words just kept playing over and over in his mind like an annoying tune he couldntstop humming why had those words bothered him so much he already knew that she was too good for him and that he had no chance of ever winning her heart but now that he had evidence proof that hermione would never fall for him it felt like a knife had been thrust into his heart ron ginny yelled suddenly he looked up to see her staring at him with wide eyes i just said that if you love hermione you ll stop torturing her she feels just awful so do you or dontyou do i or donti what ron asked slowly he thought he already knew the answer his heart was beating rapidly and he d begun to sweat do you love her ginny asked impatiently ron took a deep breath crap crap crap now what lie lie lie he told himself no he exclaimed too quickly ginny wrinkled her brow and looked at ron with confusion i mean i well i love my friends well i love harry and and but no i don t it not like ginny sat down slowly in an armchair directly in front of ron one hand went to her mouth and her eyes widened i knew it she was speaking in a strange breathy voice ginny are you okay i knew it she had jumped up from her armchair and lunged at him she sat down in his lap and gave him a bone crushing hug then stood up quickly and started swaying back and forth excitedly this was abnormal behavior ron thought what did she know you are one hundred percent completely and unbelievably in love with hermione granger crap crap crap lie lie lie no no no no no no ginny ron stood up to face his sister ron it not like i didntalready know i mean the crush thing really ron it so obvious but you donthave a crush on her she exclaimed happily now she was really making ron head hurt right right there no crush ron said quickly ginny just laughed ron you have to tell her wait that i sorry for the past week or that i donthave a crush on her ron no you have to tell her that you love her ginny said more seriously now he wasntsure where he d screwed up this conversation but it had taken a really wrong turn somewhere he needed to back this conversation up convince ginny that he didntlove hermione like that but when he looked at his sister expectant expression he somehow knew that he couldnttake back whatever he had revealed ginny knew ginny listen please promise me that you wonttell anybody not mum not dad not harry and especially not hermione he pleaded ron why she asked desperately how did he explain it how could he make her see that he could never be good enough for hermione ginny hermione reads humongous history books i read the back of my chocolate frog cards hermione has never once failed an exam i ve never once made a perfect mark hermione is perfect and i just me ron finished lamely ginny was now looking at him sadly ron she began but he couldntlisten anymore she would just try to convince him to tell hermione and he couldnttake the chance that ginny might actually persuade him i going to go up to my dormitory right now and get ready for the game you re not going to say anything about this to hermione all right after the game i will apologize to hermione but i absolutely will not tell her that i ron sighed and crossed his arms roughly across his chest ginny i through talking about this he shouted ron didntgive ginny a chance to retort instead he walked hurriedly up to his dormitory leaving her staring after him hermione had finally made her way up to the gryffindor stands she had never really realized until this afternoon that if it werentfor harry ron and ginny she would probably be alone most of the time she had planned on walking to the quidditch stadium with neville or dean but they werentin the common room when she had come down from her dormitory seamus and lavender had been there but hermione definitely didntwant to follow them to the quidditch stadium after what ginny had said so she had made the trek alone this first week of november was exceptionally cool her fingers and toes were already numb by the time she reached her seat she had actually considered not coming but she felt that she needed to show her support for harry and ginny sakes hermione found herself remembering the good luck kiss she had given ron before one of their games last year which led her mind to reminiscing over the kiss she d given him the night he comforted her over malfoy she really missed ron so much but she had no clue how to get him to talk to her again her reverie was broken as the announcer terry boot a ravenclaw boy began the introduction of the players both teams had flown out together in a wave of red gold green and silver the fourteen players hovered above the ground looking focused and waiting for madam hooch to give the signal hermione had brought along her omnioculars and used them to zoom in on the players it was a little difficult for her to focus them on each player but she finally managed to zoom in on harry he looked very ready for action and there were the creevey brothers looking extremely excited and antsy this was their first game now where was ron hermione slowly began scanning over the magnified players when her heart suddenly jumped into her throat she quickly released the omnioculars to hang by the strap around her neck they had landed on malfoy and he had been looking straight at her with a purely evil look could he see her from down there suddenly hermione heard the shrill whistle from madam hooch and she saw the large red quaffle fly up into the air and and it caught by pucey called the magnified voice of terry boot he being closely flanked by weasley and bullet and wow he getting dangerously close to the gryffindor goalposts already oh he shoots and it saved by weasley uh ginny weasley that is how did she do that well weasley with the quaffle man she flying well i mean as in her speed not that nevermind zabini approaching quickly uh oh bludger hit by crabbe whoo narrowly misses weasley and here it is she shoots she scores ten points for gryffindor hermione let out a whoop and began clapping crazily the crowd was going wild wow ginny first game and she already scored ron must be so proud ron hermione grabbed her omnioculars and focused them on the gryffindor goalposts there he was he had a look of pure concentration on his face as he hovered in the center the sun was shining brightly on his flaming hair which complimented his uniform very nicely had he filled out his uniform like that last year hermione didntthink so his shirt fit tightly across his chest and arms her mind eye began flashing pictures of what his barren chest had looked and felt like granger i think most of the players are at the other end of the field right now hermione dropped her omnioculars and spun around to see dean thomas smiling roguishly neville was beside him but thankfully he was watching the game hermione blushingfuriously attempted a small smile at dean before focusing her attention on the other players good block from bletchley he throws the quaffle to warrington but he better watch it ow too late good bludger action from the creevey brothers though and now it bullet with the quaffle she passes to weasley can she do it again um no apparently not warrington recovers the quaffle what this an interesting pass pattern zabini to warrington to zabini to warrington to bell ha dontthink that was planned but it apparently works for gryffindor as she scores twenty to zero gryffindor but let not celebrate too early it appears pucey is going in for the kill where a bludger when you need one pucey approaching scoring range ginny weasley hot on his trail but he shoots and nice save in the heat of the game hermione jumped up and yelled at the top of her lungs ron yeah ron immediately turned toward the stands and squinted his eyes in the sunlight in hermione direction she smiled brightly at him and he smiled back timidly and raised the quaffle with one hand to throw it back hermione heart began hammering wildly relieved hermione knew that she had finally been forgiven ron tore his eyes away from hermione and threw the quaffle to his sister ginny sped off down the pitch zigzagging between warrington and pucey he chanced another glance at hermione who was watching ginny intently as soon as he d heard hermione cheer echoing out of the stands he had received a rush of warmth throughout his entire body when he had spotted her smiling face he had felt a huge pang of guilt from his behavior the past week ginny had been right on one thing at least he had been a moping brat suddenly ron couldntwait for the game to end so that he could apologize properly but for now the game was still on ginny shot had been blocked and now zabini was racing toward him with the quaffle ron steadied himself on his broom his eyes were tracking the ensuing chaser every move but suddenly ron felt a jolting blow to the back of his right shoulder blade his upper body was thrown forward and he had to use both hands to grab a hold of his broom his right arm was now throbbing with pain as he looked up to see crabbe laughing with zabini who had managed to score madam hooch whistle cut through the air as terry boot yelled foul play bludger to the keeper gryffindor penalty shot as katie bell lined up for the penalty shot at the other end of the field ron looked down at the booing and jeering coming from the gryffindor stands at the front dead center stood hermione leaning over the railing and shaking one fist in the air vehemently she was shouting too but it couldntbe heard over the crowd neville was behind her attempting to pull her back down from the railing ron smiled despite the continuing pain in his shoulder ron focused his attention back on the field to the resuming game katie had made the penalty shot bletchley threw the quaffle to warrington but ginny had quickly stolen it while admiring his sister playing skills ron heard a whooshing sound coming from above him he looked up just in time to see a streak of red and gold zooming down toward him he swore loudly before dodging his best friend dive looking down he saw harry circling the base of the goalposts at a remarkable speed it made ron dizzy just looking at him but harry then sped off low to the ground toward the slytherin side of the field malfoy must have seen harry recent acrobatics because he was now speeding along behind harry firebolt pucey was now heading toward ron with ginny and bullet flanking him ginny was closing in on him which apparently made pucey act too soon because he threw the quaffle at the center goalpost where it fell short ron barely caught it with the tips of his fingers saving it from falling to the ground below he was preparing to throw the quaffle back to a chaser when a gasp erupted from the stadium scanning the field ron immediately saw malfoy lying flat on his back with the creevey brothers circling him from overhead they had apparently sent two bludgers to slow malfoy down ron smiled it had worked harry was speeding straight up into the air far above the stadium when he suddenly came to an abrupt halt raising his hands the crowd exploded into a tumultuous jumble of sound ron could barely hear madam hooch whistle calling the game to a close gryffindor wins one hundred eighty to ten terry boot bellowed into his megaphone ron immediately dropped the quaffle and rushed with the rest of his team to surround harry and the snitch hermione was hoarse from cheering everyone was beginning to filter out of the stands the gryffindors were all headed to their common room for some major celebrating hermione had decided to wait until the exiting crowd thinned a little before leaving her seat before ron had joined the quidditch team they had always left together with the excited crowd after a gryffindor win it was part of the fun however hermione felt a bit out of place without him beside her she glanced up at the gryffindor teammates laughing cheering and patting each other on the backs their huddle suddenly broke however as they all dove down to return to solid ground ron had stopped midway to the ground and had turned in hermione direction hermione heart caught in her throat what was he doing he was zooming straight for the stands but slowed down and pulled up to the railing meet me in the common room he asked slightly out of breath he had a timid smile on his face and looked as if he doubted that she would consent of course hermione said returning his timid smile he gazed at her for a moment before giving her a slight wink and diving down toward the changing rooms heat had immediately flooded her face following that wink that was only the second time he d winked at her but she liked the way it had made her heart skip a beat both times hermione hurriedly began her descent of the bleachers she wanted to beat the team members to the common room so that she could be there when ron arrived meet me in the common room he had said he knew she would be going straight to the common room where else would she go after a game but he had made sure she would be there why well at least it would give her a chance to apologize to him as she entered the castle she went over all the things she wanted to tell ron when she had the opportunity there were a few things that needed to be said how exactly should she apologize hermione bit her lower lip she didntwant to seem too whoa yes everything would be all right if she just went up the stairs right keep going keep going stop yes this was right now if she would just go down this hallway a ways great this was where she needed to be she didntknow why but it didntmatter everything was fine author note well i donthave much to say about this particular chapter other than i hope everyone enjoyed it please review i really curious as to what you thought about everything since this chapter was fairly long well chapter 11 coming up

is intended no profit is being made off this site it is for entertainment purposes only chapter 11 after showering in the changing rooms ron made his way up to gryffindor tower with harry and the other teammates that hadntmade it to their party yet the party where hermione had agreed to meet him she had looked at him as if he hadntbeen acting like a complete prat for the entire week he hadntdeserved that look and he especially hadntdeserved how her smile had added a warm blissful feeling on top of his elation from the game now that he knew he was about to apologize to hermione he was getting a bit nervous how could he explain why her words had hurt him so badly without her getting suspicious of his feelings toward her hermione was very sympathetic surely she would understand why her harsh words would upset her friend he just needed to make sure he didntmake the same mistake he had made earlier when talking to ginny however it would be much easier for him to avoid that mishap if he knew what it had been ron you all right harry asked as they approached the portrait hole you do realize that we just won yeah uh guess i just in shock that i didntbotch it up he lied harry looked at ron suspiciously as katie uttered the password and the fat lady portrait swung open as soon as they entered the common room cheers and applause hit the roof there must have been thirty people crammed inside pulling the players in and patting them all on their backs ron tried not to flinch as he was hit numerous times on his bruised shoulder people kept popping in front of ron face shaking his hands and saying things like great show or that how it done as nice as it was to have everyone praising him it was making it much harder for ron to see around the room properly he was generally taller than most of the people however so he peered over everyone head for a bushy haired brunette his eyes instead came to rest on his red haired sister ginny was still in her uniform surrounded by a hoard of fans over by the fireplace she must have come straight up to the party not wanting to miss anything she seemed to be enjoying the attention ron wandered toward her oh and here comes the king himself ginny said proudly gesturing toward ron he smiled as ginny aficionados broke into a chorus of the gryffindor version of weasley is our king do you know if hermione up in the girl dormitory ron asked ginny quietly as weasley is our king grew louder well i not sure i haventexactly gotten as far as the dormitories yet ginny said smiling broadly and nodding toward the singers ron was about to ask ginny to check the girl dormitory when a small voice came from behind him i saw her entering the third floor corridor with three boys after the game turning around ron saw luna staring absently at a spot to the right of ron head ron developed a sudden sickening cramp of worry in his abdomen what three boys ron asked apprehensively clutching at his stomach i didntnotice she said wistfully right after i spotted them your sister came up to me and invited me to your lovely party it is lovely ron didntwaste time reprimanding ginny for sneaking luna lovegood into the gryffindor common room instead he made his way over to seamus and dean who were complimenting and congratulating katie and jessica of course it was seamus dean and neville that luna had seen walking with hermione ron told himself a tiny twinge of jealousy was added to his cramp of worry but he ignored it guys ron said loud enough for seamus to hear him over the small crowd around katie and jessica did you dean or neville happen to walk with hermione to the third floor after the game no mate why d ya ask seamus asked casually smiling stupidly at katie oh nevermind ron replied absently before walking hastily to the portrait hole he walked past harry who was surrounded by his own fan club and decided not to bother him ron was just going to find hermione had stopped off at the library or a lavatory anyway despite the reassurances ron was giving himself once he was outside the portrait hole he broke into a run he ran as fast as he could down the corridor to the grand staircase grabbing hold of the banister he sprinted down the steps skipping the last few before each landing until finally he had reached the third floor the whole time his mind was racing had luna actually seen hermione with three boys luna was so absent minded her information could have been completely wrong please be wrong ron thought i wontfind anything down this corridor and i ll find that hermione just stopped by the library and lost track of time the third floor corridor was as dark and creepy as ever but ron began making his way slowly down the hall everything was eerily still and silent but then was that a voice ron immediately ran toward the sound it had come from the farthest door on the right he reached the door and yanked hard on the handle but it was locked alohamora ron yelled urgently after taking his wand from the inside of his jacket there was a soft click but before ron thrust the door open he heard a cold drawling voice say they re dead your dear harry potter and ron weasley are a problem to the dark lord no more now only you remain ron felt as though an ice cold bucket of water had just been poured down his back it cantbe thought ron he in azkaban ron threw the door open but nothing could have prepared him for what he saw next the small stone windowless room was lit only by a few wall sconces in the farthest corner cowering sat hermione her face fixed into a blank and glazed expression and in front of her stood three death eaters one of which by the sound of his voice was surely lucius malfoy the death eaters turned their hooded faces toward ron who already had his wand pointing at them stupefy a red light shot out of the end of ron wand and impacted with the closest of the three death eaters causing him to fall to the ground ron quickly turned to the next one impedimenta the second death eater fell leaving one still staring at ron not moving ron didnthave time to ponder the death eater behavior he just had to get him away from hermione he ran forward and flung himself onto the remaining death eater causing them both to fall to the floor together but as ron raised his wand to utter a curse the death eater began transforming into a humongous spider ron horrified quickly rolled himself off of the spider and noticed that the other two death eaters had completely disappeared the pieces immediately fell together into ron mind they werentdeath eaters at all riddikulous ron shouted pointing his wand at the approaching spider the boggart flew straight up into the air and landed back on the floor with a thud before disappearing into a wisp of smoke breathing heavily and dripping with sweat ron ran to hermione knelt beside her and took one of her cold and clammy hands in his she just continued to stare straight ahead with a horribly blank expression ron felt a huge lump form in his throat hermione he said urgently trying to keep his voice steady she wasnteven blinking hermione please look at me please say something ron placed his hands on her pale cheeks and turned her face gently to him he saw her pupils expand slightly before her eyes turned to look into his rubbing her cheeks with the pads of his thumbs ron whispered can you hear me hermione it me please say something he pleaded tears forming in his eyes his hands dropped to grip her shoulders all of a sudden hermione took in a shuddering breath tears suddenly streaming down her face as she managed to speak between sobs r ron th they said you were dead they s said harry was hermione flung her arms around ron neck the weight of her causing him to sit down hard on the floor he wrapped his arms tightly around her cradling her as she repeated they said you were dead they said you were dead over and over he felt as though his heart might explode from an overload of emotions it was contorted with rage at what he d found yet constricted with fear at the thought of what he could ve found and still he felt great relief at what he didntfind a few silent tears fell from his eyes as he thought about his foul treatment of this beautiful woman over the past week never again ron rested his head on hermione and said in what he hoped was a calm voice it was a boggart hermione only a boggart who who did this to you but hermione just continued to repeat they said you were dead again and again then suddenly her entire body began trembling and she dug her fingernails into his back one of her hands was directly on top of his right shoulder blade but the throbbing pain from his bruise wasntregistering with him come on he said standing up with her still cradled in his arms ron carried hermione hurriedly down the corridor and staircase to the first floor with her head buried in the curve of his neck she was still heaving with sobs when he reached the infirmary he kicked hard at the door he heard the hurried pats of madam pomfrey before the door swung open and the school healer let out a gasp ron laid hermione trembling form onto the nearest bed and explained everything that he had found while madam pomfrey gave hermione a strong sleeping drought for dreamless sleep this young girl has been severely traumatized madam pomfrey exclaimed with disbelief after hermione had drifted off to sleep how long was she locked up with that monster i dunno an hour maybe ron said miserably it lucky that you found her when you did mr weasley but miss granger needs her rest you can come visit her tomorrow off with you now madam pomfrey said briskly suddenly ron anger began boiling deep in his stomach he knew it was malfoy it had to be no one else in the school was capable of something so vile and cruel ron remembered a couple of years back he had poked fun at hermione when he discovered her boggart to be a displeased mcgonagall showing hermione a failing grade however hermione boggart must have changed since last term events in the department of mysteries had malfoy suspected that somehow wait ron called after madam pomfrey i know who did it you saw them madam pomfrey asked wide eyed ron faltered a bit before responding well no but well a girl saw her with some boys and well she didntsee their faces but well i just know ron finished lamely but with anger in his voice for her disbelieving stare madam pomfrey looked at ron sadly for a moment listen the headmaster has been in meetings all day and he will be until late tonight but i will alert he or else professor mcgonagall first thing in the morning they will want to hear the victim side of the story and for now she must rest ron wasntsatisfied with her answer and he really didntwant to leave hermione but he knew he wouldntwin in an argument against madam pomfrey besides he couldntdo any more for hermione now that sleeping drought would have her out at least until tomorrow morning ron looked from hermione to madam pomfrey will will she be she going to be alright mr weasley she just needs rest she said softly before walking to the door say your goodbyes and then go get yourself some rest madam pomfrey then exited the infirmary closing the door with a soft click ron approached hermione sleeping form as he looked down at her face a flash of the horrible vacant look she had had in her eyes just moments before sprung into his mind he couldntstop himself ron bent low over hermione and moved a strand of her hair away from her forehead with his fingertips he then laid a soft kiss on her temple hermione would never know anyway he thought sadly as he took one more look at her delicate face before exiting the hospital wing author note initially this chapter was part of a much longer chapter but i still need to tweak the rest of it i just had to post this though b c i didntwant to leave everyone hanging on the mysterious ending of chapter i

been used without permission no copyright violation is intended no profit is being made off this site it is for entertainment purposes only chapter 12 wha whadyadoin ron muttered drowsily someone was shaking him it was rather annoying why didntthey stop pig just arrived with this letter from professor mcgonagall you re the only one i know that could sleep through his constant squawking harry voice said ron opened his eyes and sat up quickly suddenly awake harry was peering over him with a letter in one hand ron quickly took the letter from harry and looked around the room seamus dean and neville were all puffy eyed and looking a bit annoyed harry however looked anxious harry expression was infectious because ron soon began worrying about what the letter might entail what if hermione had only gotten worse overnight ron heart began racing as he tore open his letter mr ronald weasley due to yesterday unfortunate events miss granger will be held in the infirmary until tonight evening meal madam pomfrey has requested your assistance she asks that you arrive before the lunch hour please arrive alone miss granger will not be allowed any other visitors today thank you professor m mcgonagall ron let out a relieved sigh hermione was going to be released tonight she must be recovering well ron glanced at his bedside clock and saw that it was seven in the morning well he thought it before the lunch hour he hurried out of bed explaining the letter to harry as he dressed yet making sure their roommates wouldntoverhear him harry seemed to be disappointed that he wouldntbe allowed to visit later on but ron didnthave time to dwell on this he grabbed some bertie bott every flavor beans from his trunk along with his geography of the magical world textbook if hermione were to be bedridden for the day she would definitely appreciate an interesting book as ron hurried out of gryffindor tower his mind began replaying yesterday events he felt as though everything that had happened after the quidditch match were a horrible nightmare after he d returned from delivering hermione to the hospital wing he had taken harry and ginny away from the still vibrant victory party to fill them in upstairs in the boy dormitory ron had explained everything and it hadntbeen easy harry was just as furious about the situation as ron he actually cursed which was very rare for harry ginny had started crying and cursing at the same time which ron thought was probably rare for anybody the three of them had shared their suspicions on the perpetrators and had come to the same conclusion they were in agreement that malfoy crabbe and goyle were the only people at hogwarts that would do something so horrible at one point ginny asked the question that ron had been trying his hardest to avoid could this in any way be related to harry dream harry had ensured her that it had nothing to do with his dream he had said that it was probably malfoy way of getting back at ron for breaking his jaw when ginny had seemed keen on asking harry even more questions about his dream ron told her and harry that he needed to go to bed it had been early but ron couldntstand to think of what ginny was suggesting besides ron had wanted to get to sleep he had been ready for the morning to arrive so that he could go see hermione and finally the morning was here and ron had just arrived at the hospital wing he hadntthe slightest idea why madam pomfrey would need his assistance or why she wouldntallow any other visitors but he was still very eager to see how hermione was fairing this morning when he entered he found a pajama clad hermione sitting up in bed with the covers around her forcing down a thick purple tinted juice ron hermione exclaimed eagerly putting down her medicine bottle ron whole body seemed to relax slightly at the sight of a smiling healthy looking hermione she continued what are you doing here at this hour but madam pomfrey entered before ron could respond good miss granger i see you ve finished the last of your anxiety antidote and mr weasley you re early good minerva must have sent an early owl madam pomfrey then conjured a plush white lounge chair with her wand right beside hermione bed have a seat and i ll bring you both some breakfast she said before quickly leaving the room ron took a seat on the lounge chair beside hermione and set the candy and book he had brought with him on her nightstand he then showed hermione the letter he had received that morning your assistance hermione said after finishing the letter what does she mean i ve no idea ron said truthfully just then madam pomfrey arrived with two trays of bacon eggs and toast listen you two eat up and then i want you both to discuss yesterday events i find talking about the source of the trauma to be the first major step in recovery i know it wontbe a pleasant conversation but it must be done she then gave each of them a tray before she exited the room and closed the doors behind her ron had wanted to remind her about informing dumbledore or mcgonagall about malfoy but he reckoned he could wait until after breakfast ron and hermione ate their breakfast without much talk he was sure she was thinking about their upcoming conversation as was assistance was to make hermione relive yesterday incident he dreaded it not because he didntwant to hear hermione side of the story he did he wanted to know exactly what had happened but not at the cost of hermione reliving it so soon however ron was sure that madam pomfrey knew best so after their breakfast trays had magically disappeared ron decided to make the first move it was malfoy wasntit he said darkly not looking at hermione i i dontknow hermione said her voice shaking slightly i remember climbing the stairs but then i felt calm and light headed as if dreaming it was as if i blacked out and then the calm feeling left me and i found myself in that room with those those hermione voice trailed off into an inaudible murmur a memory charm malfoy hit you with a memory charm ron stated heatedly that scum that complete ron not a memory charm i dontthink hermione bit her lip i researched the three unforgivable curses after the fake moody lesson on them our fourth year i think i was under the imperious curse what that that that brilliant ron exclaimed hermione looked completely perplexed i mean no that not what i meant it just that that curse could land malfoy in azkaban for life we ve got to tell dumbledore hermione shook her head solemnly what hermione ron asked distraught you know it was him luna told me that she saw you after the game with three boys well i know it was luna that told me and she didntsee their faces but i just know it was malfoy crabbe and goyle who did it ron hermione began gravely you are probably right but there not one teacher in this school that can punish three students on another student suspicion ron stood up from his chair fuming hermione luna saw three unidentified boys and i saw no one hermione shouted back unexpectedly what was she on about dumbledore would believe them he had to hermione i going to tell madam pomfrey to get dumbledore ron started walking hurriedly toward the door i ve already spoken with him hermione said evenly ron stopped in his tracks and turned to look at her you what so so what the problem the bloke believed you didnthe ron exclaimed incredulously hermione let out an impatient sigh ron i told you there not one teacher here that can punish malfoy on our suspicions suspicions ron spat he couldntbelieve what he was hearing why wasntshe as furious as he malfoy had managed to land hermione in the hospital wing for a full day due to a horrible trauma and he wouldnteven get a detention suspicions hermione i not suspicious of malfoy i know it was him and so do you even as the words came out of his mouth ron knew hermione was right if dumbledore was refusing to punish malfoy there could be no justice served on this matter i ll kill him ron said through clenched teeth i swear the next time i see that slimy bastard i ll make sure he wontbe able to say my name without wetting himself hermione suddenly slammed her hand down on her bedside table causing the bertie bott beans to rattle in their container ron you cant then you will be the one facing expulsion hermione said frustrated promise me that you wontgo near him ronald i cantpromise you that hermione ron said flatly as he walked back toward her bed he was looking down at her distressed expression and he couldntimagine how she thought he was going to restrain himself from taking malfoy head off hermione let out a loud sigh threw the covers off her legs and shot up off the bed to stand before him hermione sit back down ron commanded although it came out more of a request not until you promise her jaw was set and her hands were crossed firmly across her chest ron briefly noticed that she even looked beautiful in baggy flannel pajamas before remembering his anger i cant just let him get away with this hermione ron what good will it do me if you go off tp do something rash that will only result in your expulsion and malfoy hating us more ron thought it sounded as if hermione were holding back tears he couldntbear to see her cry right now shaking his head he knew that he was beat fine i promise he spat sagging back down to his chair just get back in bed will ya to ron surprise hermione did as he said and climbed back into the hospital bed however the look on her face told ron that she wasntcompletely convinced by his promise and in actuality neither was he what malfoy had done to hermione was just too horrible ron tried to picture himself locked in a room with a giant spider which he believed to be real he shuddered at the mere thought of it at the mere thought of a spider she had been in a room with three presumed death eaters ron hermione began picking at a seemingly fascinating spot on her fingernail i haventthanked you yet for finding me and bringing me here i think i was in shock yesterday but i want you to know that i do remember you well how comforting you were i just wanted you to know that i well thanks was she blushing was hermione jane granger blushing ron heart suddenly seemed to sprout wings it was fluttering and beating madly and he hoped hermione couldnthear it he had thought for sure that she would have little if any recollection of his behavior last night with a sudden lurch in his stomach he wondered if she also knew that he had kissed her before leaving with another lurch he realized her blushing seemed to give him an incredible urge to kiss her again but this time on her tempting lips he closed his eyes to clear his mind of this inappropriate thought toward his friend hermione ron asked hesitantly sure that hermione could see how red his face and ears were right now yeah about this last week i oh ron please let me go first hermione asked desperately turning to face him directly her legs were hanging off the edge of the bed and they looked so small he scooted his chair a bit closer so his legs were a slight two inches from hers he only did this so that he could give her his undivided attention yeah right ron nodded at her to start i am really really sorry for the way i acted at hogsmeade i overreacted to well everything and then i hermione took a deep breath and it looked like she was fighting tears again but she continued to keep eye contact whoever you fall in love with will be incredibly fortunate ron heart apparently decided to start beating in his ears had she really meant that how could she he was such a jerk ron looked away from hermione for a moment to rub his face slowly with one hand she was on the verge of tears apologizing to him ron couldntstand it hermione you arentthe one that should be apologizing and you donthave to say things like that about whoever i you know i mean i think the reason i got so angry at hogsmeade was because well i agreed with you ron looked up to see hermione looking down at him with deep concern ron no please dontfeel that way about yourself it simply not true well regardless of what i believe he continued sadly i was a complete jerk for ignoring you and if it makes you feel any better i was really miserable all week hermione let out a delightful laugh that startled ron before saying no that doesntmake me feel better well maybe a little ron couldnthelp but smile at her hermione smile suddenly turned to a serious frown though and she scooted closer to the edge of the bed her legs bumped into ron knees but he didntmove for hopes that it would happen again i need to know something ron she was looking at him so intently oh no he d done it again crap crap crap lie lie lie ron i need to know that you wont ever refuse to talk to me about something about anything ron let out a slow shaky breath of relief you dontneed to worry about that after yesterday when i thought that i might lose i mean when i couldntfind you just believe me when i say that i wontmake that mistake again he said sincerely hermione simply nodded ron looked away from her he needed to break the awkward silence hermione do you think we should talk about the boggart hermione began shifting uncomfortably in her bed ron looked up at her anxiously she opened her mouth twice as if to speak but then closed it again finally she said ron i i dontthink that i can can talk about what happened yesterday ron simply looked at hermione imploring teary eyed face before nodding his head and standing up from his chair his heart was aching for her yet there was still an underlying fury within him toward malfoy no matter what madam pomfrey had said there was no way he would make her talk about what had happened if she didntwant to not after she d looked at him like that hermione was looking up at ron he had the oddest expression on his face it was stony and unreadable why had he stood up he was just standing there staring at her was he going to try and force her to talk about what had happened yesterday in that cold stone room or was he going to leave now that he knew he didnthave to talk about it she wasntkeen on either option for an hour yesterday she had truly believed that ron and harry were dead that the death eaters had stormed hogwarts and that they were going to kill her next she had felt as if she were drowning everything had been in slow motion sounds had become muffled the air had become impossible to breath and she had done nothing she hadnteven had the courage to stupefy them or even move for that matter and then everything else was a blur until she realized that two strong hands were upon her face and two brilliantly blue eyes were staring into hers as soon as she had seen ron face it was as if she had been pulled up from the depths of the deepest ocean but now that it was over she would rather ron leave than make her talk about it you should probably get some rest ron said quietly breaking into hermione trance she nodded and let out a sigh of relief however he was still looking at her with that stony expression she looked away awkwardly and swung her legs onto the bed ron raised her covers so that she could put her feet in properly she looked up at him before easing her feet under the blanket he never ceased to amaze her with the amount of gentility he could show toward her every so often he leaned over the bed slightly and began pulling the covers up to her waist one hand had brushed up the side of her leg hermione jerked at the unexpected contact chills forming down her leg and ron quickly moved his hands away he then turned his back to her and began fiddling with the book he had brought hermione didnthave time to dwell on the awkwardness of the situation because she noticed something as she looked up at ron back ron she said suspiciously causing him to turn and look at her apologetically hermione i didntmean to he began hastily but hermione interrupted him before he could make the situation more awkward no i just saw something through your shirt on your shoulder is it swollen she asked worriedly had the boggart injured him ron reached up and felt the back of his right shoulder and then in a relieved sort of voice said oh oh that it nothing i just bruised from that bludger hermione had forgotten all about the quidditch game it looks kind of serious come sit down hermione commanded scooting over and patting the edge of her bed with her palm he walked over slowly almost hesitantly and sat down beside her hermione turned toward him and reached up to pull back on his collar she was only able to pull it down slightly but ron flinched good grief hermione exclaimed looking at the top of the large blue and black swell on his shoulder it spanned across his entire shoulder blade and was swollen almost an inch high hermione it really okay it ll go away he said chuckling a bit besides the important thing is madam hooch caught the foul it not funny ron hermione said seriously this is a severe contusion a con what in ron asked skeptically turning his head to the side to look at her it just another name for a bruise hermione said dismissively but what i trying to tell you is that i ve read ahead to chapter six in our healing book this could be bad excess fluid could accumulate and cause a hematoma if this isntalready one ron it could disrupt your blood flow and then madam pomfrey would have to do some advanced healing to cure you so if contusion is just another name for bruise why dontyou just call it a bruise i mean think about it bruise is one syllable contusion is ron hermione said impatiently i know how to fix this bruise if you ll let me take a proper look at it hermione suddenly felt embarrased as she realized what she was asking but she didntcare he had to have the injury treated just if you could just raise your shirt up in back i can heal this then you wonthave to worry about madam pomfey confining you to a bed for a full day ron shifted uncomfortably hermione i really think it fine what what are you doing hermione had decided to take matters into her own hands she had grabbed the bottom of his t shirt in back and was pulling it carefully up to his neck when she had rolled his shirt up to rest above his shoulders she let out a gasp it looked even worse than she d thought well the bruise at least hermione granted herself one quick glance up and down ron exposed back he was covered with light brown freckles but they were almost imperceptible because of the vast amount of them blending into one another his muscles expanded with every breath and down the center of his back was the dip of his spine he was beautiful hermione forced herself to focus on ron injured shoulder she took her fingers and lightly felt about the swell it was very warm chills began appearing across his entire back you have goosebumps hermione said wondering at their cause were they caused by pain ron cleared his throat yeah your hands are cold he said quietly hermione noticed the backs of his ears turning pink i really think they should take the beaters off of the quidditch field hermione exclaimed i mean this kind of injury is ridiculous and they just arent necessary for the game hermione ron exclaimed incredulously turning around slightly hermione pushed his uninjured shoulder forward take the beaters off of the hermione not neccesary they sure as bloody hell are necessary and i ll tell you why no you will not not if you dontstop swearing i mean really ronald hermione said absently as she finished scrutinizing the injury okay now i not saying that this wontstill hurt for a while after i finished but at least it wontbe swollen anymore could you hand me my wand please ron leaned forward to retrieve her wand from the sidetable hermione tried not to stare as his lean waist became more visible with the stretch ron turned his torso to look at her as he sat back and handed her the wand now you re sure you know what you re doing he asked jokingly she ignored him and took the wand from his hand he just smiled and turned back around causing her heart to flip flop she tried to ignore it however seeing as how she neededgreat concentration for this spell hermione placed her wand tip at one side of the contusion and uttered the appropriate incantation the swelling immediately began to decrease the color became a bit lighter as well when she had finished hermione placed her wand down on the bed and pulled ron shirt down slowly her fingers grazed part of his lower back done hermione said feeling a bit nervous for more than one reason it doesnthurt worse or anything does it i mean i ve never done any healing on a human only the baccaberry hares ron turned his torso to face her it feels much better actually thanks he said sincerely and then with a smile madam pomfrey better watch out huh suddenly ron eyes drifted to the left of hermione head hey who sent you chocolate frogs he exclaimed hermione glanced over her shoulder at the window seal where there were about ten chocolate frog boxes professor dumbledore brought them would you like one ron shrugged sure he said casually hermione smiled as shereached behind her for a box and tossed it at him he caught it in both hands ron opened the flap and his eyes suddenly went wide ptolemy wow do you know how long i ve been looking for ron chocolate frog suddenly decided to jump out of its package the frog jumped right past hermione and onto the window seal with the nine remaining chocolate frog boxes before hermione knew what was happening ron lunged for it with his left hand while using his right hand to brace himself by placing it on the bed about an inch from hermione hip hermione heart caught in her throat as ron torso lay extended a few inches above her own got him ron exclaimed but then his face suddenly became a bright red as he realized what he d done with one hand on the window seal and the other beside her hip ron looked down slowly into hermione face her heart began hammering wildly she suddenly felt faint his face was so close to hers she could feel his warm breath on her lips she took a deep swallow as their gazes locked this couldntbe reality he was staring at her with a somewhat frustrated but extremely handsome look on his face why wasnthe moving with a sudden mixture of elation and anxiety her heartrate quickened considerably was he going to kiss her i canttake this anymore she thought frantically closing her eyes just kiss me hermione heart was beating so hard now that her chest had begun to ache just then madam pomfrey office door opened with a noisy creak hermione eyes flew open at the same time that ron pushed himself away from the window seal he then quickly sank down into his chair with his elbows on his thighs he rested his face in his right hand his left was still grasping the chocolate frog hermione tried to catch her breath what in the worldhad just happened hello have we gotten started on the little chat we talked about madam pomfrey asked from the infirmary doorway her voice sounded incredibly loud in comparison to the tense silence she had unknowingly interrupted y yes madam pomfrey we re working on it hermione said breathlessly ron still had his head in his hand hermione could see that his ears were extremely red and his neck appeared sweaty good good madam pomfrey smiled briefly but then squinted her eyes at hermione are you all right miss granger you appear to have a fever she rushed over to hermione and put a hand to her forehead my goodness you re burning up child and you re breathing so heavily poor dear being cornered by that monster hermione saw ron head popup at the word monster but he quickly put it back in his hand his knee bobbing up and down frantically wait one moment i ll get you a cooling potion madam pomfrey said before quickly walking out returning the room to its tense silence hermione definitely did need a cooling potion actually she needed to pinch herself had ron weasley actually almost kissed her she had to be dreaming she wished he would say something hermione ron voice was strained when he spoke at last and it sent shivers up hermione neck his head wasntresting on his hand now but he was staring at his chocolate frog which he suddenly tossed onto the side table before looking back down at his hands i really tired and i still shaken from yesterday i really need to just get some fresh air or something i sorry ron stood up quickly and darted for the door without looking at her ron wait she called he stopped with his hand on the doorknob but instead of turning around he simply yanked the door open and hurried out leaving hermione feeling very confused and alone as the door slammed shut with an echoing boom author note um okay some of you are probably comtemplating throwing your monitors across the room but i strongly advise you not to lol i have a

ron are you sure nothing wrong harry asked for the third time since harry had entered the boy dormitory ron was in his four poster lying flat on his back staring at the arched ceiling harry had returned two hours ago from lunch in the great hall to find his best friend in the same exact position that he was now and the same exact position that he was in the two hours before harry had arrived harry had immediately bombarded ron with questions of hermione condition and what was going to happen to malfoy both of which made ron stomach hurt he told him the truth sort of he d told harry the complete truth about malfoy not even getting a damn detention but he only told harry that hermione was recovering quickly he hadnttold harry what she was now recovering from ron closed his eyes and rubbed his face with his hands he could not believe his stupidity he had almost kissed hermione her innocent and flawless face had been so close he had spotted an adorable freckle to the right of her left eye that couldntbe seen from a reasonable distance but he shouldnt have spotted that adorable freckle because he should have been at a reasonable distance it had been a bittersweet nightmare he d wanted to kiss her so badly that he had lost all sense of reason why why out of the six years that he d known hermione did it happen today maybe he had inhaled some fumes from hermione anxiety antidote maybe that bludger to his shoulder had jostled something loose in his brain or maybe it was because he had been slapped in the face with the reality that hermione was not truly safe even at hogwarts his mind had begun going through morbid hypothetical scenarios since last night what if malfoy wasntabove murder his father surely wasn t or his father master what if ron had found hermione dead what if he hadntfound her at all these thoughts were so horrible and extreme but they wouldntstop plaguing him he had wanted to kiss hermione granger and he had wanted to because he had now had a taste of what would happen to him if he were to lose her once he d tasted that and had time to comprehend it he d wanted to taste her he had wanted complete proof that she was really alive and okay he could see her hear her smell her and touch her he just wanted one more piece of evidence that he hadntbeen dreaming but instead he d succeeded in creating a nightmare ron ron opened his eyes to see ginny peering over him with concern he pushed himself up on his elbows and saw that harry was sitting on his bed reading a book on quidditch no not reading hiding what are you doing in here ron asked with a groan before lying back down and closing his eyes he really didntfeel like being advised or berated harry came and got me from the common room just now he says you re acting strangely ron opened his eyes enough to glare at harry but he was still shielded by his book when did lying down a spell become strange behavior ginny sighed loudly hmm maybe when the spell turns into four hours in the middle of the day with the sun shining outside when ron didntrespond beyond a derisive grunt ginny turned to harry harry would you mind giving us a minute yes harry would mind ron sat straight up now harry presence was the only thing keeping ginny mouth from spouting off questions uncontrollably ron looked over at harry who looked like he was waging an internal battle of which weasley to obey with a sigh ron took pity on his best friend ah get outta here harry harry nodded gratefully and tried to smile before grabbing his firebolt and almost running out of the room ginny sat down on the end of ron bed she looked miserable i so sorry ron i ve really screwed things up for you haventi she said looking down at her hands ron was taken aback uh what are you ron began confusedly you ve gone and told her haventyou you took my awful advice and told her she said sadly but then she stood up and started pacing oh but ron i just thought that she felt the same way i would ve sworn on merlin grave that she ginny i haventtold hermione anything ron said miserably he buried his face in his hands ginny stopped pacing you mean you haventtold hermione that you love her ginny asked puzzled no he said his face still in his hands then what happened harry said you ran off this morning to see hermione and you came back like a zombie ginny i almost he looked up at his sister she was hanging on his every word here it goes ron thought as he swallowed the knot of anxiety in his throat i almost kissed her ron didntknow that ginny eyes could grow to that size she covered her open mouth with both hands and made some sort of a quaking gasping noise before lowering her hands back down w w what you you how what she hurried over to the bed and sat down i you she what did she do she finally asked her hands going back to her mouth nothing ron said sadly i finally came to my senses and then i just left ginny suddenly stood up and stamped her foot it briefly reminded him of hermione ron you left you re telling me you were about to kiss her and then you just left actually i highly considered jumping out of the window then i apologized and then i left i cantbelieve this ron you have to tell her how you feel oh now we re back to that are we i minute ago you said that was awful advice and ginny i agreed with you a minute ago well a minute ago i thought that she had rejected you but now i know that it the other way around what do you mean by that ron if you almost kiss somebody and you stop yourself that means that they didntstop you that means ron that she wanted you to kiss her and now that you ve just walked out like that you ve just got to tell her ron stood up beside his sister look ginny she didntwant to kiss me i think i came closer to scaring her than wooing her i told you that i not telling her and i not he said softly almost desperately please he thought just drop it but ron why why cantyou just she started but ron couldnttake anymore ginny he shouted causing her to stumble a few steps away from him he roughly raked his hand through his hair you keep asking me why well answer this why cant you just tell harry she immediately stepped forward shh ron my goodness she exclaimed desperately glancing nervously at the doorway you see you ask me why but you know why all right you know exactly why ginny now i ve not once said anything to you about harry before now do you think you could offer me that same courtesy ron said in a harsh whisper ginny looked on the verge of tears now he thought she would probably either scream at him or run out of the room but instead she stepped forward slowly and hugged him tight around the neck i so sorry she whispered ron felt a sudden urge to cry but he swallowed the growing lump in his throat he patted his sister awkwardly on the back but she abruptly broke the hug and hurried out of the dormitory wiping at her eyes staring after her he thought sadly i am in way over my head hermione was sitting up in her hospital bed staring blindly at the pages of geography of the magical world volume six it was open to a page about the great snowmen of russia however hermione hadntread more than the chapter heading with a distressed sigh she slammed the book shut and threw it onto the now empty lounge chair beside her bed the book was making her angry books had always helped her solve problems or at least cope with them but hermione knew that nothing had ever been written that could unboggle her mind at this very moment fine she told herself if you cantfind it in a book use analytical skills to come to a conclusion four hours ago ron weasley had been leaning over her staring into her eyes and breathing heavily he had been in a perfect position to kiss her yet he rushed out of the room after claiming to be tired and shaken hermione could only come up with three possible solutions ron had either been telling the truth and he had been beside himself with temporary insanity from last night terror or when he d leaned over her to grab his chocolate frog he had seen a fleck of dust in her eye and had been about to blow it out not realizing until the unexpected entrance of madam pomfrey that he was basically on top of her or he had truly wanted to kiss her but had for some reason backed out at the last minute the logical answer for hermione was that ron had suffered temporary insanity why would adorable fun care free ron weasley want to kiss plain boring uptight hermione granger it just didnt make sense in six years ron had never shown any desire to kiss her at that first hogsmeade visit hadnthe plainly admitted that he didntlike her like that but hermione couldntforget the way his piercing blue gaze had reached deep within her and spoken to her in some silent language i want you i need you i love you hermione shook her head fiercely and collapsed backward into her pillows the only way she would know what he d been thinking earlier was if she asked him and she couldntdo that if he did reject her if he said no hermione i dontwant need or love you she could never look at him again without being embarrassed and then what would become of their friendship what would happen to their trio no hermione thought i wontlet my feelings get in the way of my friendship with ron losing him as a friend was too big a risk for the chance to gain him as more he would have to make the first move in this even her gryffindor bravery wasntenough to equip her against the possibility of a life without ron in it she needed him she loved him ron was taking deep steadying breaths okay one foot in front of the other his legs felt like they were full of led and his stomach full of restless insects harry was looking at him as if he feared that his best friend had finally lost his mind of course he was they were walking down the grand staircase to the great hall for the evening meal and ron was more nervous than he d been his first time on a broom ron was sure harry had never seen him nervous around food but he was going to see hermione in just a few more minutes should he look at her in the face should he sit beside her or across from her should he pull his robes over his head and sit at the ravenclaw table hoping no one will recognize him he knew what he wanted to do run run out the entrance doors onto the grounds down to the lake and then jump in and drown himself but he couldntdo that just hours ago he d promised hermione that he would never avoid talking to her again hermione harry exclaimed ron looked up with a horrifying dizziness threatening to overtake him deep breaths she was walking toward them with something clutched to her chest all right yeah harry i feeling much better thanks her voice sounded flat and her smile didntreach her eyes ron looked down to stare at his feet with his hands thrust into his jeans pockets a thin layer of sweat now covered his entire body ron hermione said in a small voice ron head snapped up so suddenly he got a rush to his head um thanks for letting me borrow these she held out his textbook and his bertie bott every flavor beans she wasntlooking at him though he awkwardly took his hands from his pockets and took the items from hermione his sweaty fingertips brushed across her slender fingers he felt as if an electric charge had just traveled from his fingers up his arm and all the way to his heart where it resided for a few seconds speeding up his heart rate even more get a grip they were just fingers he d had ten of them his entire life harry was looking worriedly from ron to hermione as the three of them started for the huge double doors to the hall however a sneering voice came from behind them ron instinctively grabbed hermione by the elbow and pulled her in between himself and harry before turning around ron had felt her flinch at his touch but he didnthave time to worry about that right now ah granger missed you today at lunch malfoy was wearing his most evil smile flanked by his two thugs i guess you were just too bogged down with homework crabbe and goyle laughed heartily any suspicion in ron mind that last night perpetrator might not have been malfoy was wiped away a blinding fury was threatening to take him over the chatter from the great hall suddenly sounded miles away he took a step toward malfoy and in front of hermione as did harry hermione had grabbed hold of ron arm he quickly turned to look at her surprised at her forceful touch her beautiful brown eyes were pleading with him to keep his promise of not touching malfoy he should really be more careful about promising things to this beauty who had the power to calm the white hot fury inside of him with a single look she had somehow given him the strength he needed to refrain from throwing malfoy clear across the room how could two brown eyes have such an effect on him ron took a deep breath and turned to look at malfoy you ll pay malfoy i swear it ron said in a low growl before turning and entering the great hall with harry and hermione at his heels ron felt as though his whole body had gone numb from anger he was actually surprised that he managed to make his way to the table without collapsing hermione sat across from him and mouthed thank you before quickly turning to talk to ginny who had just entered and sat down beside hermione ron ate in silence thinking of the many awful things he could do to make malfoy suffer if he were ever given the chance he tried hard not to stare at hermione but he wished so badly that he knew what she was thinking he didntdare dream that she had wanted him to kiss her like ginny had said that was just too impossible but he argued she hadntflinched and she had closed her eyes as if waiting yeah he argued back she had been scared into stillness and had closed her eyes waiting for him to get the bloody hell away from her what must she think of him now did she buy that bull he fed her about being tired and whatnot he hoped so what would their trio be like if hermione knew ron feelings but didnt feel the same way would she feel constant pity for him and how would harry react at the end of the meal the owls arrived with the new post ron had gotten a parcel from his mum a short letter reminding him to invite harry and hermione to the burrow for christmas along with a small plate of treacle fudge his heart jumped a little might he get his hopes up that this christmas would be spent with hermione harry and hermione yes that what he had meant to think would she even want to spend a month at the burrow she might be ready for christmas break in order to distance herself from him harry had gotten a short letter of greeting from ron mother as well but hermione had gotten a letter that she had quickly tucked into her robes ron was immediately suspicious especially since hermione seemed to be blushing who is your letter from hermione ron asked in a hopefully nonchalant way just say it your mother father aunt uncle third cousin twice removed anything better than him oh it s um nothing just junk mail she said quickly before taking a large swig of water what junk mail ron asked skeptically harry leaned over and explained muggle junk mail to ron ron was confused why would muggle companies send people things that they knew the muggles would just throw away ah ron said unconvinced still looking at hermione well i ve never seen junk mail before can i see it hermione oh it really boring ron hermione said while standing up i feeling a bit tired anyway i think i ll head on up to the common room ron was now almost certain he knew whom the letter was from but he still wanted to see for himself hermione harry began do you really think you should be walking around by yourself at this hour he and ron both glanced over at the slytherin table malfoy and his gang were still bent over their plates stuffing their faces yeah that right you shouldntbe ron began fervently before being interrupted i ll walk with her ginny said suddenly standing up ron thought she and hermione exchanged meaningful looks ron glared at ginny the little traitor ginny looked away almost guiltily see you guys later hermione said quickly before she and ginny rushed out of the great hall harry looked at ron and shrugged unconcernedly but ron stood up from the table i a bit tired myself harry you re too tired for dinner harry said with raised eyebrows hmm hey is something up with you and hermione oh no not harry too lie lie lie no even better act dumb up what do you mean ron said in a voice that was too high to be his own he cleared his throat nervously i dunno i thought maybe you d had another row harry shrugged ron let out a small sigh of relief oh um yeah i think she mad because well i almost hit malfoy across the hall a minute ago he lied oh well i would have loved to have seen it again but she probably well she probably right harry said plainly yes great whatever ron insides were screaming he had to see that letter later harry ron said distractedly before hurrying out of the great hall and up the staircase he didntknow how but he was going to find out who had sent that letter all the while he was rushing up the stairs he was asking himself what he was doing she free to talk to whomever she wants i ve got no right to delve into her private life yes i do she my friend and it one of my jobs to protect her from her own poor judgment talking to an internationally famous quidditch player three years her senior completely irresponsible hah irresponsible this is hermione granger she doesnteven know how to be irresponsible why was he arguing with himself i ve gone mental ron whispered to himself rubbing his eyes with the heels of his hands yes dear i think you re right said a pretty dark haired witch from a painting on the corridor wall ron scowled at her he reached the portrait hole shouted the password and rushed inside ginny was sitting in the corner reading a novel she looked up at ron when he entered closed her book with a snap and pursed her lips what that look for ron asked defensively just leave her alone ron she deserves some privacy ginny said with her brow furrowed how do you know what i about to do maybe i was just going to go up to my dormitory ron exclaimed boldly besides you re one to talk about respecting other privacy tuh ginny clucked her tongue and flipped her hair off of her shoulder before reopening her book and slouching low in her armchair ron took a seat by the armchair nearest the girl dormitory and sat twiddling his thumbs for a moment if only the boys were allowed up there he thought glancing at the girl staircase before making up his mind she was probably swooning over the sweet nothings in her precious letter by now he couldnttake this keeping one eye on ginny who seemed to be absorbed in her book he quietly retrieved his wand from the inside of his robes under his breath he whispered accio hermione letter for a moment he was sure it hadntworked but then an opened piece of parchment come floating toward him from the girl staircase he stood up and grabbed the letter out of the air scanning down to the bottom of the page and reading with great disappointment with love viktor ron didnthave a chance to read anymore however because hermione had come bustling down the stairs with a look of pure astonishment written on her face ronald bilius weasley hermione shouted marching to stand a few inches from him and look up into his face with her hands balled into fists at her sides give that back now ron was holding the letter just out of hermione reach who was attempting and failing to retrieve it by jumping at it he would have laughed if this werenta serious matter ginny had marched over to stand beside hermione now ron i cannot believe you ginny said vehemently oh what cantyou believe ron shouted back that i got just a tad chary when you two run out of the great hall without a proper explanation well i knew it was krum anyway hermione had stopped trying to retrieve the letter still held above ron head and was now standing shoulder to shoulder with ginny they were looking at him with disbelief as if he had just done something horrible ron pushed the tiny pang of guilt to the back of his mind as he told himself that his intentions were completely good he was doing this for hermione safety argh you are just too impossible hermione said and then to ron surprise she turned to stalk off to the boy dormitories at the base of the stairs she turned to look at him with fury well are you coming ron was a bit confused but ginny was looking at him with the same furious what are you waiting for stare i ll be down here if you need me hermione ginny said before brushing past ron to go back to her corner hermione was already stalking up the stairs so ron followed he was beginning to feel a bit apprehensive similar to the feeling he got before a quidditch match he only wished the wronski feint could work on hermione author note thank you to everyone sending in reviews i hope everyone enjoyed this chapter the next chapter is coming along slowly but i trying my hardest to post at least one chapter a day thanks again the characters and situations of harry potter depicted in this story are the legal property of j k rowling bloomsbury and aol time warner and have been used without permission no copyright violation is intended no profit is being made off this site it is for entertainment purposes only chapter 14 ron thought that the boy dormitory seemed much smaller than usual he was sitting on the edge of his bed still clutching hermione letter while she stood pacing the room this is worse than a quidditch match ron thought absently more like a lion den just then ron heard footsteps coming up the stairway and the voices of harry and neville hermione stopped pacing and stared at the door with a somewhat crazed look on her face harry and neville talking died out immediately as they entered the room they both looked from the sullen ron to the crazed hermione neville actually took a step back after looking at hermione expression uh neville i just remembered i haventplayed um exploding snap with seamus and dean in a long time maybe harry said distractedly yeah um seamus and dean i can hear them shuffling the cards now neville said nervously harry took one last look at ron before he and neville quickly descended the stairs when ron looked back at the livid hermione he considered yelling for them to come back hermione strode over to stand directly in front of ron and outstretch her hand give me my letter she said dangerously quiet ron grudgingly handed it over now if you would be so kind as to explain your imbecilic behavior ron was briefly confused as to which imbecilic behavior she was referring to his leaning over her like a hungry animal in the hospital wing or his basic thieving of her own personal letter he was such a jerk ron shifted unnecessarily on his bed and cleared his throat viktor krum is a twenty year old nineteen hermione interrupted haughtily ron let out a frustrated sigh okay ron thought she definitely needs to be arm wrestled right now a nineteen year old international quidditch player from bulgaria ron said matter of factly and hermione prompted and ron repeated aghast that enough isntit he too old for you he a pompous celebrity and he lives miles away ronald yes he does live miles away that why we are penpals hermione said smartly furthermore he never even mentions his celebrity status well what do you two talk about then ron asked emphatically that absolutely none of your concern is it hermione said throwing up her hands but you obviously dontunderstand that you had no right taking that letter from me ron ron let out a long sigh okay you may be right there but what are you so afraid of hermione inquired excitedly ron mind suddenly went blank what was he so afraid of again he briefly pondered which invasion of her personal space she was referring to he mentally cursed himself he knew what he was afraid of it had nothing to do with krum celebrity status age or location ron was jealous pure plain and simple of any guy vying for hermione attention he d been dreading the thought of hermione getting another letter from krum since the beginning of the term he knew that he was most afraid that hermione would if she hadntalready realize how much better krum was than he and that then krum or some other git would take ron place in hermione heart even if that place were only for him as a friend look ron began nervously i just afraid that that that if you two start something together blimey that was hard to say you ll only end up getting hurt wow that sounded lame he thought but hermione must have bought it since her scowl was turning into more of a slight frown she heaved a great sigh before sitting down next to ron on his bed her knee lightly brushed his own okay forget arm wrestling viktor knows how i feel about him hermione began softly a sharp pain cut into ron heart i knew it he thought and he has accepted that we are only friends the pain immediately began to subside what ron asked hopefully oh sure he crosses the line sometimes hermione carried on casually looking down at the floor but i always set him right for example he asked me to spend my christmas holiday with him in bulgaria and i replying to him tonight that i ll be spending it at the burrow hermione cut her eyes in ron direction ginny already invited me and even if she hadn t i dontwant viktor to get the wrong impression if ron exterior showed what his insides felt like at the moment he probably would have jumped through the roof in a fit of joyful whoops but instead ron determinedly kept his exterior calm and collected ron i wish i could have your blessing to continue being friends with viktor i wont quit writing him regardless mind you but still i just wish you could understand hermione looked up into ron face ron didntthink there was anyway in the world he would ever feel completely fine with hermione writing to krum but he would never tell her that not after tonight i sorry i ve been a jerk hermione it really isntany of my business who you talk to and i wontsay another word about krum all right ron said sincerely looking into hermione indecipherable expression she nodded then and stood up from the bed well it getting late and i still have some ancient runes homework to catch up on i should probably head on over to the girl dormitory hermione headed for the door but as she got to the doorway she turned around with an anxious look on her face before asking so there was no other reason you got so upset over viktor letter ron heart did a somersault what exactly was she asking of him he felt as if she were trying to tell him something with her eyes but he was afraid to incorrectly decipher their meaning is she asking me if i jealous for a brief moment ron wanted to just take his chances and tell her everything that his heart had been feeling toward her for the past few years but then he came to his senses i just ron weasley no no other reason ron sad despondently hermione simply nodded her head before giving him a half smile and exiting the dormitory a light snow now covered the grounds and other than the plants in professor sprout greenhouses the evergreen trees were the only signs of live foliage hermione wondered how december had managed to sneak up on them like this though she definitely wasntgoing to complain christmas break couldntcome too soon harry and ron both seemed extraordinarily depressed lately harry was still taking his numerous walks and flying trips so meals and classes were the extent of hermione visits with him she and ron were both starting to really worry about his constant state of exhaustion too were the occlumency lessons that intense harry claimed that he had not had any dreams since the one over summer holiday so apparently the lessons were working but shouldntthat make him sleep and feel better instead he had dark circles under his eyes which were oftentimes bloodshot and he had appeared to have lost some weight hermione often wondered if his seemingly poor health were due to that stupid prophecy and then there was ron who seemed to be sulking a lot lately he complained about his homework endlessly which hermione had to admit he did have a considerable amount of madam bones seemed to think homework was necessary after every class and it only got harder as the term wore on hermione had taken pity on him and had even volunteered to write one of his essays for him but he had refused he seemed to be taking his n e w t classes very seriously which had surprised yet pleased hermione greatly ron definitely hadntshown any more signs of temporary insanity though the closest he d come to kissing her was at lunch one afternoon when he d eaten something hot and taken a gulp of her tea because he d already drank all of his hermione had felt extremely girlish and silly when she had received stomach butterflies from the sight of his lips touching where hers had been after that hermione had begun wondering if ron and harry gloominess were causing her to suffer from temporary insanity so hermione had spent a lot more time with ginny over the last couple of weeks at least ginny smiled every once in a while hermione had also asked her to start eating with her harry and ron since ginny seemed to be the only one that could get any semblance of a smile out of harry she could always seem to come up with some witty comment to everything but other than semi happy meals with her three friends hermione classes were the only things keeping her from going mad while she waited impatiently for christmas holiday healing in particular seemed to cheer her up and make her feel somewhat competent it made her feel good to be skilled at something since harry and ron always out performed her in their biweekly defense classes therefore hermione was in good spirits this thursday morning as she harry and ron left the great hall after breakfast professor sinistra had mentioned something about learning a pain relief spell at their last class meeting it could apparently be used before during or after any healing procedures and would immediately lesson the pain of the injury you mean to tell me that if we could learn this pain relieving spell we could basically prevent ourselves from ever feeling pain again ron asked hermione disbelievingly as they walked up the many stairs to the fifth floor no hermione replied casually it lessons the pain of the injury it doesntmake it disappear plus it depends on the skill of the healer and the severity of the injury as to how well it will work well ron said turning to harry if i ever in pain make sure you let hermione heal me alright mate hermione looked up smiling to see harry staring off into space completely oblivious to his two friends presence ron turned to hermione and gave her a lopsided frown she just shook her head worriedly as they entered the classroom and took their seats professor sinistra arrived promptly wearing her dark purple lipstick and polish again today hermione sat up straighter in her seat she had been waiting for this lesson sinistra levitated a basic healing kit from a shelf behind her bringing it to rest on her desk before turning to address the class alright everyone she said quietly i ve already informed you that today lesson will be on a pain relieving spell so i want to begin the class by explaining to you the difference between the effects of the spell and the effects of these she opened the small metal box and removed two small glass bottles of the blue pain relief potion she held them up one in each hand as she continued now the potion as compared to the ahhh suddenly sinistra took a sharp intake of breath and both bottles fell from her hands to shatter on the stone floor a few of the students gasped a blue vapor was rising eerily with a hiss from the spilt potion on the ground what in the world sinistra usually calm exterior was broken by a furrowed brow and shaking hands she suddenly grabbed her left wrist and closed her eyes tightly everyone in the class was completely still watching their teacher with silent trepidation what was going on hermione turned to look at ron and harry ron was staring at sinistra in bewilderment harry was unreadable still gripping her wrist sinistra opened her eyes and began walking slowly almost dazedly toward the door something suddenly dawned on hermione no she thought she cantbe harry suddenly stood up from his seat hermione reached over ron to pull on harry robes but he ignored her show me your arm harry commanded sharply sinistra stopped in her tracks and turned to face harry with a fierce look in her eyes she dropped both arms to her sides sit down and shut your mouth class dismissed she said in a shaky yet cold whisper before turning to head quickly for the door again none of the students moved a muscle except for harry he jerked his robes from hermione grasp and walked up behind sinistra grabbing her right arm and turning her roughly around to face him hermione hands flew to her mouth as she couldntcontain a gasp ron turned around in his chair to face her with a worried look in his eye he nodded down at his chest where he then pulled his robes back slowly to reveal that he had retrieved his wand from his pocket hermione nodded her head slowly sinistra harsh whisper cut through the silence take your hands off of me or i swear she began but harry jerked hard on her arm show me your arm he shouted at her hermione felt like she could be sick as ron stood up from his seat everyone in the classroom was now looking anxiously from sinistra to harry to ron and then the classroom door was suddenly slammed open potter snape had entered looking rattled and angry hermione had never appreciated his impeccable timing more he glided swiftly over to harry who was still holding firmly onto sinistra arm you arrogant little release her this instant potter and stop acting as if you know what going on harry simply glared at snape before releasing sinistra arm she stepped back from harry and turned an imploring look up at snape severus she said almost pleadingly snape looked down at her with a dark stony expression come sobrina he thenplaced his hand on her elbow andbegan leading her toward the door harry followed directly behind them i coming with you he said boldly hermione looked up at ron who was still standing his wand held down at his side she grabbed his hand and he looked down at her with a deep frown hermione felt completely hopeless as she looked into his blue eyes and whispered ron he squeezed her hand gently before turning back toward the troublesome scene before them potter snape began menacingly when will you learn to harry suddenly thrust both hands fiercely into his unruly black hair as he shouted i have a right to know harry hands fell back down to his sides as he walked up to stand a mere foot from snape harry was much skinnier and about two inches shorter than snape but hermione thought that harry looked much more threatening at the moment harry then all but growled into snape face if he is planning something i have a right to know hermione whole body began to tremble at the mixture of anger and sadness in harry voice ron looked down at her worriedly and sat back down in his seat he then thrust his wand back into his pocket and took hermione other hand in his with both of her hands in his hermione trembling subsided slightly snape was glaring at harry we ll let the headmaster decide what rights you have he spat snape then turned on his heel leading sinistra out with harry in their wake the door slammed shut as they exited and the room immediately erupted into complete chaos everyone voices began shouting questions and exclamations ron stood up quickly pulling hermione up with him releasing one of her hands he grabbed his and harry bags while hermione grabbed hers ron then entwined his fingers with hers and led her quickly from the frenzied room they both ignored the questions shouted at them what he talking about why did he want to see her arm who planning somethin g hermione felt like she was in a dream world as ron began rushing her down the corridor sinistra had apparently felt something the dark mark it had to be it too much of a coincidence that snape would come to her classroom right after it had happened hermione suddenly realized that ron was rushing her in the opposite direction of the grand staircase she looked over her shoulder to see snape sinistra and harry disappearing down the stairs wait hermione breathed ron stopped and turned to face her with a serious frown they were both breathing heavily from sprinting down the hall and were now standing a few yards away from the entrance to their common room ron they were going to dumbledore we need to go down to the second floor hermione turned to go back toward the grand staircase but ron remained where he was standing holding tightly to her hand she looked at him curiously hermione i taking you to gryffindor tower come on ron turned to head toward the entrance but this time hermione held back no we need to follow harry ron shook his head he was beginning to look frustrated harry can take care of himself ron i hermione began but ron suddenly turned toward the entrance and pulled hard on her arm she had to choose between falling to the ground and being dragged or consenting to follow him she followed ron spat the password and led her into the empty common room hermione suddenly realized that everyone who wasntin basic healing or snape abandoned class was probably sitting quietly at their desks taking notes in their own classes ron led hermione over to the sofa where he released her hand and threw his and harry bags down on the coffee table he then started pacing in front of the fireplace hermione sat down slowly on the couch watching ron pace back and forth madly he was beginning to make her head hurt ron why cantwe just go down to dumbledore office and wait for harry i want to know what going on she said desperately ron stopped his pacing and stared wide eyed at her before coming to sit in the armchair beside her hermione you know who is calling to them dontyou understand that you dontneed to be walking around the castle right now ron we re safe as long as we re in this castle and dumbledore is here now please let just hermione ron exclaimed loudly causing her to jump as far as we know draco malfoy has one of those damned skulls on his arm and i believe you were in this castle with dumbledore present when you were put under the imperious curse by none other than draco malfoy hermione felt a chill rush through her he was right there was a possibilitythat malfoy was working for his father master but then if harry dream were true and she was the muggle born in question why hadntmalfoy just led her into the arms of a kidnapper then or why hadnthe kidnapped her himself or killed her for that matter hermione shook her head to rid herself of these thoughts come here ron said quietly standing up and holding out his hand for her hermione looked up at him and her stomach began fluttering she grasped his hand tentatively what was he doing unexpectedly he led her over to the chess table he released her hand and sat down at one side he then motioned for her to seat herself across from him he now had a weak smile but his eyes still held worry play me it will make us both feel better while we wait for harry to get here you always feel better when you have to concentrate on something difficult and i always feel better when i beat you at something hermione sat down slowly biting the insides of her cheeks to keep from smiling she shouldntwant to smile at a time like this harry was probably in dumbledore office right now hearing awful things about voldemort and his death eaters and what horrible things they may be planning but somehow ron smile however weak made her feel much more relaxed thanwas probably fitting ron and hermione were halfway through their chess match when they realized that they still had their n e w t classes ahead of them since sinistra had barely begun her lecture when her mark had burned they still had twenty minutes to get to their classes after they d remembered their schedule ron really wanted to skip the classes and remain by hermione side until they knew exactly what was going on but she had insisted that they go so he had settled with walking her to her class before going to his the chess game had apparently worked he had seen the look of fear pass over hermione face when he d mentioned the boggart incident it had made him feel horrible but he didntknow how else to get her to understand that hogwarts wasntcompletely safe as long as there was evil inside its walls but as soon as they d begun playing chess she seemed to lighten up considerably ron had pretended to lighten up as well but on the inside he was burning up with fear what did voldemort have in mind the only two thoughts that kept swaying back and forth in ron mind were harry dream and trelawney prophecy with this horrid pendulum of thought ron felt that each second of his classes ticked by in slow motion when magical law was finally over he met hermione in the hallway and they walked down to the great hall together they were both relieved when they saw harry already seated at the house table ginny was seated beside him and they were deep in conversation ron and hermione quickly made their way over to sit across from them as they sat down ginny looked from them to harry harry i ll tell them if you want ginny said quietly you ve already been through it all once and you haventtouched your food harry just nodded at her ginny turned to ron and hermione and they each leaned in toward one another okay ginny began with a deep breath sinistra is a reformed death eater but she isnt a double agent like snape apparently voldemort killed her mother and father supporters of dumbledore after sinistra refused a mission involving harmingchildren that what caused her to reform this was about seventeen years ago ginny took a deep breath to continue but she suddenly furrowed her brows and turned to look at harry who was leaned in listening to her retelling of his story harry you need to eat something i swear if you dontstart eating better you re going to be able to borrow mine or hermione jeans and if you ever fit into my jeans i ll kill myself harry smiled that smile that only ginny could manage to get out of him before ginny turned back to ron and hermione to continue anyway sinistra refuses to be a spy for dumbledore because she apparently lost all nerve after witnessing her parents murders she saw them being murdered hermione gasped ron noticed her put a hand to her mouth ginny nodded solemnly ron remembered what hermione had said about sinistra father being a healer he wondered if her father death was the real reason sinistra had dropped out of healing school to become an astronomy teacher hermione must have been thinking along the same lines as she continued gravely if i knew that i was responsible for my father death i wouldntwant to be a dentist i would think of him constantly hermione was shaking her head sadly ginny briefly nodded in agreement before leaning in close now this next part you re really going to want to hear ginny said enthusiastically ron and hermione leaned in a bit closer dumbledore told snape that he needed him to look into things and then dumbledore asked sinistra if she could help too well she refused and snape bellows out sobrina dontyou realize what is happening here dontyou realize what potter mother sacrificed for him her life our world is jeopardized if this boy dies and you canteven sacrifice your pathetic feelings of security ginny paused to watch ron and hermione reactions ron couldntbelieve what he d just heard and he let out a low whistle hermione was just staring at ginny with wide eyes and her mouth partway open snape said that ron exclaimed incredulously harry looked up at him and nodded slowly my reaction exactly and i was there but what did sinistra say to that hermione asked eagerly nothing ginny said plainly she just looked on the verge of tears and then dumbledore told snape to cool it dumbledore said that sinistra had the right to make her own decisions ginny turned to harry did i miss anything i think you nailed it harry said glumly well except for dumbledore informing me that this was the first time the dark mark has been summoned since mid june but it not the first that they ve heard from the death eaters apparently there have been attacks that the order has managed to keep out of the daily prophet of course fudge doesntcomplain since he doesntlike the idea of the wizarding community really knowing what going on anyway as long as he holds the seat of minister of magic he wants to ensure this sense of false security i think it crap but dumbledore seems to think he right in this well ginny began matter of factly dumbledore actually wants us to feel safe here because he thinks its best for us fudge wants us to feel safe because he thinks its best for his job security but regardless of what they ve told us there have apparently been around seven attacks already this term seven ron exclaimed loudly hermione elbowed him sharply in his side and he looked down at her guiltily a few people down the table had looked over at their huddle and ron ears turned a bit red as he turned back to harry and whispered seven harry nodded solemnly four muggle families and three wizarding families twenty three deaths total ron head was aching slightly with the weight of everything he d just heard he noticed that hermione now looked really uncomfortable he was suddenly ready for this conversation to be over with so anything else ron asked hesitantly harry and ginny both shook their heads ron turned to hermione who was now staring at the table blindly twirling a piece of her hair around her finger while she bit her lower lip she looked extremely lost in thought and adorable at the same time ron wondered if she were in the same maze of worry that he was in at the moment voldemort was summoning his death eaters there had already been other attacks this term resulting in nearly two dozen casualties what could they be planning that required his whole horde of death eaters was this sinistra woman really trustworthy were his parents safe at the burrow and at the heart of ron maze of worries were harry and hermione even safe at hogwarts author note the reviews have been sooo encouraging and thoughtful thanks so much and please continue to review everytime i read a new one it makes me want to stay up all night writing well buckle your seatbelts for chapter 15 mwah ha ha the characters and situations of harry potter depicted in this story are the legal property of j k rowling bloomsbury and aol time warner and have been used without permission no copyright violation is intended no profit is being made off this site it is for entertainment purposes only chapter 15 libraries were supposed to promote concentration for one studies but hermione had been staring at the same page of her arithmancy book for the last fifteen minutes the sun had long been set so there was a calming gray blue light cast about the shelves and tables from the moon and stars there was a window open letting in a cold breeze to stir with the heat from the fires it was completely silent except for the occasional turn of a page or scuffing of a book being taken from a shelf and there was the lovely smell of aged pages waiting to be read but all of these wonderful qualities of the library also made it easy for hermione to fixate on the conversation she had had with her friends at lunch it was hard to truly believe that voldemort the horrible monster she d read so much about since her youth was at large he was back he and his followers were killing innocent people hey hermione jumped slightly at ron low whisper they were seated at a small table toward the center of the library and he was looking at her with one eyebrow raised from across the table hermione i finding it hard to believe that you re still on that same page he said worriedly hermione heart sighed ron had been acting so sweetly toward her all day starting after healing class when he d whisked her away to the safety of their tower and then to the common room where he d suggested that they play chess to relieve her mind and still now as he did his homework by her side in her favorite study area she knew that he would rather be sitting in front of the fire in their common room but he had suggested that they come here harry had been invited but of course he was out walking the corridors ron hermione whispered looking into his eyes i really worried about harry ron shook his head slowly i think he just well he told me that he feels like he should be doing something doing something hermione asked inquisitively leaning forward she hadntheard this yeah you know like joining the order and being a part of the well the action action hermione asked incredulously ron how can you refer to it like it some sort of game hermione ron said sternly you know i didntmean it like that i just mean that he feels like he needs to stop sitting around on his a on his rear and help fight do you feel that way hermione asked hesitantly she couldntbear to see ron going into action he shrugged with a frown well i think it up to harry no ron i meant do you feel like you should be helping too ron had been looking at her intently but as she finished her question he leaned back slightly and looked away looking down at his hands on the table he said i do want to help but but hermione prompted trying to still her heart from its hopeful flutter he shifted uncomfortably in his seat his face and ears turning a bright pink what was the matter with him i ve grown up with nine people under one roof sometimes it bloody annoying but at other times it brilliant he said still looking down at his hands which he was twisting nervously hermione stomach suddenly felt sick he was still worried about living up to his brothers ron you dont have to go looking to fight a death eater just to prove yourself she said softly he looked up with a weak smile his face still pink before looking back down at his hands no hermione i was going to say that i well i want a family you know i mean i have a family but i want another one no that not what i mean i i guess in the future it would be nice if well if i had had you want to get married and have children someday hermione said quietly trying to sound casual as a strange lump formed in her throat did she want to cry or smile ron looked up at her his shade of pink deepening to red yeah i guess what i trying to say is that i worry a lot about dad and i know mum worries more than i do and he not even an auror or anything that sone ofthe reasons i chose the logistics path it weird you know there a part of me that feels like i should and even want to be a fighter but then the other part of me wants to boom hermione gasped so strongly her head felt chest throbbed with pain a resounding boom had just shaken the very floor beneath her feet her entire torso seemed to have shaken along with it ron was suddenly standing up and coming around the table toward her she stood up as well and suddenly her mind decided to switch from confused to scared she gripped ron forearm ron wha boom distant screams ron immediately pulled her down hard to squat on the floor hermione was staring into his face but his eyes were darting around the room like mad as he grabbed hold of her hand smoke he breathed hermione traced his line of sight to the open library window out over the lake smoke ron looked down at her fretfully hermione i think i think it hogsmeade what hermione whispered back her chest heaving up and down with the beating of her heart students are there any students present hermione looked up to see tiny professor flitwick shockingly white haired head just over the tops of the tables we re here hermione called she saw his head bobbing quickly over to where her and ron were crouched his eyes were opened wide and a bit frantic when he came upon them are you two the only students in the library he asked in a slightly squeaky yet deeply concerned voice we dontknow for sure but i dontthink there are any others ron said hurriedly still grasping firmly to hermione hand flitwick began nodding his head very quickly well i ll have a look around both of you get straight to your common rooms no dilly dallying if you see anyone in the corridors tell them the same ron and hermione stood up quickly and hermione found herself being rushed out of the library down the corridor and up the staircase by a firm faced rapidly moving ron the whole while all hermione could think about was that horrible booming sound the black billowing smoke and those dreadful horrified screams what wrong with my legs i ve got to go faster ron was wheezing with every breath as he pulled hermione along behind him up the staircase there were students and teachers going up and coming down where had they all come from ron kept glancing back to make sure hermione was following okay maybe i should just pick her up and run the hand ron had entwined with hermione was so clammy he was afraid hermione hand might slide loose no ron hand felt as though it were being crushed beneath her tiny fingers she wasntletting go finally the corridor he pulled hermione along in haste the fat lady why werentthese people moving there were about fifteen people just standing there the fat lady was yelling something what was going on still clasping firmly to hermione hand ron began pushing his way through dean thomas was crushed in the middle of the group yelling loudly move move you bloody idiots ron hermione he turned a thankful look upon them i cantget these stinking munchkins to move prefects move ron shouted it worked mostly some of the students were crying and just standing there move he shouted once more oh dear oh dear oh dear oh dear the fat lady was nervously looking around at all the students mr prefect dear the children have given me the correct password but i donthave room to open oh dear oh dear ron turned around to face the fearful students you ve got to move back ron shouted commandingly everyone looked at him in surprise move hermione bellowed suddenly stomping her foot immediately everyone began backing away should he she looked quite scary and her voice had sounded way too much like mcgonagall just then scary ron and hermione then scooted back and allowed the portrait to open he pulled her away from the door to let the others in first for fear that they would get trampled if he didn t everyone piled in immediately except for dean who insisted that ron and hermione go in ahead of him ron walked in with hermione in tow all of the gryffindors seemed to be crowded inside the common room ron had never seen it this packed some were stony faced some were crying some were screaming some were comforting others suddenly ron saw a redhead weaving her way toward them a teary eyed and frantic looking ginny pulled him and hermione into a strong hold before pulling back and taking ron free hand her grip was just as strong as hermione s ron where harry she cried harry hermione breathed beside him she was looking desperately into ron eyes ron stomach clenched painfully where was harry ginny and hermione looked so horrified i ll go look for him he said trying to pull his hands away from them no they screamed together no ron you cant leave this common room ginny said sternly hermione was shaking her head at him alright alright i not going anywhere let just let go find a seat he said softly still holding tightly to their hands he walked with both of them to a clear area in front of a bookshelf all the seats were full so they sunk down to the floor and leaned their backs against the shelving they were all sitting indian style on the warm carpeting ron had their hands resting in his lap and each of them had their heads resting on his shoulders hermione was to his right ginny to his left neither of them were crying yet he could feel the fear in them or was that his fear suddenly ginny lifted her head and freed her hand from ron s she then stood up quickly ron looked up to see harry walking over to them from the portrait hole door he had his hands shoved into his pockets and he was extremely pale hermione stood up as well and ron reluctantly released her hand as he followed pushing up from the ground hermione and ginny both ran to harry and hugged him tightly ron stood his ground but he felt a rush of relief at the sight of his best friend suddenly as the students in the common room took sight of harry arrival it seemed to get much quieter the sorting hat had told them all that there was a wizard here at hogwarts that had to win a fight in order to save their world ron was sure that no one had forgotten that song just as sure as he was that not everyone believed that wizard to be dumbledore actually most of them probably didntbelieve that at all harry ginny and hermione all walked back over to where ron was standing and the volume of the room slowly began to increase to its original level harry then began talking in a bland whisper i was on the first floor when the explosions went off dumbledore was at the entrance doors in a matter of seconds i dontknow how he got down the stairs so fast but he began shouting orders to every teacher he saw i heard him telling filch to lock down the castle mcgonagall was told to inform the other teachers to get the students to their common rooms what took you so long hermione asked suddenly anxiously harry looked at her with a frown i asked dumbledore to tell me what was going on all he said was that i needed to get to this tower and that the order had already been summoned harry sounded resentful ron felt his stomach turn sickly ginny suddenly started weeping a a all of the order she asked sobbing harry looked at her apologetically i sorry ginny harry said softly i know mcgonagall is staying here at hogwarts surely there are others who werentcalled you re just saying that harry i not stupid ginny said harshly wiping her eyes mcgonagall has to stay with us but my my she suddenly buried her face completely in her hands harry had an aggrieved look on his face as he reached a hand toward her ginny abruptly turned herself toward harry and buried her face in his chest harry closed his eyes with an intensely pained expression before wrapping his arms around her ron began rubbing his forehead with one hand dad mum bill charlie fred george he took a deep breath as hermione asked in a small voice what about dumbledore harry did he leave harry shook his head ginny still wrapped in his arms her shoulders shaking with sobs he says he ll only leave if the order sends for him only if things get out of hand or if voldemort there ginny looked up at harry suddenly and pounded him once on the chest with her fist dontsay his name not now she whispered frantically harry looked miserable as he pressed ginny head gently back down to his chest she didntresist but grabbed handfuls of harry shirt as she continued to weep ron knew harry well enough to guess at the main reason for his misery harry knew that every day that voldemort remained alive and strong every innocent person that was killed on voldemort orders harry held the burden of that death harry blamed himself ron knew however that harry couldntjust go find voldemort and murder him now that he knew the prophecy it just wasntgoing to work that way for one thing they didntknow where voldemort was hiding and for another harry wasntready voldemort was the second most powerful wizard in the world but he had to be the third before harry could go rushing after him harry ron said tentatively there nothing you can do right now isntthere harry asked heatedly ron i cant just sit here and not feel that but harry you werenteven supposed to hear the prophecy ron continued calmly imagine that you didntknow about it yet you wouldntbe rushing out to find him then ron i harry began but hermione stepped up to stand between them looking from one to the other stop this both of you she yelled i wont listen to this suddenly ginny wrenched herself from harry arms her face flushed her eyes puffy she looked at hermione scornfully hermione you stop she said sternly hermione took a step back from her open your eyes dontyou understand what it does to harry every time you disregard the prophecy he believes it hermione i believe it dumbledore believes it ron believes it it his burden not yours you donthave the right to tell him to stop close your ears if you must but open your damn eyes ginny just stood there breathing heavily her tears ceased hermione looked completely taken off guard as did harry and probably me thought ron ron had agreed with everything his sister had said but there was still part of him that had wanted to tell her to stop yelling at hermione although he truly felt that hermione needed to hear what ginny had just said it what he had wanted to tell her earlier in the term that day at the library when he d had the idea to visit hagrid instead suddenly hermione backed up to the bookshelf and sat down lowering her head to her hands her shoulders began shaking with sobs as ginny had just moments ago ron sat down slowly beside hermione and put his arm around her with her head still in her hands she leaned into the crook of his arm ron looked up at harry and ginny who were both looking down at them sadly the door to the common room suddenly creaked open and ron looked up to see a stony faced mcgonagall walk to the center of the room hermione looked up as well everyone fell totally silent hogsmeade has been attacked she said plainly no one spoke a few gasped a large group of you know who supporters apparated to the town where they blasted two buildings assaulted some bystanders and then quickly disapparated some muttering and whispering erupted about the room but dean thomas stood up from the floor near the fireplace as he exclaimed above everyone why mcgonagall stern expression did not falter as she turned to him mr thomas these people will do anything to evoke terror into the wizarding community they want to be feared in our fear they have more power i not afraid shouted jack sloper from across the room why dontwe just track down the bastards and hang them dean nodded fervently in agreement mcgonagall sighed heavily before continuing it simply not that black and white mr sloper but there are a number of talented witches and wizards attempting day in and day out to find you know who and his supporters however what you and your fellow students need to do now is go up to your dormitories and rest but what about the the death eaters lavender brown shouted sounding on the verge of hysteria sirius black broke in here two years ago surely you know who men could do it there was a mumbling of agreement ron noticed a muscle in harry jaw contract i will be patrolling the corridor tonight right outside so there no need to worry mcgonagall said calmly besides they have gone and are no doubt far from the castle which by the way is completely secure no one really looked satisfied and mcgonagall seemed to notice listen i will be right outside the door i will be listening to make sure that everyone is getting to sleep she clasped her hands together and raised one eyebrow i will also be listening to make sure that there is no one camping out in the common room tonight with sleeping bags such as these mcgonagall retrieved her wand from her robes and conjured around thirty purple sleeping bags in a large pile so only for tonight i will be listening for campers which i would most assuredly never hear anyway so right goodnight oh yes and unless otherwise informed classes will still be held tomorrow the portrait hole door opened and closed as mcgonagall left the common room many of the younger students rushed forward to grab some sleeping bags while many of the sixth and seventh year students headed up to their dormitories hermione was leaning into ron side his strong arm around her shoulders her tears had ceased but she still felt miserable sadness anger guilt fear and confusion why did her friends believe this prophecy why couldntthey understand her take on it why was there a part of her that felt that ginny was right and why were there people in the world so evil that they shed others blood simply because it differed from their own on top of these questions hermione was disgusted with herself for having one other was ron only holding her tightly because he was comforting his friend she d seen the fear in his eyes when he looked at her she knew he was thinking about her safety harry hadntlooked at her like that hermione didnteven think that harry had been thinking about the dream he was thinking about that prophecy he was thinking about fighting but ron he seemed to have been consumed with her ever since sinistra and snape dark marks had burned hermione hermione looked up to see a timid faced colin creevey standing side by side with his younger brother dennis um do you know how to make more of those sleeping bags he asked quietly yeah hermione said wiping at her eyes as she stood up from ron hold just two she asked colin nodded hermione took out her wand and conjured two sleeping bags which colin and dennis thanked her for before rushing off to a corner with some other third and fourth years ron stood up beside her and ginny unexpectedly grabbed hermione hand hermione looked up into ginny sad expression hermione ginny began softly i sorry for yelling at you like that i was just upset and no it okay hermione said with a weak smile we re all upset ginny nodded attempting to return hermione smile well i think i going to sleep in the dormitory harry muttered what about you three i d like to stay down here ginny said looking at hermione hermione nodded in agreement i ll stay down here with the girls ron said quietly hermione looked up to see harry nod appreciatively at ron harry then said goodnight and left for the dormitory hermione knew he needed to be alone tonight shielded by his curtains hermione then conjured three sleeping bags before she ron and ginny found an empty space on the floor ron sat his bag in between hers and ginny s each sleeping bag was a mere foot from its neighbor hermione couldntstop the squirming of her stomach she knew that it was excitement from the idea of sleeping so close to ron but under the circumstances she really didntfeel like she should feel excited at all what was wrong with her was she so selfish that her feelings of excitement would override her feelings of sympathy for the people of hogsmeade for harry ginny had definitely implied that hermione was being selfish maybe she really was maybe it was in her nature ginny was already climbing into her sleeping bag ron and hermione quickly followed hermione settled in lying on her back looking at the arched ceiling she heard ginny whispering something to ron followed by his low voice saying they re all fine i sure dad will take care of all of them more whispering from ginny followed by a low sure hermione turned her head to see ron reaching a hand out to his sister which she grabbed a hold of before closing her eyes and cuddling into her pillow hermione smiled to herself at ron affection and gentility with his sister but she also felt a small pang of sadness ron cared for her and ginny but in the same way was she just a sister to him would she ask herself this question until her dying day ron slowly turned his head away from ginny to look at hermione he was still holding ginny hand in between his and her sleeping bags and by the sound of ginny breathing she was already asleep are you okay he asked softly for some reason his tone made a lump form in hermione throat she simply nodded and then to hermione surprise ron tentatively reached his hand toward her to lie in between their sleeping bags she removed her hand from under her covers and extended it to rest in ron s he smiled weakly before turning his head to the ceiling and closing his eyes hermione continued to stare at him however he wasntreally gripping her hand but more so resting his on the floor for hermione to hold on to his hand was so warm and although calloused in spots his palm was mostly soft youthful sixteen lying there with his eyes closed his expression frowning slightly hermione would say he looked in his twenties and he was definitely beginning to act older than some of the sixteen year olds she knew but then again there was something in fear and anxiety and the unknown that seemed to age people she could feel it too author note well not much to say other than i hope everyone enjoyed this chapter please continue to

eaters attack hogsmeade last night thursday december tenth the peaceful town of hogsmeade was bombarded by no less than ten supporters of he who must not be named the attack solely believed to be an attempt to evoke fear in our world occurred at 9 23 pm when a number of hooded and masked individuals apparated on the outskirts of the town upon entering the town they began striking innocent bystanders at random taking the lives of five people and injuring eight two lives were taken by two separate yet successful attempts at what is believed to have been the killing curse three others were killed when one blast made contact with and destroyed the stalk family home near zonko joke shop the inhabitants of the home were a man and wife and mrs stalk father mr blenheim stalk was a renowned expert on muggles and an author of many books another blast destroyed dervish and banges a small shop for magical equipment located at the end of high street luckily the elderly owner of the store mr thelonious dervish was at the hog head at the time of the explosion and was unharmed the hog head a small inn and bar located near dervish and banges was unscathed and yet was not totally uninvolved in the attack the owner of the inn mr aberforth dumbledore managed to capture one of the death eaters when he left the security of his establishment to enter the fray after hearing the sounds of battle the captive stanley nott will have a trial today that will surely result in a life sentence in azkaban investigators believe that dumbledore involvement in the battle may have saved many innocent lives by prompting the early disapparation of the death eaters dumbledore would not participate in an interview but reporter natalie pry was able to conduct a brief interview with the brother of the innkeeper headmaster albus dumbledore of hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry hogwarts is located less than two miles from the small village of hogsmeade when asked if the attack did or would affect the school in any way albus dumbledore responded the students are quite safe inside the hogwarts castle my staff and i hold the students safety above all things and extra precautionary matters will be invoked into our usual routine to ensure the utmost safety for each child parents are free to contact me or any of my staff for further questions or concerns minister of magic cornelius fudge was interviewed as well this most unfortunate travesty will be thoroughly investigated fudge said when asked what the ministry planned to do about the attack the ministry will not stand for such crimes and we will not stop searching for these criminals until they are all behind bars fudge also revealed that a committee has already been selected by the ministry to help the citizens of hogsmeade repair all damages hermione watched ron lay the paper down on the table between his and harry breakfast plates after reading the article aloud hermione had just received the paper but she had asked ron to read it for fear that she would become too emotional however after hearing the article she felt closer to being emotionless than emotional was she supposed to feel numb inside the underlying fear of an inevitable attack by voldemort or his death eaters had now become reality yes there had been other attacks already but they werentreported so it was almost as if they hadnthappened but now instead of worrying about voldemort first move hermione was trying to cope with it but she couldntcope with it because she didntreally understand it had the death eaters really not had any objective other than evoking fear or had the attack had something to do with this prophecy that she didntbelieve in or had it had something to do with harry dream they had destroyed the home of a renowned muggle expert was that intentional or just a morbid coincidence and if aberforth had caused a premature departure from their mission what had the rest of their mission entailed nott harry said absently interrupting hermione thoughts he was there that night at the graveyard ginny looked at him sadly and at the department of mysteries and hermione began his son theodore was one of the slytherin students to enroll in the slytherin school of magic they all sat in silence for a moment digesting the article when suddenly ron spoke i cantbelieve they arentcanceling today classes ron said glumly i mean i feel like i ve been run over by the knight bus well ginny began at least we know everyone okay yes hermione thought at least they did know that the weasley had sent ron and ginny a letter informing them that everyone from the order had returned from the mission alive and well yeah ron said gruffly in agreement and at least dumbledore brother caught one of the son of ron hermione said tiredly she didntreally feel energized enough to put up much of a fight but neither did she feel like hearing him curse at the breakfast table sorry hermione ron said quietly before continuing at least he caught one of the dirty old bas ronald hermione whined ron sighed deeply and leaned forward resting his elbows on the table with a look of defeat ginny then said matter of factly you know hermione i ve got to side with ron on this one they are dirty son of bitches hermione mouth fell open as she looked at ginny with a wide eyed expression harry had spit his juice out onto his tray unable to hold back a strangled laugh and hermione was then forced to chuckle herself but ron had just grabbed a couple of pieces of bacon from his tray apparently unaware that ginny had even spoken as hermione looked at ron she began reminiscing over this morning she had woken with her hand still lying in ron s ginny had already left for the shower rooms it was more than a bit awkward waking up side by side and holding hands with your best friend especially when there were a few early risers milling about the common room surely wondering what was going on between them well they werentthe only ones wondering hermione could not ignore the fact that ron behavior toward her was noticeably different than previous years he was more protective more gentle and she couldnt forget about the hospital incident was it temporary insanity she had felt so sure that he really had in fact been tired and shaken that night the thought of ron weasley wanting to kiss her had been to good to be true so hermione had accepted that it was false but hermione couldntand wouldntknow for sure unless ron made the first move he would have to be the one to say hey i feel something for you she was sticking by her rule no jeopardizing the friendship the rest of their breakfast went by quickly as did the next two weeks leading to christmas holiday it was strange to hermione how tragedies could make such an impact but then be so easily shoved to the back of one mind the day after the daily prophet article was released everyone seemed to stop discussing the hogsmeade attack there seemed to be an unwritten agreement between the faculty and students to avoid the subject everyone hermione included just wanted to make it through the term for a well deserved break fortunately the attack had not affected their classes or end of term exams everything immediately returned to normal sinistra did not even offer an explanation to the class on her strange behavior and no one asked her about it she just began teaching the class as she had been the whole term which was exactly what all of their teachers had done although the students werentallowed outside of the castle unless escorted by a staff member no one seemed to complain everyone was too busy studying for exams which went exceptionally well for her ron and harry they had stayed up late each night studying and it had paid off ron had been elated with his marks and hermione was thrilled for him hermione was surprised however that harry had done well since he had continued to go on his walks through the castle apparently his late night studying was enough to carry him and now finally exams were over and the trip to the burrow was only one day away christmas with the weasleys would be a first for hermione and she didntremember the last time she had been this excited over christmas of course when she was a child she had always been ready for the holidays because that meant new books and toys but that had slowly worn away with age however hermione was now remembering what that childlike excitement had felt like ron was rummaging under his bed and through his bedside table for his belongings that he would be taking home over christmas holiday finally finally he hermione harry and ginny could ditch this castle for a couple of months at the burrow ron had been in high spirits for the past week after the shock of the hogsmeade attack had worn off he had discovered that he could not wait to leave this place tomorrow morning christmas eve they would be on their way home he had never been so ready to leave hogwarts and ron knew why this was the first year that he had actually given his all in his classes the first year that he had had the prophecy constantly nagging at his mind and the first year he had truly been consumed with hermione he thought about her when he awoke when he ate when he studied when he slept when he breathed in past years he had definitely had feelings for her he d had urges he d had hopes but this year his feelings had definitely reached new heights had it started with the knowledge of harry dream that first train ride to the castle in the past he had always worried more about harry than hermione harry had always seemed to be the vulnerable one of their trio but this year hermione welfare was his every thought was the dream real was the dream about her he couldntstop these questions from plaguing him he couldntstop himself from imagining his world without her and it was this that had made ron realize that without hermione he had no world ron now knew that he could not lose her but could he have her he had been telling himself no for the past two and a half years could he continue to ignore the part of him that was now saying yes where had this part of him come from when had it started saying yes as he continued to search his dormitory for his strewn belongings ron began repeating the words that had unexpectedly sprang into his mind this morning this christmas eve eve oh sure he crosses the line sometimes but i always set him right what had made him remember this why was he suddenly jovial about hermione admission that she had no romantic feelings for viktor krum it had been over a month since the letter incident since these beautiful words these words that suddenly gave him hope hope was it at that moment when part of him had started saying yes you can have her or did that happen the night in the common room when he had held hermione hand as they slept she had taken his hand willingly and gratefully she took his hand might she take him he had done exceptionally well on his n e w t classes end of term exams maybe he wasntas stupid as he d thought of course he could never be good enough for hermione but could anyone suddenly harry entered the dormitory breaking into ron reverie harry immediately went to his bed and began fumbling through a large pile of clothes with a slight look of concern ron was about to ask him if everything were okay when harry looked up at ron with a furrowed brow hey mate harry said anxiously what are you wearing tonight ron heart leapt into his throat lost in thoughts of hermione ron had temporarily forgotten that the gryffindors had decided to throw an end of term christmas bash ron first reaction to the news of the party had been excitement but then it had quickly turned to something closer to dread he thought it was probably due to the fact that everyone in the tower had been talking about how fun it was going to be to have their very own gryffindor dance this made ron nervous he wished the bash would just be like the quidditch celebration parties mingling some food maybe a few scattered games of exploding snap or wizard chess but dancing besides some odd spins and jumps he used to perform alone in his room at the burrow ron had never danced he didntknow how plus if it werentwith hermione he didntreally want to anyway should he ask her to dance tonight um ron harry prompted curiously ron looked up to see harry staring at him from over by his bed with one raised eyebrow ron paused before remembering oh yes what was he wearing he hadntthought of that oh crikey was this a formal party was hermione going to be dressed like she had been at the yule ball ron swallowed involuntarily uh i dunno i hadntreally thought about it ron admitted apprehensively leaning down into his trunk to shuffle through his recently packed clothes glancing at the clock he saw that it was already five thirty he only had an hour and a half to get ready wait what was wrong with him it took him ten minutes to get ready for some reason harry question had really intensified his nervousness for the party luckily ron had inherited some stylish hand me downs from his oldest brother bill he pulled out some fairly new jeans that bill had simply outgrown in the waist ron held them up they were dark denim and had a few small fraying holes on them but they were supposed to at least he thought that what bill had said ron shrugged and threw them on the bed okay now for a shirt there was a blue button down shirt with a collar and that red v neck sweater hey mate will you wear the red one harry asked from behind his pile of clothes why ron asked curiously because i wearing this harry held up a blue button down shirt with a collar almost identical to the one in ron left hand i not sure but i dontthink you re supposed to wear the same thing as your friends at parties harry said it sort of sounded like a question fine by me ron said tossing the blue shirt back into his trunk now to shower get dressed and hope that hermione wouldntbe wearing anything too nice ron felt suddenly warm hermione was sitting on her bed while ginny sat behind her up on her knees fixing hermione hair she couldntsee what ginny was doing but it felt very complicated her scalp was being pulled back every now and then making her eyes bulge she kept telling herself that there was no reason to be nervous it was just a party with her fellow gryffindors it would be fun right but all hermione could think about was the yule ball how ron had ignored her most of the night and scowled at her the rest she was sure it was because of viktor at the time of the ball hermione had been sure that ron was sulking because hermione hadnthelped him or harry out by going with one of them and had instead helped a foreigner that she d only just met but now she was beginning to question his motives oh it was just another strange weasleyism that made her want to pull her hair out ow of course there was another weasley doing a good job of that right now ginny hermione asked holding her breath why do you think ron makes such a fuss over my writing to viktor ginny tugs pulls and rapidly moving brush strokes stopped immediately hermione you idiot what had come over her she hadntmeant to ask that ginny was probably suspicious enough since she had awoken to see her brother asleep with hermione hand in his ginny cleared her throat and slowly resumed her brushing and tugging well i suppose it because he cares for your safety yes hermione thought that what ron had said something about worrying that krum would hurt her if they got together so kind of like when he got so upset about you dating michael hermione asked trying her best to sound casual well sort of like that but i also think that ginny paused what hermione wanted to scream well that he really loves you and harry and he can be well possessive he loves me and harry yes of course he does but something about the way ginny said possessive made hermione heart flutter just the very definition of possessive was to desire control over another did ron desire control over her hermione heart skipped a beat no two beats but ginny had also said that ron was that way about harry but hermione thought ron had only been excited for harry when he had dated cho done ginny said scooting off of the bed she stood up in front of hermione and looked her over she smiled broadly come look hermione was then dragged over to the mirror beside lavender bed ginny had pulled her hair way up on top of her head and had smoothed out her bushy curls to form silky brown ringlets all over it did look nice thank you ginny i really like it hermione said sincerely now just one more thing before you change ginny said shuffling through her purse which was hanging around her neck ah here before hermione could protest ginny had grabbed hermione chin with one hand and pulled her face toward her she then began applying some sort of fruity smelling gloss on hermione lips just when hermione thought she was done however ginny had put something on her eyes and cheeks as well fantastic ginny exclaimed excitedly she then glanced down at her watch oh jeepers we ve only got half an hour to change gotta go ginny then all but ran out of the sixth year girl dormitory hermione remained in front of the mirror for a moment ginny had let her borrow a sleeveless brown knit sweater which hermione was already wearing she didntwant to mess up ginny masterpiece atop her head hermione just felt so clueless when it came to well being pretty she would have never worn jeans and small brown heels with this sweater if ginny hadntensured her that it would match heels and jeans hermione shrugged as she quickly finished changing she descended the steps to the common room and smiled as she saw the festive decorations and scattered smiling faces the fourth year girls had volunteered to decorate and had done a nice job in hermione opinion there were gold stars hanging from the ceiling and garland strung around the fireplace and doorways there were already quite a few people mingling about but no harry or ron the music started up suddenly and a few people cheered hermione decided it might be a good idea to put an imperturbable charm on the portrait hole door she was a prefect after all she couldntlet them cause a disturbance so she made her way over to the door and pulling her wand out of her back jeans pocket she quickly said the appropriate incantation good hermione thought now they can be as loud as they want when she turned around to head back into the mix of people however she stopped in her tracks coming down the stairs to the boy dormitories was a group of smiling boys but hermione only saw one hermione was partway hidden behind the corner leading to the portrait hole so she didnthave any misgivings about taking in the astonishing site before her ron tall lean form had taken hermione breath away she couldntstop her eyes from wandering slowly over his body his chest and arms filled out the deep red sweater he had on even better than his quidditch uniform his flaming hair had grown out some since the beginning of term it looked as if he had simply run his hands through it a few times it was messy which hermione realized could apparently be a good thing her gaze traveled down to his thin waist where his dark jeans fit low on his hips were those holes in his jeans were they supposed to be there on his thigh hermione didntreally care if they were supposed to be there or not she was just glad that they were what was she doing it was wrong to stare at his body like this wasntit okay hermione she thought you need to get a grip on yourself she couldnthide back here the entire night gawking she took a couple of deep breaths to try and get her heart rate under control as she began walking toward the doorway to the boy stairwell where ron was standing she realized that harry was beside him ron appeared to be in the middle of telling harry something and he was using his hands to tell the story he really looked spectacular when she was about six or seven feet away he looked up in her direction and his whole body froze except for the rise and fall of his chest his hands had stopped in mid gesture his mouth was partway open and his crystal blue gaze was raking slowly up the entire length of her form it made her mouth go dry and her head feel fuzzy his expression was very odd she d never seen him look at her quite like that before hey hermione harry said brightly hermione willed her eyes off of ron and smiled sweetly at harry hey harry you look nice harry shrugged thanks you too hermione turned to look at ron again who was still in the exact same position staring at her she should say something um you too ron hermione said shoot she knew she was blushing maybe they would just think it was her make up ron started moving his mouth but no words came out he cleared his throat and tried again y you yeah too pardon me he rushed by her and went to a refreshment table set up against one wall he grabbed a cup of water and drank the whole thing in one gulp hermione turned to see what harry was making of ron strange behavior but he wasntpaying attention he was smiling at an approaching redhead ginny was also wearing a sleeveless sweater but hers was a deep green it complimented her red hair very nicely which was falling halfway down her back in a straight shiny sheet hi harry hermione you two look great ginny stated gaily but she was looking at harry where ron harry was looking at ginny with a silly smile on his face as he pointed vaguely toward the refreshment table where ron was gulping down another cup of water ginny barely glanced in his direction before rolling her eyes harry then grabbed ginny wrist hey would you like to play chess he asked somewhat mischievously ginny smiled and nodded hermione would you like to come along ginny asked politely hermione looked from ginny to harry harry was smiling how did ginny do that to him hermione simply smiled and shook her head and then harry and ginny were off to a chess table in the corner hermione was now standing alone by the boy stairwell she was gnawing on her bottom lip and staring at ron who was still across the room leaning over the refreshment table had he always been so well put together what was her problem these thoughts were impure she watched him for a moment longer before remembering his odd behavior had he come down with a fever or was this his reaction to seeing her she d never seen him act that strangely before well maybe a few times before but he had never had a spontaneous case of unquenchable thirst taking a deep breath she decided that she should check on him hermione quickly made her way over to the refreshment table where ron was downing yet another cup of water ron hermione said softly from behind him he jumped and spilt the remaining amount of water down the front of his sweater before turning around quickly to look down at her oh sorry hermione exclaimed quickly grabbing some napkins from the table here let me hermione reached up and put a napkin to the water mark on his chest she was dabbing at it when ron took his hand and placed it over hers to stop her her eyes flew to his and his expression was troubled she could feel his rapid heartbeat under her palm heat immediately rushed through her body making her feel weak kneed hermione a boy voice called from behind her she dropped her hand from ron chest and spun around to see a concerned neville um sorry to interrupt but i think one of the prefects should do something about seamus hermione turned to the middle of the common room where seamus was drinking out of a full bottle of firewhiskey and dancing with two girls at the same time it was disgusting that was definitely not the same type of dancing that had taken place at the yule ball i ll go ron said with his lip twisted in disgust no hermione said handing ron some napkins i can handle this just dry yourself hermione walked determinedly to the middle of the dance area before ron could object if there was one thing hermione could not tolerate it was drunkenness it was just too irresponsible she stood directly in front of seamus and put both hands on her hips suddenly the music seemed deafeningly loud seamus as a prefect i am going to have to confiscate that bottle hermione shouted sternly over the music the two girls with him laughed as they all continued to dance hermione felt like vomiting come on sweetheart jus enjoy de party seamus said playfully his breath smelt strong of liquor and hermione had to fight the urge to hold her nose he was already intoxicated the party had started ten minutes ago he must ve been drinking on this a while before the party hermione thought sickened i am enjoying the party but without that horrid drink hermione replied before reaching for the bottle and grasping it firmly she then wrenched it out of his hands without a backward glance she went straight over to a bin near the girl stairwell and tossed it when she turned around however seamus was approaching her smirking drunkenly she found herself taking a few cautionary steps backward until she bumped into the wall by the girl staircase i dontthink that you re enjoyin the ooley he slurred standing too close for hermione liking she tried to glance around him for ron but she didntsee him anywhere suddenly he put one hand on the wall behind her head and the other came to rest on her hip she gasped as she shoved his hand off of her but his face was disgustingly close to hers now the odor of firewhiskey was so strong she almost choked hey hermione heard ron yell from across the room seamus was leaning in to kiss her gross she was pushing on his face when an arm reached around his throat and pulled him back harshly seamus coughed frantically as ron released him go take a cold shower you bloody drunken bastard ron shouted at the doubled over irishman a few people had stopped to watch the scene but didntseem to be too concerned as they quickly resumed their partying and dancing hermione felt a rush of affection for the man that had caused two boys to double over in pain this term for her yet her voice found a reprimand instead of a thank you ron dontswear are you alright ron said with his brow furrowed in concern ignoring her reprimand he looked very sexy where had that come from maybe she was the one that needed the cold shower instead of seamus hermione could only nod bloody idiot ron said under his breath as he watched seamus staggering off to collapse on a sofa ron hermione began she was about to say dontswear but she changed her mind would you i mean it fine if you dontwant to but i thought maybe she was looking over at the dancing girls and boys in the center of the room what was she thinking what about her rule he needed to make the first move dance ron asked surprised hermione looked up at him his face was adorable when he was surprised you want to dance with me pushing all logic and reasoning aside hermione nodded her head she couldntlook at him now oh he going to say no oh why did i ask suddenly ron warm hand clasped her own she looked up at him and he jerked his head back toward the other dancing partners hermione heart leapt into her throat as ron lead her out into the middle of the room when they reached the middle of the floor he looked down at her and smiled nervously he slowly entwined their fingers of their still clasped hands hermione wanted to faint she felt tingly all over and before she knew it ron had taken her other hand in his ron swallowed hard hermione jane granger was standing one foot from him with both of her delightfully fragile hands in his and she looked absolutely beautiful as soon as he d seen her walking toward him in that sweater that revealed her flawless pale arms and those jeans that revealed her flawless everything else he had lost it surely hermione had noticed him gawking at her like some foul pervert his eyes had taken advantage of her and he had had to distance himself before they did it again but she had asked him to dance well sort of she was going to but had seemed unsure ron looked down at her he guessed they were supposed to be moving around like the other dancers but now that he was in the middle of the dance area looking down at hermione tremendous brown eyes ron couldntseem to move a single muscle why had she wanted to dance with him or more importantly why had he consented he had no idea what to do at least the music was slow ron looked around at the dancers it looked easy each couple was basically just leaning on each other and swaying back and forth most of the guys had their hands on the girls waists sweat began to bead along his forehead easy yeah right in his room with a pillow then it would be easy but with hermione would she let him put his hands on her waist okay you re going to have to do something other than stand here holding her hands although ron would have been content with just doing that for the rest of the night ron looked back down at hermione who was staring down at their hands uh ron began i ve never done this before so where can i put my hands ron could feel his face turning bright red that had come out wrong hermione blushed a lovely shade of pink before moving closer to him and placing his hands gently on her waist i going to die ron thought weakly her waist was so small compared to his long fingered hands which were resting on the tops of her jeans his thumbs could feel the softness of her belly through her sweater and ron was strongly resisting the urge to rub his thumbs around on the thin fabric i ve never danced quite like this either so um where should i put my hands hermione asked her glowing face still a lovely rouge ron couldnthold back his smile ha she could put her hands wherever she wanted but he really shouldntbe thinking things like that well um ron glanced around again at the dancing couples i guess the popular choice is around the neck hermione bit her lower lip and slowly stepped a little closer and reached her hands up to rest on the curve of his collarbone now they were but three inches apart ron could feel her body heat as they started swaying slowly to the music the only embraces he d ever shared with hermione were either hugs of greeting or embraces of comfort but this this was different this was two people intentionally standing close to one another for pleasure so this is a pretty good party i guess ron asked nervously looking around the room were you supposed to talk when you danced it just felt like the thing to do hermione said something in a small voice that ron couldnthear above the music sorry ron asked leaning down so that his ear was an inch from her cheek oh blimey she smells good was that fruit oh i was just saying i would ve enjoyed it more if i werent well dressed quite like this she said again he could feel her breath on his cheek it sent chills down his neck why that he whispered back watching the curls of hair around her ear move with his breath i dontknow i just feel sort of silly ron leaned his head far enough back to look at her head on are you mental oh crap why was he having trouble censoring his words tonight excuse me she asked with an edge to her voice and both eyebrows raised i just meant that um you dont look silly ron said timidly hermione face softened but she didntreally look convinced did she not own a mirror ron removed one hand from her waist to pull gently on one of her silky brown ringlets it bounced slightly after he released it he returned his hand to her waist i like it really ron knew that he was blushing again but for the first time in his life possibly not as much as hermione that meant she liked his compliment right he suddenly wanted to give her another one your sweater it goes with your eyes ya know i mean i like the color ron bit the inside of his cheek hermione grinned at him this time his heart flip flopped thanks yours too well obviously your eyes arentred but i just mean that hermione suddenly started giggling she covered her mouth with one hand and ron couldntcontain a broad smile oh i see here i am trying to tell you that you look pretty and you try to start a row ron said jokingly this made hermione giggle more she was absolutely gorgeous ron swallowed as he looked down at her do you know that you have a freckle right here ron said softly reaching up to hermione face and touching the small brown speck to the side of her left eye with the back of his index finger he let his finger rub softly down her flushed cheek before lowering his hand he thought he heard her gasp slightly careful he told himself he hadntmeant to allow his touch to linger hermione opened her mouth to respond but then hey weasley dean thomas had approached them from the side you mind if i cut in something in ron stomach tightened as he looked at dean stupidly smiling face and he realized that he was squeezing hermione waist ron loosened his grip sorry dean we were discussing something hermione said casually giving dean a polite smile oh no problem no problem at all dean said cheerfully turning to leave he suddenly stopped and turned back around oh by the way weasley you do realize that you two are snailing along for this beat ron was puzzled for a moment before he realized that dean was right the music had changed and it was now fast paced he looked around to see everyone around them dancing in beat to the cheerful song dean chuckled as he walked off ron was a bit embarrassed but he looked down to see hermione smiling up at him he then remembered that she had just refused dean thomas request his heart did two somersaults and a back flip so you were enjoying our discussion on freckles were you ron asked hermione trying to hold back a smile hermione laughed a little but then a more serious look overtook her face actually i was just enjoying dancing with you ron suddenly had a fit of coughs come over him and he had to cover his mouth with one hand and turn his head are you alright hermione asked worriedly ron managed to shake his head yes before his coughing fit stopped as suddenly as it had begun he looked around to make sure that he was in fact in the gryffindor common room and not in some sort of alternate universe well ron thought this didntappear to be a dream but by the way some of his fellow students were dancing with one another it didntlook like anything he d ever seen either uh hermione you dontwant to do that do you ron asked nervously indicating to the dancers with a jerk of his head he and hermione were still slow dancing to the upbeat music hermione eyes got wide and her jaw dropped as she looked around ron shoulder gracious no hermione exclaimed before grabbing ron wrist and dragging him from the dance area she dragged him all the way to the refreshment table where she then turned and watched the dancers in shock suddenly she grabbed his shoulder and pulled him down to whisper harshly in his ear as she used her other hand to point out into the dancing crowd is that harry and ginny ron almost laughed out loud as he followed hermione pointed finger yeah he whispered back yeah it is harry and ginny were circling the entire floor of dancers performing some sort of silly dance ron had never seen before it wasnt scandalous like the other dancers it was just silly they seemed to be laughing hysterically as they basically skipped sideways around the room holding hands that was the first time ron had seen harry laugh like that in years he looked down at hermione who was smiling brightly at them um do you want to do that ron asked tentatively hermione looked up at him and to ron surprise burst out laughing no she managed to squeak out let go upstairs for a moment though it hotter than a boiling cauldron in here ron wholeheartedly agreed but at the same time he was a bit weary of being alone with hermione he wasntgoing to be able to just act friendly toward her after all that on the dance floor was he before he could dwell on this thought he found himself being dragged off toward the boy staircase as soon as they entered the dormitory ron realized just how hot it had been in the common room the cool air felt good on his face hermione had gone straight to the window in between ron and harry beds she was attempting to pull up the heavy metal lock to open it but she seemed to be having some difficulty ron knew he should probably help her but she looked so cute trying with all her might to unlatch it why didn t she just use alohomora oh well ron thought this is cuter as he stood by his bed watching her he had the sudden urge to pinch himself this night that he had been severely dreading was turning into one of the best nights of his life he d danced with hermione and she had enjoyed it blimey she had suggested it and if ron wasntmistaken they had even flirted some ron didntthink he even knew how to flirt wasntit some sort of art that you had to practice at it had just come so naturally with hermione oh sure he crosses the line sometimes but i always set him right the words just came out of nowhere taking ron slightly by surprise and he suddenly realized something his hands had been on hermione waist they had flirted with each other and she hadntwanted to stop dancing with him for another guy ron heart began to accelerate exactly where did hermione draw the line with him open darn it hermione was pulling hard on the window latch she had gotten way overheated downstairs and she didntreally think it was caused from the crowd she thought it probably had more to do with one individual she could still hear the booming music below but it was slightly muffled it seemed like a dream that moments ago she had been down in the common room dancing with ron oh it had been marvelous her hands had been resting on his strong shoulders and neck his hands had been on her waist and hermione thought with a small smile his hands had tightened around her when dean thomas had asked to cut in was that a sign of the possessiveness that ginny had referred to earlier hermione suddenly realized something she had told herself that she would wait for ron to make the first move had he made that move she felt like she might wake up at any moment and this would all be a dream a wonderful dream hermione ron asked suddenly from over by his bed she stopped fiddling with the lock to turn around and see him approaching her before she could stop herself she had raked her eyes over his body as she had when she d first seen him coming down the stairs there was something sultry about his walk she noticed as he came to stand by her at the window yes she asked in a whisper as she turned her head up to his blue irises he was smiling as if he knew something she didn t suddenly he extended one hand to her waist and his fingertips brushed around her side to her back hermione took a sharp intake of breath oh my goodness oh my goodness oh my goodness she then felt his fingertips lift off of her back and her wand being pulled from her back pocket he held it out to her still smiling do you think that lock might open a bit easier with this he said teasingly she took the wand from him releasing a small shaky breath oh yeah hermione thought why didnti think of that she chuckled a little before turning back to the window her hands trembling slightly alohomora the latch opened with a soft creak hermione then pushed open the window to let in a cold rush of air the frigid air mixed with her nervousness made her whole body tremble slightly there was a heavy snow falling outside and it seemed to be covering the ground in thick layers hermione leaned onto the window seal to peer down at the frozen lake it was shining in the moonlight some snow had been on the ledge though and now her hands were wet and icy chills erupted all down her bare arms she suddenly had an idea whether or not ron had intentionally flirted with her downstairs he had and hermione didntwant to stop not yet what if she woke up the next morning and this was just a dream she needed to make the best of tonight so she turned around with her back against the cold stone under the window ron was very close because he had apparently been looking out of the open window as well he smiled down at her and started to take a step back hermione quickly reached behind her and grabbed a handful of snow off of the ledge and before she could talk herself out of it she reached up and dropped it down the front of ron sweater he jumped backward with his mouth wide open and looked at her with amused disbelief she burst out laughing as he shook his sweater to allow what snow hadntalready melted against his chest to fall onto the floor he sprung toward the window and hermione let out a yell as she ran to the other side of the room ron took a handful of snow from the ledge and started slowly making his way toward her she suddenly couldntstop giggling she was positively giddy i not sure i quite see the humor in you freezing me to death but then again ron suddenly lunged for her and she let out a shrill scream she attempted to run around him but he caught her one armed around the waist with his other hand he poured his snow down her back under her sweater chills washed over her and it temporarily took her breath away hermione then felt herself being lifted off of the ground as ron other arm encircled her waist from behind he began carrying her toward the window despite her kicking and giggling ron what are you doing she managed between giggles once ron stopped in front of the window he was holding her back against his chest with his arms still tightly circling her waist but he allowed her feet to touch ground their bodies were flush together and heat was radiating off of him hermione was resisting the urge to lean her head back against his chest something about the fact that she wouldnthave been able to break free from his strong hold no matter how hard she tried sent a warm wave throughout her body hmm i wonder if you would survive a trip out this window there plenty of snow down there surely it would break your fall don tcha think he said in a mock serious tone she could feel his chest vibrating as he spoke a reply wouldntform in her throat she thought she might faint well let just try it shall we he said ron released her just long enough to spin her around by her shoulders to face him his hands gripped her waist and hoisted her up to sit on the inside ledge of the window she could feel the cold air on her back through her sweater and she turned to see how close the snow was to her bottom ron i serious if you push me back any farther i going to sit in this snow she said sternly he shrugged at her with an expression that said so hermione pursed her lips and grabbed some snow from behind her feeling a bit more daring than earlier she rubbed it all along the side of his neck his shoulders hunched up around his neck squeezing her hand and he laughed out loud okay okay smiling he gripped her around the waist again and began to pull her down hermione placed her hands on his biceps as he lowered her down to solid ground she was smiling as well but once she was back on the ground their gazes locked with his hands still around her waist and hers on his arms ron smile slowly began to fade into that familiar stony expression that hermione remembered from the hospital he had wanted to kiss her that day just as he wanted to now hermione smile was now gone as well as she began to feel dizzy ron began slowly lowering his face down to hers hermione breath caught in her throat and her heart was beating painfully in her chest ron was breathing heavily as he continued to lower his face to hers until the sides of their noses were touching i like that smell he said huskily with every word hermione felt warm breath on her lips w what smell hermione was barely able to whisper if she leaned her head back even slightly her mouth would be on his she suddenly closed her eyes tightly as she had that day in the hospital it smells fruity he said more quiet now hermione opened her eyes to see him moisten his lips with his tongue i going to collapse right here in the floor hermione thought her hands tightened around his bicep for support and she felt it flex it m my lips i mean my lip gloss lip gloss he whispered hermione thought she felt his hands tighten around her waist mm hmm she managed weakly so harry you say that you saw ron and hermione walking up the stairs earlier it was ginny voice coming from outside in the stairwell and for some reason she was shouting ron pulled away from her with a frustrated sigh and quickly sat down on his bed looking toward the door expectantly he was nervously wringing his hands hermione leaned heavily against the wall to keep from falling out in the floor she tried to look as if she had just been carrying on a casual conversation with ron glancing at him she hoped that she wasntas red as he was why are you shouting harry voice asked as the door came swinging open ginny and harry emerged in the doorway hey guys harry said cheerily before his face fell slightly hey you two alright great gads you two have it freezing in here ginny said loudly disregarding harry question she hurried over to the window and closed it shut with a loud bang she leaned against the wall beside hermione but she was staring at ron with a strange smile ron was avoiding her eye is the party over ron asked harry quickly hermione could tell the casual tone in his voice was forced pretty much the only people down there now are either playing exploding snap or talking around the fire harry said taking a seat on his bed he was looking from ron to hermione with a slightly worried expression hermione was sure that he guessed that they had been rowing maybe their flushed faces were a good thing what would harry reaction be if he knew that his two best friends had been flirting all night and had just been about to kiss it was too awkward to even think about guess what ginny said excitedly she then went into a long dramatized story of how peeves the poltergeist had come into the common room and had started taking down all the garland and gold stars he had apparently begun draping the students in the garland and throwing the gold stars at their heads hermione didntget to hear the part about how they finally got peeves to leave however she was too busy remembering the feeling she had had in her stomach when ron was contemplating whether or not to kiss her are you alright hermione ginny asked suddenly apparently her story was finished you look ginny glanced briefly over at her brother flushed oh no i fine just tired really hermione swallowed and pushed herself off the wall did ginny know harry looked clueless but ginny not so much i guess i about to turn in hermione said ginny nodded in agreement well goodnight you two harry said happily ron suddenly stood up as hermione and ginny started for the door wait ron said urgently where seamus i dontwant you two walking back alone if the door suddenly swung open interrupting him as hermione heart fluttered at ron constant concern for her yo ho yo ho and a and a wha affer that seamus finnigan was being carried in by dean and neville neville looked almost frightened and had seamus by the ankles dean had his arms up under seamus arms but dean looked amused to hermione disgust seamus had one hand clasped tightly around an empty bottle of firewhiskey he must have retrieved it from the bin she knew she should ve vanished it and a pirate life for you mate dean said as he and neville tossed seamus onto his bed dean took the bottle from his hand and put it in a bin at his bedside seamus started chuckling a little before he hiccupped and then surprisingly began snoring loudly everyone started laughing then except hermione noticed ron he was scowling at seamus sleeping form well then i guess we can go now ginny said still giggling a little hermione noticed dean suddenly look sadly at ginny she knew that they had had something going on when school ended last term apparently though it had ended before the summer was up all the guys said goodnight to ginny and hermione as they headed for the doorway hermione turned around to look back at ron still sitting on his bed he was watching her his eyes were shining and his lips slowly curved up into a meaningful yet timid smile it was a look that said we almost kissed and you know it hermione grinned at him and her heart turned over as she turned to exit she began thinking if this is a dream i going to try my hardest not to wake up author note yay i told you it was juicy some of you are probably wanting to wring my neck

ginny in the common room they were packed and ready to travel to london on the hogwarts express to meet mr weasley at the train station they hurried to join the crowd of homesick homeward bound students in front of the carriages ron thought the students excitement seemed almost tangible amid the cold december air some were even singing carols one thing ron did not find tangible however was the concept of hermione granger being attracted to him ron could not understand he could not grasp it nor could he grasp how he and hermione were somehow managing to act more normally around each other than they had since the beginning of term it was baffling to ron because just last night they had been embracing one another hermione lips had been right there her beauty last night added to her flirtations had bolstered a new confidence in him hermione would have let him kiss her last night she had wanted it and bloody hell had he wanted it too he d never had a desire that strong before but here they all were talking and laughing as if last night hadntbeen the most amazing experience of ron life harry and ginny had started carrying on playful banter whenever they were around one another and the carriage ride was proving to be no exception they were both so witty and carefree when they were together that their happy demeanor seemed to infect everyone around them ron would add his bit of dry humor to harry and ginny and hermione would laugh overnight they had gone back to their old selves hermione was just his best friend again that thought scared ron a little but only a little because there was one thing different h er eyes his eyes whenever they made eye contact whether they were talking or laughing at something harry or ginny said their gazes seemed to hold just a bit longer than before they werentawkward either not like they had been all term it was as if hermione eyes were saying i remember last night wasnta dream i remember it too when the carriage ride was over they were able to find a compartment with luna and neville on the train luna was sucking on a peppermint stick while reading the quibbler neville was sitting quietly across from her with his mimbulus mimbletonia in his lap neville face seemed to light up a bit at the sight of the four of them entering the compartment hey neville said smiling ron and harry sat next to him while the girl sat on either side of luna hey neville said harry brightly you spending christmas with your grandmother neville smile seemed to falter a bit before he nodded ron was about to comment on neville plant which seemed to have grown twice in size since the beginning of term when luna suddenly gasped everyone turned to her but she was still just reading her father magazine alright luna asked ginny luna looked up from the magazine slowly her huge eyes peeking over the top oh hello she said serenely now placing the magazine in her lap i didntsee you come in ron wondered what it was like to be on the receiving end of five faces desperately trying not to smile or laugh at you actually he knew what it was like he remembered the slytherin version of weasley is our king too well luckily no one laughed and it didntseem as though luna had noticed anything luna then handed her magazine to ginny i was just reading the article on page nine about the unknown weakness of all death eaters luna shook her head slowly staring out of the compartment window it says that they have a strong affinity for gouda cheese ron snorted into his fist at the same time that hermione cleared her throat and shuffled in her seat well um hermione began so ginny ron do you two know who will be joining us at the burrow oh just the weasley clan ginny said quickly taking hermione bait to change topics possibly some order members what about percy harry asked tentatively ron had forgotten that harry and hermione still hadntheard the latest on his older brother ginny rolled her eyes oh yes merciful percival that what fred and george have dubbed him anyway he has graciously extended his hand in apology to mum and dad ginny had stressed the word apology and made quotations with her fingers in the air so what kind of apology did he offer your parents exactly harry said smiling and mimicking ginny hand signal ron scoffed oh i think it went something like mum dad i realize that we at the ministry have incorrectly assessed the situation with you know who ron furrowed his brow trying to remember the rest of his brother lame excuse for an apology when ginny took over she stood up in the middle of the compartment and lifted her head regally in an amazingly correct impersonation of percy and we graciously accept the wizarding community forgiveness for our mistake ginny turned to face harry as she bowed and extended her hand please accept my confession of fallibility ginny was speaking in an exaggerated pompous nature everyone in the compartment laughed at her show except for luna who was holding her peppermint stick up to the light and twisting her head to one side as she examined it harry then took ginny hand and to ron surprise brought it to his mouth for a light kiss ron glanced at hermione who was wearing a fairly shocked expression when she caught his eye however her cheeks turned a bit red and she quickly returned her eyes to harry and ginny ron covered his wide grin with his hand i assume they accepted harry asked her casually as if he hadntjust kissed her hand ron noticed ginny expression freeze for a moment as if she had temporarily forgotten what they were talking about before quickly regaining her composure and returning to her seat across from harry she grinned at him they did she said lightly we all said that we did but i think mum and dad are the only ones that really meant it dad was on the brink of tears mum on the brink of waterworks well can you really call what fred and george did an acceptation of percy apology ron had used the same quotation symbol as harry and ginny without really thinking about it it was just impossible to really call what percy did an apology no i suppose not ginny said smiling what did they do hermione asked with big eyes ron and ginny both chuckled a little well they generously offered him a box of chocolates from weasley wizarding wheezes as a sign of their gratitude ron said smiling ginny leaned forward a bit in her seat as she finished the story let just say that percy was so relieved that the twins had accepted his apology again ginny did the hand quotes that he actually broke out in hives became very friendly with the bathroom and lost a few clumps of hair ginny said trying not to laugh hermione hand flew to her mouth harry and even neville burst out laughing while luna looked around the compartment looking a bit confused i have never heard of someone reacting to an apology with those symptoms luna said dreamily he was most probably bitten by a tri horned skitamarink when the train had arrived at platform 9 the four quickly spotted mr weasley standing alone by the fireplaces there were probably twenty fireplaces set up along one wall of the station for people using the floo network they quickly said their goodbyes and happy christmas s to neville and luna before making their way to ron dad hermione noticed that there was a red haired woman standing beside mr weasley that was definatelynot mrs weasley the lady hair was not the shade of any of the weasley actually it was a vibrant shocking red as they neared hermione recognized the owner of the outrageous do to be the young auror nymphadora tonks dad ginny cried surpassing them all and giving mr weasley a loving hug hello kids mr weasley bellowed giving ron a fatherly pat on the back harry hermione i glad you two will be joining us thank you for having us sir harry said politely yes thank you mr weasley hermione chimed in she noticed some lines around mr weasley eyes that she hadntremembered being there the last time she d seen him tonks looked about the same since hermione had seen her at the department of mysteries other than her hair color and the appearance of losing a few pounds hermione thought that she was a little too thin and guessed that all of the order members and aurors must really be putting in the hours tonks harry exclaimed shaking her hand what are you doing here tonks smiled almost apologetically at harry before saying well in truth harry the auror office felt it a good idea for someone to watch over you this christmas harry face fell slightly and tonks quickly added dontworry though i not going to be nipping at your heels or anything hermione stomach twisted painfully the ministry had sent tonks to guard harry at the burrow hermione looked around to see that ginny had gone slightly pale and her brother was gnawing on his bottom lip she knew that they all believed in the prophecy voldemort included which was the whole reason that harry lived in a constant state of danger hermione felt a mixture of anger and fear mr weasley must have felt the tension among everyone for he quickly shouted for everyone to line up for the journey they all headed to an open fireplace and one by one they stepped inside with a handful of floo powder to say the burrow and one by one they found themselves inside of the weasley kitchen when hermione entered she immediately heard the bustle of ron family preparing for the night feast and smelled the aroma of baking pies ron family may not have had much money but mrs weasley always made sure they were well fed as soon as they had all exited the fireplace the chaotic greetings began oh my dears cried mrs weasley excitedly come in come in she then crossed over to them and gave them each a hug and kiss then entered fred and george from the living area singing happily and dancing around the kitchen table hermione wasntsure but she thought she heard the lyrics jingle bells ronald smells harry laid an egg hermione smiled broadly her fear and anger over the prophecy slowly ebbing away in the cheerful atmosphere percy was helping his father set the table with a somewhat annoyed expression directed toward fred and george hermione noticed that percy hair was cut extraordinarily short mrs weasley went back to the stove to finish cooking bill and charlie descended the stairs to offer their greetings to everyone before levitating the newly arrived luggage up the stairs as hermione watched the luggage float upward she heard a new stanza in the twin ballad silent night percy bites she then heard a plate clatter and turned to see a very red faced percy leaving the room ginny was then summoned by her mother to help with the meal while ron led her and harry upstairs to unpack hermione would be sharing a room with ginny and tonks while harry would be with ron as they reached ginny room charlie was just leaving hermione i have put your trunk by the extra bed in ginny room i conjured the bed myself sorry about the dragon print sheets charlie said smiling before descending the stairs behind her hermione turned to ron who was about to ascend the stairs behind harry up to ron room ron hermione asked stopping harry and ron in their tracks ron looked at her and hermione thought she saw his eyes linger on her mouth before they made it to her own eyes her stomach fluttered madly um i was just wondering if your mum would mind my letting crookshanks out of his cage during the meal he doesntjump on tables or anything hmm ron began how does crookshanks feel about incredibly tiny owls hermione squinted her eyes at him as long as pig isnta death eater in disguise i dontthink we ll have a problem well alright then he said grinning turning to follow harry back up he stairs hermione definitely saw his eyes dart down to her lips before he left her heart pounding in ginny doorway hermione ginny said just coming up the stairs hermione turned around to see a slyly smiling ginny staring at her with her arms crossed i think you and i should have a little girl talk hermione felt her cheeks go red before she was ushered into ginny room where the door was then closed and locked when harry and ron reached ron room they opened the window to let hedwig and pig outside for some fresh air ron didntrealize he was still smiling stupidly from his brief flirt with hermione in the hallway until he saw his reflection in the windowpane he quickly changed his expression to casual so ron have you actually warmed up to crookshanks harry asked curiously oh uh well you know um why ron stammered he was taken a bit off guard by this question harry just shrugged i dontknow i was kind of expecting you and hermione to row a bit before she convinced you to let her free crookshanks oh well ron felt his ears get hot well you know i forgave him for being mean to scabbers seeing as how now i wish he would of eaten the damn rodent this was actually true and ron was glad when harry suddenly seemed too distracted by something to finish the interrogation of ron behavior toward hermione what this harry asked ron as he reached for a bundled green plant hanging in ron doorway donttouch that ron yelled harry looked confused for a moment but stopped with his hand a few inches from the plant that wizard mistletoe touch that and you ll be forced to kiss the next person you see and sorry mate but i d rather not lose my appetite ron said smiling as harry laughed loudly who had hung that in the doorway ron briefly wondered two identical laughing faces seemed to be looming in ron mind he and harry hid out in his room conversing about the ministry decision to send an auror to guard harry over the holiday they both wondered if they had hard evidence to believe that harry could be in danger over the holiday or if tonk appointment was merely precautionary soon however mrs weasley voice and a lovely aroma traveled up to them calling them down for dinner the christmas dinner was magnificent there was turkey dressing cranberry sauce all sorts of vegetables from the garden pumpkin pie puddings and even some sort of licorice from fred and george shop that caused green and red bubbles to come out of your ears everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves and even after everyone had finished eating they remained seated talking and laughing for at least an hour at one point bill and arthur had begun talking about a massive thirty car pileup that seemed to point toward the work of death eaters but their conversation was quickly crushed by a warning look from molly while everyone attention was briefly distracted to the tension at ron parents end of the table ron was able to share a glance with hermione his face had turned bright red however when he noticed ginny nudge hermione in the side and whisper something hermione face had become rather pink too ron curiosity was heightened had hermione said something to ginny earlier had ginny said something to hermione ron stomach clenched in worry ginny knew how ron felt toward hermione she knew that it went much deeper than physical attraction but ron didntknow what hermione truly felt for him of course it had now become wonderfully obvious that the urge to kiss was mutual but as far as ron knew that as far as it went for hermione ron decided that he needed to take ginny aside and make her promise to keep her mouth shut if she hadntalready spilt the every flavored beans after everyone had pitched in for the cleanup he harry hermione and ginny decided to go outside in the snow for a bit before retreating to bed ron was able to pull ginny aside long enough to give her his warning luckily harry and hermione didntnotice and continued out the back door listen ron whispered urgently what did you say to hermione ginny smiled mischievously oh you know we just had a nice little chat ron glared at her ginny i not joking around ron said harshly did you tell her anything ginny rolled her eyes and her smile faded she grabbed a coat off of the wall pegs and began jerking it on irritably no i just asked her if there were anything she would like to share with me she the one that did all the talking ginny glanced out the window they re waiting on us wait ron yelled as ginny reached for the back door he grabbed her by the back of her jacket and pulled her backward what did she say i should just make you ask her like a grown man would do ginny sighed heavily but since i so loving and kind she told me that you had been about a centimeter away from kissing her when harry and i interrupted i asked her if she were glad that we barged in and her face turned about the color of our hair before she told me that she had wanted to wring mine and harry necks ron couldntsuppress a grin which seemed to soften ginny a bit but he then remembered the main reason why he d taken her aside in the first place ginny listen do not tell her how i feel ginny dontroll your eyes at me listen as far as i know hermione is just attracted to me i dontwant to scare her off or anything okay ginny began tapping her foot violently and biting the inside of her cheek before saying grudgingly fine she then turned on her heel and wrenched the back door open muttering something about idiotic boys and blind ron followed behind her after pulling on his own coat and scarf the night air was cool and crisp and there were a few flurries falling to the already snow covered ground the moon stars and the glow from the kitchen windows were the only sources of light harry hermione and ginny were all seated on the picnic table with tonks who must ve followed after harry ron turned his face up to admire the night sky and wait for his agitation at ginny reaction to his request to subside when something cold and wet hit him across the back of his neck he whirled around to see a very guilty looking harry now standing up pointing unconvincingly at ginny who was gaping at harry in mock disbelief and sitting angelically upon the picnic table ron bent down quickly to form his own snowball but before he rose with his ammunition he was hit twice more in the rear this time the culprits appeared to be two girls now standing beside harry doubled over in laughter neither of which were tonks who was still sitting atop the table laughing along with the other three all of a sudden a full blown snow battle began snowballs were bursting all over the yard tonks actually jumped from the table overturned it and used it as a fort to hide behind while the younger four ran about the yard yelling ron managed to get ginny on the back of the leg and harry on the top of the head but hermione was a little too quick she managed to duck out of three perfectly formed snowballs thrown consecutively ron noticed ginny smash a snowball right in harry face which caused her to burst into a laughing fit ginny giggles forced her to suspend her fire so she instead fell to the ground and began making a snow angel harry then went to reload behind the overturned picnic table and ron had completely lost sight of hermione he bent down to form a couple of war worthy snowballs when a small pair of hands pulled the hood of his coat up over his head and pushed him down into the snow he jerked off his hood and looked around to see the tail of a blue scarf retreat behind the shed smiling ron quietly headed around the backside of the shed sidling around the back corner he saw hermione shadow on the ground she was completely oblivious to his presence silently ron crept around the corner before grabbing hermione around the waist wah hermione let out a shrill scream as ron hoisted her over his shoulder ron put me down she cried through a rush of giggles i dontlike heights put me down now ignoring her pleas for mercy ron spun around in a couple of circles causing hermione to gasp and slap him on the back hey physical abuse wontget you anywhere ron said trying hard not to laugh hermione giggled more as she continued to slap him her body was so warm her laugh was so delightful if it werentfor the fact that tonks had positioned herself near the back door of the house so that she could see all four teenagers ron would have found this an entirely fitting time to kiss hermione but instead ron carried her over to ginny and harry who were now making a four foot tall somewhat lopsided snow castle they had apparently grown bored of their earlier endeavors oi there kind sir and lady ron shouted merrily in a dramatic medieval voice over hermione continuing giggles i have found a prisoner for thy dungeon oh yes harry shouted back in the same dramatic tone we have reserved a cell for just such an occasion yes but mind you it may be a wee bit cold and damp ginny exclaimed through snickers ron dontyou even hermione unfinished plea was futile as ron dumped her into the turreted mountain of snow hermione last scream before being thrown down unceremoniously caused the other three to fall into the snow laughing along with her ron caught hermione eye as they sat doubled over in the snow and the sight of her laughing in the moonlight almost took his breath away how had he been around this fascinating creature nearly every day for six years without seeing her he d had urges toward her for a long time and he d loved her for longer but this feeling that he had right now the same one he d had in the hospital and last night in the boy dormitory at hogwarts it was stronger and greater than any feeling he d ever had harry was the first to recover and stand up from the snow he reached down a helpful hand to ginny and pulled her up ron noticed with a smile that harry didntrelease his sister hands after pulling her up harry would you help me set the picnic table back up ginny asked they then crossed the yard together hand in hand leaving ron and hermione alone in the snow ron heaved himself up and held out his hands for hermione who was eyeing him cautiously i not sure if i should trust you she said with a sly smile me neither ron replied chuckling hermione laughed at this as well throwing a handful of snow up at him as they looked at each other however their laughter quickly subsided until their eyes began carrying on their own conversation ron didntreally understand why her brown eyes captivated him but gazing at her was one of the best feelings in the world hermione took ron still outstretched hands their gazes remaining locked and he felt that familiar flutter deep in his stomach ron pulled her up so that their faces were a mere five inches apart and their hands were still clasped together let go ron told himself harry and ginny are less than twenty feet away but he couldntlet go and she wasntletting go either just then however the back door opened shining the bright light of the kitchen onto ron and hermione he quickly dropped her hands and took a step back muttering under his breath damn you ve got to be kidding me ron hermione whispered harshly but she was obviously holding back a smile she then mouthed dontswear and crossed her arms tightly over her chest he winked at her before turning toward the open door he had taken note of how hermione face flushed the other times he d winked at her now that he knew it wasntbecauseit made her feeluncomfortable he quite enjoyed the effect it had on her however he couldnttell who was standing silhouetted in the doorway hi ron hermione happy christmas lupin shouted merrily professor lupin hermione shouted back ron and hermione headed over to greet their old defense against the dark arts teacher ron could now make out lupin broadly smiling face and a large box tucked under his right arm ron mother had come outside as well remus has stopped by isntthat nice ron you and the others come on inside and visit a spell mrs weasley called out ron glanced around for the others and noticed that harry and ginny were sitting fairly close together on top of the picnic table had they ever sat that close before ron thought smiling he liked that his baby sister was spending so much time with his best friend it had actually always been a secret wish of his that harry could one day be his brother lupin appeared to have noticed harry and ginny too for he was staring at them from where he stood however the smile had vanished from his face and his mouth was gaping open the package he was holding fell with a soft thud to the ground remus mrs weasley asked worriedly looking up at lupin wide eyed face what the matter dear lupin let out a shaky sigh and took a big swallow sorry molly he said bending down to pick up the package i when i saw harry and is that ginny yes of course it is i just it was like i mean i almost believed that i saw lupin closed his eyes for a second before opening them and continuing in a somewhat shaky voice let just say it brought back some memories lupin finished awkwardly molly cleared her throat and clapped her hands together to break the uncomfortable silence that had followed lupin words everyone inside now you ll catch your death of cold if you stay out any longer ron glanced up into the night sky to see the shining quarter moon before exchanging a concerned look with hermione by the look on her face she knew that lupin behavior had had absolutely nothing to do with the moon without speaking they all hurried inside the warm house author note okay those of you that are getting really antsy for

this one chapter 18 the living area was a flurry of christmas cheer only percy and charlie had retired for the night everyone else was gathered around the den as the fire cast a warm glow on their happy faces hermione thought that holidays at the burrow must always be incredible it touched something in her heart when she looked around at the purely contented weasley family enjoying one another company as soon as they had come in from the snow lupin had asked to speak to harry alone in the kitchen to give him the package he had brought quietly mrs weasley asked the others to give harry and lupin some privacy apparently the contents of the box were the remains of sirius belongings hermione had had to swallow a lump in her throat at the mention of sirius name she knew that harry must be so depressed he never talked about sirius which only proved to hermione how much he missed him however the living area was anything but depressing mr and mrs weasley were listening to fred and george talk enthusiastically about new ideas for candy and joke items mr weasley seemed impressed and offered a few suggestions himself although mrs weasley kept glancing nervously toward the kitchen she was smiling contentedly at her twin boys she must finally be accepting their chosen profession hermione thought as well she should it sounded to hermione like the twins were really doing well at their shop hermione ginny and tonks were watching an intense chess match between ron and his eldest brother bill from a nearby sofa ron talent at wizard chess never ceased to amaze her and when he was concentrating on his next move he would always get a stern look on his face which hermione found to be very attractive after ron successfully cornered bill into checkmate bill decided it was time for him to turn in ginny groaned in disappointment but bill claimed that he was getting old and would still be at the burrow for the remainder of the week before long mr and mrs weasley and ginny had also gone off to bed leaving hermione ron fred george and tonks alone in the living room as soon as mrs weasley had left the room fred and george went off to a corner where they began whispering ron then joined hermione and tonks on the couch it wasnta large couch and hermione knew that he had sat closer to her than was actually necessary it gave hermione butterflies deep in her stomach as she remembered ron angry exclamation at their third interrupted attempt at kissing i hope harry alright hermione said worriedly as she broke out of her reverie she truly hoped that lupin well intentioned gift wouldntput a damper on harry christmas yeah me too ron agreed glumly i think he ll be fine tonks said with a yawn hermione noticed her hair turn a bit lighter as she stretched but then it was back to being that vibrant cherry red so do you know what sirius left him ron asked tonks curiously tonks shrugged before standing from the couch not really but my guess is everything he owned tonks yawned once more well i guess i ll hit the hay happy christmas hermione and ron returned her holiday greeting as she left the room hermione could now feel ron looking at her but she continued to stare into the fire because she could also feel the gazes of fred and george who suddenly broke their huddle in the corner and meandered their way over to squeeze in on either side of ron and hermione on the couch hermione thought that george who was seated beside her seemed to be pushing her closer and closer to ron as he settled into the cushions fred appeared to be copying this act on ron which resulted in her and ron being pressed almost painfully close together oh hermione and our dear dear ronaldo fred began playfully you may have seen george and i talking in our conference corner what are you going to do to me ron asked in a slightly bored voice hermione bit into her cheeks to prevent a giggle george clutched at his chest and gasped in mock exasperation fred i think our young brother has begun to lack trust in us no it not that i ve never trusted you ron stated plainly hermione couldntcontain a small chuckle and hermione simply laughs at this travesty fred exclaimed tut tut and all we wanted was some help testing our latest development throw and glow taffy george exclaimed proudly taking two small red taffies from his shirt pocket fred and george stood up from the couch let us illustrate fred said happily he and george then stood up and went to either ends of the den george stood near the fireplace with his feet shoulder width apart and his mouth wide open fred moved to stand behind the couch and began unwrapping a piece of the taffy as soon as the wrapper was off fred pulled his arm back and threw the candy toward george the taffy immediately began to glow in different shades of red green and gold before george caught it in his mouth as george began chewing the ends of his red hair began to glow an even brighter shade of red then green and then gold before finally turning back to its original shade that must have taken a fairly complicated enchantment said hermione genuinely impressed well thank you for noticing we are quite proud of it ourselves fred said delightedly ron wontyou try one we just want to make sure it has the same effect on everyone ron raised one eyebrow in suspicion uh i dunno oh go on ron what the worst that could happen hermione encouraged ron turned to her and grinned hesitantly fine hand it over ron said reaching out his hand throw and glow ron they only glow if they re thrown honestly stand over by the hearth fred said as george joined him behind the couch ron reluctantly left his seat to go stand by the hearth once he d left hermione thought she heard george mutter careful she began to wonder if she had just gotten ron into trouble if this is some sort of prank i ll strangle both of you ron said harshly oh come now ron we never prank on christmas eve replied fred absently ron rolled his eyes doubtfully hermione turned around to see fred putting on a thick leather glove as she turned back around to look at ron contemplating whether or not to advise him to bail on the experiment something came flying over the back of her head and she heard fred and george quickly duck behind the couch ron keeper instincts reacted swiftly to the bundle flying his way and he caught it in both hands he had a look of embarrassment and shock on his face as he held what looked to hermione like a small green plant hermione didntunderstand ron expression it was just a plant but suddenly and without warning hermione felt herself being lifted from the couch she let out a scream as she slowly began ascending into the air along with ron fred george you re both dead ron shouted as he and hermione began floating toward one another hermione was completely mystified ron looked at her apologetically what is that thing hermione said pointing frantically to the plant still held in ron hand one large silver bubble had just appeared around her and ron in mid air and they were only a few feet apart floating gracefully this was one of the strangest feelings hermione had ever felt it reminded her of the previous year when she had ridden on the back of a thestral which she hadntbeen able to see except this time there was nothing underneath her just air i knew i shouldnthave trusted you weasels ron yelled down at his brothers fred and george had come out from behind the sofa clutching their sides as they laughed uncontrollably the commotion must have reached harry and lupin as they had both emerged from the kitchen looking puzzled tonks entered as well dressed in bright magenta pajamas hermione guessed her auror instincts had detected the loud racket from upstairs mistletoe lupin cried as his face broke into a wide smile harry mouth fell open tonks grinned now hermione understood why fred needed the glove hermione hid her face in her hands of course she remembered reading about wizard mistletoe in holiday high jinx hermione uncovered her face and looked at ron as they drew closer she noticed that his face ears and neck were a deep shade of red kiss her you idiot george yelled from down below yeah the longer you wait the smaller the bubble gets fred shouted the bubble was in fact shrinking quickly hermione glanced down at the spectators below they were all smiling except for harry who looked as if he werentsure whether he should look at them or not the bubble was now just big enough for the two of them and hermione had to turn her head to prevent her nose from being smashed on ron chest i sorry my brothers are complete morons ron murmured low in hermione ear it sent shivers down her body but if we don t you know this bubble might on the mouth it has to be on the mouth or it doesntcount fred shouted interrupting ron hermione stifled a giggle and looked up at ron who was merely smiling and shaking his head there was now loud jeering and whooping coming from the crowd below or of course you could let it burst and you ll only fall twelve feet to the ground george hollered threateningly ron rolled his eyes at his brothers before looking back down at hermione this thing really will burst but i can just kiss you on the cheek he whispered down at her before adding huskily i dontreally fancy an audience do you hermione blushed scarlet and shook her head no smiling up at his shining blue eyes i dontsuppose we could coax them into leaving hermione whispered she immediately bit her bottom lip that was a little bold of her but she couldntstop herself ron mouth fell open slightly before he grinned and shook his head he was too adorable lupin had now gotten everyone below to chant kiss kiss kiss hermione noticed that harry still looked as though he didntknow whether or not to look at them ron quickly lowered his head down until his lips were so close to her cheek she could feel his warm breath traveling down her face and neck hermione closed her eyes she felt his chest constrict beneath her fingers as he took a deep breath before turning his face to softly brush his lips across her cheek it was just a small kiss but ron lips had never even been near her until that day in the hospital and now that they had made contact with her skin it seemed to make everything that had happened recently concrete the hospital the gryffindor party the snow fight and now this ron weasley truly did want to kiss her it had just better be soon hermione thought desperately as she and ron began floating back down to their small audience christmas day arrived a little too soon for ron he had absolutely never felt that way before but seeing as how he had only gotten two hours of sleep the night before he wished he could have had a lie in he had spent almost the entire night staring up at his ceiling hermione beautiful blushing face would not leave his mind long enough for him to concentrate on falling to sleep concentrate on falling to sleep what was the matter with him after he and hermione had descended from the bubble ron had immediately felt overwhelmingly awkward fred and george kept calling him chicken for not kissing her on the mouth which made he and hermione both blush tonks had simply smiled and gone back up to ginny room lupin patted him on the back a few times and harry had gone on and on about how weird it was to see his two best friends being forced to kiss and of course ron and hermione had had to act as if it were really weird for them too however harry comment had led ron to wondering something how would harry react if i were ever in a true romantic relationship with hermione would he be jealous would he think it was neat and why ron thought am i already worrying about things like that all he knew was that for some reason hermione wanted to kiss him that didntnecessarily mean that she felt about him as he felt about her it didntmean that every time hermione pictured him with someone else she felt like she could truly be sick to her stomach after ron and harry had gone up to bed harry had immediately fallen asleep ron was glad of this because after about fifteen minutes of lying awake he heard a shrill scream and giggles coming from ginny room that were surely ginny s she better keep her mouth shut thought ron he knew that ginny had this picture in her head of he and hermione in a loving relationship well so did he but he couldnt tell hermione that he loved her not this soon he and hermione and harry the trio that what it had been since their first year at hogwarts and ron couldntjust burst out with i love you just because hermione showed some attraction toward him had he not thought himself that every guy would at one point crush on his female best friend well what if it worked the other way what if hermione was just crushing on him or even worse what if he were just crushing on her what if these feelings that he had toward her were not love but infatuation so no i love you yet he didntwant to botch anything up he was going to take this one day at a time and savor the knowledge that hermione at least wanted to kiss him ron still couldntbelieve it he didntunderstand it hermione was so beautiful and smart she could have anyone she wanted why would she even want to waste her time snogging someone like him which brought him back to the problem of his sleepless night how could he sleep with thoughts of snogging hermione nevertheless the next morning ron had joined his family and friends downstairs for the opening of christmas presents he had received another sweater from his mum along with tons of candy harry had given him a broom servicing kit like the one hermione had given harry one year and hermione had gotten ron a silk quill writing set from france along with some french chocolates ron knew that the quill must have been expensive so he made sure he gave her an extra long hug for it she had given harry a book on the history of occlumency and harry actually seemed to really like it ron had given harry lots of bertie bott every flavor beans and a book on quidditch entitled secret strategies of the seeker it was easy to give harry gifts he handed the package to harry harry opened it and said thanks however ron had felt a bit nervous when he gave hermione her present he had to consciously pretend as if he were just giving another gift to harry the smile he couldntcontain when he saw that she liked her gift however did not resemble the smiles he gave harry but oh well hermione loved the book he d gotten her a simple guide to apparition dontsplinch it a cinch she had immediately become engrossed in its pages whilst the rest of his family finished unwrapping their own loads of presents ron and hermione had exchanged mildly surprised looks when harry and ginny swapped gifts they d never gotten gifts for each other before of course they had never really carried on a true conversation before this term either harry had gotten ginny a nice gold barrette for her hair in the shape of a butterfly and she had given him a practice snitch it was just like the real thing from the games but harry could call it to him with a whistle whenever needed for instance in case he lost sight of it or wanted to abruptly stop his practicing but just as a snowflake melts on your palm christmas was gone in a blink and the days following that happy morning were pure torture ron had dreamed of kissing hermione every day for the last two or three years and now that he knew she wanted to kiss him there had not been one opportunity everyday he had to look at her beautiful face from a friendly distance the only way he was keeping his sanity was by the gazes that they were able to share at the dinner table or from across the room he had actually considered sneaking into ginny room after everyone had gone to bed and asking hermione to take a walk with him but he d talked himself out of this idea when he d considered the fact that he might actually scare her half to death or worse wake tonks and get struck with some auror worthy curse ron ron thoughts were broken into as his mother knocked raptly on the door to his room he and harry had just been hanging out while hermione and ginny were downstairs helping his mum prepare dinner ron knew that harry could tell that he had been distracted the last few days but ron simply told him that he was still adjusting to not having classes which of course wasnta bit true but harry seemed to buy it for the most part tonight they were going to have a fireworks display outside over the snow to celebrate the new year fred and george were contributing the fireworks from weasley wizarding wheezes and ron had already decided that he wasntgoing to go near any of them he would watch the display from a safe distance come in mum ron called from his bed where he was flipping through the pages of a quidditch magazine harry was looking through some of the photo albums that he had inherited from sirius he d been doing that a lot since lupin had given harry that package for christmas ron didntknow what else was in it because harry hadntoffered to show him which ron had taken as a sign that harry didntwant to share the secrets of the box with anyone yet ron harry dear could you two help arthur clear a spot out in the yard for the twins they need a place to set up for their show ron would have normally asked why the twins couldntclear their own spot but ron was feeling so antsy lately that he quickly obliged harry carefully closed the photo album he was looking through and placed it in his trunk but not before ron caught a glimpse of mr and mrs potter smiling alongside sirius and lupin ron could definitely see why lupin had become so shaken christmas eve night after glimpsing harry and ginny in the moonlight the resemblance was eerie as ron and harry walked through the kitchen to the back door ron stole a glance at hermione who was adding pepper to some sort of stew she smiled back and accidentally dropped the peppershaker into the pot but quickly whipped out her wand and retrieved it with a levitation charm ron couldntbelieve that he could affect her that way always cool always collected hermione granger could become all thumbs by simply looking at him it made him smile even bigger at her before he walked out into the snow boys over here mr weasley called from across the yard he was about fifty yards back from the house shoveling through the snow there were two more shovels beside him waiting on ron and harry so ron said as he approached his father how big of an area do fred and george need exactly yes just shovel out some snow for fred and george for the show yes bill i mean charlie sorry ron mr weasley stammered absently his brow was furrowed and he looked as if he were concentrating very hard too hard for shoveling snow uh dad are you alright ron asked tentatively taking a shovel for himself and handing one to harry what oh oh yes just a little stressed from work more raids or is it something else harry asked sounding a bit anxious as he began shoveling no mr weasley said looking up from his shoveling to shake his head sadly at harry he looked at him for a moment longer before resuming his shoveling no not a raid listen do you two think you can finish up here i ve got to uh got to check in at the office real quick sure ron said looking worriedly at his father he was acting rather peculiar he had been in high spirits all week something had happened hey dad are you flooing over or what well i just going to use the floo network to talk to kingsley through the fireplace molly doesntwant me going in to the office today so just keep shoveling mr weasley said quickly before turning and jogging to the house ron and harry exchanged worried looks is your dad really alright harry asked dunno he sure acting funny though ron said suspiciously harry had a stony expression on his face and ron knew that his friend was wondering the same thing as him harry you dontthink it has anything to do with you know who do you even as the words left his mouth ron knew the answer harry looked at ron for a moment before saying if i tell you something will you keep it from hermione ron stomach clinched a little at this question why he and harry had always had some secrets here and there that were kept from hermione but for some reason ron felt a small feeling of guilt at the thought of agreeing to harry request however ron couldntsay no sure harry let out a small sigh look these occlumency lessons with dumbledore have been great but there a part of me that almost well wants to have those dreams and pains from my scar again now ron understood why this was an important conversation to keep hermione out of he could almost hear her scolding voice now it just that harry continued i cantshake the feeling that by blocking out voldemort mind i might miss something important you know like well that vision i had of your dad being attacked last term what if i miss something like that ron knew exactly what harry meant he had never voiced his opinion of occlumency to harry or hermione but ron also thought that harry visions could be useful at times i know mate but i guess you canttake the risk of you know who you know possessing you harry simply nodded sadly before resuming his shoveling ron had a rush of sympathy for his best friend he wished harry could have a more normal life and not be connected to voldemort by that stupid scar it was sometimes difficult to always be in the shadow of the boy who lived but ron knew that harry hero status came at a huge price no family and a tie to their murderer ron would never trade his life in poverty for harry wealth and fame when ron and harry had finally finished shoveling off a large area the sun was setting and the new year dinner was prepared everyone gathered round the kitchen table to enjoy the meal it was bill charlie and percy last night at the burrow bill and percy had their own places in london and charlie would be returning to romania ron noticed his mum paying extra close attention to those three at the table she offered them seconds of everything at five minute intervals although fred and george had their own flat above their shop their mum wasntpaying extra attention to them of course they came back and forth so much using apparition it was as if they still lived upstairs harry seemed to be in better spirits now that he was in out of the cold although ron thought it probably had more to do with the fact that he was sitting across the table from ginny they kept sneaking glances at one another but they werentsneaky enough ron wondered if anyone noticed a difference in the way he and hermione looked at one another he actually doubted it because even he noticed the subtlety in it it was something deep in hermione eyes that had changed something ron couldntplace after the dinner was over everyone dressed in their warmest attire coats scarves toboggans and gloves adorned every person they then made their way outside for the upcoming fireworks display fred and george had two large cardboard boxes full of fireworks that they were lugging out to the cleared area that ron and harry had shoveled mrs weasley turned out all the house lights so that only the moon and stars illuminated the backyard bill was conjuring big red lawn chairs for everyone under a large tree but ron saw tonks hermione and ginny twenty yards in the opposite direction near the shed it appeared as though they had gotten tonks to conjure four chairs for the youngest of the group so ron quickly motioned for harry to follow him over to the girls as tonks left to sit next to mr and mrs weasley harry took his seat next to ginny much to ron satisfaction since the fourth chair was on the other side of hermione harry and ginny immediately struck up a conversation between themselves those two sure could find a lot to talk about whenever they were together thought ron ron walked slowly over to the fourth chair and looked down at hermione she was looking up at him shyly and she somehow looked completely gorgeous and cute at the same time you re not saving this seat for anyone are you ron asked teasingly hermione pursed her lips to keep from smiling and shook her head alright then ron said as he sat down suddenly harry and ginny stood up from their seats hey you two get up ginny said smiling it freezing out here we fancy a bench instead do you yes ron and hermione said in unison while standing up hermione blushed and looked down at her feet and ginny gave ron a knowing smile luckily harry hadntseemed to notice anything hermione you have to do it none of us are of age ginny said hermione nodded proudly and retrieved her wand from her back pocket she mumbled something under her breath and with a flick of her wand the four chairs molded into one perfectly formed bench ron shook his head at her amazing talent and was happy to see that she hadntmade the bench too big the four of them quickly sat down oh yeah ron thought this is exactly the right size the side of his body was flush against hermione s ron leaned down slightly and stretched his legs out in front of him crossing his feet at the ankles he glanced over at harry and ginny who were now back to their constant chatter good he could finally talk to hermione without anyone overhearing ron didntreally know what to say to hermione though now that he was basically alone with her as a nervous feeling began to wash over him he realized that it was much easier to be cocky and flirtatious with hermione from a distance or while doing something active like dancing or playing with snow pop a beautiful red and green firework had just shot into the air and exploded breaking into ron train of thought hermione had gasped when she saw it and ron found himself smiling at her she was sitting up perfectly straight and staring up into the sky he elbowed her softly in the side she turned to him hey lean down and stretch out a bit ron said quietly pop another firework this one was blue and gold why she asked curiously glancing back up at the sky you ll have a crick in your neck later if you don t ron said plainly hermione kept her eyes on the sky but i like watching them like this she said pop red and silver fine ron said sitting back up he was now level with her and if he turned his face toward hers he could whisper straight in her ear so he did i really just wanted to be able to talk to you better anyway he whispered truthfully hermione shivered not because she was sitting outside on a hard bench in the snow but because ron had just whispered low in her ear he wanted to be able to talk to her better what was he going to say they had been eyeing each other all week but without any opportunity to talk about their newfound common interest would ron just outright say i want to kiss you or do you want to kiss me or kiss me hermione shivered again are you cold ron whispered again in that same husky tone with him sending fiery waves throughout her body every time he looked at her or talked to her how could she be cold she could only manage to shake her head pop orange green and yellow hermione turned to look at him he was staring at her what happening she asked before she could stop herself he smiled in a way that caused her heart to quake well it new year eve and we re watching fred and george blow things up one of their favorite things to do actually he said jokingly hermione didntlaugh but she swallowed hard no i mean what happening to us she asked in a whisper looking into ron bright blue eyes his joking smile turned into a serious yet timid look pop green silver and purple i dontknow hermione he said bluntly holding her gaze um does it frighten you hermione cracked a small smile a bit she said truthfully she d never really thought about it until just now but frightened was a perfect word to describe her she was frightened that ron didntfeel the same way frightened that he only wanted to kiss her frightened that they could be jeopardizing their friendship me too a bit he said with a timid smile he then reached his hand up to tug gently at one of the bushy curls sticking out from underneath her toboggan but i also like it really her heart seemed to be melting she smiled a tad bigger me too pop red gold and orange hey guys harry and i were wondering if you two wanted to play some hide n seek we re a smidgeon bored to be honest ginny said suddenly hermione turned to look at her and then back at ron who was giving her a suspicious look you know ron you and hermione against me and harry harry and i can hide first indoors or outdoors count to one hundred ron stood up then alright he was still looking at ginny suspiciously but now he was smiling as well ginny beamed at him and she and harry took off toward the house ron held down a hand for hermione she put her gloved hand in his for him to pull her up come on he said smiling hermione then proceeded to follow him toward the house well more like be dragged she thought he would go inside harry and ginny had but now he was dragging her around the side of the house this game had just started out of nowhere hermione had hoped to talk more with ron ron hermione asked a little breathlessly he was still dragging her behind him quickly now they were walking through the garden i think ginny and harry went inside suddenly ron stopped they were now at a small lean to off the side of the house he pulled her inside out of the cold wind exactly he said also breathless looking down at her hermione could still hear the popping of fireworks but they couldntsee them from here the lean to smelled of potting soil and onions and cedar it was very dark but hermione could see the outline of boxes piled everywhere a bit confused hermione asked so are we going to count from in here no well then we re not going to look for them either but ron they ll be hiding somewhere by now and hermione have you seen my sister and harry lately i dontthink they ll mind hiding somewhere alone for awhile hermione laughed a little but suddenly ron began approaching her she couldntsee his face in the darkness but she could hear his breathing she took a few steps back and bumped into the back wall of the building he approached her still until his warm breath was blowing down on her cold nose she reached out one gloved hand to feel for him and he was even closer than she had thought her hand immediately came in contact with the hard muscles of his stomach ron she breathed her heart was beating so hard that her entire torso seemed to be jerking slightly with each beat yeah he breathed back hermione could feel how heavily he was breathing by the movement of his abdomen one of his hands came to rest on the side of her waist what if i mean should we well what was she trying to say i wontkiss you if you dontwant me to hermione he whispered while bringing his free hand up to brush the back of it gently across her cheek and then rest on the other side of her waist he had said it so sweetly so sincerely hermione suddenly lost all inhibition to kissing him who cares what happened later they were here now she slid her hand up his stomach all the way up his chest to grip the back of his neck it felt tense under her gloved hand she then slid her other hand up the other side of his chest to the back of his neck there seemed to be some sort of fluid rushing around wildly in her skull ron gripped her waist harder as he leaned down toward her face he rested his forehead on hers so it okay then he whispered she nodded slowly holding her breath hermione tilted her head tentatively to one side closing her eyes ron forehead lifted from her own and his lips brushed across her cheek close to her ear shivers went down the entire length of her she gripped his neck tighter his lips then glided smoothly down her cheek to her mouth they stood there for a few seconds with their mouths parted and touching each of them breathing against the other lips before ron locked his over hers as soon as their lips touched hermione felt as if fireworks had begun exploding inside her chest ron hands squeezed her waist even tighter and then slid slowly around to the small of her back pulling her tightly against him his lips had locked onto hers slowly and then held tentatively it was soft and warm this wasnta dream this was really happening hermione suddenly pulled her mouth away which created a slight smacking sound ron wait she exclaimed ron stood straight up causing her hands to leave his neck and rest on his chest what wrong he asked quickly souding startled nothing she exclaimed it just that that was my first kiss ron let out a sigh and chuckled low in his throat yeah mine too but wait what hermione asked ron suddenly sounded apprehensive well what about i mean didntyou and krum hermione laughed quietly no hermione heard ron let out a long breath and felt some of the tension in his body ebb away hermione suddenly had to embrace him she wrapped her arms around his waist and laid her head on his chest his heart was beating as quickly as hers ron leaned over and encircled her with his arms laying his cheek on the top of her head after a moment he pulled away slightly and looked down at her she still couldntsee him in the darkness you re okay right he asked anxiously hermione smiled up at him but she then remembered that he couldntsee her she removed her gloves and tucked them in her coat pocket before reaching up her hands to cup his perfectly lined face rising up on her tiptoes she placed a kiss directly to the right of his mouth he took a sharp intake of breath hermione then glided her lips across his to the left of his mouth and kissed him again suddenly ron leaned down grabbing her around the waist and locked his lips over hers again this time however it was longer and more confident it took hermione breath away and she felt weak hermione wasntsure that she would ve remained standing if it werentfor his arms around her and the wall behind her ron as she formed his name her lips moved across his can we sit down she felt him smile against her mouth without answering he released her and slid down the wall to sit on the wooden floor he then raised his hand up and clasped hers to pull her down beside him ron sat down on the hard floor and crossed his legs he quickly removed his gloves and placed them in his coat pocket he reached up for hermione and found her small hand was this even happening he had just kissed hermione twice he still felt lightheaded it was as if all the emotions he d been feeling toward her that he had been hiding just beneath the surface had finally been able to break free his mind was a blur he tugged gently on her hand and she began lowering down to him but to ron surprise she turned and sat down sideways in his lap he sat motionless for a second his heart ready to burst before wrapping his arms around her small waist she laid her head down on his shoulder without warning he felt her tiny body give a little shake and felt a small sob breathe onto his neck as she buried her head there hermione oh crap what had he done she was regretting it already his heart seemed to stop after a fierce throb of panic more sobs were coming now and he could feel hot tears on his neck i sorry hermione oh blimey what is it he whispered taking one hand and placing it onto the back of her neck gently holding her head to his shoulder i dontknow why i crying she said softly into his neck do you ron began apprehensively as he stroked the back of her neck and hair do you regret oh no she raised her head suddenly and rested her forehead on his it not that at all it just i have all these different emotions right now and i dontknow what to do with them ron heart seemed to resume its rapid beating with a vengeance he knew how hermione felt except he knew what he wanted to do with his emotions he should probably say something to her something reassuring but his mind was still a blur and all he could think about was her wonderful mouth right in front of him he brought his hands up to cup her delicate face tears were still falling from her eyes and washing over his thumbs he wished he could see her but it was so dark they were both in shadows before he really even knew what he was doing he had brought his lips to her face and kissed her gently on each eyelid he must have done something right because hermione suddenly wrapped her arms tightly around his neck and kissed him hard on the mouth closing his eyes ron somehow lost all voluntary control over his body both of his hands became tangled in the back of her mass of brown hair causing her toboggan to fall to the floor his mouth was moving over hers slowly and passionately with a skill he would have never guessed he had how could two people that had just shared their first kiss somehow become experts in a matter of minutes hermione hands were now raking down his chest to his waist causing his entire body to shudder she then raised both hands up to pull off his toboggan and toss it on the floor before plunging her fingers into his hair his hands were moving through her hair and caressing her back in an undecided pattern when hermione finally pulled her mouth away from his they were both breathing hard and ron had begun sweating for a second hermione pulled away from leaning into his body and ron felt that awful heart clenching panic but then hermione did something amazing she bent one leg to her and then placed it on the other side of his waist he instinctively raised his back off of the wall behind him and hermione wrapped both legs around him okay that it this was a dream there was no way that he was on the floor of a small dark building with hermione granger legs wrapped around him he quickly reached around her and grabbed her wand out of her back jeans pocket placing her wand in her hand he said through pants light it wha she began breathlessly but then she muttered lumos the light was blinding so he reached his hand into hermione coat pocket and retrieved her glove quickly covering her wand with it to dim the light perfect he could see her now ron she asked curiously crikey she was more beautiful than ever she was flushed and a bit sweaty around her hairline her brown eyes were huge as she looked into his face i just had to see you hermione you re beautiful his voice caught slightly as he said it the most endearing smile spread across her face could you pinch me he asked just so that i know this isnta ow she d pinched him hard on the back of his arm grabbing the wand from her hand he said nox before placing her wand down beside him they were in total darkness again and he placed his hands on her waist his elbows resting on her thighs his breathing was quickening again he leaned forward and met her in another kiss she had been ready for it and she placed her hands on either side of his face as their lips resumed a pristine rhythm he shuffled her weight slightly while bringing her as close to him as he could with his hands still gripping her waist once she was as close as possible his hands immediately encircled her back crushing her to him as hermione felt ron arms tighten around her their kisses got steadily hungrier hermione felt as if she couldntget close enough to him but that was crazy because they were as close as humanly possible their embrace was so tight and their kisses so passionate it was almost impossible to get an appropriate breath of air but hermione didntcare about air right now she felt as though she had just found something important that had been missing for a long time she couldntlet go her hands left the soft folds of ron hair and as she attempted to deepen their kiss she encircled her arms around his neck as tightly as she could then hermione felt a small vibration in ron chest and heard a barely audible moan come from deep in his throat hermione suddenly felt a strong and foreign sensation run through her he took his mouth from hers and began kissing her fervently along her jaw starting at her chin and making a wet trail to her ear where he stopped long enough to retrace his kisses back to her chin hermione instinctively tilted her head back which ron took as an invitation to kiss her on her neck whether it was caused by the lack of sufficient air in her lungs ron mouth on her neck or something else hermione whole body began to tremble ron stopped his torrent of kisses immediately and he slightly pulled away he rested his warm cheek against her own and whispered urgently hermione you are you alright yes fine just dontstop she whispered back just as urgently as she crushed her trembling body back against him ron let out a long sigh and buried his head in her neck with a long warm kiss that he was tracing up to her ear when hermione suddenly heard footsteps and voices outside she pulled back and clutched his shoulders ron she whispered fearfully he quickly pulled her back to him and held her head down on his shoulder with one hand while the other stayed firmly around her back they were both out of breath i still say we should stock more of the detonating daisies george fred that what we were using when the quirky quartet decided to bail on our show i stick with what i said about the bursting blazes yeah well all you said was that they reminded you of whirling dervishes now how exactly is that evidence for their power to sell over detonating daisies hermione kept her head buried in ron shoulder but she heard the shuffle of footsteps come right inside the lean to this isnthappening please please please dontcome back here she was screaming on the inside she felt ron squeeze her a little tighter let just put the box here i cantsee a thing good hermione thought now leave she heard the thud of a cardboard box being set down roughly on the wooden floor before two sets of footsteps exited the lean to and faded away in the snow blimey that was close ron said releasing his hold on her head we should get back inside hermione said worriedly if the fireworks show was over then everyone was probably already inside the house how long have we been out here ron chuckled softly i wasntcounting the minutes hermione laughed quietly hermione ron began in a suddenly serious tone i i didntmean to go so fast i ve just been dieing to kiss you for he paused for a long time and it seemed like well like you were enjoying it no i know i did enjoy it very much she said reassuringly i ve been dieing to kiss you too they sat there for a minute without saying anything ron was rubbing her back gently and she was twirling a piece of his hair between her fingers as she rested her head on his chest hermione wanted to know so badly what he was thinking but she was afraid to say what she was thinking i love you is what she wanted to say but she was frightened unlike what she d told ron earlier she was more than a bit frightened what if he didntlove her back what if he did ron hermione asked quietly lifting her head from his chest what happens now i mean we ve only ever been best friends and now that this has happened what if we can never go back what is harry going to think of us what if he doesntwant us to be more than friends what if what if this falls apart and you and i canteven be friends anymore hermione couldntstop herself all of a sudden she was panicking her mind had been a blur when they were kissing and now that her mind was clearing she was going into hysterics she started taking deep steadying breaths but tears were already stinging her eyes shh hermione calm down ron said worriedly putting his hands firmly on her arms listen i think that for now we should keep this from harry from everybody okay until we both figure out what going on between us and as for me and you not being friends are you mental yes hermione whined tears now pouring down her face for some reason ron comforting words only made her tears come stronger she really was losing her mind hermione ron said laughing hermione didntsee anything funny ron hugged her tight to his chest and rested his forehead on hers you arentmental well a bit but i never going to stop being your friend how could you think that that week i was an idiot and didnttalk to you was one of the worst weeks in my life honest hermione i need you in my life okay as he finished he kissed her on her forehead he needed her in his life could you say that last thing again she said softly wiping her tears away she heard him take a deep breath before responding i need you hermione he said gently and with the utmost sincerity hermione felt like her heart was about to explode ron then kissed her on each eyelid as he had earlier after she d cried as soon as the hysterics had hit her they were gone she now just felt tired and content she wished that they could stay there all night embracing one another but alas hermione pulled out of ron hold and unwrapped her legs from around his waist she stood up slowly and ron was right behind her he hugged her then as they stood there are you ready to go inside and find ginny and harry hermione asked as she pulled out of his hug not really come on he took her by the hand and reluctantly led her out of the lean to the cold air whipped hermione in the face and her eyes adjusted to the light of the moon reflecting off of the snow as they left the darkness of their haven they walked slowly back around the house to the now empty yard the lawn chairs were gone and the lights inside were off as well everyone must ve gone to bed good hermione thought she wasntsure how well she could cover up her rattled emotions from her recent incident with ron ron hermione asked stopping before they crossed in front of the window he turned to her um what will we tell harry and ginny we ve been doing a smile broke across ron face well i think we ll have to tell ginny the truth hermione nodded yes she thought after that chat she had with ginny that first night at the burrow there was no way she would believe otherwise as for harry ron said his smile fading we ll just tell him that we ve been seeking the whole time and that we thought indoors was off limits hermione nodded as she looked up into his beautiful face his crystal blue eyes had suddenly begun staring at her with desire is that what his eyes had looked like in the lean to he reached one hand to cup her face hermione can i kiss you goodnight he asked almost timidly after all they d done in that small dark room he was timid about a goodnight kiss it made hermione heart flutter he must have seen a yes in her eyes because he entwined their fingers together bent down and squeezing her hands gently took her mouth in the most tender and meaningful kiss yet author note well i hope

ron eyes were closed as he let the blazing hot water wash over him the loo was filled with steam the scent of soap and the sound of water cascading down the walls of the shower when ron had first woken up this morning he had been smiling from the memory of a wonderful dream but after the haze of sleep had risen he had realized that the memory he was cherishing was not from a dream last night had been completely and remarkably real hermione lips hands hair body desire it was all real somehow he had managed to share his first kiss with the most amazing being on the planet well his first kiss along with his second third fourth and so on the fog of disbelief had not fully cleared until the hot water had hit him this morning but once it had ron was able to recall every last glorious detail of his and hermione rendezvous her smell her touch her taste each kiss and every emotion from unsaturated desire to untainted love ron reached for the knob and turned off the flow of the water now for the hard part get dressed go downstairs and put on a convincing show for harry and his mum no telling glances or touches could pass between him and hermione at least his brothers and dad had left for work sighing heavily he grabbed a towel from the back of the door when knock knock knock ron ron froze and quickly tied the towel around his waist stepping out of the shower he shuffled to the door hermione he whispered yes can you let me in hermione asked somewhat urgently what ron hastily snatched up his clean pair of boxers and jeans from the sink top and began swapping his meager towel for something more appropriate was something wrong she sounded worried his hair still dripping wet ron quickly zipped his denims before opening the door a tiny crack cool air from the hallway drifted into his steamy space creating chills over his body before he had time to open the door enough to even see hermione she had pushed the door open hurried inside and shut the door quietly behind her she looked up at him anxiously dressed adorably in striped flannel pajamas and bright red gold and orange phoenix bird house shoes her hair began curling up around her face from the lingering cloud of steam what wrong he asked worriedly taking a step toward her but she no longer looked anxious ron felt himself go scarlet as he watched hermione slowly take in his half naked still damp body she was just staring at him with her mouth partly open blimey hermione he said feeling a bit embarrassed and grabbing his t shirt from a peg on the wall to hold modestly over his chest her eyes quickly darted up to his face as her cheeks began turning rouge s sorry she said sounding breathless ron couldntcontain a smile but hermione now looked worried again oh ron she began anxiously my wand i i i left it in the lean to last night and i didntrealize it until i woke up this morning and so i ran outside to check just now and and oh ron it gone ron let out an uneasy laugh before reaching into his jeans pocket and retrieving a small piece of parchment actually he said as he handed a confused looking hermione the note your wand our toboggans and this note were all on my bedside table when i awoke this morning hermione seized the paper and read aloud our dearest ronaldo help us with this riddle roses are red violets are blue we found some treasures in the old lean to daisies are gold lilies are white were these treasures left from a snog or a fight your beloved brothers fred george ron watched as hermione stepped back to lean against the door closing her eyes he couldnttell if that were a look of relief or humiliation he was betting on a mixture of both he felt the same relief from the fact that when his brothers had found the treasures before grabbing their remaining fireworks and heading to work they had not made a detour to divulge anything to harry or his mum yet he felt preemptive humiliation at the thought of what fred and george might do with this newfound knowledge are you alright ron asked hermione with a smile she opened her eyes but remained leaning against the door i dontknow do you think they ll tell anyone no fred and george will have much more fun torturing us with the fact that we re not telling anyone ron smiled down at her although his insides were squirming he had been trying to decide exactly how much he should tell hermione about his true feelings for her he and hermione werenttelling anyone else that they d kissed but what should he tell her in an attempt to clear his mind for a bit he glanced back down at her vibrant house shoes and then asked while laughing where did you get those what she asked glancing down and then smiling faintly oh they re tonks they were the first shoes i saw before i dashed outside to check for my wand ah so what did you tell tonks and ginny last night when you got in well tonks was asleep but i told ginny the truth like you said she was near ecstatic what did you tell harry just that we were seeking outside for awhile but then gave up i dontthink he suspects anything did he tell you what he did last night she asked with a mischievous grin that made ron want to pull her to him and kiss her if you mean did he tell me that he kissed ginny then yes he said returning her mischievous grin and raising his eyebrows hermione bit her lower lip and nodded her head enthusiastically okay ron thought how can she expect to bite her lip like that without consequence taking another step toward her he placed one hand on the door above her head he hadntreally realized that he was still hiding his chest with his t shirt until hermione took the bit of cover from him and tossed it on the sink her eyes then swept over him and lingered timidly on the tops of his jeans that did it both of his arms were around her waist in a second as he bent down to take her mouth in his her hands immediately found the back of his neck and she began fingering the ends of his wet locks causing water droplets to fall down his back breakfast mrs weasley bellow rudely interrupted their steamy tryst but hermione heart was already pounding in her chest from their brief kiss kiss the morning had barely begun and it had already happened again hermione had been afraid that she would find last night to be a magnificent dream or else ron would have decided that it was all just a bad idea bad idea was it just a bad idea ron had been so reassuring last night as he d told her that they would simply not reveal this secret to anyone until they knew what was happening but hermione did know what was happening at least for her she had fallen in love with her best friend and she had been given a bubble of hope this bubble which was fairly large in size was now residing in her heart growing a smidgeon with each sultry glance touch and kiss from ron but just like the silver bubble from the wizard mistletoe hermione knew that this bubble of hope could burst if it did would their friendship come crashing down around them tracing her hands from the nape of ron neck down to his chest hermione reluctantly pushed herself away from his hold ron groaned in frustration and stepped away from her you know ron began he suddenly sounded a bit nervous i told harry that i thought it was great that he and ginny were getting along um could you remind me again why we arenttelling anyone he finished with a timid smile hermione heart did some sort of pirouette as she looked into ron blue gaze telling anyone what that we ve kissed or are you saying hermione look ron began nervously playing with his hands and fingers last night when i said i d been dieing to kiss you for a long time i meant years hermione swallowed hard as her bubble swelled threatening to burst from her chest in the form of a nervous fit of laughter what that smile for ron asked with a suspicious smile of his own was she smiling hermione cleared her throat i um it been years for me too she said softly ron twisted his mouth as he attempted to hide what hermione was sure would have turned into a broad toothy grin well he continued resuming his hand twisting the thing is i d like to walk down the corridors of hogwarts holding your hand you know or at lunch or between classes maybe well maybe steal one of these hermione held her breath as ron lowered his face to hers and kissed her gently at the corner of her mouth as he leaned back to judge her response with an attractively stern look she let out a long breath ron it just harry we ve both been there on either side of him for six years and now that he lost sirius i i just dontwant him to feel like he losing us too hermione could tell that ron agreed with her from the sad look that passed over his face coupled with the serious nod he gave her she was about to remind him that they should get down to breakfast when knock knock knock the door had vibrated against hermione back as someone knocked upon it causing her to gasp and grab ron arm w who is it ron asked as he looked down fearfully at hermione good gravy ron is hermione in there with you hermione let out a sigh of relief as ginny urgent voice whispered against the door ron face relaxed before he rolled his eyes and stepped around hermione to open the door a crack yes but we re only talking ginny and now we re through talking yeah okay try putting on a shirt and then telling me that you two are just talking ginny said sarcastically from behind the door or more importantly both of you get down to the kitchen so i can stop saying things like oh you know ron and his showers or that hermione sure does sleep in because ron everyone knows that you take four minute showers and hermione often up before the sun she finished urgently before hermione heard her stomp off down the hall to head back down the stairs ron closed the door softly before turning around to offer her a weak smile well i guess we better get down there huh he said sadly hermione knew that he was thinking the same thing as she when would they have another rendezvous what would it be like to hide their feelings in public with a sigh hermione stepped forward and without really thinking about what she was doing she took her index finger reached up and traced it gently down the length of ron long freckled nose the smile he gave her then made his eyes squint slightly and hermione would have probably become teary eyed if it werentfor the knowledge that she had to hurry and get down to the kitchen placing her hands on his ribcage and standing on her tiptoes she locked her lips over his his hands cupped her face then and he deepened the kiss just briefly sending a rush of warmth throughher body before stepping back from her with a somewhat pained look he opened the door for her and with one last glance into his strong face hermione stepped out into the chilly hall by the time ron had finished drying and dressing properly everyone was already sitting around the kitchen table enjoying his mum cooking harry and ginny were sitting across from each other hermione who had exchanged her pj and house shoes for jeans and a sweater was sitting beside ginny and tonks and his mum were on either ends of the table ron took his seat beside harry and was quickly served a steaming bowl of porridge and a cool glass of orange juice mum ginny began when can we take hermione and harry up to diagon alley to see fred and george shop oh that right mrs weasley exclaimed you two haven t crack crack crack crack ron harry and tonks were on their feet immediately wands ready mrs weasley spoon clattered noisily what in merlin name she breathed standing up to hurry to the window the curtains were drawn ginny and hermione had now stood up as well wands in hand mrs weasley harry shouted sternly she stopped in her tracks get away from that window ron mum looked at harry almost fearfully but backed away from the window and crossed to stand with ginny putting an arm around her daughter suddenly the back door burst open and ron harry and tonks raised their wands to point at dad ron asked slowly lowering his wand arthur swept into the room and crossed quickly to molly lupin had entered as well but had crossed over to tonks and was whispering something urgently oh molly thank the stars arthur whispered as he hugged his wife quickly before letting go and grabbing a large duffel bag off of a peg by the door he began frantically stuffing it with an odd collection of and scarves shoes an entire laundry basket full of clothes arthur what molly began shakily but harry interrupted there were two more apparaters where are they he asked hurriedly oh yeah ron thought there had been two more sounds now rummaging through drawers arthur responded absently mad eye and kingsley are checking the perimeter ron harry ginny hermione you four go upstairs with tonks and pack your trunks quickly what happened harry asked quietly there was something odd in his eyes that ron had never seen before there was almost an emerald glow to his already green eyes arthur just shook his head mumbling to himself as he took the weasley family clock off the wall and thrust it into the bag dad wha ginny began but molly shouted listen to your father all of you go harry looked quite unsatisfied but the four teenagers and tonks hurriedly ascended the stairs what in the world was going on tonks went into ginny room with the girls while ron and harry continued up the stairs to his room he and harry didntspeak at first as they quickly began throwing all of their strewn belongings unceremoniously into their trunks ron kneeled down and began grabbing clothes out from under his bed harry what do you think i dontknow harry replied shortly it him though i know it is yeah ron thought me too was voldemort coming for harry had he found out that he was staying at the burrow someone must be coming why else would they have to leave ron heart was hammering wildly in his chest as he threw the last of his things into his trunk and slammed the lid closed ron looked up at the two empty owl cages on the window seal harry pig and he began fretfully grab your cage they ll find us harry said hastily he carefully placed the box of sirius belongings into his trunk before snapping it shut grabbing hedwig cage with one hand and his trunk with the other they then immediately left for the stairs when they reached ginny room they waited for her and hermione to finish and they then let them descend the stairs ahead of them lupin mad eye arthur and molly were all standing by the fireplace in the kitchen arthur waved for tonks to go first so where to arthur she asked calmly stepping into the green flames with a handful of floo powder and a large purple bag over her shoulder harry s arthur replied simply ron hermione and ginny all looked at harry with curious expressions what were they going to the dursley s oh great tonks nodded sharply throwing the powder at her feet she yelled number 12 grimmauld place ron snapped his head to harry and shot him a questioning look as arthur ushered molly in next harry was merely gazing into the fire with a blank stare so ron thought there one thing that was in that package of sirius belongings the deed to grimmauld place that hadnteven crossed ron mind next arthur ushered in hermione and ginny and then it was ron turn well harry and ron argued for a second each trying to get the other to go first until mad eye yelled and cursed at them to hurry up and choose so ron stepped into the flames and shouted for harry place hermione was seated at one of the many chairs at the large kitchen table in 12 grimmauld place her knee was bobbing up and down uncontrollably and she was surely going to cause herself to bleed if she didntstop chewing on the inside of her cheek tonks had gone to check all of the rooms of the house molly was pacing the kitchen nervously and ginny was seated beside hermione holding her hand ginny looked awfully pale but neither of them had spoken of any possible reasons for them suddenly being ushered to the order headquarters by two aurors lupin and arthur all hermione could think about was that stupid boggart telling her those awful things about harry and ron she couldntget it out of her head she wished they would hurry up suddenly ron appeared in the fireplace what had taken him so long he looked around briefly before his eyes landed on hers his brow furrowed as he dragged his trunk and owl cage to rest with the other luggage then he swept over to the seat beside her and sat down hermione looked at him what going on she asked him with her eyes he shook his head slowly harry appeared next deposited his luggage with the others and then began pacing the room opposite mrs weasley they were going to make her sick if they didntstop lupin mr weasley kingsley and mad eye quickly followed everyone took a seat around the table including tonks who had finished searching the house kreacher had come in behind her looking at them all suspiciously before exiting the room muttering something they sat in silence for a mere two seconds before mr weasley finally decided to explain the sudden abandonment of the burrow i have some troubling news he began gravely everyone seemed to sit up a bit straighter in their seats with a sigh mr weasley turned to look right at hermione her heart began beating fiercely until her head felt fuzzy there been an attack at the granger s author note i want to thank everyone so much for the reviews they re great please continue to send in your thoughts i rather like this chapter and i hope everyone else has as well chapter 20 is now in the making the characters and situations of harry potter depicted in this story are the legal property of j k rowling bloomsbury and aol time warner and have been used without permission no copyright violation is intended no profit is being made off this site it is for entertainment purposes only chapter 2 first years professor mcgonagall voice echoed through the silent great hall to the front please the almost fearful looking and incredibly small first year students were being ushered to the front many of their innocent faces were turned up to the enchanted ceiling which tonight was clear and full of stars ron wasntreally paying attention however he hadntbeen able to stop thinking about harry dream harry was right though there were tons of muggle borns however just the fact that hermione fell into that category made ron nervous ron glanced over at hermione she was sitting beside him watching the first years with great interest she certainly didntlook bothered by any unwelcome thoughts as ron was maybe she had been convinced when he and harry had told her that she didntneed to worry about the dream tearing his eyes away from hermione ron noticed that harry had a strange look on his face what was he looking at he was sitting across the table from ron and staring behind ron head with a look of utter confusion and worry ron nudged hermione with his elbow and nodded toward harry her brow furrowed as they both turned to look behind them they immediately saw the object of harry surprise ron heard hermione gasp the slytherin table was only two thirds full there must have been one hundred students missing unfortunately malfoy was not one of them and neither were crabbe or goyle hermione gripped his arm and looked at him in mild shock he shook his head as he looked into her troubled brown eyes eyes that beautiful should never be troubled ron thought absently he managed to smile back weakly in an attempt to reassure her before mcgonagall announced the sorting hat song ron looked up to the front of the hall and saw the rim of the hat open to begin another year begins for all so with this melody i ll give you a quick warning of the changes you will see the discord that has always lived between the houses four results in those that feel superior to be seen here no more sir slytherin would be too pleased if he still lived today to see a hogwart rival school that actually bears his name for in this newly founded school the founders do believe that pureblood witches and wizards are the ones who ll rule supreme yes at slytherin school of magic no muggle borns are found only ambitious pureblood students to this society are bound but gryffindor and ravenclaw and hufflepuff still stand united with those slytherin who have not left the band and though it seems a shame for some to split apart those left are those devoted of the mind and of the heart so devoted students here tonight prepare to learn this year not only magic spells and charms but history i fear no i dontmean you ll learn from books the history of which i speak but from the rise of the dark lord who wants history to repeat frightening times are here and now and all should be aware but there still hope among the dark there still hope in the air a prophecy has been foretold of a wizard here tonight he holds the power to free our world if he can win the fight now that you ve heard my warning the sorting i will start just place me straight upon your head so i can see what in your heart was it possible for time to stop ron was beginning to think so as a deadly uncomfortable silence overpowered the great hall ron and hermione slowly turned to look at harry as time resumed its pace with the immediate outburst of voices no one even attempted to whisper neville and ginny were looking at harry as well as for everyone else in the hall students and teachers alike half were staring at harry and the other half were staring at dumbledore ron suddenly realized that although time had overcome its pause he had forgotten to resume his breathing he took a deep breath slytherin school of magic prophecy wizard here tonight with the power to free our world the words wouldntcollaborate in ron mind hermione was sitting completely still and staring with the utmost shock and worry at harry harry had turned ghostly pale and had put his head in his hands was that prophecy harry prophecy was that what voldemort had been after what did that mean if he could win what did any of it mean a clenching fear grabbed at ron heart harry was the wizard with the power to free their world of voldemort ron felt as if the walls of the great hall had suddenly decided to start moving as he clutched a hand to his throbbing head if ron had this many unanswered thoughts he knew hermione must be ready to implode with the weight of her questions ron put his hand gently on hermione back while he looked at harry harry had raised his head from his hands and his mouth was fixed in a straight line ron had never seen harry eyes look the way they did at that moment he was looking at ron with an apologetic yet pleading look silence ron turned to see dumbledore standing at the front of the hall in long purple robes with both hands raised for the first time since ron had been at hogwarts no one obeyed the headmaster order the talking continued and ron thought he saw a brief look of surprise cross dumbledore face before he asked for silence again this time the talking died to a low murmur please i need everyone attention dumbledore booming voice was finally the only sound in the hall assumptions are being made at this very moment in the young minds before me but assumptions are useless to make regarding the sorting hat s unexpected song as far as even i know the wizard made reference to could be me now i have some announcements to make dumbledore just said that it could be him to save me some undesired attention he told me about the prophecy last term after we returned from the ministry i sorry i didnttell you but i didntknow how trewlawny prophesied that i would either kill or be killed by voldemort we cantboth survive hermione felt as if she were in some sort of muggle soap opera what she was hearing was just as unbelievable it was the night before classes started and she was in the common room alone with her two best friends except they werenther best friends they were robots or some kind of gross semblance of her friends trewlawny harry are you mad she said exasperatedly standing up from the sofa hermione i know it sounds awful but harry began no dumbledore has really lost it i mean trewlawny we all know she a phony hermione was screaming at him but he wouldntlook at her he just sighed and put his head in his hands why didnthe understand she turned to ron at least he was looking at her ron there is no prophecy there cantbe sybil trewlawny is a fake ron simply looked at her as if he had no idea what to believe it made her even angrier what was the matter with them they were going to believe something sybil trewlawny said without question no not just something she d said a prophecy concerning the fate of the entire wizarding world ron reached a hand toward her but she jerked away harry suddenly stood up from his lounge chair hermione trewlawny is for the most part a phony but when she prophesies it different he said calmly and then he turned to look down at ron who was still sitting on the couch looking dumbstruck ron you believe me right um ron began uneasily he turned to look up at her hermione stared down at him hermione um we did see it in the hall of prophecy i mean it has to be hermione growled and stomped her foot before turning to harry harry i sorry but i wontbelieve anything that horrible woman says believe what you will but i wontbelieve in that so called prophecy simply because it was in the department of mysteries if you two want something to lose sleep over worry about this slytherin school of magic hermione felt the tears coming so she turned and ran up the girl staircase she wasntgoing to believe it trewlawny of course that woman wants harry to either kill or be killed she obsessed with death hermione put her hands to her eyes which she was squeezing shut i wontcry she thought i not going to cry because it not true however when hermione laid down in her bed and pulled the curtains closed silent tears began cascading down her cheeks it was times like these when she wished ron were there to comfort her he had tried to comfort her some downstairs but she had jerked away this made her cry harder but of course she d jerked away he was siding with harry and that mystic this was her first night at hogwarts and she was lying in bed crying she had been so excited about returning to school while at the platform this morning but after hearing about harry dream the slytherin school of magic and this fake prophecy oh hermione grabbed her pillow out from under her head and hugged it to her tightly okay am i a gryffindor or not she asked herself i not going to scare myself silly worrying about a hypothetical kidnapping and a bogus prophecy if she were going to worry it would be over that horrible new school she gripped her pillow tightly and willed herself to go to sleep however it wasntthe slytherin school of magic that hermione was thinking about as she cried herself to sleep the next morning ron dressed hurriedly and made his way down to the common room to meet harry and hermione who were both waiting for him at the portrait hole the night before he had lain in bed for a long while before going to sleep he wondered if harry or hermione had had the same problem there had just been so many things thrown at him in one day they couldntjust disappear as soon as the lights had gone out ron didntwant to believe that harry dream was real and if it were real he didntwant to believe that hermione might be the victim of a kidnapping he couldntbear to think of it so naturally his mind had wondered to another unpleasant thought some purebloods had decided to form their own school ron couldntbelieve that it was a coincidence that they formed this school as soon as voldemort became widely believed to be alive and strong it seemed like something a horde of death eaters would do for their children but malfoy crabbe and goyle were still at hogwarts ron had thought those three would ve been the first to sign up for a slytherin school of magic the sorting hat had said that those that felt superior had left and those devoted of heart and mind had stayed if malfoy sheart and mind were devoted to anything it was evil and if malfoy didntfeel superior to everyone around him who did and to top everything off harry has been prophesied to murder or be murdered ron didntwant either for his best friend he couldntimagine living day to day with the knowledge that you were destined to be a murderer of course if hermione were right the prophecy was a fake but ron really didntthink so trewlawny was mentally off but she had made that prediction about pettigrew returning to voldemort in their third year and she had been right oh yes ron thought cynically as hermione turned to smile weakly at him before they exited the portrait hole door i also have to worry about getting a better hold on my emotions no more noticing hermione eyes hair smile and other accoutrements today he was going to look at hermione as one of his two best friends because that all she was with that unhappy thought on his mind he then remembered he had one more thing to worry about their first class was unfortunately potions with professor snape i cantbelieve his skinny face will be the first thing we see every monday morning ron exclaimed with disgust as the trio left breakfast and walked down the many staircases to the dungeons harry grunted in agreement ron complaining wontmake it any better hermione said matter of factly it best to just tough it out with silence and diligence ron opened his mouth to defend himself when he suddenly tripped over something and fell hard onto the stone floor ron hermione gasped as she and harry bent down to help pull him up from the ground once back on his feet ron dusted his pants off and looked up to see harry staring threateningly at a laughing draco malfoy crabbe and goyle harry wand held tightly in his right hand draco leg was extended into the hallway you imbecile hermione screamed at malfoy you could have really hurt him this comment only made malfoy and his cronies laugh harder when their laughter subsided malfoy approached hermione ron tensed granger if i wanted to seriously hurt weaselby i wouldntdo it for an audience malfoy turned his gaze upon ron no i d do it somewhere where he would die in pain before being found ron just stood silently glowering at malfoy hermione had gasped and harry was still standing in the same spot holding tightly to his wand heat was rising in ron cheeks he was accustomed to disregarding the awful things malfoy found to say to him but he couldntstand the way malfoy said hermione name like it was something dirty on his lips oh dontworry granger malfoy said sneering at hermione and then in a low whisper he said with the dark lord back a mudblood like yourself will probably be dead before i get the chance to get your boyfriend alone something in ron snapped at these words it was like a sheer red gauze had been pulled over his eyes ron grabbed fistfuls of malfoy collar and thrust him with all his strength into the stonewall malfoy took a sharp intake of breath and doubled over gasping for air ron then grabbed a handful of white blonde hair at the back of malfoy head and pulled him up straight to face him he briefly glared into malfoy fearful but soulless grey eyes before rearing back his fist and punching him square in the jaw malfoy fell to the floor his mouth marked with blood and ron was on top of him in a second hermione let out a sound that was a cross between a scream and a squeak as she grabbed the back of ron shirt to try and pull him off of malfoy who seemed to be whimpering somewhere ron could hear a distant sounding harry yelling at ron to stop but ron wasntsatisfied with just the one punch he pulled his fist back for another when mr weasley snape had approached the scene with his impeccable timing i suggest you lower your fist and remove yourself from mr malfoy mr malfoy take yourself to the hospital wing and potter put that wand away snape glared at harry with hatred for a moment before a malevolent smile crept onto his thin lips oh and one hundred points from gryffindor but professor ron was provoked if you d only listen to what hermione began talking very swiftly before being interrupted miss granger no provocation is cause enough for violence but your insolence will cost gryffindor another fifty points and with that snape swirled around his black cloak waving behind him as he entered his classroom ron pushed himself off of malfoy making sure he used all of his weight to do so malfoy limped off cursing crabbe and goyle were standing off to the side looking menacing yet unsure of what to do once inside the classroom ron and harry sat down on either side of a sullen hermione ron was fuming at both malfoy and snape yet snape mind boggling injustice was doing nothing to ron anger as compared to malfoy comment toward hermione ron noticed that his hands were actually shaking and he had a throbbing pain in his right hand now how dare he speak to her that way who cared about stupid house points he d punch malfoy out in a second if he had it to do all over again ron glanced at hermione who was looking down at her hands in her lap malfoy comment had surely upset her she usually ignored malfoy offensiveness but this time his remark had some disturbing truth to it ron couldntbear to think of it but he knew that hermione was in fact vulnerable in the wizarding world at this time both of his best friends were whether the dream or prophecy were true or not they were both vulnerable if anything happened to either of them ron willed himself to not think of such things he was only partly aware that snape had begun his lesson because he sat wordlessly looking at hermione unexpectedly a single glistening tear rolled down her delicate cheek to fall silently to one of her hands in her lap ron felt a horrible crushing feeling in his chest no one would notice if he just reached a comforting hand to her under the table ron thought it what any good friend would do taking a shuddering breath he slowly took hold of hermione hand closest to him and interlocked his fingers with hers hermione tensed for a moment before looking at ron who gave her a feeble smile and squeezed her hand soothingly her hand felt so fragile and cold in his as he rubbed his thumb across the back of it she returned his smile and the rest of the class went on with their hands united while ron convinced himself that the warm tremor in his stomach was merely a hunger pang i promise that the romance in this story grows with each chapter i just need to form a good foundation for their sixth year before it skyrockets the characters and situations of harry potter depicted in this story are the legal property of j k rowling bloomsbury and aol time warner and have been used without permission no copyright violation is intended no profit is being made off this site it is for entertainment purposes only chapter 20 i have some troubling news there been an attack at the granger s ron stared at his father what his lungs suddenly felt like they were deflating caving in on themselves his mum and sister both had their hands covering their mouths harry had that strange green glow in his eyes but his expression was eerily blank and hermione hermione looked utterly horrified completely frozen no ron shouted suddenly standing up so quickly from his chair that it fell with a deafening bang to the floor rubbish by products of half breeds despicable blood traitors shouts immediately flooded down from the entrance hall upstairs tonks raised hurriedly from her chair to go quiet the painting over the incessant shouts of sirius dead mother lupin had stood up and was saying loudly hermione your parents are fine no one was at your house at the time of the attack they ve been in france with your grandmother all holiday and dumbledore has gone to speak with them himself ron felt a little air enter his lungs but he still felt as if he were drowning hermione didntrespond she had hidden her face in her hands and was now shaking with sobs ron placed his unsteady hand on her shoulder as he remained standing beside her she kept her head resting on one hand but with the other she reached up and clasped onto ron hand tightly he suddenly had a pounding ache in his head has this anything to do with my dream harry asked evenly it was almost impossible to hear him over the continuing shouts from mrs black now there is no proof of this being an attempted kidnapping mad eye began gruffly death eaters like to target any and all muggle families just for the hell of it which is why kingsley was stationed nearby and was able to inform us immediately of the attack hermione suddenly lifted her head from her hand her face was flushed and tearstained and she continued to grasp firmly to ron hand on her shoulder s so when you say a attack kingsley cleared his throat and spoke in his low slow voice they did a fairly good job ransacking the place and writing some crude things on the walls but we ve already sent some ministry workers to clean things up for your mum and dad who cares about the house ron shouted unable to restrain himself was everyone mental why were three aurors sitting in front of him cool calm and collected ron rounded on his father dad did they know to look for her at the burrow i mean is that why we left what if they find her here what if that damn elf has told them where this place is damn it boy sit down and cool it mad eye yelled suddenly his electric blue eye swiveling madly in its socket cool it ron had a sudden urge to rip that stupid eye out of moody head but he simply remained standing glaring at mad eye as his father began explaining slowly and patiently ron grimmauld place is under the fidelius charm with dumbledore as the secret keeper they can not find us here and yes there was evidence suggesting that they might target the burrow evidence harry suddenly asked in that same monotone voice from some of the messages written on the walls we gather that they know hermione to be a strong confidant of the weasley family kingsley offered ron wondered what the messages might have said he wanted to know but he wouldntask in front of hermione tonks entered then she had apparently calmed mrs black there were no more shouts coming from upstairs ron felt hermione start shaking slightly and looked down to see that both of her knees were bobbing up and down she suddenly whispered but w what if they find my grandmother home what if they not possible stated arthur firmly as we said dumbledore has gone to speak with your family but he has also gone to perform the complex fidelius charm on your grandmother home he will be their secret keeper and they will be completely safe i assure you hermione nodded her head slowly but she then rested her head back in her free hand listen arthur lupin began rising from his chair i have some things i need to look into concerning the breakout as do i said kingsley also rising from his seat breakout ron and harry asked together mad eye grunted yesterday lucius malfoy we think peter pettigrew may have helped him escape so that what was wrong with my dad yesterday ron stomach suddenly twisted in pain and he felt as though he could be sick all over the table he sat down quickly one had still on hermione shoulder harry dream voldemort was angry with pettigrew for failing at something had he failed over the summer at freeing lucius malfoy his animagus form could prove helpful in sneaking in and out of azkaban undetected and now that lucius was free the bastard has been able to make his first attempt at kidnapping a muggle born ron snapped back to the present as he heard two consecutive cracks lupin and kingsley were gone hermione arthur began softly dumbledore will be here shortly and he going to take you to see your family alright hermione nodded slowly her expression was now unreadable but she still had a firm hold on ron hand he wanted to wrap her in his arms and tell her something reassuring but he was afraid that would just make things worse then she would be worrying about the attack and the possibility of harry becoming suspicious of them ron dad soon announced that he needed to be getting back to work he informed them that mad eye and tonks would be staying with them this was beginning to feel like the summer after their fourth year all over again being rushed out of the burrow for it being too risky it looked as though grimmauld place would be their home until school started back in about a month but as long as hermione was safe ron didntcare where he had to live until school resumed he would sleep under the boiler with kreacher if he had to why couldntthe death eaters target me ron thought miserably he was harry friend too although i not muggle born thought ron how far would they go to get to hermione would they try anything at hogwarts ron suddenly had an unwelcome vision of hermione cornered by that boggart ron mum had started rummaging through the pantry to find something to cook up a pursed lip worried expression on her face mad eye had risen to ascend the stairs and tonks was following molly around asking her if she could help her with anything harry and ginny were just sitting silently at the table there were suddenly so many things that ron wanted to tell hermione but he couldnt not in front of everybody at least even if he and hermione werenthiding their feelings from everyone these were things that ron wanted to tell her in private hermione was staring straight in front of her but her eyes werentfocused a swarm of hippogriffs could have just flown by and she wouldnthave known it mrs weasley had begun cooking something harry and ginny were sitting to her right silently ron was to her left gripping her shoulder as she gripped his hand as soon as she had felt his hand on her her breathing had becomea bit more steady she had felt a surge of confidence that everything would ultimately be okay but whether or not that were true hermione didntknow maybe she was justtoo much in love to think straight during a tragedy her house had been attacked harry dream had been real she knew it now what if her parents had been home the death eaters would have killed them without a second thought what was she going to do after she visited her family in france would she go back to hogwarts or would the order make her stay hidden away at grimmauld place mad eye had said that there was no proof of the attack being an attempted kidnapping but hermione was sure that he was just saying that to reassure her it hadntworked if he was right and it wasntan attempted kidnapping then they would ve killed her instead she had been terrified when ron dad had told them what had happened but now she was beginning to feel anger that stupid prophecy it all goes back to that every last thing the reason harry parents were dead the reason harry was now being hunted the reason hermione was wanted as bait suddenly hermione released ron hand and stood up from her chair hermione ron asked hesitantly hermione closed her eyes briefly before turning to walk up the stairs to the entrance hall she knew that ron had stood up to follow her but she didntturn around to acknowledge this fact these thoughts and emotions about the prophecy were threatening to spill over and hermione knew that she couldntlet that happen ginny had been partly right that night in the gryffindor common room after the hogsmeade attack if harry chose to believe in that rubbish then it was his burden not hers thus hermione didnthave the right to denounce it the entrance hall was still as shabby as ever with its threadbare carpet and peeling wallpaper moody was seated on a rather dusty moth eaten dark green sofa great hermione was hoping no one would be in this room so that she could sit in her quietly this was the room with mrs black portrait the room where near silence was a necessity hermione hermione turned to see ron standing timidly at the top of the basement stairs he looked unsure of himself yet he was standing tall she was highly considering running to him and wrapping her arms around his neck when harry and ginny appeared behind ron on the stairs they were all looking at her worriedly her friends ginny looked sad ron looked miserable and harry he looked as though he were holding the weight of what had happened fully on his shoulders something snapped inside of her like the breaking of a dam tears began streaming down her face as she sank to the floor why cantthey just leave us alone she cried at the top of her lungs ron was kneeling by her side almost instantly but he didnttouch her his jaw was set in a rigid line although he looked as though he might burst into tears filth muck betrayers of blood vile beasts of contaminated veins hermione hoisted herself up from the ground and whipped her wand out from her back pocket incendio without thinking she had aimed at the portrait of mrs black and set the canvas to flames she dropped her wand and covered her face with her trembling hands what was she doing had she gone completely mad mrs black shouted insults suddenly turned to shrill screams of terror and with hermione face still in her hands two strong arms encircled her waist and she felt herself being almost lifted off of the ground however the arms werentron s hermione opened her eyes to see ron standing in front of her with an astonished and somewhat angry look on his face get off of her he shouted as he wrenched the hands away from her waist everything was happening in super sonic speed moody stumbled away from her ginny was now crying on harry shoulder tonks and molly had entered the room looking frightened and ron arms had now encircled her she lowered her head to sob into his chest and as she felt her knees buckle ron sank slowly with her to the floor moody hobbled over to the portrait and shouted an incantation that caused the flames to extinguish before marching back to stand before her and ron listen now i understand that she upset but you re going to have to restrain her she cantjust start setting things on fire and i saw you pull that wand out of your back pocket missy and that just just well not the point if that fire had spread it could ve burned the whole that quite enough alastor hermione lifted her head from ron chest to see albus dumbledore standing in one corner of the entrance hall he must of apparated but hermione hadnteven heard a tiny pop he was approaching where she and ron were sitting on the floor with his long white beard flowing about his long dark purple robes miss granger dumbledore began softly she stared up into his crystal blue eyes behind his half moon spectacles they were such kind eyes i think it time that you harry and i had a talk a a talk sir hermione asked croakily her voice didntseem to want to work properly now oh yes dumbledore said raising his eyebrows your igniting mrs black portrait while constructive indicates a certain amount of frustration in you i think constructive she had simply felt like being destructive but now hermione realized that after the screams of terror had subsided the insults had not started back she glanced up at the portrait and to her surprise saw that only the top of mrs black head was visible she seemed to be peering over the bottom edge of the frame a mixture of fear and anger in her eyes the curtains that usually covered the painting now had large burned holes on them and part of the canvas was scorched dumbledore extended one long fingered pale hand to her which she took as ron arms fell from around her and she stood up from the ground she released his hand and he nodded toward the basement stairs apparently he wanted to talk in the kitchen so with one fleeting look at a confused looking ron hermione headed for the stairs mrs weasley tonks and ginny stood aside for her harry and dumbledore to descend once in the kitchen hermione and harry sat down at the table opposite dumbledore sitting there directly beside harry hermione realized just how little she had seen of him this term with his walking flying occlumency and quidditch she felt as if she had hardly seen her friend at all for awhile dumbledore just sat there drumming his fingers on the table and looking about the room before he cleared his throat and began in a calm and quiet voice now first i would like to inform you miss granger that your parents and grandmother are completely safe within the walls of your grandmother home they were a bit rattled when i arrived but i left them in the sunroom sipping mimosa and listening to one of your father old benny goodman records a rather nice style of music i might add but i digress dumbledore paused and stroked his beard a few times before peering over his spectacles at her and continuing if you dontmind my asking why do you not believe in harry prophecy miss granger hermione was a bit taken off guard she hadntreally expected him to ask her that question she had thought that dumbledore might scold her for setting fire to what was now harry property but apparently he knew her feelings on the prophecy had harry told him hermione cleared her throat awkwardly as she remembered that she was supposed to be answering the headmaster question sir hermione began timidly to be honest i think that divination is a very wooly discipline and since my third year when i had professor trelawney well i ve come to the conclusion that she is nothing more than a phony dumbledore smiled slightly closed his eyes and nodded slowly not quite the reaction hermione had expected miss granger i almost agree with you lock stock and barrel the only thing that you have gotten incorrect is the fact that sybil is a tad something more than a phony her great great grandmother was a very gifted seer unfortunately the gift was not passed on to sybil however there are times when sybil prophesies in an entirely authentic manner and i know that you want to ask how i know her prophecy for harry was authentic so i will tell you i was there to see and hear her give it you were there sir hermione asked in an incredibly small voice he simply nodded she turned to harry who was staring at her with deep concern tears wanted to come but she held them back harry why didntyou tell me i i just harry let out a small sigh i think that there was a part of me that didntmind so much that you didntbelieve it you know there was a part of me that felt like you would feel better and safer if you just went on believing that my destiny wasntto well to kill voldemort oh harry hermione reached out her arms and met him in a strong hug a few tears fell from her eyes but she continued to swallow the lumps that kept forming somehow she didntfeel as though she had just learned anything drastic or earth shattering maybe she had really believed in the prophecy the whole time or if not the prophecy she had somehow believed that harry would have to be the one to fight voldemort in the end after a few seconds hermione realized that dumbledore was probably waiting for her to release her death grip on harry so she released him and wiped away the stubborn tears that had fallen harry had a few tears in his eyes as well hermione looked up to see that dumbledore was humming quietly and admiring his fingernails he suddenly stopped however and placing his elbows on the table he touched his fingertips together harry dumbledore began i do believe it is time to inform miss granger and mr weasley what you have been doing all term what do you think harry looked over at hermione apologetically but then nodded at the headmaster dumbledore nodded back could you summon kreacher for us harry you can send him to retrieve mr weasley clearing his throat with a look of disgust harry said kreacher crack kreacher had appeared standing a few feet away from harry chair he bowed low to the ground keeping his eyes on harry with a look of pure hatred as he said yes master hermione hadntthought about the fact that grimmauld place house elf would now belong to harry but harry then gave kreacher a direct order go get my friend ron and harry looked up at dumbledore sir might i ask for ginny presence as well hermione noticed the corners of dumbledore whiskers twitch as he nodded his head harry turned back to kreacher yes and my friend ginny and tell them to come down here of course master kreacher said through gritted teeth crack kreacher was gone they waited mere seconds before hermione heard hurried steps descending the stairs from the entrance hall funny enough ron and ginny steps slowed right before their feet became visible from the kitchen they then descended the rest of the stairs at a normal pace and tried to appear casually concerned hermione could tell by their pale faces however that they had probably been upstairs pacing the entire time ron crossed the room to take a seat on the other side of her while ginny took a seat next to harry ron clasped his hands upon the table and began rubbing the pads of his thumbs together nervously hermione could feel him looking at her but she turned to give her attention to harry harry took a deep breath as he began in a calm voice there something i ve been keeping from you ginny gave an unexpected scoff at this they all turned to her including dumbledore please harry do you really think we believed you were going flying and walking every day i did ron exclaimed looking baffled i mean i thought it was odd but then it is harry thanks ron harry said with a small chuckle suddenly something clicked into place for hermione lumen contego she said quietly now everyone was looking at her you already knew how to cast that spell harry and dumbledore both nodded at her then harry spoke in addition to my occlumency lessons with dumbledore i ve been training everyday with remus what hermione and ron exclaimed together ginny was just sitting quietly with a strange smile slowly curving upon her face hermione had a flash of the dark circles that had been under harry eyes before the holiday they were gone now and hermione knew it was because he was having a well deserved break from his many lessons all of those times i wasntaround i was learning all sorts of defensive techniques it was my idea to keep it from you guys i guess i thought it might frighten all of you more to know that i was spending most of my time preparing for battle always looking out for everyone but number one you know harry potter you are human and all of these secrets are going to drive you mad ginny said sternly i feel better knowing that you re preparing yourself i sorry ginny harry said softly taking her hand and entwining their fingers ginny blushed slightly well she said with a slight pout i forgive you harry actually chuckled at her so harry hermione began what techniques have you learned exactly unexpectedly dumbledore chuckled softly oh miss granger you might want to rephrase your question to what techniques haventyou learned harry is an even quicker study than remus and i foresaw we have taught him above and beyond what we had even planned for him to learn this term he paused and looked at harry who waved a hand at dumbledore to continue dumbledore looked somewhat pleased with the opportunity to continue to sing more praises on harry oh let us see numerous shield charms and hex deflections invisibility charms blasting curses some memory charms a bit of legilimency along with his occlumency apparition animagus transfiguration what hermione ron and ginny had all cried at dumbledore last words animagus hermione was speechless y you can ron began looking at harry as if he d never seen him before i mean like is it you show us ginny said evenly she had one eyebrow raised as if she didnttruly believe what she had just heard hermione didnteither harry looked at dumbledore questioningly and dumbledore merely shrugged harry rose from his chair and backed away from the table slightly everything was completely silent dumbledore had a twinkle in his blue eyes harry slowly closed his eyes and hermione watched in awe as his back arched and elongated horizontal to the floor his legs and arms extended and he rested his hardening fists on the ground to support his weight his entire form began turning a solid sleek black as a course hair replaced his clothing his face was stretching to twice its length and his shoulder blades began lengthening and broadening into long wing like appendages hermione gasped as she looked at harry a pegasus she breathed ron had his mouth wide open but ginny was smiling brightly harry was at least seventeen hands tall and covered in shiny black hair except for his wings sprouting from slightly below his withers his wings were covered in soft black feathers and would surely span eleven feet if extended to his sides even his hooves were a shiny black there were only a couple of things that were of a different color his eyes were the same brilliant green but they had no pupils and were glowing fiercely and on his face where a blaze might have been was a lightning bolt marking of shocking white hair his mane lying to the right side of his neck and his tail were black and relatively coarse and messy he looked violently feral and beautiful hermione and ron seemed to be glued to their seats but ginny rose from hers and approached him she reached up a finger to his lightning bolt marking and stroked it gently amazing she whispered with a glowing smile harry lowered his head to nudge ginny gently under the chin as he snorted softly ginny giggled and stroked his nose hermione noticed that harry tail had begun to swish back and forth seeing as it was now slapping her in the face she stood up and crossed to feel of harry mane he turned to look at her with those glowingly fierce eyes and she found herself taking a step back ron was crossing around to the other side of harry and had begun playing with harry upright ear with an amazed smile on his face harry ear began twitching and he turned to snap playfully at ron fingers they all laughed professor dumbledore sir hermione began is he well i mean isntit illegal to yes and no dumbledore said matter of factly yes it is illegal for harry to be an unregistered animagus and no he is not registered with the ministry i feel it beneficial to harry to keep this newfound ability secret so can he fly ron asked in awe harry tapped his front hoof twice twice is yes once is no dumbledore offered wicked ron breathed so hermione began tentatively is it legal for harry to apparate then hermione felt a bit like a spoilsport asking dumbledore for the legality of harry new skills while ron and ginny were simply awestruck but she couldnthelp herself she didntwant harry to get himself into trouble i was able to pull some strings if you will and get the ministry to bend the age limit a bit for harry dumbledore said with a small smile suddenly harry beautiful muscular body began contorting back to his true human form before their eyes the black winged stallion had turned into their biped friend who was now crouched on the floor on all fours ron held his hand down and hoisted harry up dumbledore suddenly stood up from his chair with a small sigh well miss granger are you ready he asked softly for a second hermione didntknow what he was talking about but she quickly remembered that she was going to be taking a trip to visit her family in france her stomach twisted uneasily she most definitely wanted to see her family but she was also a bit hesitant would her parents let her return to school what if they forbade her surely they would fear for her safety they would be wondering if a kidnapper could reach her at hogwarts hermione stomach twisted a bit more she wondered that too

and have been used without permission no copyright violation is intended no profit is being made off this site it is for entertainment purposes only chapter 21 two days two whole days ron was sitting in the drawing room losing a chess match against harry with ginny and tonks as an avid audience this was wrong in so many ways ron never lost at chess especially against harry and if he did he was competitive enough to become highly annoyed however he was losing to harry and he was not annoyed in the least well he was not annoyed with himself for losing he was annoyed with himself for not insisting that he go with hermione to france she was going to be gone for two whole days dumbledore had escorted her by floo powder but he wouldntbe staying with her he was just dropping her off for two days after which time he would return to escort her back home or whatever this place was it wasnthome ron home was at the burrow but it was too risky hermione home was at her parent s but it had been invaded then again wasnthome where the heart was or something of that sort if that were true then ron home was currently visiting her grandmother in france checkmate harry muttered what oh ron looked down at the chessboard yes harry had won he had taken his queen with a bishop damn ron let out a long sigh she going to be fine you know harry said softly as long as dumbledore doesnttell anyone where she is she cantbe found the fidelius charm if it werentfoolproof do you honestly think the order would set headquarters here ron nodded at his friend he was right but ever since hermione had left that afternoon ron had been beside himself with worry he hadnteven gotten to talk to hermione since the attack he didnteven know what she was feeling exactly was she scared was she angry he knew one thing whatever she harry and dumbledore had talked about in the kitchen had convinced her of the prophecy authenticity so naturally he was worried about that too how did she feel about it was she scared was she angry argh ron wanted to pull his hair out he knew that she was at least somewhat distraught she had basically collapsed in the entrance hall bellowed out at voldemort and set sirius mother on fire now that ron thought about it she was more than somewhat distraught and then mad eye had had the nerve to grab her as if she were a rag doll that had seriously made ron blood boil he liked moody all right but didntlike how he had manhandled and then yelled at hermione who was already in enough distress as it was why why why hadnthe gone with her oh yeah dumbledore thought she should be alone with her family well maybe she should but that didntchange the fact that her absence was driving ron mad maybe he could sneak into the fireplace and floo over to check on her ms leda granger house that all it would take to be standing in hermione grandmother house what would happen if he appeared in the fireplace in front of the granger s who were probably fairly jumpy from the news of the attack on their house ron dad had told him about the strange metallic devices used by muggle dentists he might come out of the mission looking a bit like mad eye ron glanced over at mad eye who was in the corner of the drawing room reading a copy of the stealth apparently it was a newspaper that was not generally known to the entire wizarding community only those in auror work or high offices of the ministry were subscribed moody kept grunting every five or so minutes and turning the pages roughly as if he were angry at the rag c mon mad eye tonks said suddenly you cantkeep grunting like that and then not tell us what you re reading it very rude moody looked at tonks with a stern frown for a brief moment before standing up and limping over to where she and ginny were seated on an old wooden bench with an engraved snake along the back here he growled thrusting the newspaper into tonks hands you wontlike what you see mind you i need a scotch moody then turned and left the room presumably for the basement kitchen to find a drink tonks began thumbing through the paper her brows furrowed a bit more with each turn of a page ron noticed a picture on the front of a fisherman who kept looking to each side and then shrugging with a baffled look on his face ginny leaned over tonks shoulder a bit hey tonks exclaimed jerking the paper away your mother will have my hide if she sees you reading this why ginny asked stubbornly she didntwait for a response it just stupid we arentchildren we know that there a war going on we know that there are people dying and disappearing i dontlike being kept in the dark it only makes my imagination come up with its own morbid ideas to fill in all the blanks tonks twisted her mouth as if struggling with something harry was nodding in agreement with ginny yeah harry began matter of factly i mean think about it ginny been possessed by voldemort before i ve faced him five times and we ve all faced a horde of death eaters dontyou think we can handle a few newspaper stories tonks raised her eyebrows and inclined her magenta haired head in consideration well alright she said with a sigh handing the paper to a pleasantly surprised ginny but i going to stand watch at the door and if any of you hear me stub my toe it probably means molly coming probably ron asked curiously tonks shrugged i stub my toe often she said as she began walking toward the door i just saying that ow she had just rammed her toe into a writing desk and was now hobbling the rest of the way to the door see anyway if you hear me make any noise hide that paper after she had left the room and closed the door ron and harry sat down on either side of ginny on the hard wooden bench to peer down at the paper ginny had opened it to the first page which contained a table of contents a very bleak and disturbing table of contents table of contents 1 the lestrange theory 2 transportation mishaps trains planes and automobiles 3 muggles attempted explanations bermuda triangles are there more than one 4 the giants whose side are they really on 5 the ministry agenda 6 deaths by avada kedavra 7 deaths by other 8 suicides 9 harry potter quick myths and facts hey turn to that first one there harry said almost excitedly the lestrange theory ginny looked at harry in exasperation dontyou see that last one there harry it s it about you she said looking at harry to ron surprise harry smiled at her and kissed her on the nose they sure werenthiding anything ron briefly wondered if he should clear his throat to remind them of his presence i think i probably know everything they have to say about me but we ll read that one next alright he said thoughtfully putting his arm around her shoulders she shrugged and leaned into the crook of harry arm as she turned to the first piece where there was a short article and picture on bellatrix lestrange ginny read aloud the lestrange theory bellatrix lestrange azkaban escapee since january of 1996 is suspected by some to be the headmistress of the slytherin school of magic nothing has been heard of lestrange since she escaped with lord voldemort from the ministry of magic department of mysteries earlier this year as a loyal death eater she is believed to be located with or near lord voldemort it disturbing to say the least says amelia bones head of the department of magical law enforcement we do know that this slytherin school has a head mistress who wishes to remain anonymous in identity and location so it is disturbing that nothing seems to be known of this woman lestrange mrs bones also pointed out that lestrange brother in law and fellow death eater lucius malfoy escaped yesterday morning and has yet to be found malfoy wife and lestrange sister narcissa would not comment on her husband escape however authorities have searched her home and do not believe mrs malfoy to be hiding her husband lestrange theorists believe malfoy may now be with his sister in law and that if found the slytherin school of magic more death eaters and even lord voldemort himself may be found as well blimey harry ron said in surprise you think these people are onto something harry was rubbing his chin slowly with one hand looking distracted i ve been a lestrange theorist ever since i heard that blasted song at the sorting hat ceremony harry let out a sigh and looked from ginny to ron there a small detail that i left out of my dream when i retold it ron heart clenched painfully in his chest a small detail please donthave anything to do with an adorable bushy haired brunette ron pleaded silently ginny didntlook worried however she looked a bit angry she had sat up from the crook of harry arm and was sitting on the edge of the bench turned toward him harry she moaned in aggravation i asked you multiple times earlier if there was anything else you were hiding from me and you said no harry sat up and grabbed both of ginny hands in his again ron wondered if he should clear his throat to make his presence known ginny harry began patiently i honestly forgot about this honestly it not really anything that big okay listen in my dream you remember that i said bellatrix was in the corner laughing when voldemort used crucio on pettigrew yes ginny said apprehensively well harry continued she was wearing plain black robes but there was an official looking insignia on them similar to that of the hogwart slytherin seal her robes well they sort of reminded me of something a professor would wear i had forgotten about that until just now when you read that article ginny let out a small sigh oh well did you tell dumbledore and the order about that small detail harry nodded at her they both leaned back in the bench and ginny resumed her position in the crook of harry arm she began thumbing through the paper again ron remembered the pallid looks that harry would get whenever anyone mentioned that stupid school now ron had a lestrange theory of his own she was the murderer of harry godfather that woman in charge of a throng of slytherin students could not be good for harry future task wherever this school was it must be where voldemort was so were these students intended to be an army would harry be forced to find this school in search of voldemort these are just your basic boring facts ginny said absently ron looked down to see that she had turned to the back of the paper to the article on harry you know only known survivor of the killing curse faced voldemort five times speaks parseltongue conjured a corporeal patronus at the age of thirteen blah blah blah i glad to see that you appreciate all that i ve done harry said teasingly ron cracked a smile but ginny just continued to read the myths are fairly interesting though she cleared her throat before continuing harry potter is not the son of voldemort he is not a werewolf or vampire he has not been asked to tour with the weird sisters at this ginny stopped to burst out laughing so wings you mean you arent touring with the weird sisters ron exclaimed in mock exasperation harry punched ron playfully in the arm ginny began thumbing back through the paper ron and ginny had been taking turns calling harry by his new nickname tonks had come up with it ron still couldntbelieve that his best friend could turn into a large winged horse at will from what ron had always heard anamagi had to study for a long time to be able to transform properly however dumbledore had said that harry had learned fairly quickly and he had also said that harry was only the third wizard that he knew of that could turn into a magical creature ron wondered who the other two were oh jumping jellyworms ginny suddenly exclaimed incredulously some muggles actually believe that the recent boat and plane disappearances are due to paranormal sites over water such as something they call the bermuda triangle since there have been so many disappearances lately they believe that there are more of these triangles appearing out in the oceans i remember learning about the bermuda triangle in grade school harry said that must be what the picture of the fisherman is about ron offered bermuda triangle what rubbish the death eaters were just having fun blasting the planes and boats to smithereens ginny began flipping more pages she gasped look at at all the deaths harry and ron both leaned over her there was name after name of the deceased some were witches and wizards but they were mostly muggles ginny then exclaimed graham pritchard who ron asked the name sounded vaguely familiar he was a third year slytherin student ginny scanned the page with her index finger apparently his whole family mother father two sisters and himself were killed when his parents refused to turn to the dark side so horrible harry took the paper from her suddenly and folded it up we ve seen enough of this i think he stood up then tonks is probably growing tired of playing watch maid anyway ginny looked up at him and smiled slyly why dontyou just use your legilimency to see for yourself whether or not she growing tired i not that good yet harry replied plainly reaching down to grab her hand and pull her up i still have to use the incantation and make eye contact and whatnot and even then i dontdo it properly every time well you re still brilliant said ginny sincerely nowstanding next to harry and smiling up at him ron was still sitting on the bench looking up at his sister and best friend they love each other ron didntknow exactly how he knew but there was something in the waythey were looking at one another right then that made it perfectly clear it made ron heart ache for more than one reason one he was worried about the woman that he loved and she wouldntbe back for two days secondly he was deeply grateful that ginny and harry had found this love but it was bittersweet it reminded ron of how quickly they were all growing up and lastly he had found a love at least as strong as theirs but he was currently hiding it away in his heart suddenly ron realized something since harry and ginny seemed to be together now harry might not feel as though he d be losing his two friends if he and hermione were to get together ron heart skipped a beat the rest of that day drug by so slowly so slowly after he harry and ginny had left the drawing room the latter two had gone up to a dark high ceilinged room on the second floor which was where he and harry would be sleeping later that night ron hadntfollowed and didntreally want to think about what they were doing so instead he had helped his mother and tonks clean up around the kitchen and entrance hall in a desperate attempt at occupying his time luckily mrs black was still sulking at the bottom of her painting silently so she hadntshouted when tonks dropped and broke a large glass vase although ron could still hear some low mutterings coming from the painting ron dad had arrived late from work but he had worked overtime in vain he had found no news on the granger attack or lucius escape of course not that that was his job but ron had still had his fingers crossed all day he thought his father might at least have some news from the auror office or something but no nothing around ten o clock that night ron couldntstand anymore excruciating minutes of worrying so he turned in for the night quickly followed by harry across the room harry seemed to fall asleep instantly but ron was simply lying on his back staring at the ceiling pig and hedwig had both arrived at number 12 earlier that evening but ron wouldnteven dream of sending one of them out with a letter to hermione that was way too dicey if someone intercepted his owl it might lead the death eaters straight to her with or without the fidelius charm on the house ron actually wasntsure of this he didntunderstand the charm completely but he was not going to take any chances suddenly ron kicked the covers off and sat up this was ridiculous he was kidding himself thinking he would fall asleep anytime soon prowling around the house seemed like a fairly good idea however ron quietly left the bedroom his bare feet padding along the cold wooden floor he walked slowly down the hallway passed ginny and hermione room it was very dark and ron heart jumped into his throat when he realized that there was a figure standing silently in the corner at the end of the hallway he froze where he was the first thing he thought was where my wand quickly followed by shit it in the bedroom it just me ron felt the tension slowly fall from his body as he heard the whispered voice of tonks what are you doing lurking around the corners like that he asked before he took a deep breath you nearly made me jump out of my skin sorry i working the graveyard shift she said matter of factly moody will take over for me in a few hours what are you doing lurking around cantsleep he offered darkly ron suddenly remembered something he had wanted to ask tonks earlier hey tonks ron began hesitantly she raised her eyebrows slightly what exactly was written on the granger walls she twisted her mouth the same expression she had made when she had been trying to decide whether or not to let he ginny and harry read the stealth she let out a small sigh like kingsley said earlier some rather crude things i want to know ron said stubbornly this was only half true he wanted to know about as much as he didntwant to know if that even made sense well i guess i could tell you she began slowly i agree with your sister you arentkids anymore but to your mother you will always be her babies so dontmention anything to ginny okay i think it would just upset her unnecessarily ron merely nodded as tonks continued there were of course multiple derogatory names for muggles and muggle borns messages of that sort are often found in invaded muggle homes however there were other comments that didntrefer to her bloodline such as weasel lover book loving cow potter bitch and um the redhead whore tonks looked away briefly with furrowed brows before giving him an apologetic frown ron swallowed hard as he felt his heart rate quicken and a surge of anger shoot through his veins i figured on rubbish of that sort ron said through gritted teeth he wasntsurprised in the least at what the death eaters had written it just made their intentions more real hearing tonks repeat those awful things suddenly ron knew what he had to do he couldnttake it any longer he couldnttake not knowing anything could happen well i guess i going to try to get some sleep ron lied tonks gave him a weak smile and to ron delight she turned for the loo she shut the lavatory door after giving him a brief wave as soon as he heard the soft click of the door he hurried as quickly and quietly as he could down the flights of stairs all the way to the basement author note okay another semi cliffhanger i dontknow what gotten into me lately but dontworry the next chapter is in the making please continue to send in reviews i still get excited with each new review that comes in thank you thank you thank you to my readers and reviewers the characters and situations of harry potter depicted in this story are the legal property of j k rowling bloomsbury and aol time warner and have been used without permission no copyright violation is intended no profit is being made off this site it is for entertainment purposes only chapter 22 hermione was lying on the small featherbed in the small guestroom located off of the small kitchen of her grandmother small house this was where she had spent part of her summer holiday but it hadntseemed so small then so cramped like everything was closing in and making breathing a bit more difficult over the summer the bed had seemed adequate the room cozy the kitchen quaint and the house peaceful now everything seemed different her parents and grandmother had been asleep for at least an hour by now but hermione had just been tossing and turning not only was her body restless but also her mind she was reminded of that first night at hogwarts after the summer holiday unwelcome thoughts of the prophecy and harry dream had accompanied her in her bed as she cried herself to sleep at the time she had believed the prophecy to be bogus and the kidnapping to be merely hypothetical now however she was being accompanied by thoughts of harry authentic prophecy and her attempted kidnapping her parents had been very doting and concerned when she had arrived she had quickly lost count of the number of times she was asked the question are you sure you re alright the truthful answer was no she wasntalright she wanted to scream cry and laugh all at the same time those were surely the only ways to relieve the tension and stress she was feeling but she had answered yes i am alright it might have been more beneficial to her emotional health if she had been honest with her parents and said no then they could have talked through their feelings on the attack but if hermione told them how scared she actually was they might be compelled to forbid her from finishing her school year that couldnthappen hermione was determined to go back to hogwarts she wouldnt let those awful death eaters scare her away from living her life so yes i am alright was the answer she had chosen the answer that would not allow for screaming or crying and now that she was alone she still couldntscream everyone was asleep and crying well crying seemed like it would take too much energy as for stress relief through laughter the idea of laughing was almost laughable laughing was impossible at the moment there was not one happy cell in her entire body but as she lay there in that small bed in the small guestroom off the small kitchen of the small house hermione knew what she needed ron it was as simple as that throughout the entire term she had had ron at her fingertips whenever she was in distress after malfoy harsh words ron was there under the willow trees ron was there after the hogsmeade attack ron was there after the boggart incident ron was there at grimmauld place ron was there being in his arms was a much more powerful stress reliever than screaming crying or laughing but she was hundreds of miles away from his strong arms swoosh hermione entire body froze except for her heart her heart was beating no thrashing madly she knew that sound that was a very distinct swooshing sound that could only mean one thing someone had just flooed into her grandmother kitchen fireplace ever so slowly hermione was able to unfreeze her limbs and slide silently off the bed her feet touched the wooden floor lightly and she grabbed her wand from her bedside table hands shaking everything was black except for a small sliver of light from the crack in hermione almost closed door the light was coming from the moon outside the kitchen window taking a deep breath hermione began inching her way to the door wand ready maybe she had fallen asleep and not realized it maybe the swooshing sound had been in a dream scrape hermione body temporarily froze again okay hermione thought i am fairly positive that i am not sleepwalking so there is someone or something in the kitchen that has just rammed into a chair what if it were a death eater but they couldntfind her could they not with the fidelius charm maybe it was an auror coming to check on her what if something had happened at grimmauld place and someone was coming to give her devastating news this last thought seemed to carry hermione to the door a bit quicker until she was close enough to peer out of the crack hermione throat seemed to grow taut with fear she could see a lone figure a tall thin man he was in the shadows edging his way closer to the stairs the stairs that led to her parent and grandmother rooms she couldntmake out any details of the intruder but wait this intruder had a very distinguished gait a very familiar long legged lanky gait hermione pushed the door open slightly ron the intruder froze for a mere second before turning around on his heel he stepped forward out of the shadows and hermione saw two troubled blue eyes a pair of striped pajamas and a head full of messy red hair ron suddenly hurried to her side and looked down at her with concern she was gaping up at him neither one of them spoke for a few seconds but then hermione snapped out of her astonished gaze and grabbed hold of ron arm she pulled him hastily into her room and shut the door silently behind them total darkness lumos hermione whispered the bright white light was near blinding so hermione tucked the wand into the tops of her pajama pants in back now she could look up into his still concerned face ronald what in merlin name are you doing here she whispered urgently keeping her hold on his arm is something wrong at grimmauld place he simply shook his head and in a barely audible whisper said no well then what do you mean by flooing here and scaring the living hermione stopped mid sentence as ron enveloped her in his strong arms resting his head on top of her own her ear was now pressed to his chest and she could feel his warmth and hear his rapidly beating heart ron was squeezing her tight and suddenly hermione heard a small sniff before she could speak pull away or even move in the slightest ron released his hold grabbed her hand and pulled her toward a small pink lounge chair in one corner of the room she knew that he meant for her to sit so she did so removing her wand from the tops of her pants and placing it on the floor still lit it was casting an almost blue glow on ron face it wasntshockingly bright since it was sitting on the floor but it was bright enough for hermione to see a few tears rolling down ron cheeks as she peered up at him now she was really beginning to get frightened what wasnthe telling her why was he here why was he crying suddenly he lowered down to kneel in front of her as she sat with her legs ankle to ankle knee to knee she began hesitantly ron what ron brought two long thin fingers to rest gently on her lips silencing her the touch sent a small shiver through her hermione i sorry if i frightened you but i couldntsleep not knowing for certain that you were alright he said quietly her heart was melting so that what the tears were for he had been that worried about her so worried that the sight of her caused him to shed tears of relief he lowered his fingers from her lips and clasped both of her hands in his hermione there something i have to tell you he said with a pained expression hermione felt a lump forming in her throat she held his gaze as he held her hands she was waiting on him to continue but he just continued to stare at her his tears had ceased does anyone know that you re no so you just snuck yes but ron you could get in so much i know hermione just stared into his eyes for a moment before taking a deep breath and asking softly what is it that you have to tell me ron broke eye contact with her for the first time since he d knelt in front of her he was now looking down at her hands on which he still had a firm hold hermione heart was beating frantically she d never seen ron like this before she wasnteven sure if she had ever seen him cry and now he had to tell her something something about the kidnapping something about harry something about us ron cleared his throat but still didntlook up from her hands how is your family that not what you have to tell me hermione said quietly he looked up at her then and smiled slightly hermione felt some of the tension leave her just a bit no he said his smile fading but how are they hermione wanted to ignore his question and force him to reveal the something that he had to tell her but she merely sighed and said dumbledore explained the war to them and insured them that hogwarts was one of the safest places in the wizarding world they re going to let me go back they were worried well they still are but i told them that i was alright are you he asked worriedly his mouth set in a firm line one eyebrow slightly raised hermione heart sighed was he trying to kill her with his gentility sincerity and compassion y hermione stopped herself she had said yes so many times that day she had almost done it without thinking but this was ron she didnthave to hide anything from him i scared she said simply was that her voice it sounded so distant hermione saw a muscle clench in ron jaw he released one of her hands and rubbed over his forehead a few times his eyes closed tightly me too he admitted darkly before standing up unexpectedly and tugging gently on her hand for her to rise as well she did ron was looking down at hermione questioning face he knew she must be utterly confused at the moment he had been very vague about his reasons for coming to see her vague but honest he was simply worried about her although there was also that something that he had to tell her had to did he have to yes after the horrifying events of that day yes he had to tell her hermione he began but her expectant expression caused him to falter what was he waiting for for some reason the words wouldntcome well if he couldntsay it then he would show her he closed the meager space between them and bent down to place a light kiss on the small freckle to the right of her left eye hermione had closed her eyes at the contact but had also tilted her head up with what looked like a hopeful expression he couldnthave denied her anything if he d wanted to and he didntwant to ron bent down slightly to gently press his lips to hers he felt her tentative hands come to rest on his forearms and slowly glide up to his biceps this minor contact encouraged ron to deepen their kiss as he did so he took her in his arms and crushed her to his chest even as he began to lose himself in the kisses that they were now giving each other in a gradually quickening pace ron was silently asking himself what he was doing at any moment harry could awake to find ron bed empty tonks or mad eye could check the room and notice his absence or there was also the slight chance that a member of hermione family could come downstairs to check on her what would they think if they opened her bedroom door to find her wrapped in his arms they might think he was attacking her that would be horrible or they might know exactly what he was doing that wouldntbe good either ron pulled away reluctantly and moved to sit on the edge of hermione bed he looked up at her now frowning face she looked a bit bereft of his kisses but she slowly came to sit beside him he looked into her big brown eyes had it only been last night that they had each shared their first kiss in the shed by his house just twenty four hours later he was sharing a kiss with her in her grandmother french home because some death eaters had tried to take her last night he had held his tongue in check when he had been tempted to tell her how he truly felt about her but now just one day later he knew that he could not keep his feelings hidden any longer they werentchildren anymore these were not feelings of mere infatuation and they were not living in peaceful times they were at war and when at war time was not to be taken for granted taking a deep breath ron was going to say it he was going to tell her but hermione spoke first ron i dontknow exactly why you came here tonight but i glad that you did i was well i was just wishing that you were here when you arrived she looked down and blushed slightly ron felt a rush of warmth move through him she had been wishing for his presence so i didntwake you he asked curiously no i couldntsleep me neither well obviously ron cleared his throat suddenly feeling a bit nervous so uh why were you wishing that i were here she rolled her eyes and smiled slightly i guess it a bit silly but i feel safer whenever you re around like you can somehow make me feel as though things arentas bad as they seem her smile turned warm as she looked at him but that what you try to do isntit that what friends do try to make the other feel better about things ron smiled and shrugged yeah well i love you hermione he had said it without even thinking it had just fallen from his mouth quickly quietly and without warning at first ron wasntsure if hermione had heard him nor was he sure if that made him relieved or anxious what do you mean she asked softly tentatively yet staring at him with direct intensity she had heard what does he mean ron hadntprepared himself for that question i he began croakily he cleared his throat which had suddenly decided to go dry i mean just what i said i love you ron swallowed hard awaiting her response with every fiber of his being frozen in time the intense look she had had was gone it had been broken by a welling of tears in her eyes ron wasntsure but he thought that this was a good sign hermione then scooted toward him on the bed until their hips were touching she wrapped her arms around his neck just after he saw a few of her tears fall one side of her face was flush against his own and he could feel her moist tears on his cheeks he wrapped his arms gently around her waist as he heard her sniff softly before whispering directly in his ear i love you too ron weasley ron squeezed hermione as tightly as he could without harming her as a foreign current swept through every vein in his body he turned his lips upon her damp cheek and caressed her with his mouth before tracing a line of kisses over her jaw line and onto the side of her neck as he kissed her neck he noticed that her pajama collar revealed her collarbone so he kissed that too his mouth brushed across the entire length of this exposed bit of her anatomy hermione suddenly grabbed his chin with one hand and pulled his mouth up to hers for a passionate kiss that gave ron a new respect for the french culture ron wasntsure how it happened maybe he blacked out for a brief moment after this kiss but somehow hermione had lain back against the soft feathers of the mattress and ron had leaned over her his forearms resting on the soft sheets on either side of her head she had stretched her arms up to lie above her head on the mattress and ron was gripping her arms with his hands as they continued a steady rhythm of lingering kisses ron felt as if his heart might burst from his chest they had just confessed their love for one another this meant that their relationship had just taken a huge step forward into uncharted territory it was definitely a territory that he wanted to be in but was it one he was prepared for no matter what had happened between them over the course of this term she was still perfect hermione granger and he was still just ron weasley how would he not botch this thing up these thoughts were disturbing yet they were only occupying a very small portion of his mind she loved him and that was all that mattered at the moment he was lost in her kissing hermione had been itching at him for a very long time but he would have never imagined it would be this wonderful every one of his senses was filled with her however as ron lay there half of his body on top of her he became a bit weary there were so many emotions coursing through him and it was creating a desire of such magnitude that he had never felt before his hands wanted to go places that they shouldn t and his mind had already traveled to a place that it shouldn t nonetheless ron allowed one tentative hand to glide down her arm and down the side of her torso until he reached her waist he squeezed her slightly suddenly hermione brought one hand down to clasp his at first he was fearful that his touch had made her feel uncomfortable but she then led his hand under her flannel shirt and held it against the warm soft side of her waist ron was so startled by this boldness that he pulled his lips away from her and stared down into her beautiful face her lips were red and slightly swollen her cheeks were flushed and her eyes were hungry yet full of innocence ron closed his eyes to the urges that were coursing through him this woman was surely going to be his undoing hermione had been so completely lost in her and ron intimate moment that she had glided his hand under her shirt to grip her waist it had just happened she hadntthought it through before she had done it she hadntbeen thinking at all since she heard ron say i love you but now he had pulled away from her and was looking down at her with a stony calculating look hermione he began quietly he sounded anxious i just wanted to feel your hand on my skin she said softly breathlessly truthfully the proof of her embarrassment was creeping up her neck and cheeks he didntrespond but instead he looked away from her and she saw that muscle clench in his jaw oh no she thought fretfully he must think that i one of those what did he call them scarlet women this was only the night after their first kiss ron she began tentatively he looked back down at her i really not a a randy teenager i dontknow what came over me to her surprise ron face broke into a broad grin i know that he said simply still smiling at her she smiled back weakly and her heart expanded he was so beautiful well then hermione began slowly her smile fading why did you stop kissing me and look away ron broad grin faded as well and he cleared his throat turning a deep pink hermione i he sighed with a hint of frustration you are very desirable to me and i was having a time keeping my hands away from things before you put my hand here he squeezed her gently on her waist with his warm long fingered hand his face was possibly the most scarlet hermione had ever seen it and by the heat in her face she was sure that hers wasntmuch lighter desirable her mouth was dry and all she could manage was a few nods of her head and a timid smile he smiled back at her then and their eyes locked hermione suddenly felt as if she would be able to see his soul if she stared hard enough and she had the distinct impression that ron was thinking the same thing about her swoosh hermione heart clamped painfully and her eyes mirrored ron as they opened in terror oh shit ron whispered harshly ron hermione reprimanded as she pushed them back up into a seated position get under the bed no ron hermione we dontknow who out there he said sternly before he stood walked quietly to her still lit wand by the corner chair picked it up said nox and then walked hurriedly back to her take this he said brusquely he then retrieved his own wand and began slowly making his way to the door we dontknow who out there yeah right it had to be someone from grimmauld place that had seen ron empty bed hermione rose and began following behind him since it was now totally dark again hermione reached out and grabbed hold of the back of ron t shirt ron reached behind him with his free hand and pried her hand away from his shirt to hold tightly as he reached the door he slowly opened it a crack with his wand hand hermione was holding her breath she felt ron tense up for a moment before he released her hand and grabbed his head with both hands oh no he moaned taking a step back the door swung open spreading light into the darkness and in walked tonks she waltzed in and looked from ron to hermione with a rather smug expression well are you quite finished or should i come back in an hour or two hermione rested her face in her hands this was absolutely mortifying tonks ron began apprehensively it really not what you think we were just hep hep hep hep hep she said quickly hermione looked up to see tonks holding up both hands to stop ron mid sentence please hot lips spare me the gory details i just here to collect you before i trade posts with moody what ron asked surprised so you aren t mad listen stud she began matter of factly i only went to the loo so i could come right back out and follow you i could tell from your eyes that you werentgoing to be going back to sleep oh ron said blandly so you i saw you floo over here like a bat out of hell but i thought that you both probably needed some stress relief tonks pursed her lips to hold back a smile but she didntdo a very good job of it anyway it time to end this little rendezvous i dontthink moody and i will see eye to eye on this matter thank you tonks hermione said softly tonks smiled at her it was an understanding smile that reminded hermione a bit of ginny sure she said with a sharp nod tonks ron began uneasily do you think that you could maybe not mention this to anyone tonks actually laughed a little at this do you think i want to reveal to anyone that i let you sneak over here in the middle of the night no no no come on studly cannons tonks said with a smile before looking from ron to hermione she twisted her mouth to one side hmm i ll go wait by the fireplace so you two can say goodbye and by goodbye i mean thirty seconds tops with a small wink at hermione tonks quickly left the room closing the door behind her hermione lit her wand and turned to see ron looking at her with a sheepish grin she couldnthelp but smile back at him do you know how much worse that could have turned out for us he asked moving a bit closer to her much worse she replied his blue eyes were shining as he looked at her thirty seconds and then she wouldntsee those eyes for another day and a half with a sigh hermione stepped forward and threw her arms around his neck wrapping his arms about her ron squeezed her to him sending chills cascading down her body ron whispered in her ear dontforget what i told you tonight i won t she whispered before kissing him tenderly on his neck her heart was so full of love for this red haired gentleman they shared a few more kisses before they parted from their embrace and she regretfully opened the door for him he traced a finger down her cheek and smiled warmly at her before turning to enter the quaint kitchen where he left her behind in her cozy bedroom feeling completely stress free author note hurray sorry that this chapter took a while but i

herself humming quite often and if she didntfind herself humming her mum would what that tune you re humming dear her mother would ask and hermione would then realize oh i was humming wasnt i they werenteven songs just random notes here and there ron weasley loved her as soon as he had left that night hermione had lain in bed smiling to herself as she drifted into a peaceful sleep she had even had a wonderful dream about him something about them flying on the back of a pegasus but not harry this one was white there had been beautiful music in the background maybe this was the music that she had been singing of late hermione knew that her mum dad and grandmother were pleased yet curious with her quick recovery her dad had said something like that our little gryffindor but she wasntanywhere near as brave as they were being led to believe hermione knew that if she had room in her brain for thoughts on the attempted kidnapping she would have been nervous and agitated but there was only room for three words in her mind i love you dumbledore arrived around sunset to pick her up they were to use a portkey hermione wasntespecially fond of this means of transportation it gave her a funny feeling behind her navel however she didntreally care how they got back she was ready to see ron again of course there was a bittersweet side to her return she would arrive at grimmauld place she would see ron for the first time since they confessed their love for one another yet she would only be able to hug him in greeting smile at him harry still needed them both in the shed at the burrow hermione and ron had agreed that harry did not need to feel as though he were losing his two best friends she had come to this conclusion before she truly believed in the prophecy and now that hermione knew what harry future held she realized just how much he was going to need their support but still as hermione said her goodbyes to her family grabbed her suitcase and then took hold of the empty box of lemon drops that dumbledore had brought her stomach squirmed with excitement at the thought of seeing ron yes it would be bittersweet but although hidden her and ron love would still be there it would just need to be silent for a while by the time she and dumbledore appeared on the walk outside of grimmauld place that lead to the battered black painted door the sun had set completely the moon and stars were twinkling up above and a worn looking mr weasley was just making his way to the front door he must have just apparated from work at the time of her and dumbledore arrival oh mr weasley said as he turned around to face them sounding a bit startled before continuing in a thoughtful voice dumbledore good to see you and hermione how was your visit oh it was fine thank you hermione said politely remembering something hermione sat down her suitcase and reached into her pocket to pull out a couple of small batteries mr weasley these are for you i told my dad that you er were a collector they re from my grandmother television remote mr weasley took the batteries in his hand and a pleasantly surprised smile brightened his face how kind i should give him a ringer on the fellytone well if we had one that is but oh thank you wow a televised remoter a look of awe swept over his face as he slowly reached down to pick up hermione suitcase with his free hand before turning to enter the house dumbledore walked hermione to the door but simply said goodnight to her and mr weasley saying that he had to prepare for a weeks worth of meetings with the wizengamot hermione briefly wondered what the meetings would be covering but her stomach butterflies soon interrupted these thoughts as she and mr weasley entered the house mr weasley sent her suitcase up to her room with a flick of his wand before he went to the basement surely following the aroma of potato soup that was drifting about the entrance hall from the kitchen hermione noticed a pink haired tonks sitting on the tattered green sofa in the corner of the entrance hall she looked up from her newspaper and smiled knowingly at hermione after mr weasley descended the stairs wotcher hermione tonks greeted her brightly hello tonks hermione said with a slightly timid smile alright super tonks replied cheerily before her expression changed to mock concern but something bizarre is about with the teenagers in this house i not sure if it contagious but two of them have seemed to become glued at the hip and as for the other one hmmm he been right antsy yet all of them seem to smile endlessly hermione giggled a little well if those are the symptoms i hope it is contagious tonks laughed at this as ginny appeared at the top of the basement stairs hermione ginny exclaimed smiling hermione noticed that a portion of ginny long shiny hair was pulled back with a small butterfly barrette it was the one harry had given her for christmas ginny hurried over to her and took her by the arm unexpectedly ginny began dragging hermione toward the stairs hermione turned around to wave goodbye to tonks as she was ushered up the stairs and into their room oh my goodness ginny began what happened when ron went to see you hermione mouth fell open slightly he he told you about that hermione wasntupset about ginny knowing she was just surprised that ron would willingly give out that information to his sister well ginny began sounding mischievous the next morning he came down to breakfast singing singing so i took him aside and asked him what was up hermione smiled brightly he was singing ginny continued but he wouldnttell me any of the details and he wontlet me talk to harry about it she said with a pout but then a sly smile spread across her lips he did say i could ask you though hermione stomach fluttered madly for a couple of reasons one it struck hermione as an awfully sweet gesture for ron to keep their intimate moment private unless hermione wished to speak of it second hermione felt excitement at the thought of gossiping she d never felt that before but ginny enthusiasm was rubbing off on her and hermione suddenly wanted to tell her everything well not everything well hermione began slowly we kissed of course she paused to allow ginny a small squeal but then he told me that he that he loved me ginny let out a muffled whoop as she jumped up and down with one hand over her mouth and the other still gripping hermione arm when she had stopped bouncing around like a cornish pixie she whispered excitedly i ve always felt like we would be sisters one day hermione felt herself go slightly pink that sweet ginny but i think you re getting a bit ahead of yourself as hermione said these words her insides were actually saying yes i ve always felt that too but hermione didntwant to say these words aloud for the underlying fear that she would be setting her hopes too high too soon ginny continued to smile no i not sister she added slyly let go find the boys wait hermione said quickly she had a few questions of her own what about you and harry ginny brown eyes seemed to shine oh hermione he wonderful she looked off with a faraway look in her eyes as she said you ve been one of his best friends for so long i honestly dontknow how you fell for ron but i glad you did ginny hermione exclaimed with a smile that like me saying i cantbelieve you have lived with ron you re whole life and not fallen in love with him harry like my brother they both laughed at this before making their way up to the boys room ginny was talking so quickly and quietly as they walked up the stairs hermione was sure that she wasntcatching everything ginny was saying however she had heard her say that harry had not yet confessed his love for her she said that she could tell harry would move slowly in the relationship but ginny didntseem to mind as they reached the landing hermione heard a voice a low somewhat angry sounding voice coming from the boys room ginny stopped talking immediately and they exchanged worried looks edging their way closer to the nearly closed door they heard the distinct sounds of a heated argument ron you cantask me to do that harry exclaimed loudly ron sighed with great frustration and sat down hard on his bed this conversation was not going well at all ron had been in good spirits since his visit with hermione but this evening as her arrival grew nearer ron felt strong pangs of worry hit him unexpectedly book loving cow that was one of the things written on the granger walls ron had been talking with harry about quidditch a nice quiet chat when bang the cruel words hit him and he realized something the only people that would know of hermione studious nature would be those who saw her study habits those of hogwarts and what three death eaters had sons enrolled at hogwarts malfoy crabbe and goyle this realization had sent him into a frenzied state of panic why ever since the beginning of the term ron had wondered if harry might be missing something vital by becoming an occlumens and as the term wore on this curiosity had grown but now it was as if a light had gone on in ron head and he was suddenly determined to take absolutely every means necessary to protect hermione ron knew why malfoy crabbe and goyle had not enrolled in the slytherin school of magic he was almost one hundred percent sure that they were giving their fathers vital information about hogwarts about hermione he couldntlet hermione walk into that castle without knowing that he had done everything in his power to prepare her for the worst harry ron said sternly loudly it was malfoy that put the imperious curse on her and it was malfoy asshole of a father that attacked the granger home yes yes ron harry said frustrated you ve said this five times but why is that a reason for me to drop my defenses because harry ron continued we know that your dream was real it was not a false vision pettigrew helped lucius malfoy escape so that lucius malfoy could attempt the kidnapping but harry the attack failed now what do you think old lucius is going to ask of his dear son harry looked down sadly before saying through gritted teeth we will be with her everyday malfoy wonthave a chance to touch her alright but you cannot ask me to stop occlumency dontyou understand harry that why he dead harry shouted ron glanced toward the door harry was going to alert the whole house he would still be here this would still be his house i would still be his godson if i had known occlumency then ron felt as if a small rip had formed painfully on his heart but before ron could respond the bedroom door was thrust open banging loudly as it hit the inside wall ginny looking furious had walked in quickly followed by hermione ron muttered he closed his eyes to her angry stare and turned away from her how much had she heard ron felt as if he could truly be sick a pair of small hands gripped him on the arm and urged him to turn around he turned slowly to look down at his sister her face was blotchy with red marks of rage what are you thinking she yelled at him he cantdo what you re asking ron ron sighed with immense frustrationand looked up to see hermione standing near the door with her arms crossed she was looking down at her feet she looked so small and fragile ron then looked sadly at harry who had sat down on his bed and put his head in his hands ron hated this he hadntwanted to talk about any of this with hermione he hadntwanted to scare her further nor did he want to hurt harry but if there wereeven the slightest chance that theycould see what voldemort was planning they needed to know he had to know ginny had crossed over to stand in between harry knees as he sat on the edge of the bed she was hugging him around the neck and harry had his arms wrapped around her waist ginny listen ron began calmly all i asking is no hermione suddenly shouted her hands were balled up into fists at her sides and she was staring at him with a mixture of shock anger and sadness it was a look that made ron heart tear completelyin two hermione marched forward to stand a foot away from him all you re asking is that he risk the invasion of his mind and possibly his body it not worth it ron opened his mouth to respond but was cut off by the sound of harry shooting up off of the bed hermione that not true your safety is worth everything it just that voldemort could show me a false vision that would lead one of you to harm he could possess me and make me hurt one of you tears had begun falling down hermione face ron reached a hand toward her but she backed away from him and covered her face with her hands why didntthey understand why didntthey see harry ron began quietly i understand what you re saying but damn it ron just ginny yelled but harry grabbed her hand they looked at each other for a fleeting moment before ginny wrenched her hand from harry and sat down on his bed but what ron harry asked his voice sounded tired and weak all of a sudden hermione had gone to sit beside ginny but ron began there are ways that we could make certain that you wouldnthurt one of us i could ron felt disgusted with himself but he continued i could hold you down long enough for you to open your mind ginny shot up from the bed hold him down are you insane are you and what if i did see something how would we know if it were real harry asked ignoring ginny outburst we wouldn t ron said truthfully he knew that voldemort could show harry a false vision but he also new that there was a possibility of harry seeing something that could save hermione harry we could take the information to dumbledore to the order harry was looking at ron intently he was considering it ron felt a flicker of hope in his chest please please let at least try ron was pleading on the inside ginny was looking at harry with real fear in her eyes she approached him and grabbed hold of his forearm alright harry said quietly a rush of gratitude swept through ron but ginny immediately burst into tears while hermione stood up from the bed an astonished and fearful look in her eyes ron looked away from her his stomach twisting with guilt and self disgust no harry no ginny was pleading it was horrible watching his sister in so much pain she was still gripping tight to harry arm but he wasnteven looking at her harry took a couple of steps closer to ron and closed his eyes he then turned around so that his back was to ron ginny was still crying but she was now leaning on harry chest sobbing harry continued to ignore her not even offering to pat her on the back although ron looked down to see harry fists clenched so tightly his knuckles were white hermione had large tears falling down her face and she met ron eyes he felt a lump form in his throat but he ignored it he attempted a silent apology with his eyes but she looked away from him ron wanted to hurry up and get this over with so he took both of his arms and reaching around harry torso pushed ginny away from harry by her shoulders he got her far enough away to wrap his arms firmly around harry chest holding harry arms to his sides ginny suddenly began pulling hard on ron arms as her sobbing continued hermione put an imperturbable charm on the door harry said firmly harry please dontdo this please just hermione began softly hermione harry shouted hermione flinched at the harshness in his voice but she moved quickly to the door closed it and spoke a quick incantation ron had never seen or heard ginny cry like this before she had now sunk to the floor at harry feet ron continued to swallow the lump in his throat ginny please harry began quietly but sternly ginny she just continued weeping hermione take her harry ordered hermione looked hesitant take her harry shouted hermione flinched again but then grabbed ginny by the backs of her arms and managed to pull her back slightly it looked as though ginny had gone slightly limp and hermione kneeled down beside her ron moved back with harry to further their distance from the girls harry took a deep breath and went completely still everything grew silent even ginny sobs had stopped although tears were still falling from her eyes hermione looked frozen in time as she stared at harry face which ron of course could not see then without warning ron felt harry whole body quake before harry legs buckled and he began jerking madly ron kept his stance and held onto harry no harry bellowed suddenly as his body gave the biggest jerk yet ron arms slipped slightly but he held on his heart had clenched into a knot at harry shout and it was continuing to hold painfully seeing his friend in this state because of him was almost unbearable and then abruptly harry body went completely limp ron sunk with him to the floor and hurriedly laid harry on his back ginny and hermione both rushed forward tears in both of their eyes they were all peering over harry sweaty pallid face no harry whispered opening his eyes slowly ron and hermione both leaned back from harry to give him space as he was waking but ginny leaned over him her hands cupping his face harry ginny whispered she kissed him gently at the corner of his mouth her hair falling around him like a beautiful red curtain ron saw harry look into ginny eyes and that green flash that strange glow appeared or had it had he even seen it it was gone now suddenly harry sat up causing ginny hands to fall from his face they were all listening intently for harry to say something ron heart was pounding painfully in his chest as he looked at his friend blank expression harry what did you see ron asked tentatively it wasntyou hermione harry said his voice completely void of emotion hermione looked briefly from harry to ron but quickly looked away from ron when he met her eye ron knew she was angry with him but he still felt his entire body sigh with slight relief however his heart was still clenched painfully as he looked worriedly into his friend face unexpectedly ginny spoke in a quiet yet strong voice you saw me didntyou harry looked at her without speaking but he didnthave to harry blank expression had turned to a deeply sorrowful stare ron could tell that the answer to ginny question was yes suddenly a new wave of fear shot through him ginny but how could he see ginny in a vision if she were here now harry suddenly stood from the ground grabbing ginny hands and pulling her up with him we need to talk he said quietly and before ron brain could function enough to ask questions harry had led ginny from the room leaving him and hermione alone ron looked over at hermione who was sitting about two feet from him she was staring at him her jaw set and her eyes teary yet fierce how could you do this she asked shakily hermione ron began reaching a hand toward her she backed away and stood up quickly wiping at her eyes and cheeks she then began heading for the door ron shot up off the floor and cut in front of her blocking the doorway hermione stop he said evenly taking a firm hold on her upper arms she closed her eyes as he looked at her listen i feel absolutely awful for making harry do that but he only did it because he realized that i was right her eyes flew open right ron you were not right in asking harry to allow lord voldemort into his mind what is wrong with you ron sighed heavily hermione at the beginning of the term i gave you three reasons why you had nothing to worry about do you remember she just stared at him with her brow furrowed he asked more sternly do you remember what they were yes she said in an almost whisper tell me hogwarts dumbledore and you right ron said softly well hogwarts isntsafe for you anymore hermione not as long as there are people like malfoy there and as for dumbledore well he didnteven try questioning malfoy after that boggart incident i know he had his reasons but hermione i just feel like it up to me to protect you ron saw hermione swallow hard before asking well then whose job is it to protect harry hermione i knew harry would be fine you couldntknow that damn it hermione ron said a bit louder than he d intended he took a deep breath and began rubbing his thumbs on her arms which he was still gripping harry was fine i wasntgoing to let him hurt any of us i wasntgoing to let him hurt himself i love harry do you think i would do something that would put him in danger ron you did put him in danger hermione began in disbelief other than the pains in his scar harry visions have never physically hurt him before but voldemort is stronger than ever now there no way you could ve known what would happen well hermione interrupted him with a huge sigh if you re going to try and rectify this by mentioning harry vision then save your breath think about it ron he saw ginny ginny she was sitting right there how could he see ginny through voldemort eyes if she were here the whole time i ve already thought of that ron replied calmly i was just going to say that you know who body is stronger not his mind hermione began gnawing on the inside of her cheek as if considering what he had just said they were staring at one another ron felt as if her brown eyes were looking so deeply inside him that it might be wise to look away but he held her gaze ron why cantyou say his name she asked quietly looking away from him ron slid his hands down her arms and released his hold on her she turned her back on him and ron felt a new wave of self disgust why couldnthe say his name he could but he didntwant to he had been raised to fear the name and after meeting harry and becoming his best friend he had learned to hate the name saying voldemort name didntscare ron it disgusted him however he could feel the disapproval in hermione and harry eyes every time he refused to say the name hermione turned back around as the door suddenly burst open as it had earlier banging loudly against the wall it was ginny again but this time she looked hysterical her hair was completely down now the barrette gone she walked quickly and determinedly up to her brother raised her right hand and slapped him hard across the face there was a loud smack as ron face turned roughly to one side a hand flew to hermione mouth as she gasped this is all your fault ginny screamed pushing ron hard on his chest ron just stood there looking down at his sister with immense sadness in his eyes hermione suddenly felt a strong urge to embrace him but she stood back from the scene before her he saw me she cried he saw me in trouble and now now but ginny how could that be a true vision you re here ron asked quietly i know that but harry wontlisten to reason ginny screamed before tears began falling from her already tear stained swollen face he wontlisten she said quietly now he says his scar didnteven hurt but he saw me and now he says he cantbe with me anymore what ron asked in a whisper ginny then turned an imploring look upon hermione hermione stepped forward and embraced her friend hermione he says it too dangerous for me to get involved with him ginny said in a high pitched teary voice i told him that i loved him and he wouldnteven look at me ginny he loves you that why he doing this hermione said gently i know ginny whispered come on let go to our room okay hermione said as if talking to a child with her arm around ginny she began leading her out of the room she glanced at ron who looked sadly at her but she quickly looked away as she stepped into the hall she heard a faint hermione being called from behind her but she ignored it without looking back author note i know this chapter ends on an exremely melancholy note but everyone hang in there i was extremely teary eyed when i wrote it but ah i am now working on chapter 24 by the way i hope hope hope that i can post it by tomorrow but i am taking summer classes and we are having a test tomorrow that i have to study for so blegh also about ron being able to floo to hermione grandmother i wondered about this too but i then decided that since ron knew dumbledore was the secret keeper and he basically knew where the house was that he would be able to floo there i also recalled the fact that harry could floo his head over to grimmauld place in book 5 to look for sirius harry knew about dd being secret keeper and he also knew where gp was i dunno lol i guess the main reason i allowed ron to travel this way was b c i knew it would make for a sweet scene lol the characters and situations of harry potter depicted in this story are the legal property of j k rowling bloomsbury and aol time warner and have been used without permission no copyright violation is intended no profit is being made off this site it is for entertainment purposes only chapter 24 i hate him hermione i just hate him no you don t ginny hermione said for the third time since she and ginny entered their small room on the first floor she actually wasntsure if ginny were talking about her brother or harry regardless hermione knew that ginny didnthate either one of them hatred was not the issue no thought hermione the issue was being completely aghast and outraged at the man you love which was what both she and ginny were at the moment hermione still could not believe that ron would ask harry to expose his mind to the darkest wizard of all time it was outrageous despicable irresponsible and absolutely wonderful hermione had never had an inner battle of anger and love fighting like this before she was delighted at the thought of ron loving her so much that he would not stop at anything to protect her however she was fuming at the thought of him jeopardizing their friend life had he jeopardized harry life hermione wasntsure she knew that it jeopardized harry emotional and mental wellbeing but she couldnteven begin to fully understand his curse scar and connections to voldemort but the point was ron didntunderstand it either and he was acting as if he did thus hermione was aghast and outraged at ron weasley ginny on the other hand was aghast and outraged at harry potter hermione was sitting on the edge of ginny bed stroking her friend long crimson hair as she continued to cry although her loud sobs had subsided there was still a steady stream of tears falling from ginny eyes followed by an occasional hiccup all hermione knew was that harry had seen something involving ginny that had caused him to refuse her but she knew little else for she was waiting on ginny to be able to talk about it hermione patience was rewarded a few moments later when ginny sat up slowly and leaned back against her headboard clutching tightly to her pillow she suddenly reminded hermione of the little girl that she had been a few years ago hermione ginny began sounding a bit hoarse as she wiped at her eyes do you know what he saw no hermione replied softly as she shook her head he saw jagged rocks everywhere but he didntrecognize the place i was holding my arm it was bloody and i was screaming for him she said blandly it seemed as though she had cried until her emotions were too raw and exhausted to show through but ginny hermione began softly it impossible for that to be a true vision you re here i dontunderst hermione he knows that i know that ginny said in the same insipid voice but he said it didntmatter he said that voldemort must know how much i mean to him or else he wouldnthave shown him that vision so he feels like you re safer if you arentinvolved with him hermione said quietly ginny merely sighed pitifully in response hermione heart was breaking for ginny and harry it wasntfair that this was happening to two beautiful people knock knock knock hermione ron hermione looked at ginny who was now wearing a furrowed brow thin mouthed expression i cantsee him right now please dontlet him in here hermione hermione nodded and rose to go to the door she opened it a fraction of an inch and peered outside tears began stinging the backs of her eyes at the mere sight of him he looked absolutely miserable his beautiful blue eyes were sad timid and apprehensive it tore at her heart opening the door a bit more she asked quietly what is it ron hermione i understand if you dontwant to talk to me right now but harry needs you he said in a deep whisper that sent chills down hermione body despite her anger sadness and now fear what do you mean he needs me she asked hurriedly before turning to check that ginny was not overhearing them she had lain down again and her back was facing the door hermione turned back around to ron he ron began he sighed heavily when he came back to our room he laid down on his bed and now i think he crying hermione heartbeat seemed to pause crying she whispered ron nodded hermione me and harry we dontreally cry in front of each other but i think it might be good if you talked to him you know alright hermione replied looking into ron troubled eyes she looked down quickly he was pulling her in with that gaze but she was still mad at him let me say something to ginny she made to turn but ron grabbed her hand causing her heart to beat a bit quicker donttell her harry crying he wouldntwant her to know i know she whispered sadly ron released hermione hand and she disappeared into her room as he waited out in the corridor ron tried to make sense of the last hour he had done some really stupid things in his life incredibly stupid things that had made him feel really really bad but right now ron felt worse than he had in his whole life for doing something that he knew in his heart wasntstupid he had promised hermione at the beginning of the term that he wouldntlet anything happen to her and he had meant it he would not lose her he couldnt ron had been hoping that harry might be able to open his mind once a week or so hadntharry said a few days ago that he worried occlumency might result in him missing something important my father would be dead right now if harry hadnthad the vision of that snake attack ron thought but apparently he was going to have to use other means to ensure hermione safety no more asking harry to drop his defenses not after seeing the pain it had caused his best friend his sister and his love ginny had slapped him in the face but hermione might as well have when she walked out of the room without responding to his call when she d flinched at his touch that had hurt much more than a slap in the face she was furious with him she saw his actions at trying to be her protector as irresponsible and selfish exactly how mad was she mad enough to tell him to leave her alone for good ron heart clamped painfully as the door opened a bit wider and hermione slipped through the crack she then shut the door quietly behind her ron looked down at her and he felt that awful stab of guilt as she looked up at him with weary eyes has harry told you what he saw she asked quietly as they began walking toward the stairs ron didntlike the tone of her voice it was distant like she would rather be doing anything else in the world than talking to him at that moment no he responded truthfully harry hadntsaid one word to him he had just walked in like a zombie to collapse on his bed ron had initially decided to go fetch hermione to beg for her forgiveness it wasntuntil he left the room and heard harry gut wrenching sob that he decided to instead ask hermione to talk to harry as he and hermione neared the door to the second floor bedroom she quickly described harry vision of ginny injury ron was listening intently but something seemed to be missing from the story how could voldemort already know about harry and ginny they hadntreally begun much of a more than friendly relationship until the christmas holiday surely malfoy hadntnoticed anything between them unless he noticed them sitting together at meals but why wouldntvoldemort just show harry a vision of hermione in danger or me and what good would it do voldemort to show harry a vision involving a place that he never seen jagged rocks when he showed harry sirius it was because he knew harry would come to the department of mysteries did voldemort expect harry just to up and say ah well i guess i ll go search all the jagged rocks i can find something wasntadding up ron and hermione came to a halt outside the bedroom door ron strained his ears but he couldnthear any sniffs or sobs just silence i guess i should go in alone then hermione whispered looking up at ron with an unreadable stare he considered reaching out a hand to her but he didntthink he could stand seeing her flinch from his touch again so he simply nodded before turning to head for the stairs well he had wondered if he were ready for a serious relationship with hermione he had wondered how long it would take him to botch things up apparently it only took him around forty eight hours wow he thought i must be setting a new record ron ron turned back around slightly startled out of his thoughts to see hermione staring at him her expression still unreadable could you stay outside the door just in case he needs you ron highly doubted harry would want or need to see him tonight but he nodded and took a few steps closer to the door hermione had begun twirling one of her brown curls around one of her delicate fingers and she looked as if she might say something more but she then turned and quickly entered the dark bedroom ron sighed and leaned against the wall this was completely dreadful ginny was angry with him for presumably causing harry to call their relationship quits hermione was angry with him for presumably putting harry life in danger harry was surely at least a bit resentful toward him for asking him to drop his defenses to his mortal enemy and ron was torn between self disgust and feeling as though he had done what he had to do it took hermione eyes a moment to focus in the semi dark room but when they did she saw harry form stretched out atop his bed he was lying on his back but hermione couldnttell if his eyes were open although open or not she knew he wasntasleep harry she said quietly inching her way closer to his bed at first she wasntsure if he d heard her but then she heard his tired emotionless voice hermione i know what i did was stupid and dangerous but i really dontfeel like being reprimanded right now harry i haventcome to reprimand you then why did you come i came to see if you wanted to talk about anything i don t hermione leaned against one of the posts at the foot of his bed and looked down at harry shadowed face she could now see that his eyes were open and his brow furrowed it had been thoughtful of ron to come and get her for harry but maybe ron had been wrong maybe harry just needed to be alone right now hermione sighed and slowly turned to walk for the door i not going to tell dumbledore or the order hermione stopped in her tracks she turned back around to harry bed he was pushing himself up into a seated position so that his legs hung off the edge hermione went to sit beside him okay she thought maybe ron was right she allowed her silence to prompt harry into revealing his thoughts and feelings i know it was a false vision hermione my scar didnthurt at all ginny was right in front of me when it happened there no point in telling dumbledore or the order dumbledore would just be disappointed in me i ve promised him that i would never drop my defenses and as for the order i dontwant to upset mr and mrs weasley i agree i think telling dumbledore and the order would be pointless she said quietly harry looked up at her you agree he scoffed wow that sort of rare hermione smiled slightly but then swallowing hard she decided to push her luck harry um there is one thing that i dontagree with however she admitted apprehensively i dontwant to talk about ginny alright i ve made up my mind the less involved she is with me the safer she is he said sternly that goes for everyone you should understand more than anyone hermione ignoring this last comment hermione continued she loves you harry and i know that you love stop hermione harry said quietly this time it wasnta stern command it was a plea hermione took a deep breath swallowed the lump in her throat and took a hold of harry hand he looked up at her i didntget to tell you how proud i am of everything you ve learned with dumbledore and lupin hermione said trying to sound a bit more light hearted your animagus form is beautiful thank you harry said softly hermione could tell by his voice that he was more so thanking her for changing the subject it been really good for me you know he continued all these things i learning are giving me this thirst to find him hermione felt an unpleasant chill move down her spine she could only nod in response a thirst to find voldemort it made hermione stomach lurch she wanted to say harry you donthave to find him but she couldntsay that because it wasnttrue where ron harry asked suddenly oh um he about hermione replied trying to sound casual to hermione surprise harry chuckled slightly before calling out ron you can stop hiding out in the hallway hermione surprised expression toward harry quickly turned into a smile as a timid faced ron peeked around the doorframe he slowly walked into the room and came to stand before them his hands shoved into his jeans pockets and his head down he looked so pitiful but hermione could tell by harry expression that he wasntmad at ron suddenly hermione had a strong urge to embrace her two friends she stood up quickly and grabbed a hold of ron hand one hand still clasping harry s ron looked a bit startled as if he were surprised that hermione would touch him it made her want to cry but instead she looked deep into his blue eyes a strange shiver moved through her when she felt him squeeze her hand gently can we please have a group hug hermione asked tearing her eyes away from ron to look down at harry she felt a bit silly asking this question boys were strange and she was probably succeeding in creating an awkward moment for harry and ron but she didntcare harry actually smiled slightly standing up to put one arm around her shoulders and the other around ron s this was probably the first time they had ever hugged each other all at one time before she was crushed in between them she caught an immensely relieved look overcome ron face she knew that ron felt awfully guilty and she was thankful that harry wasntmaking him feel any worse although hermione felt a twinge of anger at herself for not attempting to sooth ron in the hallway she had contemplated it but she had let her frustration at him win out suddenly however ron grazed his hand down her back to her waist where he then began rubbing his fingers over the side of her stomach the warm contact was sending a pleasant current through her body and hermione knew that he was using this contact as a way to apologize to her seeing as how they didntknow when they might be alone again to show her acceptance of this silent apology she slid her hand from ron shoulder down to his waist where she squeezed him a couple of times slowly she ron and harry pulled away from one another hermione chanced a glance at ron and to her delight he gave her a small smile and winked at her it still made her heart skip a beat when he did that she felt herself blush as she looked away to see harry sliding his trunk out from under his bed um harry she asked curiously he opened his trunk reached inside and then stood up suddenly with a box in his hands it was the box lupin had brought harry on christmas eve harry set the box on his bed before turning to look at her and ron i have something i want to give each of you ron was a bit taken aback at harry statement wasntthat the box with all of sirius belongings harry opened the top of the box and began rummaging through it last year sirius gave me something he said to use it if i ever needed him harry began quietly he pulled out two objects wrapped in brown paper i forgot about it until after he died it might have been the difference between him living or dying but that neither here nor there i guess harry eyes were sad as he began unwrapping one of the objects here harry thrust the unwrapped object into ron hands it was a small square mirror ron feeling more than a bit confused looked up to see harry unwrapping the second object and then handing hermione an identical mirror i ve never seen them work before but apparently you can look into the mirror say the name of the owner of its twin and use them to communicate my dad and sirius used to use them while they were in detention harry hermione began in a whisper you re giving these to us but you should have them you could give one to dumbledore or no harry said plainly i really dontwant them it just reminds me that i he stopped abruptly and ron noticed his eyes becoming glossy before he swallowed and resumed smiling weakly it doesntmatter they re yours now i er actually broke one and had to use reparo on it you might want to try them out before you thank me for them thanks man ron said slapping harry on the arm hermione then hugged harry around the neck ron knew she was probably trying very hard not to cry so he decided to avoid an awkward silence by filling it so uh let try these out shall we i ll go out into the hall and call your name alright hermione ron had begun making his way to the door as he was talking but he stopped suddenly as his mirror began glowing a bit alarmed ron peered into the looking glass the actual glass was glowing with a dim blue light but he could still see his reflection ron looked over to see that hermione was doing the same when ron looked back down however the blue glow was fading and he watched as his reflection became very blurry when the blurred reflection came back into focus he found himself staring down at a lovely young lady ron smiled and hermione reflection smiled back at him brightly brilliant harry he breathed looking up at harry who gave him a no problem shrug when ron looked back down he was once again looking at his own reflection you know harry hermione began suddenly sounding excited i ve read about these types of devices in magical hermione voice hummed on in the background but ron was suddenly filled with a rush of excitement and it had nothing to do with what hermione had read in some book it did however have everything to do with the fact that he was now holding something that gave him unlimited access to hermione whereabouts as long as she held the twin to this mirror smiling to himself ron turned to look at harry and hermione his smile quickly faded however as he saw harry standing in front of a wide eyed hermione with an opened ring box in his hand it looked like an engagement ring obviously harry wasntproposing to hermione but something about seeing her standing in front of that ring made ron stomach cramp ron come look hermione exclaimed excitedly ron walked toward her slowly and peered down at the ring it was a thin gold band with a solitary diamond shining in the middle on either side of the diamond were two rubies ron didntknow anything about rings but he guessed it was pretty enough it was my mother s harry said softly before looking up into hermione still smiling face he chuckled and removed the ring from its velvet box hermione would you like to try it on i dontmind ron watched as hermione smile faded slightly and her face turned a bright pink she glanced up at ron for a split second before looking to harry and shaking her head oh no no really i just like looking at it harry it very beautiful harry shrugged and returned the ring to its box snapping the lid closed why had hermione become so flustered when asked to try on a ring granted ron was glad that she refused the stomach cramp he had received when seeing harry holding that box in front of her had increased tenfold when harry had offered to place the ring on her finger yeah harry began suddenly i was surprised that sirius had it lupin said my mother gave it to him before she and my dad went into hiding ron realized that he hadnteven commented on the ring with a sudden revelation he said yeah uh i guess your dad knew how to pick out jewelry that gold would go really well with someone with long red hair ron harry said somewhat sternly shutting up ron said quickly looking away from harry eyes but not before he caught a glimpse of a faint green glow author note okie dokie i somehow managed to balance my time today to where i could study and write a chapter so yay i feel like i am not giving my readers much in this chapter but there are

awoke the next morning with a rather excruciating headache it was one of those headaches brought on from crying and stress however as she rolled out of bed she did feel much better than she had yesterday before she spoke with harry and ron their group hug and chat was very effective in cheeringher up a bit however when she left their room the night before she had wanted so badly to kiss ron goodnight but she had to settle with a smile it might have been possible for ron to follow her out into the hallway for a brief tryst but harry had unfortunately followed her out the door in need of a trip to the loo so hermione lips had been deprived of ron since that night at her grandmother home she wondered if ron felt the same as she was he in a constant state of longing for physical contact with her or was she just a randy teenager despite her denial hermione really wouldntcall herself randy because she simply wanted a kiss a hug a hand hold she would even settle for a pat on the back it seemed however that since she and ron had begun consciously trying to keep a friendly distance she had forgotten what a friendly distance with ron was how often did she used to hug him did she usually sit beside him or across from him last night as harry had shown them the rest of sirius belongings she had sat on the bed with harry but ron had sat on his bed he had looked a bit uncomfortable too twisting his hands and rubbing the back of his neck she remembered what tonks had said about ron being antsy during her absence it was regrettable that he had to continue being antsy in her presence she was fairly sure that his whole body had been itching to sit down beside her but he hadn t as for looking through the box of sirius belongings it wasntmuch of an uplifting experience however she was pleased that harry was beginning to talk about his godfather since sirius death hermione had not even heard harry say his name until last night the most shocking of harry inheritance was buckbeak the hippogriff harry had asked charlie if he would look after him in romania until harry graduated charlie had apparently been only too pleased to do so the box also contained a few picture albums harry had opened one to a picture of sirius lupin and james the resemblances between harry and his father truly were uncanny they were all smiling and waving the right side of the picture appeared to have been cut or torn as harry flipped through the album hermione had noticed many pictures with pieces torn or cut from them she knew why peter pettigrew used to be in those pictures smiling and waving beside his friends in the days before he decided to sell harry parents out to voldemort sirius had surely cut him out of all the pictures never wanting to see the coward again also there was a picture album from james and lily wedding wormtail had been cut from these pictures as well ron had been right in saying that lily engagement ring would go well with someone with long red hair it was terribly sad however seeing harry mother smiling and wearing the ring that harry now kept hidden in his trunk and even sadder that the redhead that harry loved was lying in the bed across from hermione still dressed in her clothes from yesterday a deep frown lining her sleeping face sirius box had also contained a few books hermione had become keyed up until she read the titles among them was a small paperback book entitled so you think your mother a vampire not quite hermione cup of tea there was a small cigar box with pictures of wizards playing chess and smoking cigars covering the lid inside the box tied together with a piece of string was every letter harry had ever written to sirius they appeared to have been read over and over hermione had wanted to cry so badly but harry had been smiling as he looked through the letters so she had bitten back her tears however the tears she had shed earlier that day when she witnessed harry having a vision must have been enough to cause this horrid headache so as hermione made her way down to the basement she removed her wand from her back pocket and uttered a pain relief spell upon her forehead ah slight relief she had thought about offering ginny a pain relief charm but hermione thought it best to let her sleep sleep would be the only truly peaceful time for ginny at least for a while the entrance hall smelled faintly of sausage eggs and toast once the aroma hit her however hermione realized that food did not sound appealing nonetheless she descended the stairs to the basement mr weasley tonks mad eye harry and ron were all seated at the table already bent over steaming plates of food mrs weasley was still pattering about the kitchen but when she spotted hermione she immediately fixed another plate and ushered hermione into an empty seat beside harry and across the table from ron who had his head bent low over his plate he hadnteven acknowledged her presence harry had given her a weak smile tonks had given her a nod mr weasley had given her a small wave even mad eye had grunted did ron really think a small smile would give anything away hermione thought with a frown thanks mrs weasley hermione said politely although the food in front of her made her stomach churn ron mother was a fabulous cook but for some reason hermione had no appetite no problem dear mrs weasley said as she sat herself down beside mr weasley arthur says your visit went well at your grandmother s that nice and oh a letter came for you from the a t c the apparition testing center i believe your test is scheduled one week from today hermione throat seemed to close off her apparition test she had completely forgotten about it she hadntpracticed at all she had read most of the book that ron had given her for christmas a simple guide to apparition dontsplinch it a cinch but that wasntenough hermione took a deep breath and a swig of pumpkin juice i can help you prepare if you want hermione said tonks brightly you wonthave any problem with it hermione nodded with a small smile she wonthave any problem yes she would how could anyone prepare for an apparition test in one week this was horrible she was going to fail she was going to splinch herself right in front of the testers and they were going to send her home with disapproving stares on their faces went to st mungo early this morning mr weasley said suddenly paid a visit to mundungus fletcher hmph mrs weasley wrinkled her nose a bit at the mention of mundungus hermione guessed she still hadnttruly forgiven the old crook for abandoning his post at privet drive two summers back when he was to be watching over harry what fletcher in the hospital for harry asked curiously small battle broke out over in wolverhampton moody growled with a mouthful of sausage old dung narrowly missed a nasty blast from rodolphus lestrange i dontknow that i d call it a small battle there mad eye tonks replied when you consider that two trams derailed on the midland metro mrs weasley was looking increasingly uncomfortable as she said with a forced smile did i mention that we re having company today so what were the death eaters targeting muggles harry asked disregarding mrs weasley feeble attempt to change the course of the conversation of course moody snarled and lucky for dung elphias doge saw lestrange on the verge of casting the killing curse old doge blasted the bastard to bits what harry asked almost excitedly he dead deceased gone no more tonks replied bluntly hermione eyes went wide at this news rodolphus lestrange was bellatrix husband malfoy uncle and harry mr weasley began sounding a bit nervous dung happened to pilfer a few things from lestrange before the body was confiscated by ministry officials mrs weasley gasped disgraceful mr weasley placed a comforting hand on his wife shoulder molly dear now i not condoning pilfering off the dead but it was lestrange and dung did happen to find something on him that should now belong to you harry mr weasley said quietly me harry asked incredulously mr weasley reached into his pocket and pulled out a large banded silver ring there was a large stone on top that appeared to be an onyx as it was a deep shiny black a crest of some sort was carved into the band on one side it was sirius great grandfather ring arthur began handing the ring to harry who had a blank expression on his face that the black family crest there i assume it was handed down to bellatrix who then gave it to her husband dung thought you should have it thanks mr weasley harry said with what hermione knew to be a forced smile she highly doubted harry would ever want to wear a piece of jewelry that had touched the hand of a death eater nonetheless harry placed the ring in his pocket where ginny mrs weasley asked suddenly causing the small cramp in hermione stomach to deepen she doesntusually sleep in this late ron coughed loudly and looked up from his plate for the first time since hermione had entered the kitchen before saying these eggs are delicious mum hermione took note of the fact that ron had long since finished his eggs she thought she saw harry heave a rather large sigh before looking back down at his own plate hermione also thought she saw ron cut his eyes in her direction and turn a bit pink around his cheeks and across his nose he was too adorable she bit the insides of her cheeks to keep from smiling oh look mrs weasley said suddenly fred and george must be on their way hermione had just been about to take a bite of her toast so that she at least appeared to be enjoying mrs weasley breakfast but her hand froze halfway to her mouth hermione instantly ceased the biting of her cheeks there was no need now she suddenly didntfeel like smiling ron fork had clattered to the floor and he was bent under the table retrieving it hermione glanced up at the weasley clock that was now hung on the kitchen wall and yes fred and george clock hands were moving to traveling hermione then chanced a glance at ron but he still wasntlooking at her although his ears had gone incredibly scarlet two metal springs had suddenly become implanted in hermione feet her legs were now bobbing up and down uncontrollably she and ron hadntseen the twins since new year eve and they hadntheard from them since the embarrassing letter that they so graciously left behind after finding her abandoned wand suddenly hermione felt two rather long feet clamp firmly on either side of her bouncing feet the springs left immediately as she looked across the table at ron who was still not looking at her although she could ve sworn she saw him smiling at his sausage for a brief moment hermione then had to resume the biting of her cheeks ron began counting down from ten silently he d often heard people say that this practice could calm one nerves however it wasntreally working for him it was actually making him feel worse but that was probably because he wasntdoing it right for in his mind ron was counting ten embarrassing jokes nine embarrassing jokes eight embarrassing jokes and so on glancing up at the clock ron saw that his brothers were still traveling what was taking them so long they should ve already apparated outside of grimmauld place by now it would be nice if they would just hurry up the more ron counted the more nervous he became at least he wasntin this alone hermione was possibly more nervous than he was at least that what her bobbing feet had implied ron was used to embarrassing jokes from the twins but hermione hadntbeen forced to endure a lifetime of their comical persecution cr crack crack ron took a deep breath of clean non awkward air it would be the last relaxed breath he would take for the next hour or so usually the twins stopped by on sundays when their shop was closed but they never stayed an awfully long time ron hoped this sunday would be no different ho ho ron looked up to see his two brothers walking down the stairs with one other person was that lee ron hadntseen lee jordan since he had left hogwarts although he knew that fred and george were still friends with him he looked the same as ever with his dark skin and dreadlocks glancing at hermione ron noticed that she had barely touched her food although she was seemingly entranced with her plate at the moment he squeezed her small feet a couple of times she peeked up at him with the smallest of smiles small yet powerful what took you two so long mrs weasley asked in a scolding sort of voice before turning a sweet smile to lee hello dear i ve been wondering how you ve been lee gave her a winning smile oh mother george began fred here has to stop by angelina at least once a week you know is that so mr weasley said cheerily a suspicious grin curving upon his face you two just friends are you fred fred shrugged and to ron dismay looked straight at him as he said casually well dad you know how that old story plays out how that tonks asked with a knowing smile at fred who turned his gaze upon her you stay friends with a charming little lady long enough and s n ap fred snapped his fingers in the air and turned his gaze upon hermione who was now entranced with her fork bye bye friendship hello courtship oh dear that wonderful mrs weasley said sweetly angelina was always such a sweet girl yes and very smart george added with an innocent wide eyed sincerity i mean come on only the smartest of the smart fall for us weasleys not true i say not true fred said shaking his finger in the air all girls fall for us weasleys but we only fall for the smartest of the smart everyone chuckled at this comment except for ron even hermione had giggled a little but ron thought it sounded a bit forced he still had a firm hold on hermione feet i stand corrected george said bowing his head slightly to his brother before taking an empty seat at the table however i sit famished as do i fred agreed also taking a seat ron realized that he had been holding his breath during his brothers grand entrance so he slowly let it out please let that be the end of the torture ron thought desperately mrs weasley stood from her chair and made her way over to the remaining breakfast food lee dear would you like a plate she asked as she fixed the twins their own plates no thank you mrs weasley i just holy horklumps everyone looked up at this unexpected outburst and ron immediately became aware of the object of lee surprise ginny had appeared on the stairs hermione was glad that she did not have much of an appetite because if she had been eating at that moment she would have surely choked she had turned around in her seat to see ginny descending the stairs at least hermione thought it was ginny for a second hermione wondered if fred and george had arrived with another guest a flaming haired veela but this was no veela ginny had entered the kitchen looking most unlike what hermione had expected her friend to look like this morning the morning after harry had rejected her the morning after she had endured the breaking of her heart ginny sleek ginger hair seemed even shinier and more crimson maybe she had used some sort of charm on it it was lying perfectly straight down her back with some strands cascading over her shoulders she was wearing a long jade green cotton skirt that fell down to her ankles it reminded hermione of something a greek goddess would wear the way it was wrapped about her waist it didntappear formal however even with the flat gold sandals she wore and the long gold earrings ginny had managed to make the skirt appear casual by wearing a rather form fitting sleeveless brown cotton shirt no not just sleeveless there were merely thin straps over her shapely freckled shoulders and the shirt even revealed a modest amount of cleavage the most shocking aspect of ginny appearance however was her face she looked absolutely beautiful with an ample amount of clear gloss on her lips and some sort of gold shimmery powder around her eyes hermione was completely stunned she had never seen ginny dress like this and apparently neither had anyone else in the room her father and brothers were looking at her with wide eyed open mouthed slightly angry stares and her mother oddly enough was smiling broadly lee jordan was smiling broadly too but with a much different look in his eyes than mrs weasley tonks and mad eye didntseem too surprised and simply turned around to finish off their meals but then there was harry he was staring at her he didntlook angry like the weasley men he didntlook proud like ginny mum and he didntlook lustful like lee harry was absolutely expressionless the only part of his face that revealed any of his feelings was his jaw hermione saw that muscle moving it was just like the one she sometimes saw in ron she was quickly coming to understand that that muscle moved when a man became frustrated slap hey hermione was inadvertently slapped out of her reverie as lee jordan was physically slapped on the back of his head by fred who had stood up from his seat just for this reason lee was now rubbing the back of his head and looking a bit guilty fred scowled and sat back down hard on his wooden chair uh um m molly um mr weasley was stammering his brow furrowed and his eyes blinking profusely i think you should well uh i dontthink that oh arthur hush mrs weasley snapped although she was still smiling at her daughter ginny you look lovely what the occasion mr weasley did hush but he continued to stare worriedly at his daughter ginny took her time flipping her long hair off of her shoulder before responding oh there no occasion mum and then looking directly at harry with heavy lidded eyes she said no occasion at all harry quickly looked away from her and hermione saw his adam apple bob up and down but then again i didntknow lee was coming ginny exclaimed in what hermione knew to be an overly enthused voice i haventseen you for ages how are you great lee stated somewhat dreamily veela or not ginny didntneed magic to captivate the men in this room whether it was frustrated angry or licentious she had their attention well ginny said approaching lee slowly arentyou going to greet me properly hermione saw harry glance up to glare at them over the tops of his glasses at these words lee smiled broadly before grabbing ginny around the waist lifting her off of the ground and spinning her in one complete circle he then sat her back down slowly ginny giggled gaily tonks and mrs weasley seemed to be the only other people that found this situation laughable although they didnttruly understand the situation after ginny pulled away from lee she sat down beside ron and directly across from harry who jaw muscle was now working fiercely hermione could see his tightly clasped hands under the table and saw him place one fist in the other and crack his knuckles hermione knew exactly what ginny was doing and she didntlike it one bit the rest of breakfast involved the gradual recovery of the weasley men fred and george helped with this task after a few minutes of moping over ginny appearance it seemed as though they couldntcontain themselves any longer they soon burst forth with exciting tales of their business on diagon alley ron continued to squeeze her feet every few minutes reminding her that he was ever aware of her presence maybe she was silly but it made her stomach flutter a bit when he did it lee kept stealing glances at ginny who kept stealing glances at harry who kept stealing glares at lee it was almost sickening for hermione so when fred george and lee decided to go upstairs and nose around a bit hermione was only too glad she quickly stood from her chair and with a fleeting glance at ron marched straight to his sister ginny hermione said casually can i talk to you for a minute upstairs ginny nodded with a somewhat uneasy frown before following hermione up to their room on the way they passed fred and george pestering mrs black someone had apparently informed them of hermione attack on the portrait they kept walking away from the painting briefly but then running back up to it and screaming fire which caused mrs black to yelp in fright and duck her might have made hermione laugh but she was on a mission once she and ginny had reached their bedroom hermione quickly closed the door and locked it ginny hermione began calmly why are you doing this ginny rolled her eyes in a way that unpleasantly reminded hermione of her brother i knew this is what you wanted to talk to me about and hermione i really dontwant to talk about it with you why not because you wontunderstand try me ginny sighed heavily and crossed her arms hermione last night was the worst i ve ever felt in my life i think i probably cried more tears than ever before but you know what what hermione asked wearily i ve decided that moping around and crying isntquite my style she said with her chin held out proudly so i taking a new approach to the issue by flaunting yourself in front of harry i dontlike it ginny ginny sighed listen hermione if harry plans to just shut me out because of some stupid war with voldemort then he going to have to fight another war with me and you know what hermione ginny asked with a somewhat cruel smile after he seen the types of weapons i possess he going to be begging to see mr riddle she spat before turning sharply toward the door hermione grabbed her by the elbow ginny please dontdo this why arentyou and ron even looking at one another has it to do with last night ginny had changed topics so quickly that hermione was taken off guard no i hermione began softly i ve forgiven him for that i know he was only trying to protect me although i guess i am still a bit annoyed with him so why are you two still hiding your feelings hermione took a deep breath before saying matter of factly we dontthink the time is right to tell harry that his two best friends are forming a bond that he not a part of ginny scoffed and rolled her eyes it sent angry shivers down hermione spine well i thought as much harry just shitting with everyone relationships isnthe ginny please dontsay things like that hermione said softly this conversation is over hermione ginny said sternly hermione reluctantly let go of her friend elbow and watched her wrench the door open and storm out of the room one delicate hand wiping at her eyes as she disappeared around the doorframe ron and harry were seated on the small green sofa in the entrance hall watching fred and george badger mrs black portrait well that what ron was doing anyway however he had the distinct impression that harry was actually staring daggers into the back of lee jordan skull who was playing bystander to the twins antics hermione and ginny had rushed off to their bedroom and ron thought he knew why his little sister had descended the stairs to the kitchen wearing something that were hermione wearing it he would ve been too pleased however on ginny it had made ron feel sick to his stomach he knew what ginny was up to and knowing hermione she was reprimanding his sister for her cruel actions glancing at harry ron knew that ginny was having her desired effect on him harry looked quite frightening actually and wait harry ron asked tentatively harry turned to look at him and ron realized that he must ve been mistaken oh nevermind harry looked confused for a moment before returning his stern glare on lee ron had thought for sure he had seen that strange glow in his eyes but as soon as he saw it it was gone just like all the other times maybe i going mad ron thought maybe all this distance from hermione was starting to take its toll he had wanted so badly to run up to her when she had descended the basement stairs but as ron stole another glance at harry he was even more certain that he and hermione were doing the right thing by keeping their love hidden ron could see the horrible ordeal unfold in his mind eye if he were to reveal the truth to his best mate oh harry i sorry that my sister has decided to adopt the sensual habits of a nymph but while you re dwelling on that would you mind if hermione and i left for a quick snog it made ron stomach churn especially after seeing that glow in harry eyes if he even saw it at all suddenly ron felt harry jerk slightly and sit up a bit straighter ginny was descending the stairs now meanwhile the twins and lee seemed to have grown tired of harassing mrs black and were walking over to ron and harry ginny was close behind still dressed in her vengeful outfit ron took a deep breath and prayed to the stars that she wouldntdo anything drastic harry we really like what you ve done with the place fred said with exaggerated gusto yes top notch george agreed thanks harry muttered and then with a brief glance in lee direction i not sure i quite like the idea of just anyone dropping by though fred and george exchanged a quick glance and lee pleasant expression seemed to fade to a slight frown but fred then smiled broadly oh harry not to worry lee joined the order now did you know ron knew that the quick look that had passed between his two brothers was a look of understanding they knew how harry felt about ginny and they obviously knew ginny was acting strangely ron also knew that informing harry that lee was now in the order was an attempt at cheering him up however it would most likely have the opposite effect harry wished to be in the order and the fact that lee jordan was now a member and the boy who lived was not couldntbode well with harry although harry expression at the moment was unreadable ron was sure his friend insides were on fire yes lee chimed in with a weak smile at harry just joined a couple of months ago actually it fine of you to allow the order to continue using this house fred and george have told me about well about you inheriting this place lee cleared his throat and looked down awkwardly harry simply nodded ginny was looking sadly at harry for a moment before she forced a smile oh hermione ginny exclaimed ron looked up to see hermione making her way toward them from the base of the stairs she wore a displeased expression as she looked at ginny hey hermione we hear you ve got an important test coming up fred said brightly immediately taking the opportunity to change the tension among them into humor hermione smiled weakly ron knew she was beside herself with worry over yet another test that she would pass with flying colors he had seen the look of terror overtake her at the breakfast table when his mum had announced the arrival of her letter i hope you ve been studying your arse off hermione george said in a very convincing serious tone that one bugger of a test that is hermione squinted her eyes at them as if trying to decide whether or not to believe them hermione ron began they re just being daft it not all that hard she bit her lower lip and nodded slightly ron felt a wave of chills move over him oh apparating already ronnie fred said ron rolled his eyes at his brother can you apparate lee ginny asked innocently sure it a simple task really he responded cheerily of course i have splinched myself once before left behind my right arm when traveling from my house to fred and george shop gave them a nasty surprise ginny giggled quite a lot at this story that didntseem all that funny to ron she then approached lee who was unfortunately standing directly in front of harry slouched form on the couch so ginny began with a demure smile how much of your arm she placed one hand on lee shoulder who smiled weakly but looked to harry apprehensively harry seemed to have a death grip on the arm of the couch well uh a all of it i guess lee stammered still looking from harry to ginny the twins were looking at ginny with furrowed brows they didntseem to be appreciating the fact that she was returning the tension among the group hermione was standing to the side looking sadly at harry how awful ginny said in a near whisper she then glided her hand smoothly down the length of lee arm hand and finally fingers harry suddenly shot up from the couch everyone was silent as he and ginny had a stare off they both looked positively livid ginny won however as harry jerked his head down his hands in fists at his sides before he quickly left to ascend the stairs as he left ginny took on a rather self satisfied sneer um i really ought to be leaving hate to run but um prior engagement you know lee said quietly good seeing everyone again and i ll stop by the shop tomorrow he added with a nod to the twins crack what in bloody hell is your problem ron exclaimed angrily she was being ridiculous i haventdone a thing ginny spat back ron threw hermione an incredulous look and she shook her head at him with a look that plainly said it no use you have too fred began you ran off harry and jordan in less time than it takes to milk a glumbumble george finished ginny glared at them both before stalking toward the stairs to the basement fred shook his head sadly geez what did harry do to her must ve been bad george stated with raised eyebrows ron i need to talk to you hermione said urgently ron felt a rush of fear as he stood up slowly from the couch he suddenly had an image of hermione standing in front of him with her hands on her hips and saying it just not going to work ron i ve thought about what you did to harry and i now know what a great git you are uh oh fred whispered in mock horror you mean to tell me that there are two women scorned in this house george fred i think it might be time to go the twins looked at one another and gave one sharp nod well we re going to pop on down to the kitchen and bid farewell to mum and dad see you two later fred said giving ron a pat on the back and hermione a small squeeze on her arm good luck ron george said quietly before turning to hermione go easy on him he a bit green at this sort of thing you know hermione blushed a beautiful shade of pink cr crack where are tonks and mad eye hermione asked quickly as they were now alone in the entrance hall alone ron felt a rush of excitement mix with his trepidation of what hermione needed to talk to him about dunno still in the kitchen i think ron replied shrugging hermione gasped and one hand flew to her mouth as her eyes got wide what ron asked hurriedly suddenly hermione grabbed a hold of ron hand and led him at a near run to the staircase leading to the first floor they by passed the first floor and the second but then they came to the third floor this was where fred and george bedroom from two summers ago had been however they by passed this room too and hermione led ron into a room at the end of the hall that he knew to be mrs black old bedroom it was where buckbeak had stayed of course he had forgotten all about this room hermione pulled him inside the dark musty room and quickly shut the door there were a few long stemmed candles burning on a wall candelabrum beside the door but this was the only source of light in the room it cast a lovely golden glow on hermione face and before ron really thought about what he was doing he had wrapped his arms around hermione and crushed her to him in a fierce hug she laid her head on his chest and he felt her small arms wrap around his waist hermione ron breathed in deeply taking in her sweet scent i know you have something you want to talk to me about but blimey i had to do this first to his delight hermione actually giggled maybe she wasnta woman scorned as fred had said ron hermione said against his chest hmm i still dontthink harry should have dropped his defenses but i not angry with you i know you were just thinking of me ron felt as if a huge weight had been lifted from his shoulders he hadntrealized how much he d needed to hear that thank you hermione he said softly before kissing the top of her head um hermione hmm the way ginny been acting this morning ron sighed heavily please dontever use that as a way to get revenge on me i d rather you spit on me slap me curse me hex me anything but that hermione pulled away from him slightly and peered up at him with an adorable wide eyed expression ron i dontagree with what ginny is doing to harry at all it awful i glad we agree ron said with a small smile of course i dontagree with harry shutting ginny out either she said matter of factly me neither ron hmm could you please hurry up and kiss me hermione whispered hermione could tell that her request had had a positive effect on ron a sultry smile spread across his lips which seemed to stimulate every nerve in hermione body ron leaned down slowly and briefly nuzzled her nose with his before his mouth found hers in a titillating lingering lip lock maybe it was the candles or the clean earthy smell radiating from ron body or the amount of time hermione had been waiting for this contact but something about this kiss fueled hermione desires to a height that actually frightened her a bit not enough to pull away from the kiss or to stop herself from raking her fingers down ron chest and back up again there was one urge however that she was denying herself it was such a strange thing to want to do but when ron deepened their kiss she seemed to forget how to practice self restraint parting her lips a bit more hermione bit ron bottom lip ever so softly and then slowly moved her tongue over it he breathed heavily on her lips after this and squeezed her tighter hermione heard a soft moan fill the air between them she then realized that it had been her own ron pulled his mouth away suddenly and rested his forehead on hers bloody hell hermione he whispered between pants running his hands up and down her arms his eyes shut tightly hermione eyes werentshut however and she saw that jaw muscle working are you frustrated with me she asked quietly that is what that muscle meant wasntit frustration what ron asked sounding perplexed as he leaned back to look at her are you frustrated hermione asked again no yes well i ron began blushing profusely but he held her gaze you re a bit scarlet hermione stated plainly i know he said looking down hermione took a deep breath as she decided to be a bit bolder are you frustrated because you find me desirable she asked remembering what ron had told her that night at her grandmother home he looked back into her eyes and smiled softly yeah something like that what do you want what do you mean at my grandmother home you became frustrated because you wanted to well touch me and now you re frustrated again so what is it that you want this time hermione asked quietly she wasntannoyed just curious and a tad worried she didntwant ron to become frustrated every time they had one of these intimate sessions the same he replied quietly his gaze was positively piercing where he sighed and rolled his eyes slightly but it wasntthe eye roll that sent angry shivers down her spine this eye roll was sort of attractive ah hell hermione dontswear ron sorry okay where do i want to touch you honestly he asked somewhat nervously hermione simply nodded fully aware that she was now deeply red upon her cheeks ron took a short breath before he replied everywhere hermione felt a warm wave wash through her as she felt flattered excited and troubled all at one time oh so um what if i don t i mean if i not ready will you always become frustrated with me when we kiss if i don t a wide eyed worried look swept over ron and he quickly cupped her face with his hands no no no no hermione i not frustrated with you he said reassuringly although hermione was still a bit confused then i dontunderstand she stated bluntly ron looked as though he were searching for the right words and his hands left her face to rest on her shoulders i well i i really dontthink frustrated is the right word it more like self restraint hermione offered remembering how she had felt before biting ron lip hesitant and unsure at first but then the inability to restrain herself you have these urges and then you pull away from me because you re unsure if you ll be able to restrain yourself yes ron said in a deep whisper that sent chills up hermione neck but hermione i promise i ll never touch you unless you say it alright i would never do anything to hurt you at these words hermione felt a lump form in her throat as ron tucked one of her stray hairs behind her ear i know she said in a strained voice her unshed tears were being very stubborn hermione lifted up on her tiptoes and cupping ron face with her hands she brought his lips down to hers his strong hands gripped tightly to her waist and brought her closer to his body it was a bit ironic to hermione that immediately after a brief chat on self restraint she and ron began kissing madly she had her hands entwined in his soft locks as she applied pressure to the back of his head to deepen their kisses her heart was beating frantically and she knew that ron was as well because she could feel the vibrations against her chest hermione slowly moved her mouth from ron and kissed a warm trail over the harsh edge of his jaw and onto his neck as hermione planted a stream of soft kisses on this soft area ron buried his head into her neck his hot breath creating pleasant chills down her arms i promise i ll never touch you unless you say it alright remembering these sincere caring words hermione removed her hands from ron hair and grabbed hold of his hands she then boldly moved them under the bottom of her shirt to rest warmly on the bare skin of her waist ron immediately encircled her body so that his hands were splayed across her bare back hermione didnttruly understand why she felt the need to have ron hands on her bare skin but she knew that it had something to do with the amount of love that she felt for him just like that night in the shed by his house she had felt as though she couldntget close enough to his body it had made no sense to her then because they had been so very close but now hermione was beginning to feel as though skin on skin contact was one of the strongest ways to show and feel love she could feel it in the tenderness of his touch the way he rubbed his fingers along her skin in small circles the way he squeezed her gently ron she whispered breathlessly on his neck he rubbed his cheek softly across hers before replying huskily in her ear yeah i love you she said before kissing him full on the mouth when she pulled away ron hugged her to him tightly and then huskily in her ear he replied i love y boom ron threw himself onto the floor bringing hermione with him after landing painfully on his back he rolled himself over hermione small frame lying his body across hers shielding both of their heads with his arms he felt bits of wood and debris hitting him across the back dust was falling all around them ron mind was in a frantic blurred state what in the hell was that blast it had shook the entire room why was there debris falling all around them who had done this was there a death eater in the house what about the fidelius charm had fred and george returned to accidentally set off a firework when ron realized that there was no longer a steady rain of debris he raised his head to look about the room the room was a shambles wood and dust everywhere and a rather large hole in the middle of the floor light was streaming into mrs black old bedroom from the room below wait ron thought the room below is mine and harry room ron looked down at hermione who was still underneath him shaking slightly hermione are you all right were you hurt did i i fine ron but but what wha i ve no idea but it came from mine and harry room hermione get out your wand and follow close behind me all right we ve got to bang ron head snapped up as the door to the room flung open tonks ron cried despite the confusion and fear running through his veins like an unpleasant icy current he also felt extreme embarrassment as he realized the compromising position he and hermione were in tonks didntlook at all worried about their awkward position however she was glancing around the room frantically wand raised and a fierce expression that looked ready for battle she only spared a split second glance at him and hermione ron hoisted himself up off of hermione and reached a hand down to pull her up there was a small cut above hermione eyebrow and an immense amount of dust in her hair and on her clothes ron knew he probably looked worse as he was on top of her there was real fear in her eyes too he put an arm tightly around her waist tonks what s hermione began but she stopped as tonks suddenly strode over to the large hole in the middle of the room peered down cautiously and then to ron surprise jumped down into the room below hermione stay back ron commanded pushing hermione back up against the wall ron no don t but ron had already retrieved his wand and was now striding over to peer down the hole there was a fair amount of debris about the second floor room as well along with tonks harry mad eye and possibly some others ron couldntsee properly but he could see that none of them looked exceedingly worried or in a hurry to leave the place ron turned to hermione who looked extremely anxious yet with wand in hand he grabbed a firm hold on her free hand and led her from the room as they reached the stairs descending to the second floor however ron remembered something turning to hermione he took hold of the nape of her neck pulled her to him and kissed her briefly but passionately i love you too he said quickly to a taken aback hermione before descending the stairs with her hand still clasped in his as they reached the second floor landing they immediately heard shouts although the voice sounded vaguely familiar ron didntquite recognize it however as he and hermione arrived at the open door to he and harry bedroom an intense scene was playing out before them that would eventually answer all of ron questions everyone at grimmauld place was crowded into the room ron mum dad and sister were standing in one corner of the room while tonks and mad eye were standing in the middle of the room where most of the debris was the slightly familiar voice that ron had heard from the hallway however was yelling out from a portrait on the wall in the room abominable what in the name of all that is sacred do you think you are doing to the most noble and ancient house of black this is your inheritance boy and look what you ve done phineas nigellus had appeared in his frame he was extremely red in the face and was shaking his fist in harry direction harry however was sitting on the edge of his dusty debris strewn bed with his head in his hands oh stuff it nigellus mad eye growled before turning to harry boy now what do you mean you just looked up at the ceiling i told you moody harry said raising his head from his hands and standing up from the bed i just did like this harry raised his hands up to the ceiling and i well dontdo it again growled mad eye frantically just sit there sit still too harry rolled his eyes and sat down hard on the bed returning his head to his hands ron his mum had just spotted him standing in the doorway and was rushing over to him with tears in her eyes oh my poor baby what happened to you look at the scrapes onyour arms where were you two tonks said you were fine but look at you you re covered in rubble and hermione dear you re cut they were with me when it happened tonks said quickly ron felt a huge rush of relief and hermione must have too because he felt her hand loosen from his slightly now that he thought about it she had been holding his hand with a viselike grip ron was holding her hand behind his back however so no one in the room was any the wiser with you mr weasley asked curiously yes we were just looking around buckbeak old room you know none of us had ever really seen inside it so we just well why arentyou covered in rubble dear mrs weasley asked curiously tonks eye twitched just slightly before she said convincingly well i was actually admiring the room from the hallway it still smells a bit like a hippogriff in there jibber jabber that all you people do think about the problem at hand this young man needs to be punished he needs to be taught how to respect this home if he to live here why in my day phineas yelled oh shut up you old bat ginny cried unexpectedly everyone in the room turned to look at her including harry ron noticedtear trails down her cheeks nigellus gasped as if someone had just done him a great wrong before exiting his portrait with his head held high like royalty i know what happened ginny said quietly looking at harry and keeping everyone silent attention harry looked back at her with a horribly pained expression on his face ron heard a small sniff from hermione so he squeezed her hand gently and began rubbing the back of her hand with his thumb hermione must have realized something that ron hadntbecause he was still utterly confused i think harry was just upset over what happened at breakfast ginny said she and harry still holding each other stare as everyone listened voldemort keeps attacking people ruining lives taking lives evoking fear in those he hates so that they can t ginny paused and swallowed hard cantlive their lives the way they want to oh mrs weasley cried with a steady stream of tears now falling down her face and rolling off of her chin that awful wolverhampton attack was just the last straw arthur i knew you shouldnthave given him that ring oh mrs weasley rushed to sit down on the bed beside harry she wrapped him in a fierce hug and harry closed his eyes tightly ron was no longer confused but his mother was wolverhampton was not what upset harry at breakfast no a giggly ginger haired maiden had caused enough anger and frustration in harry that he had blasted his ceiling to bits with a simple stare harry had told ron of other instances like this blowing up his aunt marge and setting a python on his cousin dudley for their cruelty blasting the door off of the cupboard under the stairs at privet drive out of necessity and now blasting a hole in the ceiling of his room at grimmauld place because he was denying himself the love of his life author note this fairly lengthy chapter surprisingly takes place over the span of about two or three hours but i guess a fair amount of stuff happened huh well i hope everyone is still enjoying the i couldntget this posted sooner but this chapter gave me a bit of trouble at first until i found my groove again lol i getting antsy for the school year to resume so for those of you that

nope nothing maybe it worked better the other way one two three four five six seven eight nine ten ron sighed heavily as he sat on the tattered green sofa in the entrance hall thumbing through a new copy of the stealth and counting he d already read through this thing cover to cover so he was actually just staring at the pictures he had seen moody toss it in the kitchen bin one morning and had sneakily removed it and shoved it under his shirt the stories werentreally any different than that of the issue he harry and ginny had read just a lot of death and destruction he had been hoping that if he read something devastating enough he might be able to take his mind off of the highly irritating course this week had if he couldnttake his mind off of it he hoped to dwarf it in comparison to something more horrible ron could hardly believe that one week and one day ago harry had blasted a gaping hole in their bedroom it seemed like a month ago everything was moving so slowly now the damage was quickly repaired well at least the damage to the ceiling was quickly repaired however the events following harry outburst had inadvertently caused a bit of damage to ginny as soon as phineas strode from his painting to return to dumbledore wall at hogwarts he informed the headmaster of harry s explosive anger after hearing this news dumbledore arranged to pick harry up from grimmauld place that evening ron had heard dumbledore saying something to his mum and dad about harry needing to redirect all of his anger to a more productive method of anxiety liberation so he had taken harry to hogwarts for the week to resume his training with him and lupin in hopes that this would clear harry mind a bit as harry and dumbledore were preparing to apparate however ginny had run up to harry and whispered something in his ear it wasntuntil later that ron found out from hermione what ginny had said hermione had been able to read her lips i sorry to everyone surprise everyone being the whole lot of inhabitants at grimmauld place harry had wrapped ginny in a fierce hug and kissed her lightly on her cheek and if the scene had ended there maybe no damage would have been dealt to ginny but unfortunately ginny had pushed her luck she made a move to cup harry face and kiss him on the mouth but before she could there was a crack and harry was gone leaving ginny standing alone near the front door with her hands held up in a slight v shape she had looked like some sort of delicate statue looking to the heavens until of course she broke the pose to flee to her room it was ron and hermione belief that ginny and harry brief reunion followed by harry refusal to accept her kiss was what had caused the ensuing damage to ginny ginny had spent the entire week locked away in her and hermione room not one soul in grimmauld place could pretend that they werentaware that something was going on between ginny and harry of course ron hermione and tonks were the only ones who actually understood the situation ron and hermione had explained mostly everything to tonks who as they expected understood completely that the matter should remain secret the only bit of the story that they hadntrevealed to tonks was the bit about harry lowering his defenses and seeing that horrible vision of ginny ron mum and dad however did not know any of the secret of harry denial of their daughter they believed ginny to be upset and scared for harry after seeing the power of his veiled anger his parents believed ginny to be innocent and fragile unable to fully deal with the war and how it was affecting harry and ginny had readily let them believe this ron mum delivered ginny three meals every day and ginny only left her room to go to the loo ron had visited her a few times but she hadnttalked to him her appearance made ron doubt if she were actually eating the food brought to her each day her eyes were dark underneathand her skin was pasty either she wasnteating or she wasntsleeping or both but she definitely wasnttaking good enough care of herself for she did not look healthy at all in addition to ron worries over his sister and harry he felt as if he hadntseen hermione for a week with harry gone and ginny hiding away it would seem ideal for he and hermione to have ample alone time but this wasntthe case hermione had been studying all day everyday with tonks for her apparition test at which times ron was made to leave the room apparently he made hermione too nervous to apparate properly and when she wasntpracticing she was reading the book ron bought her for christmas a simple guide to apparition fortunately he was able to sit with her while she read who knew sitting with someone could be so fulfilling it was quite odd how content ron felt just being in hermione presence but ron reckoned love was peculiar in a lot of ways that he d never really thought of before for one thing there was this insatiable hunger to rendezvous with hermione ron was a connoisseur of satisfying his hunger or at least he had been before he adopted this new hunger that didntinvolve stuffing his mouth full of food he constantly longed to be in hermione presence preferably hugging and kissing her hugging and kissing hermione granger sometimes he had to remind himself that her attraction to him and love for him was not false why has she chosen me ron would often ask himself he still didntreally know the answer but ron felt as though answers were scarce these days it seemed that all of his questions remained without proper ones would harry ever accept ginny back into his life could ginny recover if he didn t would he and hermione ever feel as though it were time to tell harry about their feelings for one another would he be able to keep hermione happy in a relationship so that she wouldntleave his sorry arse for someone better could he recover if she left him well maybe one of his questions had an answer to it but more importantly at the moment would hermione ever get back from the apparition testing center ron shoved the depressing newspaper in between the two cushions of the couch hermione had surely been gone for at least two hours kingsley had come for her this afternoon and then shacklebolt hermione and tonks had gone to the a t c at the ministry tonks claimed that she was just going along for the ride however ron had a sick feeling in his stomach that told him otherwise surely someone being targeted by death eaters would need at least two aurors to guard them ron reckoned it was a sign of the colossal love he had for hermione that he could still be worried sick about her when she was being escorted by two highly capable aurors ron stood up from the sofa with the intent of going downstairs to the basement and checking the time if hermione didntreturn soon he was going to drive himself mad what with all the counting backwards and forwards reading depressing newspapers and dwelling over the past week however as ron reached the top of the basement stairs he heard someone coming up the steps outside the front door his heartbeat quickened and the door opened wide to reveal tonks and hermione being ushered inside by kingsley kingsley gave ron a brief wave from the front steps but quickly apparated after shouting some sort of combined greeting and farewell ron didnthear exactly what he d said however because he was too bothered by the horribly gloomy look on hermione face hermione ron asked tentatively how did it go she looked up at him sadly which caused his stomach to clench up and then pop she was gone but then pop a mischievously smiling hermione was now standing about a foot from him ron smiled back broadly and quickly scooped her up into his arms tonks smiled and rolled her eyes as hermione wrapped her arms around his neck and giggled he swung her around a couple of times before returning her feet to solid ground brilliant hermione ron exclaimed brightly both of his hands clasping her arms thanks she replied smiling modestly although he could see the excitement in her eyes now you see tonks was right you didnthave any problem did you he said smiling down at her beautiful blushing face ron reveled in causing her to blush from his compliments it was so delightful the testers were quite impressed werentthey hermione tonks said matter of factly hermione just continued to smile as tonks continued said they hadntheard a seventeen year old apparate that quietly on their first try in ages ron felt a strange sensation wash through him as he looked down at hermione the sensation was immeasurable pride he d never felt this proud of anyone before not even hermione he usually always felt at least a small pang of envy when others exceeded above his accomplishments but he didntfeel that at all at the moment glancing around the room to make sure that they were alone besides tonks ron entwined the fingers of both of their hands leaned down and gave hermione a congratulatory kiss tonks made some sort of whistling noise followed by a snorting sound before making her way past them to descend the stairs to the kitchen would you like to go with me to show ginny my new skill hermione asked after pulling away from him slightly i thought it might cheer her up a bit you know sure ron said still smiling hermione suddenly got that mischievous smile again i bet i can beat you to the bedroom she said slyly before pop swirling colors and warmth surrounded hermione for a brief moment before everything stopped abruptly and she found herself standing outside of her and ginny bedroom door it was a strange sensation but hermione didntmind it really she was just relieved that the test was over and she now had her apparition license hermione smiled to herself as she saw ron running up the stairs three at a time he stopped at the landing breathing slightly heavily giving her a knowing smile he approached her slowly yet determinedly she found herself leaning back against the wall that wasntquite fair now was it he asked huskily as he came close enough to place his hands upon her hips hermione felt her heart flip over backward it fair by my rulebook hermione said softly as ron leaned further over her and squeezed her hips with his warm hands she could feel their heat through her denims or maybe that heat was coming from her he smiled broadly i see he leaned down until he was breathing on her lips sending those marvelous chills up and down her body well if we re playing by your rulebook he whispered against her lips suddenly ron bit hermione lower lip ever so gently before running his tongue across it she closed her eyes as she felt her legs grow a bit weak and a warmth much stronger than that from apparating run through her veins before they could continue this wonderful game however a door opened somewhere down the hall causing them to reluctantly yet quickly part from one another they gave each other meaningful smiles before creating a friendly distance between them although hermione heart was still beating at a non friendly rate ron stepped back from her and hermione turned toward the bedroom door as moody began making his way down the hall toward the stairs he had come from the loo hermione tried to appear to be just now arriving at her bedroom as she slowly opened the door and peaked inside to see ginny lying on her bed curled up into a small ball with her back to the door motioning for ron to follow her hermione entered the room quietly ginny hermione asked in a near whisper hmm i back from the a t c ginny rolled over then and sat up hermione felt a small lump form in her throat at the site of ginny slightly sunken eyes and weak smile her hair was pulled up into a high ponytail with loose strands falling all about her pretty face she was wearing a light blue cotton t shirt and shorts hermione would swear that ginny had lost at least ten pounds in the past week was that possible how did it go ginny asked in a small voice swallowing the lump in her throat hermione focused on the space directly in front of ginny bed closed her eyes and pop warm swirling colors engulfed her but then pop hermione was now a foot from ginny who was smiling up at her great show hermione she said sweetly before standing up to give her a hug hermione returned the hug and took note of ginny noticeably protruding spine as she patted her on the back ginny had always been a thin girl but this was ridiculous hermione felt that she should reprimand her or threaten to tell her mother but she couldntdo it she couldntcause her friend anymore pain or stress as hermione and ginny broke their embrace hermione decided that she would just have to keep a closer eye on ginny and make sure that she was eating something everyday ginny you look ron began worriedly hermione turned around and shot him a warning look his eyes went a bit wide for a moment you look sleepy um should we leave you to a lie down hermione smiled at him and he gave her one of those wonderful heart stopping winks oh no it really alright i just ginny stopped mid sentence her mouth was still partway open but her pallid face seemed to grow paler as she looked past hermione toward the door hermione turned around to see harry standing in the must have returnedjust moments after she and ron had entered the bedroom he too was staring with his mouth partway open at ginny a deeply concerned furrow appeared on his brow the last time harry had seen ginny she had looked like a greek goddess but now hey mate ron replied hesitantly glad to have you back harry slowly tore his eyes from ginny and looked at ron in confusion for a moment as if he wasntsure why ron was standing there talking to him before rubbing a hand quickly over his face and then nodding at ron in an attempt to break the silence hermione was about to ask harry how everything went at hogwarts but she saw something moving behind harry legs dobby hermione asked curiously a small head with a long nose and huge green eyes peaked timidly around harry legs before the large eared elf stepped out from behind them yes miss it is dobby he replied with a small smile he was wearing about five pairs of differently colored socks a purple sweater and some bright green shorts oh yes harry began with a forced smile his gaze had returned to ginny dobby has come to live here at grimmauld place what ron asked with one eyebrow raised but harry was entranced with ginny who was simply sitting quietly on her bed her small legs hanging off the edge her eyes focused on her knees dobby took harry silence to mean that ron was addressing him directly yes sir mr wheezy sir dobby said smiling proudly dobby will replace harry potter kreacher because kreacher is a dark and bad elf really harry hermione asked in disbelief he nodded turning to look at hermione yeah well when i arrived at hogwarts dumbledore told me that dobby here had a request of me apparently he had gotten wind of my ownership of kreacher through the well the elvaan grapevine yes dobby added nodding excitedly dobby requested to work here for harry potter for free dobby is used to wages but dobby could never take money from the great harry potter ron chuckled a bit at this before harry continued uh i still well own kreacher but dumbledore said i could send kreacher back with him to hogwarts if i wanted and bring dobby to live here and well that what i wanted wow hermione smiled down at dobby who smiled back timidly he was sort of unattractive at first sight but his innocence and lovability made him charming why doesnteveryone sit down for a bit ginny asked softly her voice sounded a bit strained hermione took a seat on her own bed along with ron who had sat down rather quickly hermione wondered if he had simply wanted to sit beside her or if he wanted to force harry to sit beside ginny maybe it was both harry had his hands in the pockets of his jacket as he walked slowly to ginny bed he took a seat beside her his eyes sweeping over her concernedly are you ill he asked softly ginny shook her head without looking at harry she was actually playing absently with the edge of her pillow she not eating ron stated candidly hermione thumped him on the knee for interrupting but he just continued to stare disapprovingly at his sister is that true harry asked calmly ginny didntrespond but continued fingering the edge of her pillow ginny are you not eating when she continued to ignore his question harry sighed heavily and turned to dobby dobby would you mind running down to the kitchen and fixing some hot soup dobby smiled brightly at this as if he had just been told that he had won a grand prize of course sir he cried cheerily before he all but ran from the room almost tripping over his large feet in his haste once in the hall he must ve apparated because hermione heard a loud crack ginny and harry were staring at one another now hermione looked to ron and with her eyes she attempted to ask him whether or not they should leave the room he shook his head at her before turning to look back at harry and his sister i not hungry harry ginny whispered looking away from him well you sure look hungry but i not and you cantmake me eat ginny please harry said a bit hoarsely he then took hold of one of her hands causing her to look up at him expectantly ginny what if i sit here with you hmm will you eat then without warning a loud sob burst forth from ginny small frame she quickly grabbed her pillow and buried her head in it harry closed his eyes tightly for a mere second before he gently took the pillow from her tossed it to the floor and pulled her to him she wrapped her arms tightly around his neck his arms were about her waist hermione quickly stood from the bed and grabbed ron by the wrist ron looked at her with slight confusion she pulledron up from her bed and began dragging him to the door but before they reached it the door slammed closed hermione turned on her heel to face harry he still had one arm about ginny stroking her back but the other was just returning to encircle her after being outstretched toward the door harry did you just ron began in awe wandless magic yeah harry said shortly over ginny shoulder as he began rocking her still sobbing form back and forth slightly you two sit down will ya hermione gave ron a half questioning half astounded look before they both shrugged and returned to her bed harry could do wandless magic exactly how much wandless magic hermione wasntquite sure why harry didntwant to be alone with ginny but she couldnthonestly say that she wasntglad she had the opportunity to watch this sweet exchange between her two friends she was exceedingly curious as to where this was going please dontrefuse her after this hermione thought desperately just then hermione heard another loud crack come from the hallway followed by the sound of quickly pattering feet dobby appeared in the doorway with a large tray it had four steaming bowls of vegetable soup along with four glasses of pumpkin juice four spoons and four napkins dobby harry said in surprise as he gently pried ginny hands from his neck he stood up to take the tray from his new house elf how did you cook that fast dobby laughed a small laugh before he shrugged and simply said magic sir thank you dobby harry said politely as he took the tray and sat it atop ginny nightstand dobby seemed to be dancing slightly or maybe he was just hopping from one foot to the other but he began tugging on harry jeans harry looked down at him please harry potter sir dobby will serve harry potter should sit back down with his second wheezy harry nodded and smiled kindly at dobby as hermione ron and even ginny chuckled at this sentiment harry did sit back down beside his second wheezy as dobby raised his hands and directed one bowl spoon napkin and drink to each of them as it was a bit difficult to hold all of these and eat at the same time they all decided to sit on the floor when they were all settled dobby apparated back down to the kitchen to finish serving the rest of harry potter family this soup is bloody brilliant ron exclaimed through his final mouthful of dobby hot vegetable soup he and hermione were sitting across from harry and ginny all of them had their backs against the beds yeah i suppose life could become a real doss with dobby around ginny replied before swallowing a spoonful of soup that ron guessed to be the first food she d eaten in a week harry turned to her and smiled so you think i ll laze up if he sticks around he asked teasingly ginny shook her head with a small smile no but you might fatten up harry chuckled at this well that what you need to do he said as he reached over and scratched her tummy playfully she giggled ron was beginning to wonder if dobby had put some sort of cheering charm on the soup or maybe some sort of hallucinogen were harry and ginny actually flirting and smiling again was it possible for the madness to finally end and ron thought with a flutter deep in his stomach if the madness ends could he and hermione safely tell harry about their romantic relationship so hermione harry began you can officially apparate what do you think about it it alright i suppose she said casually alright ron asked with a disbelieving smile you suppose hermione rolled her eyes with her delectable lips pursed slightly alright then it brilliant i was trying not to boast suddenly ginny stood up from the floor and grabbed hers and harry empty bowls but harry grabbed a hold of her ankle hey little bit where are you off to he said before standing up beside her and taking the bowls from her hands i ll get them you lie down but harry i ve been in bed all week she said with a casual smile harry smile faded slightly as if he were imagining ginny pitiful state over the last week well he should feel bad ron thought vengefully it was mental to be in love and not share your feelings to the person you re in love with of course it was probably a bit mental to be in love and only share your feelings to the person you re in love with but still as harry and ginny stared at one another however their bowls disappeared from harry hands ron then looked down and saw that his empty bowl had also disappeared as had hermione s okay ginny said smiling i take it back you re going to laze up and fatten up harry smiled weakly before he waved his hand in the direction of the door sending it flying open he then pulled ginny to him and quite unexpectedly kissed her full on the mouth ron was in a semi shocked condition before he felt a small hand pulling on his arm he looked up to see that hermione had stood from the floor and was now bent down tugging on him to stand as well snapping out of his trance ron stood up quickly and followed hermione out of the room but not before he stole another quick peek over his shoulder as their kissing continued harry crushed ginny to him ginny cupped harry face and harry waved his hand at the door where it closed softly at ron heels author note aww well i hope everyone enjoyed thanks again to the wonderful readers and reviewers the upcoming chapter may take a while i never know but it very sketchy right now in my mind oh and by a while i still mean less than 48 hours so dontget too worried if you are anxious for chapter 27 and about tonks lupin relationship i ve been debating that very thing but i dontknow if i will have a good opportunity to fit that in or not if i do put that in my story however the credit for the idea of that relationship goes solely to jo i never saw that coming in hbp but i liked it nonetheless well stay tuned the characters and situations of harry potter depicted in this

entertainment purposes only chapter 27 ten nine eight seven six five four three two one nope nothing hermione was lying on her bed lazily in the early morning hours those hours that were specifically designed for thinking the hours when the light coming through the windows was a pale almost purple color for most of the holiday hermionehad usedthis quiet time to think about ron she would fill her mind with pleasant thoughts of him until she was happy and carefree it was an excellent way to start the day however hermione thoughts of ron were only making her anxious on this particular morning a couple of weeks ago harry and ginny had made it quite obvious that they needed alone time to make up so hermione and ron had retreated to the third floor bedroom on that particular night fortunately the floorboards had been fixed so they could not see any details of harry and ginny reunion she and ron had then talked mostly they had discussed whether or not it was time to reveal their true feelings to harry after a fairly lengthy discussion they had come to the conclusion that they would wait two more weeks and that was two weeks ago so that made today the day before they would make the trip to king cross station that made today the day that they would tell harry the interesting turn that her and ron relationship had taken so hermione was counting backward from ten ron had given her the idea he had said that some thought it was a good way to calm one nerves it wasntworking hermione had counted from ten to one about fifty times and she was still fixating on her and ron discussion from two weeks ago she was going over it again and again in her head trying to make sure that they hadntmissed any important points they had first reminded themselves why they were hiding their feelings from harry in the first place harry ron and hermione that the way it had always been just the three of them they shared each other secrets hopes fears dreams and lives it had always been a triangle of trust and dependability a triangle that had been harry only true home without the triangle hermione still had her parents and grandmother ron had his family but harry he truly had no one of course he could always go to dumbledore or someone from the order if he ever had a problem but she and ron knew that he wouldn t harry only seemed to trust her and ron to listen to his problems without them judging him although a romantic relationship with ron wouldntchange any of hermione feelings for harry she knew that it would still cause a certain separation among their triangle she and ron would have an extra bond of shared secrets hopes fears and dreams that harry would be isolated from how would harry handle that could harry handle that sirius had died less than a year ago now however harry had a bond that she and ron werenta part of harry and ginny had secrets hopes fears and dreams that would never be revealed to her or ron so hermione and ron had decided that it was coming time to tell harry about their own bond but harry and ginny reunion had almost seemed too good to be true harry had seemed so set in his ways he had seemed so sure that he could not be with ginny and then as quickly as he had refused her love he had accepted it for this reason hermione and ron had decided to wait two weeks before telling him their secret they had really gotten the hang of hiding their feelings while at grimmauld place anyway what was two more weeks then they would know for sure that harry and ginny were together and now two weeks after the peaceful dinner of dobby vegetable soup it looked as though she and ron could finally tell harry he and ginny were inseparable they were once again the adorable couple with the infectious cheerfulness they had actually succeeded in infecting the whole household mr and mrs weasley were overjoyed at the idea of ginny dating harry mrs weasley would get teary eyed nearly every time she witnessed harry giving her daughter a kiss mr weasley had begun referring to harry as son ron would light up when his father did this with an adorable smile which would then cause hermione to light up it reminded her of the comment ginny made about her and hermione being sisters one day maybe ron and harry would be brothers even tonks hair was a brighter shade of pink lately she seemed to enjoy just sitting back and watching harry and ginny playful banter of course anyone would it wasntthe sickening type of flirtations that some couples participated in harry and ginny wasted no time with shmoopsy whoopsies their flirtations were simply charming sometimes hermione would catch herself just staring at them and smiling at the present moment however hermione was nervous and frowning for the past two months she and ron had hidden their feelings very well and over these months she had continually reminded herself that not telling harry was the right thing to do so naturally there was still a part of her that was holding on to that presumption there was a part of her saying what if harry hates the idea of me and ron dating she knew she was being silly but she couldnthelp herself glancing outside the window hermione saw that the light streaming in was now a bright yellow her purple thinking light was gone and it was time to get up and face the day yellow light meant that dobby had already prepared breakfast for everyone mrs weasley had been given a nice two week holiday from cooking and cleaning although hermione wasntsure if mrs weasley was actually enjoying the break hermione had spotted her a few times wiping the already clean table or rewashing the dishes taking care not to wake ginny hermione slowly rolled out of bed and made her way to the loo where she showered dressed and threw her hair up into a bushy ponytail she then began making her way to the staircase the hall was completely silent hermione quite liked being the first out of bed everything was so peaceful once she reached the first step however she stopped smiling to herself hermione closed her eyes envisioned the far corner of the basement kitchen and warm swirling colors pop pop crash bloody hell hermione quickly opened her eyes to see a wide eyed ron standing near the kitchen sink with one hand clutching his chest a broken plate was shattered on the floor at his feet apparently he had been about to fill it with the breakfast dobby had prepared kippers porridge eggs bacon toast and jam oh sorry hermione exclaimed as her hand flew to her mouth in an attempt to hide an involuntary smile with her other hand she quickly retrieved her wand repaired the plate and levitated it to sit atop the counter rapidly recovering from his sudden scare ron smiled at her roguishly as he retrieved an ample amount of strawberry preserves from a bowl with his index finger ron dont hermione warned between giggles backing up as he began advancing toward her unfortunately she had decided to apparate herself into a corner so there wasntmuch backing up that she could do of course she could just apparate to the other side of the room but this was more fun you know this isntthe first time you ve made me jump out of my skin with this new skill of yours he said as he came to stand about an inch from her smiling and holding his finger threateningly close to her cheek she could feel his body heat and smell his freshly showered scent heavens he smelled good he must have used the second floor loo to shower while she used the one on the first floor but ron never woke this early between her continuing laughs hermione managed to say i thought i was the only one awake at this hour ron dont ron smile plainly showed that he had every intention of wiping that jam on her clean face so purely out of desperation and maybe a bit of bold flirtation hermione grabbed ron hand took his finger in her mouth and sucked off the sweet bit of jam staring into his magnificent blue eyes hermione saw ron playful smile immediately replaced by a shocked expression that seemed to cause his whole body to freeze that small act of desperation was much more exhilarating for hermione than she had foreseen pleasant currents were sweeping through her body as she slowly removed his finger from her mouth their gazes locked hermione jane granger ron whispered in astonishment before he smiled broadly at her hermione suddenly felt her cheeks go very warm she knew she was blushing like mad for some reason she suddenly felt very timid as she asked the first question that came to her what are you doing up at this hour ron slid his warm slightly calloused hands under her shirt to grab hold of her waist and pull her to him he then bent down until he was breathing in her ear i think it has something to do with nerves but i having trouble remembering much of anything at the moment he said huskily cue the chills he then placed a warm kiss on her neck directly below her ear hermione immediately felt a rush of raw excitement course through her veins she was about to turn her head to return a similar kiss when she saw a pair of feet coming into view on the basement steps she gasped slightly and ron pulled away to look down at her but before ron even had time to raise a questioning eyebrow hermione had closed her eyes and pop pop she was now on the other side of the kitchen ron looked a bit silly standing in the corner but he quickly turned around with a slightly alarmed expression hey ron harry said as he appeared at the bottom of the stairs for some reason ron rushed forward to sit down in one of the wooden chairs around the table harry looked a bit confused as he asked what are you hi harry hermione said suddenly feeling as though she should make her presence known and interrupt harry question harry turned around quickly oh he said looking slightly startled hey hermione i thought i heard someone apparate yeah i just came from my room hermione said trying to sound casual really i just came from there checking on ginny harry began slowly hermione heart stopped as he looked from ron to her but hermione i didntsee good morning all ginny said brightly as she suddenly entered the kitchen hermione exhaled a long breath and ron gave her a relieved glance why were they so relieved at ginny interruption werentthey going to tell harry everything today this would have been as good a time as any wouldntit no hermione thought it wouldnt breaking the news to harry with oh ron and i are in love and we were just about to start snogging too bad you interrupted didntsound appropriate harry attention was fortunately drawn to ginny however as he approached her and gave her a quick hug he seemed to immediately forget the confusing scene that he had just stumbled upon in no time harry and ginny were basically unaware of ron and hermione presence as they helped themselves to dobby smorgasbord ron and hermione exchanged one more relieved glance before falling into line although hermione heart was still beating rapidly at two things almost being caught in the act and the actual act as the four of them sat around the scrubbed wooden table eating dobby fantastically prepared breakfast hermione watched as a scene played out before her between harry and ginny a scene that was becoming increasingly common among the two harry ginny began after a bite of toast could you pass me the jam sure harry said as he made to stand up but ginny grabbed hold of the bottom of his shirt and pulled him back down beside her no harry do it the other way please ginny begged nearly jumping up and down on her seat harry gave her a sweet smile before shaking his head at her slightly alright he said without speaking an incantation he waved his hand toward the bowl of preserves and levitated it to the table to sit before ginny who smiled brightly at him ron chuckled at his sister as did hermione ginny loved to find small tasks for harry to do with his wandless magic it thrilled her each and every time hermione knew that harry didntlike showing off his talent but since his and ginny reunion he hadntbeen able to refuse her anything ron would joke with them and say that ginny was already spoiled from being the family ginny baby and that now harry was going to ruin her for good since hermione ron and ginny had discovered that harry could perform wandless magic they had all asked him numerous questions about how it was done he had attempted to explain it to them but there didntseem to be much to explain harry said that you just had to focus all of your attention on what you meant to do and besides that you just had to believe that you could do it it sounded very simple but hermione had attempted a few menial tasks without her wand to no avail ron and ginny of course were underage so they could not attempt it though hermione had a feeling that ron would be able to do it easily apparently harry hadnttruly believed that he could do it until after the night he blasted a hole in the ceiling something about knowing that he had done that with a simple stare had given him more confidence so harry said that wandless magic had come easy to him after that he said that he and lupin had then practiced silent dueling throughout the week he spent at hogwarts harry had also tried to explain this technique but it sounded a bit more complicated to hermione than wandless magic lupin had told harry that all of your internal powers had to feed off of your emotion when wizards duel they focus all of their emotions and thoughts into their wands that what causes the lights to shoot out of their wand tips these lights were called magic bursts which hermione already knew from reading some short chapters on dueling from past defense against the dark arts textbooks lupin had said that if harry had pulled his wand out and focused all of his angry thoughts into it the night he blew her up his aunt marge it would have shot a magic burst straight at her but he had also said that some wizards never master the art of dueling because they cannot focus their energy without proper focus you could end up hurting yourself you wontbe able to keep your composure or aim and your magic bursts can even backfire so the thought of attempting to duel made hermione more than a bit anxious she hadnteven been able to make a proper shield charm in their bi weekly defense classes how would she be able to duel without incantations hermione hermione looked up to see harry ginny and ron staring at her oh sorry did someone say something she asked quickly oh we only asked you five times whether or not you ve packed ginny said ron was looking at her worriedly she attempted a casual smile i was daydreaming about dobby excellent cooking but in answer to your question no i haven t ginny and harry chuckled slightly and looked convinced ron on the other hand raised one eyebrow at her she felt herself blush as she looked away from him to take a bite of her kipper just then mrs weasley entered the kitchen looking cheerful and well rested good morning dears mrs weasley said as she crossed to the food to make her own plate oh ginny that blue jumper you asked for i ve almost finished knitting it oh really ginny asked excitedly yes but i d like for you to try it on before i put on the finishing touches i not quite sure about the length of the sleeve alright i finished anyway where is it ginny said as she rose from her seat it in mine and your father room atop the dresser she replied casually ginny smiled and kissed harry atop his head before quickly ascending the stairs mrs weasley finished fixing her plate and then followed after her daughter hermione glanced at ron he was actually looking at her intently she knew what he was thinking this was it they were alone with harry they might not get another moment alone with him all day hermione took a deep breath her heart was in her throat and i need to talk to you two harry said unexpectedly pushing his empty plate forward it disappeared along with ginny abandoned plate mine and ron room alright before she or ron could object harry had apparated from his seat with a crack ron gave her a perplexed expression before quickly standing from his chair what he on about no idea hermione said as her stomach turned sickeningly well maybe i do have an idea but i hope i wrong hermione rose for the door but ron grabbed her hand hey what were you so troubled over earlier it wasntdobby cooking you were oblivious to everything hermione averted her eyes from his gaze she didntreally know why but she didntwant to talk about her inability to perform well in defense against the dark arts so she replied hastily later ron um harry needs us ron looked unsatisfied but before he could press her further pop ron and hermione were seated on his bed awaiting an explanation from harry who was standing in the middle of the room gazing out of the window ron had arrived after hermione of course who had suspiciously apparated out of his presence without explaining to him what she had been thinking over breakfast so he was now worried about hermione unspoken thoughts as well as whatever harry had in store for them what could be both urgent and confidential from ginny hermione had said that she had an idea so did he his stomach twisted painfully listen harry began quietly continuing to stare out the window i ve decided that once we return to hogwarts ginny and i will have to hide our feelings for one another harry hermione began hermione let me finish before you tell me what a bad idea it is harry said sternly i know that there are people in that school that are watching me they see who close to me and they target them on voldemort orders imagine if they got wind that my best friend sister was also my girlfriend so are you going to stop hanging around us now hermione spat smartly harry sighed i have been friends with both of you for six years hermione he said incredulously do you honestly think that there is any chance that voldemort doesntalready know that or have you forgotten what happened over new year s no hermione said quietly ron glanced at hermione who was now staring at her knees he didntreally appreciate harry last comment that wasntnecessary attempting to ignore this however ron began quietly but couldntyou just ron sighed and shifted nervously couldntyou two hide your feelings from everyone except each other he felt hermione look up at him then that what i plan to do actually but i dontknow how to tell ginny harry said sadly do you think she ll consent to having a secret relationship with me i mean what if she stops eating again or what if what if she gives up on me and moves on i cantexpect her to be willing to just keep our relationship on hold until i kill voldemort harry she wontgive up on you hermione began ginny might be disappointed she might even become angry with you but as long as you dontrefuse her completely like before i think it will work but what if we cantmake it work harry asked now beginning to sound a bit desperate what if we canthide our feelings what if i wontbe able to hide the way i feel about her unless i ignore her completely you can ron and hermione said simultaneously ron felt his cheeks go red as hermione looked down nervously how harry asked almost urgently he was apparently too distressed to take note of the oddity of ron and hermione offering him the same answer at the same time well you will just have to find alone time here and there time where you donthave to pretend that she just your friend hermione began slowly there the boy dormitory unused lavatories and the quidditch locker room ron turned to her with a sudden urge to smile which he refused himself it sounded as if hermione might have already thought these things through yes harry began gloomily but there are also our roommates moaning murtle and the quidditch team you re not even going to let on your feelings to fellow gryffindors ron asked in disbelief ron have you forgotten how fast word travels in hogwarts harry asked with slight exasperation ginny and i meet up in the dormitory seamus sees us seamus tells lavender or parvati they talk about it loudly at lunch and bam everyone knows ron frowned yeah i guess i see what you re your invisibility cloak hermione interrupted excitedly harry raised one skeptical eyebrow no listen ginny dorm mates see her get in bed and close the curtains but they dont see her sneak out of bed they dontsee her sneak down the girl staircase and into the sixth year boy dormitory and no one sees her well hermione suddenly turned scarlet enter your bed ron couldntcontain this smile and even harry was smiling slightly now hermione continued seemingly encouraged by their expressions with the invisibility cloak you two could sneak into hagrid hut for visits over tea secret passages for well secrets and even the room of requirement for whatever you require hey harry ron began smiling broadly i think our hermione on to something dontyou hermione blushed again but harry smile was fading slightly i think it sounds brilliant hermione harry began slowly but i dontwant ginny to have to be in a stressful secret relationship with me hermione sighed with frustration harry you and ginny are made for each other she is going to do whatever it takes to stay with you even if she isntespecially keen on the idea at first besides hermione cut her eyes very briefly in ron direction i think a secret relationship sounds a bit exciting harry still looked unconvinced ron felt his ears and cheeks grow warm at hermione words but just then ginny appeared in the doorway harry hermione and ron all looked up at her with slightly guilty expressions it was one of those moments where no matter what expression any of them made they wouldntlook completely innocent have i interrupted something ginny asked blandly with an extremely suspicious look at harry ginny harry began softly um i need to talk with you about something ginny eyes immediately began to fill with tears harry no she whispered harry closed the space between them without a moment hesitation and grabbed hold of her hands ginny please dontcry he whispered it not what you think alright i promised you that i would never push you away again ginny sniffed as she looked at harry somewhat hopefully with wide and watery eyes harry turned to look at ron and hermione we re going to go down to the drawing room for a bit harry then placed one arm about ginny waist as he led her from the room hermione sighed softly before turning abruptly to ron now what now what what ron asked hermione looked up at him sadly now what do we do if ginny wontagree to harry terms for their relationship she asked softly ron realized that hermione reassurances to harry that everything would work out had been partially feigned she will ron said firmly how do you know i know he said evenly and somehow he really thought that he did hermione gave him a calculating look but her face seemed to soften a bit as if she thought he sounded credible enough so what do we do in the meantime hermione asked we wait for the next opportunity to tell harry hermione nodded at him slowly she looked fairly despondent but ron gave her a small smile i thought secret relationships sounded exciting to you she gave him the tiniest of smiles as she rolled her eyes at him i well i ve been really nervous about telling harry she began quietly but once we were so close to telling him down in the basement i guess i began to get excited at the idea of not hiding anymore ron had a huge urge to kiss her then but he reached out to clasp her hand me too he said sincerely their gazes locked as they exchanged meaningful smiles knock knock knock ron quickly released hermione hand to see his father standing in the doorway with a faint smile to ron complete surprise he was holding crookshanks hermione gasped as she stood up from the bed oh my goodness i completely forgot has he been at the burrow this entire time ron father set crookshanks on the floor before smiling at hermione not to worry he been quite content chasing about the gnomes and such i just happened upon him this morning i stopped by the burrow long enough to pick up some things and have a quick look around crookshanks began slowly weaving around mr weasley legs how is everything at home ron asked hesitantly everything appears to be untouched mr weasley said i haventreally decided on whether or not to remain at grimmauld place once you kids get back to hogwarts your mother and i will have to discuss it ron simply nodded as his father continued anyway here mr crookshanks for you hermione now i going to see what old dobby has whipped up for us this morning and with that he left the room crookshanks strutted over to ron trunk at the foot of his bed where he then jumped atop it and laid down lazily hermione was staring at crookshanks and shaking her head absently i a horrible person she said plainly ron chuckled at her but when her bland expression didntchange he realized that she wasntjoking hermione you re not serious he said incredulously ron i abandoned him and he my responsibility my pet she exclaimed and then whispering as if crookshanks might hear her and take offense i never gave him a second thought it been nearly two whole months ron was just gaping at her she actually looked teary eyed hermione ron began calmly standing up beside her and tucking a stray hair behind her ear you are not a horrible person you re a wonderful person and a tragedy occurred two months ago i forgot about him too we all did but ron he mine i feel awful she said miserably looking down at her feet i forget about pig all the time like now where is he i dontknow hermione looked up at him then and twisted her mouth to hide a smile ron you know pig in the drawing room with hedwig he is ron said in mock astonishment hermione giggled a little hey he began a bit more serious now just give crookshanks a hug and he ll forgive you it would work on me hermione gave him an adorable grin before she turned to crookshanks and approached him slowly crookshanks she said timidly as she reached down for him he allowed himself to be lifted into her arms hermione then nuzzled him slightly and kissed him on his squashed ginger haired face ron realized that he was absently smiling at hermione when she turned to look up at him still holding a somewhat limp crookshanks in her arms hermione rose up on her tiptoes and placed a light kiss on ron cheek it was times like these when ron heart fluttered at the simplest of things that he wanted to just forget about keeping anything hidden scoop hermione up into his arms and spin her around or give her an endless shower of kisses but ron thought i know that ginny will accept harry offer and then we can safely tell harry everything they could safely tell harry that they had fallen in love somewhere along the way and that they hoped he would understand ron heart fluttered once more before he and hermione exited his room hermione was sitting at the entrance hall chess table staring down at the small white chess pieces in front of her there werentvery many left although ron still had most of his black pieces she just really didntunderstand how to use strategy in this game if it werentfor the charming expressions of concentration ron made when they played she would probably never consent to playing a game with him at the moment however she might have consented to anything that might pass the time quicker harry and ginny had been up in the drawing room all day afternoon and now evening they had only come out for meals only to go right back upstairs they werentsnogging either well not the entire time at least they had left the door open and hermione had walked by several times to see them sitting upon one of the sofas talking hermione and ron had guessed that ginny didnttake harry news too well at first at lunch she had seemed very quiet and sulky hermione hadntbeen surprised she knew that ginny would most likely put up a fight and insist that she didntcare if voldemort found out about them however harry must have convinced her to accept his terms because by dinnertime they were both being very polite to one another and ginny even smiled a few times of course this might have meant that harry had accepted ginny terms but hermione highly doubted that harry had fallen in love with ginny and he had fallen hard he wasntgoing to let anything happen to her if he could help it ron i cantconcentrate on this anymore hermione said suddenly it had been her turn for at least ten minutes and she hadnteven thought about the game at all in that time ron was looking at her with a small smile he was slouched low in his chair and he had his head propped up on his fist stop looking at me like that ron she said quietly he furrowed his brow slightly why because it makes me want to kiss you and i can t she whispered indicating toward mad eye slumped form on the couch with a jerk of her head she knew she was pouting but she was really not in a good mood right now hermione it wontbe long alright ron said softly i anxious to tell harry too but he and ginny need this time together dontthey i mean we ll sort of be trading places with them shortly they ll have the secret relationship and we won t hermione nodded slowly he was right of course and hermione really didntunderstand why she felt so incredibly gloomy she guessed it was because she had been awaiting today for two weeks thinking that after this day she and ron would not have to hide anything from harry anymore but now it wasntlooking so good now it looked as though they would be hiding their feelings for at least one more day and who knew when they would have time alone with harry tomorrow they would awake travel to the train station arrive at hogwarts have the start of term feast and then it would be time for bed with a heavy sigh hermione closed her eyes to ron beautiful blue and slightly worried gaze ten nine eight ron was contemplating reaching across the chessboard and kissing hermione despite moody presence she looked very troubled but before he could make up his mind harry and ginny began descending the stairs they both looked content as they made their way toward he and hermione hand in hand your chances arentlooking so great hermione harry said as they approached the chess table hermione looked up at him with a small smile it impossible to beat ron at this game hermione said matter of factly before turning to give him a felt a surge of delight run through him at her compliment hmph ah hell i need a scotch they all looked up to see mad eye chuck his copy of the stealth down roughly on the tattered green couch before standing up and hobbling down the basement stairs to the kitchen ginny raised one eyebrow went to the couch snatched up the abandoned paper and sat down she quickly scanned the front page and her eyes grew to twice their original size what ron asked apprehensively harry rushed over to sit beside her and peer over her shoulder after he scanned the page he sat back against the back cushions of the sofa terry boot harry said darkly the new quidditch commentator ron asked quickly ginny looked up slowly from the paper he s dead his whole family no hermione breathed her mouth falling open slightly he a she stopped and looked down at her knees he a what hermione ron asked suddenly finding it slightly hard to breathe a muggle born ginny said quietly ron felt as if a disgustingly cold cement had just been poured down his throat and into his chest ginny stood up then and crossed to hermione oh me and my big mouth hermione i sorry what are you sorry for ron said harshly it has nothing to do with her ginny looked at him sadly before returning to her seat on the couch beside harry who was being very quiet ron hadntmeant to snap at his sister but this really didntaffect hermione she was in no more danger now than she was before boot and his family had been killed ginny and harry were probably just scaring her more by acting so grim hermione was still looking down at her knees blimey he wanted to embrace her sir all four of them looked down to see dobby approaching them from behind the couch he was addressing harry yes dobby harry asked quietly dobby doesntmean to be discourteous or to interrupt harry potter friends but dobby does have a question he cleared his throat before continuing dobby has begun to wonder sir why harry potter keeps the portrait of that bad and dark witch oh it wontcome down dobby harry said dontworry about it it alright but sir it will come down dobby said with a slight smile no dobby we ve honestly tried everything harry replied dobby began hopping from one foot to the other but if dobby could get it down harry potter would be pleased harry looked as if he were growing a bit impatient i suppose dobby dobby smiled brightly and turned to walk toward the portrait dobby looked up at the painting and pointed a long thin finger at it suddenly a bright blue burst shot out of his finger and impacted with the painting which promptly fell to the floor with a soft thud harry stood up from the couch his mouth partway open in shock dobby how did you do that he asked in awe dobby smiled at harry and shrugged magic sir ron had heard that house elves had special magical abilities that witches and wizards did not he didntknow much about them though actually he only knew two things that they could do that humans couldn t they could apparate inside of hogwarts and apparently they could remove stubborn seemingly non removable items from walls thanks dobby harry said quickly crossing to the painting he bent down to look at it dobby where mrs black dobby actually giggled slightly oh sir unwanted witches and wizards do not remain in their frames once they re removed from the wall oh harry said plainly that makes sense so where did she go hermione asked quietly ron thought she looked a bit pale she gone miss mrs black painting is no more dobby replied harry rose then but the frame fell face forward onto harry foot he looked down at it and his brow furrowed slightly he then squatted back down beside it ron come look at this he said slowly ron stood quickly from his seat and crossed to squat beside harry hermione and ginny were close behind there was something taped on the back of the painting but the thick brown tape covered the object completely harry reached down and pulled slightly it came off rather easily ron couldntsee very well while harry was pulling the tape off of the object but once harry was finished he was holding a large curved dagger whoa ron said looking in awe at the hidden treasure its handle was about six inches long and wrapped in black leather it also had a black leather sheath and strap harry removed the blade from the sheath to reveal an eight inch long shiny silver metal edge how long do you suppose it been back there harry asked i dunno mate ron said as he stared at the blade a while i reckon possibly the same amount a time that portrait been on the wall which could be ages ron looked up at the bare wall where the picture had been there was now a large square of dark green embroidered wallpaper ron guessed the greenish brown wallpaper in the rest of the entrance hall had looked like that small patch at one time i dontlike it hermione said suddenly she was glaring at the dagger as if were some evil creature ron stood up beside her ginny was glaring at the dagger as well come on you two ron said with a slight smile it just an ancient dagger i think it kind of cool well of course you do ginny snarled you re a boy ron rolled his eyes at his sister but then he caught hermione eye the look she was giving him was a bit scary her jaw was set her lips were pursed and her eyes were squinted slightly uh oh i keeping it harry said suddenly harry ginny and hermione said together casting harry disapproving stares harry ignored them however dobby harry said looking down at the elf if you put the frame back on the wall will mrs black return no sir dobby said well then i want you to put the frame back on the wall and if anyone asks you about mrs black tell them that she has crossed over or gone toward the light or whatever it is unwanted paintings do but donttell them about this dagger alright yes sir dobby understands sir dobby said hastily before turning toward the painting and levitating it back onto the wall harry hermione began matter of factly i really dontthink you should have anything to do with that dagger unless you know exactly harry sighed heavily hermione it a dagger it was probably in the black family for a long time then why was it hidden behind a portrait with a permanent sticking charm on it hermione asked smartly i dontknow hermione harry began with slight exasperation probably because it worth a lot of money or something what do you think about it ron harry asked turning to him oh crap ron thought what did he think he honestly thought it was a cool looking dagger that he would personally keep but hermione was still giving him that evil look i i would keep it if it were me he said honestly hermione eyes went wide he looked away see harry said plainly well ginny began i guess it does look harmless you just be careful harry she said warningly but then that was it she grabbed harry hand and smiled at him ron mouth dropped open that was it he knew that harry was getting off way easier than he was going to once he and hermione were alone again he should have just said it was a horrible idea well i a bit tired hermione said suddenly she wasntlooking at him and ron could tell that she was trying to sound casual i guess i going to turn in for the night we ve got an early train tomorrow pop ron harry and ginny exchanged quick glances i guess she a bit angry with me harry said with a frown no she isnt ron thought she angry with me she ll forget about it by tomorrow ginny said no she wouldnt ron thought were they talking about the same hermione granger that just apparated up to her room hermione retreated to her bed to hide from him because she was angry how would he get any sleep knowing that she was ill with him harry and ginny began ascending the stairs so ron followed as ron expected harry walked into the girls room to wish ginny goodnight ron couldntrightly follow him in there that would look very odd and suspicious grudgingly ron made his way up to his and harry room this was awful hermione was lying in her bed pretending to be asleep as harry and ginny said their goodnights as soon as she had apparated she had hastily changed into her pajamas and jumped under the covers she could now hear whispering and a few kisses but mostly she just heard angry static in her ears harry had found a mysterious dagger taped to the back of a dark pureblood witch portrait and he and ron had not felt at all suspicious what was it ron had said i would keep it if it were me argh hermione could not believe him the door had just closed harry had left and ginny had gotten in her bed hermione sighed and rolled over on her side she supposed it was pretty harsh of her to just apparate without saying anything to ron but he had made her so angry and she had already been in a bad mood she and ron had not had the chance they wanted to tell harry about their romantic feelings for one another her anxiety about revealing the truth had finally turned into excitement and eagerness but then they could not get harry away from ginny long enough to tell him then there was that muggle born killing that had really bothered hermione even though she hadntsaid anything toher friends so far there had been many muggles and muggle borns killed in the war but no students to hermione knowledge terry boot was the first muggle born hogwart student to lose his life at the hands of a death eater it made hermione shiver and then then harry had found that strange dagger it just gave hermione the creeps well there was nothing she could do about any of that now she would just have to try and fall asleep so that tomorrow would come and hopefully tomorrow would be a better day she was actually very sleepy but then again she had so many horrible thoughts swimming around in her mind but then again she was so very sleepy where am i hermione thought as she looked around a strange room a circular room that odd and so many doors twelve of them they donthave handles though that also a bit odd the floor hmm it very shiny it almost looks like water i should open one of these doors but which one oh they re spinning this was all beginning to look very familiar but why couldntshe place it wait the doors have stopped spinning but now they all have red x on them except for one hmm i guess that the way i have to go hermione reached forward to push at the handle less black door and surprisingly it opened but there was nothing there but complete blackness fear began to rise in hermione chest painfully this place was too familiar she knew exactly where she was suddenly hermione realized that she wasntlooking at complete blackness through the open door but a completely black figure she raised her head slowly it was a man in a black cloak with a black mask he raised his wand and slashed it across her chest a purple flame passed over her and then everything went black hermione sat straight up in her bed her throat was dry and sore she was breathing very heavily and there was sweat covering her face and arms for a horrifying moment she didntknow where she was but then everything seemed to come back to her in a wave the department of mysteries dolohov it was just a nightmare hermione tonks hermione looked toward the door tonks was standing there motioning for her to come out into the hallway hermione quickly got out of her bed and padded out of her bedroom her bare feet cold on the floor are you alright tonks asked worriedly i heard you gasp oh i i had a nightmare hermione said did i gasp loud enough for you to hear me out here yeah you gave me a fright tonks said before twisting her mouth to one side go ahead what hermione asked she was honestly confused you re young and in love and you ve just had a bad dream tonks smiled slightly in thirty seconds or less you re going to be dying to see studly cannons hermione blushed unable to contain a smile actually seeing ron did sound rather appealing to her right now thanks tonks she said sincerely tonks just shrugged hermione wasted no time in hurrying up to the second floor the boys door was partway closed it wasntuntil hermione was standing outside the door that she realized she was wearing a pair of cotton pajamas it was a tank and shorts she didntfeel exactly comfortable in this outfit now that she thought about it she d never worn shorts in front of ron before oh well hermione thought as she inched inside the room it dark ron ron eyes shot open he sat straight up and looked to his side his eyes had not adjusted but he knew that voice hermione he reached a hand out and he felt her small cool hand clasp his his eyes were adjusting now she was sitting on the edge of his bed sitting on his bed in a sleeveless top and shorts was he dreaming shaking his head slightly he found his voice again hermione what happened he whispered urgently nothing i just she looked down and shrugged i had a nightmare a nightmare ron asked breathlessly he felt a huge sigh of relief pass through him blimey hermione you scared me i sorry i shouldnthave woken you no no i really glad you did he said honestly she smiled at him hermione had come to him in the middle of the night because of a nightmare he had to embrace her leaning back against his headboard he said softly come here she quickly hoisted her legs up on the bed and wrapped her arms around his neck resting her head on his shoulder he wrapped both arms around her his eyes traveled from her delicate feet all the way up her body her small ivory legs were just lying there perfect he squeezed her a bit tighter you re beautiful hermione have i ever told you he whispered she lifted her head to look at him with a small smile once in the shed at your house she said just once he asked incredulously he thought it all the time everyday had he really only said it once well that wontdo will it she smiled a bit bigger at him before she scooted in as close as she could get she then lifted her lips to his to give him a soft kiss he returned the favor with a longer kiss as he brushed his fingers down her arm you have chills he said softly she nodded timidly which made him chuckle they gazed at one another for a moment before he asked what did you dream she swallowed hard and laid her head back down on his shoulder i was alone in the department of mysteries and dolohov killed me ron closed his eyes as a wave of anger and trepidation washed through him he held her to him tightly and kissed her on the forehead i sorry hermione he whispered before tenderly grabbing her chin and lifting her face to his for another kiss hermione unexpectedly deepened their kiss and one of her hands moved smoothly from the collar of his flannel shirt down his chest and around his waist his breathing began to quicken as it always did whenever he and hermione started kissing and he had a very strong urge to pull her underneath the covers with him but she suddenly pulled away ron she began quietly i really dontlike that dagger ron closed his eyes for a moment shoot he d forgotten about that hermione i was only answering harry truthfully so you really would ve taken it she asked with a hint of fear in her voice yes he said simply he felt her pull away a bit more but he quickly grabbed her around the waist and pulled her back against him i dontthink so ron hermione what if i tell harry that i think he should get that dagger checked out he asked she looked up at him with a slight frown maybe he should say something more and i wonttell him that i think it cool anymore okay ron thought i think i saw a tiny smile and i ll tell him that i think it a really ugly knife that only a prat would carry around she giggled then and buried her head into his chest to stifle it he squeezed her to him and once again looked down at her ivory legs hermione he began slowly she looked up at him smiling i have to ask you something what she asked sounding a bit apprehensive ron then reached down and twiddled with the hem of her shorts why have you been hiding these they re amazing my shorts ron they re no your legs he whispered brushing the back of his hand across her thigh it was too dark to tell but ron was sure that he was making her blush that lovely rouge color she laid her head back on his shoulder but to ron surprise one of her small hands slid underneath his shirt she glided it smoothly up his chest to rest on his sternum why do you hide this she whispered softly in his ear ron immediately realized that he wasntgoing to be able to speak after hermione glided her hand over his barren chest so he instead pulled her against him with the arm that was around her waist resting his forehead on hers he used his fingertips on his free hand to gently trace over her lips before he took her lips with his hermione fingers began tracing circles along his chest as their kisses grew in passion ron somehow felt warm all over while at the same time chills were erupting all over his chest and arms psst they broke apart rather quickly and looked toward the door tonks entered the room and walked quietly to stand before his bed she then whispered um okay the chastity fairy is here to collect a miss hermione granger whose time with mr ron weasley is hereby up ron face ears and neck began to boil he and hermione exchanged quick glances before hermione began to pull from his embrace and scoot off the bed tonks shook her head at them slightly before leaving the room well bye i guess hermione whispered as she stood by his bed ron quickly scooted out from underneath the covers to stand beside her he then leaned down and embraced her giving her a few quick kisses on her slender neck goodnight he said in her ear before pulling away she rose on her toes to plant a kiss on the corner of his mouth before turning to leave he allowed himself to take in her appearance as she strode from the room turning at the door to give him a small wave ron then turned and sunk back down on his bed tomorrow he thought suddenly we have to tell harry tomorrow that middle of the night visit was too fantastic to not repeat in the future after all ginny and hermione could both fit underneath harry invisibility cloak

property of j k rowling bloomsbury and aol time warner and have been used without permission no copyright violation is intended no profit is being made off this site it is for entertainment purposes only chapter 28 a large pile of socks boxers shirts and jeans were lying atop ron bed there was a similar pile on harry s they were each siphoning through their newly washed laundry that mrs weasley had delivered when she woke them she told them that they would have to separate what belonged to whom because she had to get along with the rest of the girls laundry so immediately after breakfast and showers ron and harry had begun the task of separating their clothing ron found that this task was not as simple as one might think so what about these harry asked ron turned around to see his friend holding up a pair of dark woolen grey socks well i have some that look a bit like those ron replied shrugging so do i harry said with a sigh before tossing them at ron take them i ready to be done with this ron caught the socks and threw them into his opened trunk he agreed this task was bordering on being annoyingly tedious they didnthave much time left anyway they were to leave grimmauld place by nine o clock and it was already eight thirty just thirty minutes until departure thirty more minutes of feeling as though hermione were completely safe after they walked out of the front doors of this house anything could happen they would be going to hogwarts the place that ron used to believe to be the safest place in the wizarding world now he wasntso sure okay i know these arentmine harry said tossing ron a pair of bright orange boxers with the chuddly cannons quidditch logo on them ron smiled sheepishly hey mate you ve gotta support the team haventyou sure harry said rolling his eyes slightly hey what do you say we just lob everything into our trunks and separate this stuff at school brilliant idea ron said as he immediately began grabbing handfuls of clothes and tossing them into his trunk they were landing haphazardly and ron knew that he would have a lot of wrinkled clothing once he got to school but once he got to school he could just do an unwrinkling charm so ron just continued to toss in handful after handful until he saw something strange in one of the handfuls that caught his eye he was sure he saw a flash of pale pink material fall into his trunk i dontown anything pink ron thought a bit curious ron bent down over his trunk and rummaged through a few things and then he saw them a small pair of pale pink knickers glancing up to make sure that harry was still quite distracted with his own packing ron reached down with his thumb and index finger and picked up the soft cotton undergarment images immediately began to spring into his mind that he was quite sure would constitute as a violation of hermione privacy were these hermione s ron swallowed hard and dropped the knickers back inside his trunk he then quickly shoved the rest of his clothes on top and shut the trunk lid with a thud before snapping down the locks the images remained ron closed his eyes tightly i such a pig he thought i need to clear my mind uh harry ron began in a somewhat high pitched voice he cleared his throat so how exactly are we getting to the station again harry looked up from his trunk looking slightly perplexed were you not listening to tonks and mad eye over breakfast he asked curiously ron merely shrugged yes he thought but please just help me clear my mind we re taking one of the cars from the ministry auror office harry replied ron of course already knew this but he listened intently nonetheless goodbye images goodbye images and it supposedly has quite a few security features and whatnot ron nodded yes tonks and mad eye had informed them all over breakfast that they would be escorted by four order members this tidbit should have made ron feel better but it had only made his eggs lose their taste knowing that the ministry felt it necessary to send four teenagers to school escorted by four guards made ron stomach churn he knew that it was not only for harry protection but also hermione s finished harry said with a sigh as he closed the lid of his trunk ready to head downstairs yeah mate you ron asked wearily not actually ready at all harry nodded and they both grabbed their satchels and trunks before heading out the door they stopped by the drawing room to pick up their owls and then lugged their cargo down the rest of the stairs to the entrance hall hermione and ginny were seated at the chess table in the corner their luggage about the floor around them with a groan ron saw that hermione was wearing an adorable pale pink sweater the images returned after ron and harry had made their way over ron took a seat on hermione trunk which positioned him directly to the side of the table his eyes went wide when he looked down at the pieces hermione ron exclaimed excitedly you ve got her beat in two moves hermione looked up at him disbelievingly you can tell that just by glancing at the board well yeah hermione look ron pointed out the position of her remaining knight you re knight is hey ginny cried punching ron in the arm no fair harry laughed so she punched him too come on ginny ron said with a sly smile let me give hermione a small hint unless of course you think a small hint from ron weasley is worth the game ginny sat back in her chair and crossed her arms returning his sly smile i already have a strategy for my win thank you go ahead and give her your little hint ron slid down a bit on the trunk toward hermione so that he could lean forward and cup his hands around her ear he took a deep breath before whispering blimey you smell good he felt a small pinch on his arm sorry okay take her knight with yours i know how ginny plays she ll move her pawn after that and then you can use your rook to take her queen that will equal checkmate oh and i love you beautiful ron leaned back from her and looked at a violently blushing hermione ginny was looking at him suspiciously but harry simply seemed to be awaiting hermione move hermione did exactly what he d told her and ginny knight was promptly busted into bits ginny then reacted exactly as ron had predicted smiling broadly he watched as hermione took ginny queen with her rook checkmate hermione said proudly ginny mouth fell open and she squinted up at ron harry laughed and was again punished by ginny she squeezed him on the back of his knee where harry seemed to be ticklish seeing as how he jerked away rather quickly while his friend was distracted ron reached over and squeezed hermione softly on her knee she looked at him with a timid smile and ron suddenly remembered something hey do you have your mirror he asked quickly yes it in my satchel you yeah in my satchel he replied smiling at her having the mirrors on them did make ron feel a bit better about leaving grimmauld place keep your satchel with you at all times on the train okay hermione dontleave it behind if you have to go to the loo or anything all right better yet take ginny with you if you have to go to the loo but also take your satchel and if you go track down the food trolley keep it with you then too actually it wontmatter then i ll just go with you to the food trolley but if you have to oy ron ginny said suddenly ron looked up to see ginny and harry staring at him with slightly raised eyebrows he felt his face going a bit red stop going spare hermione will be fine ron attempted a half smile but he noticed harry looking from him to hermione with a strange look on his face something akin to suspicion ron leaned back a bit more from hermione and then just decided to stand up from her trunk altogether i come bearing gifts they all turned to see ron dad coming up the basement stairs with four small metal boxes in his arms picked these up at st mungo that day i visited dung they re basic healing kits i thought they might be nice to carry for uh emergencies you know safety first and all that mum made you pick them up didntshe ginny asked as mr weasley began handing one kit to each teen he gave her a playful warning look i must say i dontknow what you re talking about he replied with a hint of a smile before reaching down to lift his daughter trunk with one hand and pig cage with the other pig gave a loud squawk ron harry you two mind giving me a hand with the girls luggage ron shoved his kit into his satchel before grabbing hold of hermione trunk with one hand and his own with the other he then began lugging them to the door well here we go thought ron goodbye security as the door opened ron stopped in his tracks the scene on the other side of the door was a bit unanticipated tonks mad eye kingsley and lupin were all standing around a sleek black car with heavily tinted windows they were each positioned at one of the four car doors dressed in crisp black suits tonks was almost unrecognizable with her jet black hair ron suddenly felt like the muggle prime minister as he slowly approached the car behind his father nice hair ron said to tonks she shrugged it a bit bland for me she replied casually as ron looked away from her he thought he might have seen lupin staring at tonks with his head tilted to one side however when ron looked again he realized that lupin was merely scratching the back of his neck and coughing mr weasley was now leaned over the opened boot of the car in which he had already hoisted ginny trunk he then deposited pig and hedwig inside the car through one of the back doors then ron and harry hoisted their trunks inside the boot it was a good thing these ministry cars had enchanted interiors to hold large amounts of luggage of course ron wasnttoo thrilled about the fact that with a roomy backseat he would have no reason to sit close to hermione alright remus harry exclaimed brightly after closing the boot cover i didntknow you would be one of the escorts well harry i volunteered when i heard a guard would be taking you to king cross lupin replied giving harry a swift pat on the arm harry and lupin then began chatting a bit but ron quit paying attention he thought he had heard hermione name so he began eavesdropping on a conversation between his father and mad eye while pretending to be bent down tying his shoestrings yes we ll be staying at grimmauld place arthur said that on amelia orders mad eye asked in his low growling voice i wouldntcall it orders mad eye more so a request well i think she right they know your boy close to two of their prime targets and you know there only one way to keep one step ahead of them constant vigilance ron thought he saw his father jump a bit at moody exclamation but ron then quickly stood from the ground and entered the house he felt like he could be sick he hadntreally thought of the idea of death eaters continuing to target his family after harry and hermione werentwith them anymore but he guessed that was thick of him of course they would have some beef with his parents his parents holiday invitation to hermione had botched up their kidnapping and who was this amelia person requesting that his parents stay at the order headquarters amelia hmm ron had a feeling that he should recognize that name but he couldntplace it once back inside ron saw hermione and ginny waiting near the door with their satchels over their shoulders his mum and dobby were standing off to the side both of them looked a bit teary eyed ron rolled his eyes slightly before approaching the girls hermione had crookshanks cage in one hand and ron reached down and took it from her taking care to brush his hand across hers hermione smiled at him before reaching her hand inside ron satchel which was still hung over his shoulder she then pulled out his basic healing kit may i she asked may you what ron asked curiously hermione then pulled her wand from her back pocket and held it to the kit decresco hermione said softly the metal box immediately shrunk to the size of a galleon hermione smiled as she returned her wand to her back pocket see she said holding up the now tiny healing kit pocket size now you can carry it around with you everywhere to get it back to it original size just say engorgio she said simply before reaching down and dropping it into ron jeans pocket which for some reason made his heart leap he smiled at her genius at spell work as well as the adorable expression she now wore ginny sighed in exasperation good grief with you two together i honestly dontsee how anything could possibly happen to either one of you hermione you ve got your own guardian and ron you ve got your own healer ron and hermione both chuckled at ginny comment exchanging quick smiles as harry and arthur entered the house hermione guardian he liked the sound of that ready kids mr weasley asked excitedly i think they re waiting for you out there mrs weasley sniffed loudly alright there molly mr weasley asked his wife she blew her nose on a handkerchief before nodding vigorously i fine arthur she said quickly dobby then blew his nose loudly on what looked like an old sock alright dobby harry asked with a small smile yes sir dobby said returning harry smile dobby is just expecting to miss harry potter and his friends harry approached the elf and knelt beside him here dobby i almost forgot he said reaching into his jacket pocket and retrieving a small brown sack ron heard the sound of clinking coins as harry handed the sack to dobby i order you to accept this from me and use it only for yourself dobby abruptly burst into tears burying his head in his hands and wailing something about not worthy and the great harry potter mrs weasley then approached the four teenagers huddled near the front door now i want each of you to be extremely careful and well behaved dontdo anything foolish or dangerous she gave them each a fierce hug before ushering them out the door actually ron was pretty sure they d each received more than one hug from his mother by the time they descended the front steps each of the four order members promptly opened a car door as the four descended the steps quickly followed by ron parents kingsley got in the driver seat while mad eye took the passenger side tonks and lupin however waited patiently beside the opened back doors for the kids to finish saying their goodbyes to mr and mrs weasley ginny and hermione then entered the backseat first quickly followed by ron and harry tonks and lupin piled in after them the backseat actually reminded ron of one of the compartments on the hogwarts express there were two benches facing each other with a wide foot space in between although these seats were shiny black leather that squeaked a bit when ron sat down tonks and lupin each had a window seat with hedwig and pig sitting between them the four teenagers sat across from them on the bench unfortunately harry and ginny sat smack dab in the middle of the bench so ron sat beside harry and tried not to feel too antsy over the distance between him and hermione glancing down ron noticed that tonks black shiny shoes had bright pink shoestrings he almost laughed out loud but an unexpected question entered his mind that took him by surprise if those pale pink knickers were hermione s i wonder what other colors she got aghast with this sudden thought ron shook his head he truly was a great foul pig as the black ministry car pulled away from grimmauld place and began the drive to king cross station hermione began taking deep steadying breaths she suddenly felt very faint ron was seated on the other side of harry looking quite attractive in his muggle clothing but that wasntwhy hermione felt faint she didntthink she was fairly certain that it was nervous tension causing her wooziness nerves over the upcoming school year classes tests alleged kidnappers nerves over getting ever closer to telling harry about her and ron and nerves over riding backward in a moving car it was an odd sensation and hermione wasnttoo keen on it she had been known to become carsick once or twice on road trips with her family alright hermione tonks asked suddenly you look a bit peaky oh fine fine hermione lied very aware that she was now receiving a worried stare from ron she decided to close her eyes lay her head back against the cool leather seat and try to rest for the duration of the drive this proved to be effective as she surprisingly drifted off to sleep for the hour long trip what felt like a mere five minutes later she was woken by someone prodding her in the arm with their finger we re here hermione ginny said softly opening her eyes hermione saw that the car was already parked and tonks and lupin were already standing outside she exited the car to join ron and harry who were helping unload the boot after they had each retrieved their luggage they made their ways toward platform 9 the guard followed in a close perimeter tonks and lupin even came through the barrier with them well you kids be safe lupin said sincerely and then turning to harry with a smile he said and i ll see you starting the second week of school hermione was glad to hear that harry training would continue although she honestly didntknow what else lupin and dumbledore could teach him of course he could always hone his newfound skills harry and ginny had already begun walking toward the train at a friendly distance of course but hermione noticed ron saying something to tonks who was smiling brightly hermione decided to approach them no problem tonks said to ron i know what it like to have a secret relationship really hermione asked with interest she guessed ron had thanked her for being such a helpful accomplice in keeping their relationship hidden over the holiday but what was this about a secret relationship tonks sighed and hermione thought she saw her look over at lupin you two better hurry now the train leaves in about ten minutes hermione and ron both said goodbye and waved to lupin before lugging their trunks and caged pets to the train where harry and ginny were waiting tonks and lupin didntleave until they saw that they were all safely onboard once they were aboard the four searched a while until they found an empty compartment hermione watched as ron lifted his trunk to the luggage carrier it was pleasing to watch but as harry was also in the compartment hermione looked away she grabbed her trunk and hoisted it up on the bench she was about to hoist it up the rest of the way but it suddenly became weightless hermione ron said firmly as he grabbed it from her and easily hoisted her trunk up in the carrier beside his she smiled at him briefly before taking her seat on the bench beside ginny ron sat down beside harry for the time being both couples would have to pretend to be merely friends hey everyone they all looked up to see dean thomas standing in the doorway of the compartment he looked slightly different to hermione what was it hey everyone said in greeting uh actually um dean began crossing and uncrossing his arms and hermione suddenly realized what looked different dean looked timid and a bit nervous she d never seen that in him before i actually wondered if i could speak with you harry harry looked a bit taken aback but he stood up slowly sure dean then came further into the compartment closed the door and took a seat beside hermione and across from harry standing form we can talk in here harry i dontmind if these guys hear what i have to say he said before looking around at them all and smiling weakly harry sat back down with a furrowed brow dean took a deep breath before continuing okay i dontknow if any of you have ever heard of a newspaper called the stealth but just then the compartment door opened and luna lovegood appeared in the doorway pardon me but is there room for one more there was a sort of awkward moment in which no one answered because dean was waiting on harry or one of the other three to answer since it was their compartment yet none of them were answering because they didntknow if dean minded luna overhearing whatever it was he wished to tell harry finally though dean nodded at harry who then motioned for luna to enter once the door was shut and luna settled harry cleared his throat and replied yeah dean we actually have heard of the stealth oh luna said her eyes protruding with a dreamy expression that quite an interesting paper they are always outselling father i think many people prefer the not so cheerful news um yeah dean said looking down sadly well did you guys read the article on the death eater that was killed about a month ago well we didntsee an article on that but we heard that lestrange no dean said quietly not him i was referring to avery avery dead harry asked in disbelief hermione mouth fell open slightly dean looked up at harry and for a brief second hermione thought he almost looked like he would cry or be sick but then he looked down and muttered i killed him hermione eyes went wide as ginny gasped and a hand flew to her mouth harry expression was blank and ron looked utterly shocked hermione glanced over at luna who was seated beside ron but she was merely reading an issue of the quibbler the turning of pages was the only sound in the compartment he was sent to kill me dean continued quietly hermione felt sick i think that um you know who may have found out that i plan to be an auror what ginny breathed looking horrified voldemort targeted him because they found out that he wanted to be an auror hermione thought the sick feeling in her stomach deepened as she glanced at ron malfoy ron said through gritted teeth dean raised an eyebrow at him but ron continued he in that history of the dark arts class with you and harry isnthe he must know what career you re taking the class for dean looked thoughtful for a moment but then he merely shrugged i dontknow how the death eaters found out exactly but i guess avery wanted to do me in like he did my father what do you mean harry asked quietly in the last war my father was killed by death eaters because he wouldntjoin them dean said with his lip twisted in disgust it took about five of them to take him down at least that what my mother heard from the authorities but i guess you know who just saw me as a stupid kid so he only sent avery i dean voice broke off and he looked down at his hands i didntmean to kill him harry i just pointed my wand at his heart and and a green light shot out of my wand and then he died dean it was self defense i mean if you hadntkilled him he harry began but dean looked up from his hands with real sadness in his eyes they said i performed the killing curse harry the killing curse dean said his voice strained they harry asked the ministry officials that came to my house after the incident they said that i wouldntbe prosecuted since i performed an unspoken unintentional unforgivable curse in self defense dean said now talking rather quickly you must be asking yourself why is he telling me this and harry i honestly dontknow but ever since it happened i ve been thinking about the rumors that went about after our first year something about you killing professor quirrell by accident i guess i thought well you thought i might understand how you feel harry asked dean nodded slowly and harry heaved a large sigh dean i honestly never felt guilt over quirrell death he tried to help voldemort back into power i guess i see the death of one dark wizard as equaling the saved lives of many good wizards and muggles i guess dean said slowly but he didntsound convinced dean ginny said suddenly avery helped kill your father and then he tried to kill you and on top of that he been a death eater for ages and has undoubtedly killed numerous others what he done with his life is unforgivable the curse you cast was not dean gave ginny a weak smile and swallowed rather hard hermione thought that this time he lookeda bitmore convinced thanks gin and harry look i sorry i interrupted you guys with depressing news as soon as you got on the train not to worry harry replied dean slowly stood from his seat but harry quickly added why dontyou just hang out with us for a while no need to rush off sure dean said with a surprised smile as he sat back down hermione felt extreme sympathy for dean at that moment he had just killed the murderer of his father and he actually felt guilty about it that spoke volumes about his character to hermione oh my luna said suddenly in that dreamy voice there a new minister of magic what ron asked skeptically hermione noticed that luna was still reading the quibbler amelia bones luna said calmly hmm she likes cribbage amelia ron asked suddenly and then he started nodding as if he just realized something amelia bones i really dontthink hermione began wondering why ron was reacting in that way but dean interrupted no that right i read that early this morning in the daily prophet apparently fudge was sacked i dontthink he had very good approval ratings among the wizarding community my mother couldnteven stand him and she a muggle i think he lost a lot of support because he was so rotten to you and dumbledore harry he said matter of factly so luna right hermione asked incredulously luna looked up from her paper and looked at hermione with a slight frown i mean i just really surprised that there a new minister she added hastily luna turned back to her paper and hermione felt herself blush what about magical law ron asked almost fearfully who ll take her place as professor of my n e w t class no one dean said plainly i read that she would continue to teach the magical law class at hogwarts ron looked relieved at this news well she ll be better than fudge ginny said cynically how can we know for sure hermione asked although hermione truly thought that anyone would be better than fudge because hermione she a woman ginny said they all chuckled at this although ginny looked completely then leaned over hermione slightly and patted ginny knee still think a woman going to rule the world gin he asked good humoredly and i bet you still think it you ginny forced a polite smile but hermione could feel the tension in the small compartment she was sure that dean and luna couldn t but that didntchange the fact dean had just made a slightly flirtatious remark and gesture toward harry girlfriend hermione glanced up at harry and saw wait hermione shut her eyes tight and then opened them again for a second she could have sworn she d seen a faint green glow in his eyes now however it was gone she must be getting tired fortunately the rest of the train ride went by without any more awkward moments with dean who was actually quite humorous hermione always knew that he had a sense of humor but she didntknow he could make a whole group of people laugh for an hour straight after an hour however dean left to go back to his compartment with seamus as soon as he d left however a somewhat awkward moment did occur with luna luna was sitting up straight on her bench listening to a conversationg between harry and ron about this upcoming term quidditchpractices and out of nowhere she turned to harry and spoke with the utmost casual wistfulness she said so how long have you been dating ginny hermione watched as the color drained from harry face ginny actually smiled how did you know ginny asked in awe ginny harry said sternly ginny cast him a half scowl before he turned to luna luna what makes youthink that we re dating he asked with forced calm hermione knew his insides were squirming like mad because luna stated plainly i can see it you didntlike it when dean thomas touched her knee harry color came back slightly but now it was very flushed well alright that not the point though the point is that we really need to keep this quiet luna could you please not tell anyone he asked quietly she nodded a few times before tilting her head to one side as she looked at harry i dontwant to tell anyone she replied harry let out a sigh and leaned back against his seat he seemed convinced with luna promise the rest of the train ride was fairly uneventful and before they knew it the hogwarts castle was looming large and beautiful in the distance i guess we should get our robes on hermione said as she stood from the bench remembering the look ron had given her earlier when she had tried to hoist her trunk up by herself she added ron could you get my trunk please sure ron said with a smile as he quickly rose to retrieve both of their trunks hermione wasntexactly sure why ron seemed to enjoy doing these small tasks for her but she found it quite endearing again hermione had to stop herself from staring as ron reached up for their luggage harry retrieved his and ginny luggage as well but hermione noticed that ginny did not attempt to stop herself from staring at harry ginny then poked harry in the ribs and motioned for him to help luna with her trunk which he did ron hermione said holding back a smile as she looked up at his collar come here ron approached her tentatively but she just giggled at him she reached up and fixed his collar to where it wasntflipped out at odd angles there she said he smiled roguishly at her maybe i was trying to make a fashion statement she smiled up at him well if you re trying to say here an example of what not to do she replied playfully he chuckled at her and their gazes locked for a brief moment before hermione realized that harry was still in the compartment glancing at him she noticed him looking from her to ron and was that a hint of a smile when the train finally came to a halt harry opened the compartment door and waltzed out into the hallway which was quickly filling with students and their luggage hermione was about to follow after ginny and luna but ron grabbed hold of her wrist she turned to look at him and was a bit surprised to see a look of apprehension in his eyes ron what wr hermione will you promise me something ron whispered urgently her heart was beginning to beat faster as his tone and expression were sort of frightening what she asked listen you re a brilliant witch hermione but you and i both know that well that you didntperform all that well in our bi weekly defense classes last term he said looking at her apologetically hermione face fell ron i hermione i just want you to promise me that you re going to try harder in defense against the dark arts we re going to have that new teacher uh what his um williams wilson edgar whitman hermione replied quietly that him ron said quickly hermione promise me that you ll try harder alright ron i am trying hermione replied truthfully i dontknow what wrong with me i just i just can t don t say can t he said sternly grabbing hold of both of her hands ron you re kind of scaring me hermione whispered as a lump formed in her throat hermione i not meaning to scare you i going to be with you all term and you wontever be out of my sight long enough for anything to happen to you he said reassuringly absently stroking her fingers with his i just need you to pr i promise hermione said softly suddenly very ready for this conversation to end i will try my hardest a somewhat relieved look passed over ron face before he gave her a small smile and squeezed both of her hands gently he then quickly bent down to grab the handle of his trunk hermione did the same they then squeezed their ways into the confusing flood of students in the narrow hall with each step she took as she trudged along toward the train exit hermione found herself growing more and more anxious about the upcoming term ron was obviously anxious for her to better her skills in defense against the dark arts hermione wanted to as well but would she be able to and even if she were able to better her skills would she actually have to use them before the term was up a cold shiver ran down hermione spine author note okay wow i hate not posting for a couple of days it makes me feel bad for those of you that check for updates

been used without permission no copyright violation is intended no profit is being made off this site it is for entertainment purposes only chapter 29 the drone of hundreds of voices met hermione ears as she entered the great hall for the start of term feast the ceiling was filled with replicas of the millions of twinkling stars of the night sky glancing to the left on her way to the gryffindor table she saw that malfoy crabbe and goyle were already seated at the slytherin table she also noticed a young girl at the ravenclaw table crying and being comforted by michael corner hermione wasntsure who the girl was but she wondered if she had just been told of terry boot death hermione did know michael corner to be one of terry good friends once she reached the gryffindor house table hermione took her seat beside harry facing ron and ginny who were seated across from them she could see the other three house tables from where she sat and she noticed that now malfoy was laughing heartily and pointing something out to crabbe and pansy parkinson following the direction of malfoy pale thin finger she saw the object of their laughter idiots harry murmured low beside her he had seen too dean was bent down among the crowd of students entering the doors picking up the contents of his satchel which had mysteriously split open ron and ginny turned in their seats to look as well you know what malfoy needs ginny said vehemently ron nodded at her yeah he said through gritted teeth he needs a swift kick in the a ron caught hermione eye and cleared his throat in the abdomen hermione couldntcontain a small smile and harry chuckled slightly to her surprise she suddenly felt two feet clamp on either side of hers she then had to cough to cover up a giggle that was threatening to burst forth it was so silly how the slightest contact from ron could make her feel better hermione wondered if ginny were the same way with harry harry hermione whispered with a sudden thought she motioned for him to lean closer and he did before she continued i was just thinking just because you and ginny canthold hands at mealtimes it doesntmean you canthold feet she leaned back to judge his response which was a small smile as harry continued to look at her hermione saw ginny jerk slightly from across the table hermione then smiled brightly it was humorous to her that none of the hundreds of students in the great hall were aware that there were two secret couples at the gryffindor table holding feet good evening and welcome the buzz of students voices faded quickly as dumbledore booming voice filled the hall there was a collective rustling of robes as everyone turned to face the headmaster at the staff table welcome to the second half of your school year i hope everyone had a most fantastic christmas holiday filled with gluttony and excessive cheerfulness now he continued before i give the start of term notices i believe you are entitled to one more bout of voracious feasting so without further ado dumbledore clapped his hands twice and then with a wave all four house tables were filled with a beautiful arrangement of food and glittering golden plates and goblets there was roast beef lamb chops chicken steak boiled potatoes roast potatoes yorkshire pudding peas carrots and many other delicacies everyone immediately resumed their chatter and began filling their plates hermione chose lamb chops as her main course i wonder where professor whitman is hermione said glancing up at the staff table there were definitely no new teachers sitting among the staff maybe he doesntlike large crowds ginny said before taking a bite of a stewed carrot maybe he doesntlike food harry said shrugging everyone likes food mate ron said before taking a large bite of steak i bet he hasntarrived yet i hope he hasntbacked out or anything hermione replied before reaching for ron crescent roll she tore off a pinch for herself before returning the rest to his plate she suddenly had a disturbing image of snape or trewlawney as possible desperate choices for defense against the dark art teacher well harry began i ve actually wondered what a newly certified auror would be doing teaching sixteen year olds at hogwarts i mean dontyou think they could use him in the field we ll find out tomorrow wontwe ron said nonchalantly splitting his crescent roll in half and placing one half on hermione plate these potatoes are excellent he added before spearing another roasted potato onto his fork harry ginny said suddenly could you pass me a treacle tart hermione then noticed that the desserts had appeared on the table harry reached for the treat only to receive a dissatisfied grunt from ginny he twisted his mouth to hold back a smile as he handed it to her ginny i not going to show off for the whole table she rolled her eyes and pouted fine and then handing the tart to harry she added here i didntreally want it to begin with harry smiled at her briefly before looking down at his plate the four continued to eat and chat until they were eventually very full probably too full at which time dumbledore stood once more from his seat to address the hall now that everyone is sleepy from the weight of food and is most likely only pretending to be listening to me i would like to make some announcements dumbledore then turned to his right and gestured toward the staff i would first like to congratulate our professor of magical law ms amelia bones who is now the new minster of magic everyone in the hall including dumbledore gave a smiling madam bones a hearty round of applause secondly dumbledore continued turning back to face the students as the applause died away i would like to introduce the new defense against the darks arts teacher but i can t unfortunately professor whitman will not be arriving until tomorrow morning nonetheless i think he deserves a round of applause as well dumbledore then began clapping energetically it took everyone including the staff a moment to join in but after a sufficient round of unnecessary applause dumbledore continued also i regret to inform you that all hogsmeade visits for this term have been cancelled violent attacks have only increased over the holiday and the faculty and i think it best to keep everyone inside the walls of the castle no students will be allowed outside after four pm unless given permission by a faculty member although the quidditch season will continue and should any of the games last until after four pm the game will be allowed to continue unless otherwise noted and lastly may each of you have a restful night sleep and an overabundance of splendid dreams goodnight as soon as this last word came forth from dumbledore mouth there was an immediate scraping of benches and a crescendo of voices hermione and harry made their way down the walkway between the gryffindor table and the wall as ron and ginny made their way to the end of the table on the other side the four of them met at the end and walked out of the great hall together as soon as they entered the entrance hall hermione saw harry veer off to the left to the corner in front of a door to a broomcloset ron and ginny had noticed his detour as well so they all followed after him hermione then saw that luna was standing in the corner alone were you motioning for me luna harry asked she nodded slowly oh well harry glanced around at hermione ron and ginny luna said simply them too there is something i should like to tell you luna said her grey eyes appearing even larger than normal ron had no clue what this could be about but luna seemed to be nervously twisting her hands in front of her there were only a few stragglers left in the entrance hall seeing as the gryffindors were always the last out of the great hall yet luna was still speaking in a very low voice what is it luna ginny asked curiously well luna began her wispy voice shaking slightly i have a question she swallowed hard before continuing do you remember when i took dennis creevey to the hospital wing last term after he fell from a tree yes harry replied okay luna said wistfully before looking off to stare at the suits of armor beside the huge oak front doors do you remember when i told ronald that he should have said no to susan bones yeah ron replied slowly where in the world was this going so far her train of thought did not contain any coherent cargo for ron alright luna said now looking at ron do you remember when i asked how long harry had been dating ginny yeah ginny replied with a furrowed brow well luna began more quietly now while looking off to the marble staircase i knew that all of those things were going to happen before they happened i also know that hermione forgot her pet at the burrow although he truly did enjoy himself hermione mouth dropped open slightly how could you know that ignoring this question luna continued still keeping her eyes fixed on the marble staircase i also knew that dean thomas would kill that death eater and that her eyes suddenly became very glossy as she abruptly stopped talking all of them had been hanging on her every word utterly entranced and confused by this strange conversation and what luna hermione prompted quietly luna looked at hermione and a single tear rolled down her cheek i knew terry boot would die at the hand of lucius malfoy there were other death eaters at the boot family home but i didntsee their faces the others killed his family but mr malfoy killed terry she whispered another single tear falling from her other eye ron felt a rush of anger course through his veins so malfoy was the death eater that had killed a hogwart muggle born but wait how could luna know this she couldnthave been there could she what do you mean you saw it ginny asked quietly luna looked down at her feet then my mother died when i was nine she began ron was holding his breath as she continued i saw her dying in an explosion on she stopped and looked up at the ceiling april third of 1990 it was only in my head that i saw it but i told my mother and my father about my vision it was my first vision my parents began experimenting with anti explosive charms to place on the house after i told them it was one of these charms that my mother was experimenting with when something went rather badly wrong luna looked back down at her feet i saw her die on april twenty fifth of that same year this time it was not in my head but it was identical to my vision father then explained to me that seeing was a form of dark magic he had never told me this before but after my mother died he became very adamant in this belief he told me that should i ever have another vision to keep it hidden away from everyone and to try and forget it myself oh luna ginny breathed as her eyes began to tear up hermione looked teary eyed as well however luna eyes were no longer glossy they were simply wide and sad i never questioned my father judgment and as i grew older i continued to receive more and more visions but i never told anyone i began to believe that there was something wrong with me i didntunderstand why i had this dark magical ability luna harry began quietly i dontthink that but now luna continued as if she hadnteven heard harry and ron actually doubted that she had i am beginning to question my father judgment the vision i had of terry boot murder could have saved his life but i didnttell anyone so it is my fault that no it not luna ginny said quietly but firmly your father has taught you that nothing good can come from your visions but he wrong you were just afraid that if you revealed your vision to anyone something might go rather badly wrong hermione replied to ron surprise luna nodded at hermione although ron believed luna story he had thought that hermione would question whether or not she truly were a seer of course hermione words could have been merely spoken in comfort but from her teary eyes ron felt that she too believed everything luna had said the only people to fault are the death eaters and voldemort harry added then suddenly luna looked from harry to ron and he realized that he was the only one that hadntsaid anything reassuring swallowing rather hard ron said um yeah there nothing dark about seeing i think it a cool gift ron felt a bit like an idiot after his simple words but luna actually gave him a tiny smile luna harry began the next time you have one of these visions you can tell me you can tell any of us even if you want to keep it from your father luna nodded at him so ginny began can you see these visions whenever you want ron heart began beating a bit faster of course if luna could conjure a vision of what voldemort or malfoy were planning hermione and harry safety could be ensured no luna answered softly and ron hopeful feeling died instantly i never know when i might have another vision i could have one in a few minutes or the next one could not be for a few months they were all quiet for a moment no one really knew what to say but then luna looked at harry and smiled well i am rather glad that i decided to tell all of you i do feel a bit better thank you although i think it is time to go to my common room it quite late goodnight luna ginny said sweetly harry ron and hermione followed her lead with their own goodnights and with one last smile at them all she turned toward the stairs they followed behind her up the marble staircase until she veered off for the west tower then they walked the rest of the way to the gryffindor common room no one spoke ron wasntexactly sure why no one else was speaking but he knew why he was silent his brain was still trying to take everything in he felt immense sadness for everything luna had been through since she was nine she believed herself to be receiving visions through dark magic and she must blame herself for her mother death ron also felt sick at the idea of malfoy father killing a sixteen year old boot was draco age did the man have no conscience ron now felt even more confident of the fact that lucius had been one of the death eaters to attack the granger s a very unwelcome vision flashed into ron mind hermione cornered by three death eaters he truly hoped that hermione kept the promise that she had made to him on the train i will try my hardest there were a few people still scattered about the common room so harry and ginny hardly looked at one another before ascending the stairs to their respective dormitories ron hung back a bit from harry because he noticed hermione doing the same by the girls staircase she hurried over to him after harry had disappeared from view ron she began whispering urgently tomorrow morning i ll come to the boys dormitory after seamus dean and neville leave for breakfast and we can tell harry then before classes ron smiled down at her a bit eager arentyou arentyou she asked with apprehension he almost laughed at her of course i am he said she gave him a small smile tomorrow morning i ll call you call me hermione said sounding utterly confused yes the mirrors he stated plainly had she already forgotten she covered her mouth to hold back a giggle oh call me she said with a smile you re too adorable ron was a bit confused but he enjoyed the compliment thanks so are you they smiled at each other before she gave him a half wave half hair twiddle she then turned quickly and left for her staircase he was tempted to watch her leave but he decided to ascend the stairs before they looked too suspicious to seamus or dean who were sitting in the corner playing exploding snap once ron entered the dormitory he saw that neville was already in bed asleep his rapidly growing mimbulus mimbletonia was sitting on his bedside cabinet which was now at least three feet tall harry was sitting on his bed examining the sheathed dagger that he had found behind mrs black portrait ron remembered what he had told hermione he would say to harry about that mysterious item he really dreaded it he already knew what harry would say it just a dagger i thought you said it was cool you sound like hermione as ron began changing into his pajamas he continued to ponder over whether or not to bring up the dagger warning however before he could come to a decision harry asked him something that made him jerk and bump his knee on one of his bed four posters is there something going on between you and hermione harry asked casually keeping his eyes on the dagger this was when ron jumped and kneed his bed ow he hissed grabbing his knee and looking over to see if he d woken neville he hadn t harry had looked up at him though and he was actually smiling slightly should i take that as a yes he asked ron sat down on the edge of his bed and simply stared at harry for a moment he honestly had no idea what to do hermione wanted to be with him when harry found out right so should he lie or would hermione be relieved tomorrow if ron told her that harry found out on his own harry kind of shrugged at ron silence and placed his dagger in his bedside cabinet ron cleared his throat and whispered what do you mean by something harry shrugged again you know something something ron was again silent and harry continued i ve just been noticing lately i dontknow you two dontrow near as often well ron began deciding that he should wait until tomorrow morning when hermione was with him hermione been through a lot this holiday i guess i sort of thought that i should take it easy on her you know you gave her half of your crescent roll harry stated plainly what ron asked perplexed half of my what harry chuckled slightly you love crescent rolls it was the last one at our end of the table and you gave her half ron couldntcontain a smile i i didntnotice that i she fixed your collar on the train harry continued he was now leaning back against his headboard with a smug smile on his face well you know ron began feeling his cheeks growing warmer by the second hermione a perfectionist when it comes to ginny always straightening my shirts for me your mum does it for your dad too he replied casually ron was now just staring at harry with his mouth hanging open slightly he was at a complete loss for words he was sure that there was something really cunning that he should say at the moment that would prove to harry that his suspicions were unfounded but he was too much of a prat to know what that cunning something was i i i ron began he was sure that he looked like a fish out of water the way his mouth was moving are you attracted to her harry asked with another smug grin harry mate what kind of question ron began with slight exasperation hey it okay harry said with a wave of his hand if you dontthink she attractive she gorgeous ron exclaimed impatiently before clearing his throat and dropping his gaze to his knees ha harry cried suddenly standing up from his bed and pointing at ron ron glanced over at neville again who was somehow still asleep harry could you be a little less noisy i mean ha harry cried again his mouth wide with a toothy smile he was still pointing his finger at him as if ron were a celebrity that harry had just recognized but was too stunned over to say anything more than ha suddenly however harry seemed to overcome his shock you see i sometimes wondered but then i would think no harry began in an eager whisper i mean the way you and hermione are always rowing with one another it always sort of well sort of reminded me of your parents oh and you re cursing less too you think malfoy needs a kick to his abdomen yeah right and then there was the way krum went from being your idol to your enemy in no time at all plus the way you acted at the yule ball you know i mean dancing not really my bag either but then you and hermione at the christmas bash well ha harry was now back to pointing at him ron swallowed hard and took a deep breath so um you sound kind of happy about the idea of me and hermione i mean i not saying that i agreeing to what you re saying but i oh come off it harry whispered excitedly what are you denying it for well ron began nervously i not really denying ron suddenly sighed heavily ah hell we were going to tell you tomorrow morning harry together tell me harry asked with wide eyes tell me what exactly well that we d like to start dating you know ron began harry said ha again but ron ignored him and continued but we wanted to make sure that it was alright with you and everything harry made a series of sounds in quick succession that came out sounding like pachufka he then continued in english alright with me he asked incredulously alright with me he shook his head and said pachufka again do you realize what this means harry began animatedly ron shook his head his heart beating rapidly he thought harry seemed to be happy but happy could sometimes be confused with mental couldntit harry continued i ve always wondered what would happen to the three of us when we all graduate you know like you and i plan to be aurors for the ministry but what about hermione she could go off to switzerland or france but if you two are together well i wonthave to worry now will i ron found himself smiling broadly all of a sudden which harry returned with a bright smile of his own ron felt a huge weight lift from his shoulders and for some reason he began to laugh harry then began to laugh as well why ron didntrightly know nor did seamus or dean know when they entered a couple of minutes later they entered to see harry and ron on their beds holding their stomachs as they stifled their laughter the best they could it resulted in strange wheezing noises they calmed down shortly after seamus and dean entered and they each got into their beds when their dorm mates asked them what was so funny ron just told a random joke that he had heard from fred and george at one time this worked well seamus and dean both laughed heartily at this which gave harry and ron another excuse to laugh some more although ron wasntlaughing at his brothers joke and he was pretty sure harry wasnteither no they were laughing for some unknown reason ron thought it had something to do with joy and stress relief maybe it also had something to do with the irony of ron dating their mutual female best friend whom ron had rowed more with than a dog and cat whatever the reason for their laughing fit ron now knew something he knew that tomorrow when he called hermione to their room with the mirror she wouldntmind too terribly bad that ron hadntbeen able to conceal the truth for one more night she wouldntbe too terribly upset that harry knew because harry did not care he actually seemed thrilled it didnttake ron long to drift off to sleep that night and the last thing he remembered thinking before a peaceful slumber found him was the next time someone asks me if hermione and i are dating i will reply with a simple yet powerful yes author note yay harry finally knows i wonder what hermione will think about harry reaction and what their first day of school going to have in store for them it should be interesting thank you reviewers thank you readers stay tuned i hope to post again tomorrow night but it will most likelybe very late or early depending how you look at it well the big chapter 3 0 is on its way in regards to the question over when i wrote this story i am actually writing it as i go but i came up with the whole story idea and summary in june while i impatiently awaited hbp i decided to start writing it out when my brother told me about which i had never heard of before all of the plot ideas thus far have been mine except for the tonks lupin relationship i never saw that coming in hbp but some of the reviewers requested it so i included the idea of a romantic involvement between the two j the characters and situations of harry potter depicted in this story are the legal property of j k

after potions hermione told harry and ron that she would meet them in charms she then went straight to the girl lavatory luckily there were no other students using this bathroom because as soon as hermione entered she burst into tears wiping them away angrily she went to look in one of the mirrors oh what was the matter with her she had already shed a few tears in class and that should have been enough it would have been enough if ron hadnttaken her hand in his it had been one of the best feelings in the world her whole body had felt charged with electricity his hand had been callused and warm it had been wonderful she had immediately forgotten all about malfoy harsh words which was she told herself exactly what ron had meant to accomplish console his friend which was exactly why she was in the loo blubbering like moaning murtle why was it so hard to just be friends with ron weasley if she didntget a hold on reality soon she would go mad it was just that every now and then ron would do something to surprise her something like handholding something that made her wonder what if he feels the same way i do but that was ridiculous he d hold ginny hand if she were upset he was a compassionate person it was nothing more than a friendly gesture of comfort hermione was glad that the rest of their classes that day were uneventful in comparison to potions she didntknow how much stress she could take at one time and it was piling on quick professor flitwick taught them a simple vanishing charm abeorior it was similar to the summoning charm except the items would disappear as they traveled also the vanishing item could be made to reappear at any spot visible to the spell caster but unlike the summoning charm the item must be insight to use the spell pillows were disappearing and reappearing all over the classroom one of them actually reappeared on professor flitwick desk spilling a full bottle of ink and hermione noticed parvati patil had gone remarkably red when it had happened transfiguration went by as normal as it ever had professor mcgonagall had asked that they spend the class period practicing basic transfiguring each student was supposed to transform three small stones into three small teacups hermione managed to turn all of her stones into perfectly formed teacups within the first ten minutes of class ron had had a bit more difficulty by the end of the period two of his rocks had transformed into teabags while one could actually pass for a fair tea mug hermione had scolded him for his lack of concentration and had immediately felt guilty he had rolled his eyes and ignored her the rest of class by talking with harry whose teacups didntlook all that great either she didntmean to be so bossy but transfiguring was really so simple plus ron had managed to get e on his o w l in transfiguration that proved to her that he just wasntconcentrating how could she ever even dream that ron might like her as more than a friend a romantic relationship with a nag is probably the last thing ron wanted or needed yet this thought only made hermione in the mood to nag more okay so tomorrow we have healing with sinistra first thing in the morning followed by our n e w t classes right ron asked on their way up to the common room after classes that right hermione said briskly and what were your n e w t classes for administration again harry asked curiously i had a few classes to choose from but i chose to continue studying ancient runes and arithmancy hermione replied she looked at harry and ron enviously of course i would love to take that history of the dark arts class with you harry and ron that magical law class wow and you also get to take geography of the magical world those should be fascinating i almost wish i had mcgonagall time turner again no harry and ron exclaimed in unison hermione stopped in her tracks with surprise they were both looking at her with horrified stares i was only saying that i think your classes would be interesting i not actually thinking of using that thing again do you think i mad hermione said defensively as they resumed their walking yes ron said with an adorable smile on his face hermione rolled her eyes at him he was even charming when he was insulting her so what about defense against the dark arts then i thought dumbledore always introduced new teachers after the sorting hat ceremony ron asked as they finally reached the portrait hole door weeping daisy hermione said to the fat lady the portrait door swung open and the three of them climbed in ron you really should learn to listen when people make announcements hermione said haughtily ron frowned at her after that bloody song i bet harry didnthear either did ya harry actually yeah it was a professor white no professor whitehall harry replied proudly hermione rolled her eyes again professor edgar whitman he graduated from the kilmore school of magic in australia he still in auror training so defense against the dark arts classes wontstart until after christmas holiday he will have graduated by then hermione spat impatiently she really doubted either of her two friends would ever learn to listen no defense against the dark arts until after christmas but they cantdo that we ve already wasted a whole year with that umbridge hag ron exclaimed angrily oh honestly ronald dumbledore also announced that all teachers would set one class period aside every two weeks to teach defense against the dark arts to their classes hermione replied scornfully ron simply turned to give harry a questioning look yeah i heard that bit at least it should do alright until after christmas i suppose harry said twisting his mouth he didntlook satisfied and neither was hermione she felt that they needed all the defense training that they could get she d almost died last term and although almost doesntcount this dream of harry gave hermione an incentive to be as prepared as possible for anything that night ron had trouble getting to sleep again after fifteen minutes of tossing and turning harry actually asked if he were all right when harry hadntheard ron loud snoring he must have thought something was up there was nothing wrong with him though well other than the fact that his two best friends lives may be on the line but that actually wasntit what else could i be worried about it was this question that he continued to ask himself until he fell into a restless sleep everything was black but he could hear something in the distance was it a voice he began to run toward the sound but it only seemed to get softer where was he he couldntsee a thing he stopped then he heard it louder than ever someone was shouting his name ron ron he knew that voice she sounded like she was in trouble he had to reach her but he couldnteven see his own hand in front of his face ron hermione ron whispered into the quiet dormitory as he awoke with a start he was breathing heavily and he had apparently kicked all of the covers off of his bed looking around the room he saw that nothing appeared to be out of the ordinary harry seamus dean and neville were all sleeping peacefully getting out of his four poster bed and grabbing his wand off of his nightstand ron quietly patted his bare feet down the cold stone stairs and into the common room everything was black but he could hear something by the hearth it was the sound of someone crying lumos ron whispered urgently and a beam of white light shot out of his wand tip holding it above his head he saw the tear stained face of hermione looking up at him from the sofa in front of the fireplace ron hermione said quickly wiping the tears from her face with the backs of her hands what what are you what happened ron interrupted her urgently as he made his way to the couch and kneeled in front of a puzzled looking hermione he laid his still lit wand on the coffee table nothing happened it just i was what are you doing out of bed hermione eyes drifted quickly and timidly over ron before she looked down at her knees it was then that ron realized that in his haste he had neglected to put on a shirt he was simply wearing some flannel pajama pants his arms instantly crossed over his barren and freckled chest as he stood up he would have probably been unbearably embarrassed if he werentastonished at the fact that he had known somehow that hermione was in distress his dream had forewarned him oh no he thought i better not be turning into harry with harry most recent dream on ron mind he quickly decided on not telling hermione about his own dream i just couldntsleep but i dontbelieve that nothing happened to you why are you down here in the middle of the night crying i dontwant to talk about it hermione muttered unconvincingly still looking at her knees he hated when she said that nothing good ever came from a conversation with hermione that started with i dontwant to talk about it hermione dontbe i dontwant to talk about it ronald hermione said defiantly before standing up to pace the floor in front of the sofa wow she d said it twice she would never tell him what was wrong when she was in this state or would she ron had a sudden idea i know what it is ron said with mock irritation hermione stopped pacing immediately to peer up at him with suspicion you you do not ron hermione said with one eyebrow raised oh yes i do you re angry with me what hermione said stunned what are you talking about you re mad that i did such a poor job today in transfiguration class you ve convinced yourself that i wasnteven trying well i was doing the best that i could ron was trying to sound convincing and it was actually quite simple this sounded just like the beginnings of one of the rows they might have had last term or the one before that or the one before that ron that is the most ridiculous thing i ve ever well i dontbelieve you i know you think i just a lousy sloth hermione i going back to bed ron spun around and started slowly to the boy dormitory stairwell wait hermione called stopping him in his tracks he smiled inwardly at his stroke of genius it s it malfoy ron wheeled around on his heel so fast he almost fell over backward he marched over to hermione and stood a mere foot from her face what what do you mean what has he done where is he did you leave the common room tonight what ron hermione said putting a soft hand to his chest to stop his barrage of questions she was apparently reminded that he was bare chested as she pulled her hand away as if being burned she quickly regained her composure although ron skin seemed to be blazing where her hand had been ron i ve been thinking about what malfoy said right before potions class today i know i should ignore him but what he said and then remembering harry dream it might i mean he had a point you know ron felt as if his heart were breaking he couldntstand to see hermione in shreds over something draco malfoy had said this is exactly what malfoy had been trying to do scare her and he had been wrong to think that she had stopped worrying about harry dream of the kidnapping apparently neither of them had forgotten it hermione ron began softly ron listen i am muggle born and i am close to harry potter now whether harry dream was real or not there two solid reasons why i a prime target for any death eater of vol hermione ron shouted a little louder than he had intended she closed her mouth abruptly he couldntbear to hear her utter the fear that had given him many sleepless nights over the summer taking a steadying breath he continued hermione i have three reasons why you dont have anything to worry about one you are at hogwarts possibly the safest place in the world two the headmaster is albus dumbledore the strongest wizard in the world and three ron raked a nervous hand through his hair i not going to let anything happen to you all right they were still standing a foot apart but now they were simply staring at one another ron thought hermione looked as though she were about to say something but when she opened her mouth a distressed sigh was the only sound to exit more tears began falling down her face he didntknow if he d ever seen hermione like this so scared and damn it vulnerable ron uncertain of what to do closed the foot of space between them and wrapped his arms around hermione who then rested her face and hands on his chest to sob her wet face was pressed hard against him they d never hugged like this before there had been countless times in the past when he d wanted to embrace her in this way and it was even better than he d expected his whole body was warm and he knew she must be able to feel and hear his rapidly beating heart was this a friendly embrace of condolence ron was sure it was to hermione but what was it to him why did he feel as though he would be losing something when this hug ended and why did his knees suddenly feel like they were made of gelatin hermione fresh tears had stopped leaving her face feeling warm and sticky she was greedily leaning on ron chest once she let go there was no guarantee that she would ever find herself wrapped warmly in his arms again this was the first time she d ever seen ron without his shirt on and quite possibly the last unless she staged another sob fest hermione she berated herself for even letting it cross her mind ron had absolutely no idea that while he was giving his friend a comforting hug she was concentrating on the curves of his lean torso and how warm it was against her face the feel of his arms squeezed tightly about her back he had no idea that she was taking deep breaths trying to memorize his scent he smelled of simple soap and an earthy yet sweet smell that hermione guessed was just ron wrapped warmly in his arms there was something different about this hug they d never hugged quite like this before right before he had embraced her hermione had seen something in ron eyes it was a mixture of emotions concern sympathy but something else it was one of those looks he gave her from time to time that made this crush she had even harder to endure it had surely been an hour since ron first entered the common room she couldntkeep him down here all night they both needed their sleep slowly and with much regret hermione pushed herself back from her tower of comfort ron hands fell slowly to his sides he was looking down at her now with furrowed brows and a slight frown before she could talk herself out of it hermione rose up on her toes placed her hands lightly on ron shoulders and brushed her lips over his cheek his face had a light covering of stubble that tickled her mouth thank you she whispered beside his cheek before she quickly turned and ascended the stairs to her dormitory without a backward glance author note i wanted to thank everyone that has sent in a review this being my first fan fiction i was very pleased to see that everyone liked my story so far i was actually going to go to bed and post this tomorrow afternoon but after reading the reviews i just had to give ya ll more to read the characters and situations of harry potter depicted in this story are the legal property of j k rowling bloomsbury and aol time warner and have been used without permission no copyright violation is intended no profit is being made off this site it is for entertainment purposes only author note i very sorry for the delay i have a very good reason though this chapter required quite a lot of research on my part i always research the characters and such to make sure that i get everything right but when creating a completely new character whew i had to research the culture of australia i have included a glossary of terms at the bottom of this chapter but i recommend reading the chapter first and experiencing the confusion of slang along with ron and the gang you ll see what i mean btw if there are any aussies reading this please be gentle i very sorry if i have incorrectly used the language in any way and i am not meaning to stereotype or offend anyone i think aussies are awesome that why i tried to create one lol anyway enjoy chapter 30 hermione woke early monday morning too early but she couldntgo back to sleep her eyes had just flown open and as soon as they had the thought we re going to tell harry sprang into her mind before she could even think something along the lines of i hungry or i need to go to the loo she was thinking about the confrontation with harry and now as she laid in bed she seemed to be having trouble even blinking there was no way she would be able to go back to sleep lavender and parvati were still snoozing and it was far too early to expect a call from ron through the mirror well hermione thought sounds like shower time so hermione left for the shower room and once there she decided to linger the hot water seemed to relax her a bit maybe waking up early was a good thing this way she had plenty of time to prepare herself for the revealing of the truth to harry plenty of time actually time seemed to be going by rather quickly this morning by the time hermione exited the shower room dressed and dried her hair there was less than an hour remaining before she expected her call why was time passing so quickly she wasntready was she and what did she even think she could do to prepare herself this wasntsomething you could study for hermione decided to read over her assignments from last term to occupy her brain she could use some memory jogging anyway when hermione entered the dormitory lavender and parvati had just awoken to begin scurrying about the room as usual rummaging through each other make up and hair accessories trying to be as pretty as possible for the day it was tiring to watch but hermione wasntsupposed to be watching she was supposed to be reviewing it was impossible the words seemed to blur together and overlap the three fate groups of arithmancy are the heart number the personality number and the life number are the heart number the personality number wait she d already read that the heart number involves the vowels of one name as divided by divided by the heart number involves the vowels hermione sighed heavily as the words continued to blur and the conversation going on in the dormitory became much clearer so he really is an aussie lavender asked excitedly as she applied some sort of gel to her hair yes lavvy parvati exclaimed and he twenty one and available hermione eyes involuntarily rolled into the back of her skull and she had to shake her head slightly to right them were they really only excited about the new teacher because he was young and single pathetic just stare at your paper the words will un blur she told herself they didn t he ll like you more lavender said with a playful scowl at her friend you re so exotic black hair black eyes parvati shrugged green eyes are exotic really lavender asked in a high pitched hopeful voice parvati nodded sweetly at her friend they then fortunately finished their morning preparations in near silence as soon as they had left the dormitory hermione literally jumped off of her bed and slid over to her satchel which was sitting atop her trunk she quickly removed the small square mirror when ron had tested the mirrors over the holiday a dim blue light had appeared in the glass yet her reflection was the only thing in the glass at the moment hermione sighed and sat down on the edge of her bed assuming harry accepted the news of she and ron dating she would have a boyfriend in less than an hour less than an hour she d obviously never had a boyfriend whenever she wanted to embrace ron or kiss his soft lips she could but once they werenthiding anything anymore hermione wondered if she would even want to exhibit public displays of affection with ron especially in front of harry the thought seemed absolutely bizarre then there was always the chance harry would hate the idea and then holy cricket life would be so awkward for the three of them and what kind of girlfriend would she be lavender and parvati were always talking about boys seamus has lovely eyes dean is so tall and handsome roger davies is positively dreamy they never spoke of harry or ron whenever hermione was around but she was sure that they had discussed her friends appearances at one time or another would fellow female students expect her to talk about ron in that way ron has beautiful blue eyes that speak to my soul his red hair sets my heart to flame his body no there was no way she could talk about him in that way with anybody hermione suddenly heard a soft buzzing sound looking down she saw her reflection becoming blurry in a pool of blue light oh no she wasntready the blur was fading hermione ron asked his freckled face was staring back at her with a furrowed brow she smiled down at him hi she said quietly he smiled broadly at her ready yes hermione replied as she nodded and then with a sigh she said i ll be right there ron nodded at her still smiling broadly hermione stood from her bed and placed the mirror back inside her satchel with her schoolbooks well here goes nothing hermione thought ron definitely looked ready he looked completely calm and collected so why was the blood in her legs gradually turning to metal as she descended the stairs hermione began taking deep breaths everything would be fine harry would be accepting ron would obviously be a great boyfriend and she she would do her best there seemed to be more steps than usual leading to the sixth year boys dormitory but hermione finally made it to the door taking one last deep breath hermione pushed the door open ha hermione jumped slightly as she came face to face with harry who was for some unknown reason pointing at her and smiling broadly ginny and ron were in the room as well but they were sitting on ron bed ron was very scarlet and wore an apologetic grin while ginny was bouncing up and down slightly on the edge of the bed um hermione began looking from one to the other harry what hermione ron began uh you know how harry is really good at solving mysteries and whatnot hermione just stared at him what was he talking about hermione addled brain still hadntrecovered from harry s ha hermione harry began approaching her and putting an arm around her shoulders his other hand was behind his back there something that i ve been saving for you i didntknow if i would ever get the chance to give it to you but well happy start of term harry then pulled his hand out from behind him and placed something in hermione palm hermione was just staring at harry with utter confusion happy start of term she looked down slowly and opened her hand to see well what did she see harry what is this she asked turning the small piece of plastic over in her hand suddenly harry and ginny started laughing although ron face just turned an even deeper crimson looking back down at the object in her hand she asked is this an arm harry laughed a bit louder before saying our fourth year i found that on the floor in here and i ve kept it all this time you know on the belief that my suspicions might prove true one day do you know what it is hermione simply shook her head she was actually growing a bit impatient with this game they werentgoing to have time to tell harry anything if he didntfinish up this silly game involving small plastic arms ginny answered suddenly that happens to be a small piece of a dismembered vicky krum ron had a doll of action figure ron interjected before looking back down at his hands to pick at his thumbnail oh pardon me ginny said airily ron had an action figure of krum but after old vicky began fancying you hermione that bit of plastic was found on the floor by harry odd coincidence isntit a smile slowly spread over hermione face as she looked from harry to ginny to ron she suddenly had a mental image of ron tearing up his action figure and throwing it across the room it was quite humorous hermione ron began looking up at her with that apologetic smile again harry sort of figured out our secret after you left for your dormitory last night hermione heart promptly jumped into her throat to beat a few times before rolling over and dropping back down into her chest she felt her face go extremely warm as she looked up at harry who definitely looked accepting he actually looked very happy without a bit of warning tears began stinging her eyes and when she blinked hard to hold them back they only fell stubbornly down her cheeks dontcry hermione harry said with a hint of a laugh behind his voice so you fancy ron everyone has something to be ashamed of a strangled giggle burst forth as she flung her arms around harry neck he hugged her back tightly and whispered in her ear i think it brilliant hermione she might have held on all day but harry pried her fingers from his neck and then with both of her hands in his he dragged her over to ron where he released her hands ron was smiling up at her kindly go ahead mate harry said slapping ron on the back when they spring a leak like that you ve got to you know ron chuckled at his friend before standing up to quickly wrap his arms around her hermione breathed in his wonderful clean yet earthy scent she hadntbeen able to do this in the last couple of days ron kissed her lightly on the top of her head but when hermione opened her eyes to see what harry response would be she saw that he and ginny were already in their own embrace she looked up at ron then and smiled broadly well that definitely not an angry look is it he said with a bright smile his arms still around her why should i be angry she asked disbelievingly angry she was thrilled with the turnout of this morning confrontation with harry he shrugged and said we didntget to tell him together it doesntmatter he knows and he s happy i donthave a care in the world right now she whispered truthfully ron let out a deep sigh before cupping her face and leaning down to kiss her gently on each eyelid it almost made her want to cry again almost but instead she laid her head upon his chest and embraced him he was so warm his chest so soft yet hard his scent so ahem hermione was rudely brought back to reality and she quickly pulled away from her boyfriend to look toward the source of the disturbance harry and ginny were both standing at the doorway with smug grins harry was actually shaking his head slightly with a look that said this is too weird hermione didntmind the look though she felt the same way and it wasnta bad feeling just exciting stepping into the unknown armed with her two favorite men and her sort of sister a huge weight lifted from hermione heart only to be replaced with wings oh look here come the owls ron was staring at hermione with a stupid smile on his face as she pointed up at the ceiling of the great hall the owls were descending among the students but he wasntpaying much attention to that he was allowed to stare at hermione now it was wonderful what was also wonderful was the minimum amount of space in between them on the bench he was holding one of her precious hands in his and resting it on his knee under the table they had even walked into the great hall holding hands he had noticed a few people turn their heads as they had made their way to the gryffindor table by the end of the day everyone at hogwarts would have surely heard about the newest couple in the school some bloke had finally managed to steal hermione granger heart and it was he harry was on the opposite side of the table with his and ginny satchels on the bench separating them ron felt bad for his best mate he knew too well what harry must have been feeling right then extreme restlessness caused by a strong desire to reach out and touch the woman you love however ron happiness at being hermione boyfriend was overshadowing all other emotions plus harry didntlook too displeased with the distance between him and ginny at the moment though he did keep looking at ron every ten or so minutes and shaking his head in slight disbelief hmm look at this hermione said suddenly she had already retrieved her paper and laid it out on the table between the four of them she then began reading aloud minister bones surprising approach to better informing the community the new minister of magic amelia bones has decided to place a weekly article in the daily prophet to inform the wizarding community of the ministry plans goals and actions this new column will be entitled between the lines prophet reporter natalie pry was able to obtain a comment from minister bones i feel that the wizarding community has not been as informed as needed we are in a war if the ministry attempts to run from this fact are we on the path to peace i think not bones replied the first article of between the lines will appear in the prophet next monday hermione leaned back from the paper with a satisfied grin ginny i think you were right about what ginny asked still peering over the upside down article madam bones will do a better job than fudge hermione said matter of factly she going to be risking the possibility of a lot of ridicule from the community by printing the ministry objectives in the post she giving everyone free reign to accept or denounce her progress as minister fudge would have never done that you know i ve never really thought about it ron began with a sudden revelation but fudge never really told us anything did he i mean he always gave vague answers like we re doing all we can or the ministry wontstop until all death eaters are behind bars yeah harry replied exactly what is all we can or the ministry wontstop what ron was suddenly reminded of the snippet of conversation he overheard mad eye and his father having yesterday morning the minister of magic who seemed to have her head on straight had basically ordered his parents to stay in hiding that was more than a bit unnerving but ron reminded himself at least they were safe behind the walls of grimmauld place the fidelius charm would keep them safe once they had finished their breakfast ron hermione and harry made the trek down the stone steps to the dungeon while ginny departed for her morning class ron had a scowl on his face as he made the descent potions he definitely hadntmissed this class he wasntsure what he dreaded most about the upcoming hour snape malfoy or the undoubtedly difficult lesson followed by an assigned essay harry was walking a bit ahead of ron and hermione as they entered the damp chilly classroom ron was holding hermione hand extra tight as they made their way to their table holding her hand was such a wonderful feeling ron felt as if it connected them in a deeper way than merely palm to palm malfoy and pansy were already seated with crabbe and goyle on either side of them they looked like two skinny rats lodged in between two ugly swine ron unfortunately made eye contact with malfoy and he noticed his grey eyes dart down to his and hermione clasped hands he then looked back up at ron with a disgusted sneer ron felt an angry pulse begin to beat in his chest he could guess what malfoy was thinking with that look of disgust removing his satchel from his shoulder ron looked away and took his seat on one side of hermione while harry sat on her other hey remember that day you held my hand under the desk hermione whispered suddenly looking up at him with an endearing smile ron had to force a smile of his own he knew hermione was simply remembering the comforting gesture but that memory held much more for ron that was the day malfoy had made that horrible comment to hermione the comment that was even more disturbing now you ll probably be dead before i get the chance to get your boyfriend alone ron grabbed her hand with his i remember their gazes locked mother says uncle rodolphus left everything to aunt bella ron stiffened as he heard malfoy drawling voice he was sure that he was purposefully speaking loudly enough for him hermione and harry to hear talking about two death eaters casually as uncle and aunt of course everyone at hogwarts knew that his own father was a death eater so what did it matter if he spoke of his other foul family members did you inherit nothing draco pansy said almost soothingly as if malfoy needed an inheritance well there was one thing that i was to inherit malfoy said conversationally but oddly enough it seems to have gone missing he stressed this last word as if it held some special meaning ron glanced over at hermione and harry harry had his jaw set but was obviously listening from the tilt of his head hermione knees were now bobbing up and down ron placed their clasped hands on her knee which stopped the bouncing abruptly she smiled weakly at him but before he could return the smile malfoy said one last thing it was a ring of my aunt bella that my uncle wore dontknow where it could ve gone to slam hermione jumped slightly but ron merely turned and made eye contact with harry as snape glided to the front of the classroom wearing his usual dark black robes an unspoken query passed between ron and his best friend did malfoy know that harry had the ring from rodolphus how could he know that as ron looked to the front of the room at snape he noticed that there was a bubbling cauldron atop snape desk and a rather unpleasant odor filling the room somehow snape presence seemed to make the smell more pungent snape placed his hands on his desk on either side of the cauldron before taking a deep breath and briefly closing his eyes did he actually enjoy that odor would anyone like to take a guess as to what potion this cauldron contains snape asked in his deep cold voice hermione free hand immediately shot into the air ron had to twist his mouth to prevent a smile snape took his time looking about the room but hermione was the only raised hand with a sneer his eyes fell on her miss granger he asked sounding annoyed hermione hand promptly dropped to her lap that is an inflammatory confusion potion also known as demon oil it is a potent concoction that once ingested will cause one enemies to fight each other instead of oneself she stated as if she were reading straight from a textbook how did she do that ron squeezed her hand slightly in an attempt to tell her good job she squeezed back gently correct because the potion requires the seed of dragon capsicum fruit it burns quite horribly when consumed thus it is rarely used among wizards and witches of today snape replied blandly can anyone tell me what is causing the sweet odor of the demon oil sweet ron thought more like revolting again hermione hand flew up from her lap this time snape merely waved an impatient hand in her direction as a motion for her to give her answer he apparently knew that no one else would have the adequate knowledge ron felt a strong surge of pride in hermione as he held her hand the sweet smell comes from the essential oil of the patchouli plant more specifically the steam distillation of the dried leaves of the plant hermione replied promptly correct again miss granger snape said with a sneer spoken like a walking and talking textbook pansy parkinson let out a shrill giggle that caused an unwelcome shiver to run down ron spine hermione face fell slightly and ron squeezed her hand a bit tighter as he also heard some chuckles from malfoy crabbe and goyle that caused his mouth to disobey his rationality and you would know since you re a walking and talking set of bollocks right ron replied coolly looking straight at snape as soon as the words came out of his mouth he felt immensely better and worse at the same time hermione and harry both turned to stare at him with wide eyes in fact the whole classdid weasley you insolent little snape snarled in a low hiss coming around to stand directly in front of ron seat hermione now had a deathgrip on his hand ron just glared atsnape as hespat i afraid you may be becoming as arrogant as your famous friend detention with me wednesday after the evening meal snape then straightened up to his full height with a horribly ugly glower before whipping around and stalking back to his desk since when are teachers allowed to stick students in detention for stating the obvious professor harry replied calmly hermione groaned released ron hand and placed her head in her hands snape pale face somehow lost more color as he glared at harry with the purest loathing potter couldntstand having the spotlight on someone else could you snape hissed well you can join weasley in detention this wednesday and fifty points each from gryffindor harry merely shrugged before leaning down to retrieve his textbook from his satchel snape eyes went wide for a moment before he turned harshly toward the blackboard to display the ingredients of the potion with a wave of his wand over the next hour ron had trouble concentrating on much of anything everyone had to break off into partners hermione insisted that ron continue to partner with harry since that the way it been ever since our first year so she partnered with neville harry seemed to be distracted too because every few minutes hermione would whisper something like ron harry no no no it two dashes of guinea pepper grains not three or psst what are you two doing dontadd that yet you haventdiluted your bat blood solution properly by the end of the period ron and harry demon oil did not resemble hermione deep black potion in the least actually their potion looked a lot like orange juice nonetheless they bottled a sample of it and handed it in ron ignored the mocking smile snape gave them when he saw their potion hermione didnthold ron hand on the way to charms she was much too busy talking with her hands in exaggerated movements as she reprimanded him for getting a detention on the first day in their first class for the use of vulgar language but after each longwinded scolding she would grab hold of his arm and say something like now i know you were only standing up for me and i really do appreciate it ronald but and then the reprimand would start again ron just continued to nod at her every few seconds while harry seemed a bit distracted and possibly worried he doubted harry was that upset over getting a detention was he still thinking about malfoy comment on the ring in charms flitwick reviewed the spells that they had learned last term he then walked about the room checking on everyone individually as they practiced this gave ron a good opportunity to talk freely to harry and hermione harry ron began tentatively what bothering you mate you seem distracted hermione said looking at harry worriedly ron nodded in agreement harry made a face that resembled the look of someone who had just taken a whiff of dragon dung i dontknow he began darkly something just sort of hit me today in potions i ve never really thought of it before what is it hermione prompted as she absently moved her wand about causing a pillow to disappear and reappear on the desk harry sighed snape absolutely hates me he stated evenly ron was a bit taken off guard okay maybe this doesnthave to do with malfoy he thought uh mate ron began slowly you ve never thought of that before it seems sort of obvious to me i mean no i wasntfinished harry replied impatiently do you two remember what snape said last term when i followed him and sinistra to dumbledore office the day of the hogsmeade attack ron and hermione both nodded harry continued well i ve just been wondering what if snape only wants to keep me alive and well so that i can kill off voldemort for him hermione furrowed her brow and her waving hand ceased in mid air but harry what do you mean kill voldemort for him she asked quietly if he truly is a reformed death eater then he ll never be able to rest easy until voldemort snuffs it harry said evenly if voldemort ever found out that snape were a spy for dumbledore he would kill him after torturing him plus i sure snape doesntespecially enjoy living the life of a spy so you mean ron began if snape truly believes that you are the one destined to kill you know who then he needs you in order to well to go free i guess yeah harry stated glumly i dontknow harry hermione began questioningly dumbledore seems to think that dumbledore has made mistakes in the past hermione harry said harshly it made ron cringe although he agreed with harry ron had never been convinced of snape trustworthiness despite dumbledore claims hermione simply turned from harry and began vanishing her pillow again well even if snape does just want to keep you around so that you can get rid of his old master the important thing is he wants you alive right ron asked harry merely shrugged and started performing some sort of summoning charm with a small sigh ron turned in his seat to think of some charm to perform he would ve liked to ask harry what he thought about malfoy comment but harry seemed to be through with conversation for the time being so ron merely turned in his seat to join his friends in practice mcgonagall wasted no time with review as flitwick had hermione was pleased when mcgonagall immediately introduced a difficult new spell which would transfigure objects into keys apparently with this spell you could hold the object up to any keyhole and state the incantation patefacius at which time the object would then become an appropriately shaped key for the lock although this spell could sometimes work on locks unaffected by attempts at alohomora there were still enchantments and charms that could be placed on locks to disable the transfigured keys from working properly the class was instructed to practice throughout the entire hour by turning spoons into keys for small locked jewelry boxes hermione was able to correctly perform the spell after two attempts but ron was having a bit of trouble after many tries he had only managed to turn his jewelry box into a large wooden key the spoon remained a spoon he looked adorable as he wrinkled his brow in concentration but hermione knew that he truly wasntconcentrating properly she was sure that he was thinking about something else as he repeated the incantation over and over ron just simply did not seem to care for or see a need in transfiguration hermione on the other hand thought the subject matter to be very potentially helpful for instance last year at the department of mysteries there had been locked doors harry had fortunately had that knife from sirius but if he hadn t patefacius might have come in handy but even though hermione appreciated the class and had managed to correctly perform the spell her heart really wasntin it either she was thinking of other things malfoy comment in potions class for instance hermione had a fairly good idea as to how he might know that the ring was in harry possession lucius malfoy was probably at the attack in which rodolphus was killed he probably saw mundungus take the ring before he fled after which mr malfoy probably came up with the mere idea that the ring might end up in harry possession his son was probably just mouthing off at the slight chance of upsetting harry then there was harry theory on snape hermione just couldntshake the feeling that dumbledore was correct in his assessment of their potions master dumbledore trusted snape of course snape was a nasty foul buffoon but that didntmean he was evil it just meant that he sometimes did awfully unfair things like calling her a walking and talking textbook and then giving ron detention for standing up for her suddenly an awful sound interrupted hermione disjointed thoughts it was a series of horribly conflicting notes hermione looked to her side and saw that harry jewelry box had been transformed into a music box most likely the work of a mispronounced incantation mcgonagall quickly crossed the room to stand before harry where she uttered a counterspell the room instantly returned to silence ron still unsuccessful in making a key sat his spoon down and addressed mcgonagall professor he asked timidly yes mr weasley mcgonagall asked crisply she still looked a bit frazzled from harry unexpected music ron cleared his throat before speaking i was wondering if you might give the gryffindor team permission to practice after four pm on the pitch three nights each week hermione closed her eyes and sighed softly did ron not know professor mcgonagall classroom during her class period was not the time or place for questions concerning quidditch mr weasley do you think that you and mr potter might transfigure proper keys if you were less concerned with quidditch and more concerned with the task i ve set for you this hour she snapped ron turned a bright shade of red yes professor he stated glumly hermione shook her head at him slightly but then mcgonagall turned to her and miss granger she began in the same tone causing hermione heart to quicken in apprehension although you have managed to correctly perform the patefacius spell i dontrecall giving you permission to take the rest of the hour off hermione mouth fell open slightly but she was struck completely dumb ron and harry eyes had both gone round mcgonagall had never reprimanded her over her performance in class but hermione realized that she had merely been monitoring ron and harry progress and had been consumed in her own thoughts without continuing to practice the spell mcgonagall had surely noticed hermione simply sitting there staring into space nevertheless the displeased note in mcgonagall voice was much more unharmonious to hermione ears than the noise from harry music box as mcgonagall resumed her walking about the room hermione picked up another spoon and began the incantation again however she was having a bit of trouble concentrating due to a disturbance occurring on either side of her so when our next match harry murmured to ron under his breath mid february ron replied between a couple of fake coughs hufflepuff harry sneezed ble yes you ron murmured in response sighing heavily hermione sat her spoon down hard on the tabletop do you two mind she whispered impatiently harry rolled his eyes at her and picked up a spoon ron however elbowed her softly in the side and mouthed sorry before looking back down at his own spoon which was still not a key but was now slightly bent and discolored from his many failed attempts at the spell hermione suddenly felt a bit guilty for snapping at him she didntfeel too badly for snapping at harry because he had simply rolled his eyes at her but ron actually looked ashamed and despondent making sure that mcgonagall was not watching hermione said a quick incantation over her spoon which began molding into swirled silver letters she then placed the spoon on ron thigh he glanced up from his own spoon to raise one eyebrow at her before picking up her token which now formed the phrase key to my heart hermione knew it was incredibly cheesy and childish but it did the job ron looked up at her slowly with a poorly concealed grin a smile was all she had wanted and if she could get one from a tacky clich so be it ron then gave her one of his winks which immediately made hermione forget mcgonagall reprimand and as always caused her heart to flutter finally harry said as the three of them took their seats at the front of the defense against the dark arts classroom yes ron thought finally they were finally just minutes away from meeting their new teacher who would hopefully have something in knowledge or skill to offer them lupin had been the only defense against the dark arts teacher of which ron and harry had actually approved death eaters disguised as good teachers by means of polyjuice potions didntcount of course hermione had also initially approved of professor lockhart due to his charm oh fabulous hermione said with sarcasm ron turned to see that malfoy and his cronies had just entered the room this term the gryffindors would be sharing this class with none other than the slytherins it been so long since i ve practiced defensive spellwork ron said to hermione with a sly smile i might accidentally hit him with a curse during class ron hermione said warningly he smiled at her as harry chuckled but hermione actually looked quite serious as he continued to smile at her he considered asking her if she remembered her promise to him she promised to try her hardest in this class however ron didntthink that she needed reminding hermione looked very nervous not only were her knees bobbing up and down but she was twirling a strand of hair around her finger at an alarming speed he was sure that she was anticipating how well she would perform in this class ron was in the process of reaching a hand to her when the door creaked open every one of the students turned their curious eyes toward the doorway this was it ron thought this guy better be good when ron eyes fell on the figure standing in the doorway however he was almost certain that a seventh year boy had simply forgotten his schedule andentered the wrong room but wait was that a hogwart s name badge none of the teachers wore name badges but then again none of the teachers or students looked at all like edgar whitman turning to hermione as their new teacher walked no strutted to the front of the room ron leaned over and whispered low near hermione ear i thought you said he d have graduated his auror training i did she whispered back but i also said that he had gone straight to auror training after graduating from the kilmore school of magic he only five years your senior ron ron just continued to stare at hermione as she turned to face forward and sit up straight five years his senior dumbledore had hired a kid to teach them now that the second war was underway ron could not fathom being a certified auror teaching a class full of sixteen and seventeen year olds at the age of twenty one slowly turning in his seat to face the teacher ron just gaped at him he was just standing there looking around at them all and ron thought with an unexpected sick feeling he was an extremely good looking young black man ron reckoned the dark skinned man to be about six foot five inches in height that was at least three inches taller than ron his black head was almost entirely bald with a mere sprinkling of coarse brown hair he was donning a black leather jacket and a pair of dark blue denims that looked a little worse for wear of course the jeans which seemed to be sparsely spattered with paint and frayed along many of the seams somehow went sportingly over his thick black work boots his simple black t shirt had a logo of a heavy metal rock band which ron recognized as a group that bill used to listen to his mum referred to them as foul mouthed scallywags the thrashing thestrals over his t shirt yet underneath the jacket he wore a red and black checked flannel shirt that was unbuttoned down the front the flannel shirttail was visibly hanging out beneath his jacket glancing at harry ron saw that he was looking at whitman with a calculating look yet there was a semblance of a smile barely visible amidst his scrutinizing stare hermione on the other hand looked a bit frightened and was avidly biting at one of her fingernails ron heard a girlish giggle from behind them and he turned in his seat to see lavender and parvati whispering excitedly oh great ron thought clap ron quickly turned back around in his seat to see whitman smiling broadly with perfectly straight white teeth he had his hands clasped apparently the source of the noise all whispering immediately died away his smile caused his eyes to squint at the corners and ron noticed that his eyes were a very light golden brown color g day young ducks n drakes my name is edgar whitman he said with a surprisingly loud and cheerful voice and a distinct australian accent lovely arvo innit the students silence remained ron was tempted to stick one finger in his ear to make sure that there was no cotton ball or wad of gum lodged in preventing him from hearing properly he was almost certain that this guy was speaking in english yet ron hadntunderstood a word whitman raised his eyebrows with a slightly discouraged look well youse a bit sooky arentya he asked with another bright smile when no one responded he cleared his throat but his smile remained as he continued ah well i mighty chuffed to be here at hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry although some of you may think only a yobbo of an auror would take a teaching job right after training eh he said happily before his smile abruptly faded to a set jawed serious expression well it nothing to do with big bickies i ll tell you that when albus dumbledore contacted me and told me the caliber of teachers you lot have suffered through in this class it made me right ropeable i knew that youse might as well give it away if someone didntfang it and train you up a bit but i ll warn ya i gonna put you through some hard yakka like your pommy polly said in the daily prophet we are in a war it not just here either it everywhere even down under in the big smoke of melbourne whitman stern expression faded just as quickly as it had come to again be replaced with his bright smile he then chuckled softly here i am havin a yack with myself when you lot are dancin in your underdaks to have a go at some of that hard yakka eh a few people laughed politely yet timidly ron realized that he was gaping at whitman with his mouth open so he closed it quickly whitman trudged on first i ll need to explain to youse how i plan to run things he took a deep breath before continuing with that serious look i want us to study perfection of marksmanship if you find yourself up a gum tree and surrounded by those death birds you might as well squib out of the barney if you cantaim properly ron realized that he was absently nodding his head in agreement as whitman continued to speak the only problem was ron didntknow what he was agreeing to he was actually becoming a bit worried whitman was talking very animatedly with that stern expression and his hands were moving about in front of him so whatever he was saying must be important right ron didnthave time to answer himself because a shot of red light flew over his head and burst upon an empty glass jar on a shelf in the back of the room a few people gasped a couple screamed the jar had been just barely above the head of neville who was seated in the very back of the classroom neville eyes went wide and he was looking back and forth between the broken glass on the floor and the teacher who had his wand pointed to the back of the classroom you see whitman said excitedly now what if he had been a mangy maggot of voldemort s eh his eyes went wide and he looked around the room but he then smiled back toward the back of the room what your name chap there was a short pause and then an apprehensive neville longbottom longbottom eh whitman said with interest bonzer you know i missed on purpose right he added with a smile sure neville said but he didntsound too sure to ron whitman chuckled slightly oh yes back to how i going to run things whitman began with a slight frown i understand youse are learning healing there were some mumbles of agreement among the class and a look of pure relief passed over whitman face bonzer we can x out first aid and then with a smile he said between you and me mateys first aid not really my bowl of rice he paused briefly but then nearly bellowed strewth what more which caused a few people including ron and hermione to jump slightly ron glanced over at harry who was just looking at whitman with a tiny smile oh yes whitman began again he was now weaving his wand rapidly between his fingers as he spoke i reckon some of you blokes will like this not so sure of the sheilas hand to hand combat believe me if you find yourself wandless she ll be apples if you can pack a mean punch hand to hand combat ron couldntstop himself from smiling and turning around to peer at malfoy who looked a bit peaked now hand to hand combat ron could get into that for the first time in his life ron would be very tempted to request that malfoy be his partner and last but not least defensive magic of course whitman stated casually you know spells charms enchantments so any questions mates he peered around the room with his eyebrows slightly raised as everyone remained still and silent after a few seconds however lavender raised her hand whitman smiled brightly at her yes miss the lil sheila in the back there hi lavender began my name is lavender brown and i was just curious about something what are the thrashing thestrals whitman suddenly clutched at his chest and gasped in mock exasperation it briefly reminded ron of fred or george and quite a few people laughed what are the strewth miss first you mean who are the thrashing thestrals second they happen to be a rock band that i barrack for their mascot is one of them flyin biggie black gee gees you pommies have over that forbidden bush i pondered asking that hagrid bloke if i could have a squizz at one but i squibbed he chuckled then oh um neat lavender said with a forced laugh neat eh whitman said before shrugging i reckon if you value your limbs said a sneering and condescending voice i would stay away from that hagrid bloke ron turned in his seat to glare at malfoy who had just spoken unexpectedly from his table at the back of the room malfoy had obviously just mocked whitman accent in front of the entire class when he had repeated that hagrid bloke how would whitman take that ron wondered whitman expression was unreadable he was now staring back at malfoy but he simply looked as if he were reading over a boring poster on the wall and your name is whitman asked casually malfoy malfoy sneered draco malfoy malfoy eh whitman said ron thought he saw his eyes squint slightly but not as they did when he was smiling well that good oil for me innit hmm no stickybeaking in my bizzo alright no what your what malfoy asked rudely i dontunderstand that talk fair dinkum whitman said cheerily ron didntunderstand this but he wondered if it were an insult well i can tell that you re not the full quid but i ll try and explain my limbs are my bizzo ron turned to see how malfoy was reacting to this comment malfoy was glaring at whitman with a look that resembled disgust but there was still a bit of confusion mixed in with his expression whitman then quickly looked away from malfoy and clapped his hands together smiling brightly once more well mates since today is just a sort of introduction to the class i say everyone should state their name and chosen career path who wants to have the first go no one spoke or raised their hand and whitman rolled his eyes slightly the boss cocky gave me a list of all my students anyway i ll call your names out or will never nick off he said reaching into a satchel atop the desk and retrieving a white piece of parchment brown lavender he stated before looking up and nodding in lavender direction alright i ve met you but what your chosen career well lavender began excitedly i have chosen muggle studies ah whitman said with interest that pretty spiffy muggles need to be studied especially now eh without waiting for a response he looked back down at his paper and continued crabbe vincent ron heard a low grunt from the back of the room that he guessed to be crabbe response followed by education ron almost gave a snort of laughter but he covered it up with a cough education maybe crabbe thought the question was what do you need instead of what do you plan to do glancing over at harry ron saw that his friend was holding a balled fist to his mouth hermione nudged them both in their sides holy dooley is that right whitman replied pleasantly good onya as whitman continued down the list with finnigan seamus ron began fazing out he used the time to try and digest his thoughts of this new teacher did he like him well what was there not to like he was laidback seemingly intelligent and prepared for a productive term and he had insulted malfoy at least ron thought he had he really wasntsure but whitman response to malfoy comment didntseem to be said in a pleasant tone harry seemed to like him as he continued to look at him with an accepting amiable expression hermione had been looking at whitman with a furrowed brow the entire time as if thoroughly scrutinizing his every word which ron thought she probably was so why was it that he didntknow what to think of the guy granger hermione ron snapped out of his daze as hermione raised her hand timidly before placing it back in her lap and replying i hermione granger and i plan to graduate on the administrative path administration eh whitman said with a bright smile i bet your ant pants arentya when hermione didntrespond beyond a i uh uh whitman added i can already tell that you d make a good fist as a sheila in the ministry he then gave her a small wink before looking back down at his list of students hermione blushed slightly and looked down at her hands in her lap ron immediately felt a very unpleasant burning sensation deep in his stomach why was she blushing was it that wink she better not have enjoyed that wink what was a teacher doing winking at a student anyway was hermione flattered by the smooth talk whitman had used that ron didnteven understand exactly make a good fist ant pants they sounded like comments a perv would say to a young girl or am i just overreacting ron thought he hadntrealized that he was fazing out again until he heard potter harry whitman abruptly looked to ron before harry had time to respond harry sounds like a name for a bluey you re harry right um no actually he harry ron said pointing his thumb in harry direction that was a first ron was fairly sure he had never met anyone that couldntpick out harry from a group of students and he was positive that no one had ever suspected him to be harry whitman looked to harry as if he d only just noticed there was a student in that particular seat ah right then career he asked casually auror field agent harry replied auror dinkum whitman exclaimed excitedly bonzer hazza half your luck half your luck he then took out his wand from the inside of his leather jacket and waved it in the air to create a bit of confetti which fell slowly in a colorful arch before disappearing right whitman said still smiling thomas dean yes sir here dean said raising one hand auror field agent another one whitman cried creating more confetti bonzer matey half your luck as well and now there s weasley ronald ron raised his hand suddenly feeling a bit nervous um auror as well logistics the bluey too whitman exclaimed more confetti bonzer mate half your luck half your luck ron smiled and nodded his face flaming curse his blushing tendencies oh well that wasntso bad whitman continued down his list but ron was too busy thinking about hermione recent blushing tendency this was ridiculous ron had until now been nervous over whether or not whitman would meet the par but now he was nervous over whether or not the bloke had flattered hermione it was just that ron delighted himself in causing hermione to blush and he didntlike it so much when someone else was the cause for her lovely rouge cheeks after whitman commented on ron career choice he read off one other name before he concluded the class period with a simple wave and something that sounded like hooroo some of the things this new teacher said were quite interesting hermione had turned to ron to smile at him after this last exclamation but ron had simply given her a very weak grin before standing from his seat to collect his satchel what was his problem hermione stood and turned for the door as well but harry slowly approached the teacher desk hermione and ron exchanged slightly perplexed expressions as they waited sir harry said quietly whitman looked up from his own satchel with a confused expression before he chuckled slightly ah hazza call me edgar or whitman he said lightly sir or professor it just too wacky er alright harry replied awkwardly well then edgar i was actually just wondering is my name well that is is it not known among australians a small smile formed on whitman face why d ya ask mate well harry began slowly in all honesty if it not well known i might like to live there one day whitman chuckled heartily at this before sighing sorry mate but i afraid you re known everywhere i just reckoned you might like to give a gobful to the people that are always takin a captain at your forehead and well i didntrightly want to be one of those people he finished with a shrug oh harry said obviously a bit taken aback at this response well thanks no worries hazza whitman replied with a wave of his hand see you in a couple alright yeah see ya harry replied with a smile he then turned and joined hermione and ron to walk down to lunch the rest of the afternoon and evening between lunch and the evening meal consisted of studying in the common room well hermione studied at least she wanted to refresh her memory on her n e w t classes material however ron and harry talked about quidditch and defense against the dark arts hermione had joined in on the discussion of the latter long enough to offer her opinion on edgar whitman harry seemed to really like him ron was undecided and hermione had said that she thought he seemed mature yet casual and capable yet not overly cocky harry had agreed ardently but ron hadntreally said much more than yeah maybe hermione guessed the class was just very important to ron and he expected a lot of whomever the teacher might be it was good that he took the class so seriously but she hoped he would make the most out of what whitman had to offer harry of course would be resuming his lessons with dumbledore and lupin but ron and hermione would only have whitman to further their understanding of defense against the dark arts despite her concerns and worries at the end of the day hermione thought it had been a pretty good start of the term despite snape arrogance malfoy shiftiness and insolence mcgonagall disconcerting disapproval and ron and harry detentions it was a fairly good day wasntit hermione had to stop and ask herself why was it a fairly good day a lot of negative things had happened but she quickly remembered she and ron werenthiding anymore throughout all of those things he had been beside her openly holding her hand or smiling at her plus harry was happy about this fact and this made hermione happy of course happy was not synonymous with satisfied because hermione was not satisfied after she had said goodnight to ron in the common room with a brief goodnight kiss she had been left longing she hadntreally been able to have a nice private snog with ron in days hermione and ron could snog openly like some couples did but this idea disgusted hermione for hermione those moments with ron were private maybe the longing for a snog made her no better than a scarlet woman or a randy teenager but she didntcare at the moment and when ginny came to the sixth year girls dormitory to tell hermione that she and harry were taking the invisibility cloak to one of the secret passages hermione decided to call ron on their mirrors it wouldntbe fair for ginny and harry to have a romantic evening and she and ron simply retreat to their beds early after one kiss ron hermione whispered to the mirror as she sat on her bed concealed by her curtains lavender was down in the common room with seamus dean and neville last hermione checked but parvati was already in bed hermione stuck her head out of the curtains to check that parvati was still in fact snoozing she was hermione hermione jumped slightly as she quickly ducked back inside her curtains ron she breathed is everything alright he asked hastily his brow furrowed and his blue eyes concerned fine she said quickly but i i miss you hermione bit her lip after this comment as she realized that she d never actually said that to anyone before a broad grin spread across his face well do you know what he asked what i happen to be having a bit of trouble going to sleep at the moment and i also happen to be missing you as well i not sure but i think the two are related hermione smiled brightly into the mirror before quickly shoving it under her pillow grabbing her nightrobe and heading for the boys stairwell she was wearing cotton pajamas with long sleeves and pants but she still liked to wear her terrycloth robe in front of ron dorm mates seamus dean and neville were still in the common room along with lavender and a few other students so ron would have the dormitory to himself hermione hurried to the boys stairwell with her robe closed tightly about her she got halfway up the stairs when she almost collided with someone after looking up slowly from a rathr painful gasp of fright hermione saw ron holding his side and very plainly laughing at her she then playfully slapped him on the arm to which he responded by unexpectedly grabbing her around the waist and hoisting her up over his shoulder ron she whispered urgently screaming would have been better suited for the situation but she didntwant to wake any of the younger boys ron then began ascending the stairs reaching down with one hand hermione attempted to tickle him on his ribs by squeezing hard it worked he gasped loudly and gripped her a bit tighter he clearly hadntbeen expecting it and his abrupt jerk almost made hermione scream out loud she contained it however and managed to tickle him again and again he gasped but this time he stopped his ascent of the stairs long enough to lower her back to solid ground just as she tried to grab for his ribs again he caught both of her wrists with his hands and then pinned her hands behind her back with one of his strong arms her body was pressed firmly against his you re ticklish she stated with a smug smile as she looked up at him and you werentsupposed to find that out he replied with a chuckle she giggled at him might i have my hands back she asked do you have the notion to tickle me with them he asked playfully maybe she stated plainly and then feeling somewhat fiesty she added but if you re too chicken to risk it ron immediately released his firm hold on her and took one step back hermione actually did have every intention of tickling him again it was quite fun but as she stood back smiling up at him she felt that familiar tug his gaze was pulling her in and when that happened there was only one thing she could think to do hermione all but jumped into ron arms throwing her arms around his neck as she kissed him hard on the mouth he lifted her off of the ground as he returned her kiss she was pressed against him one of his arms was around her back while the other was just beneath her bum immediately after each separate kiss either her or ron would begin another one by relocking their lips her head was a complete shambles she didnteven realize until ron back collided with the door to his dormitory that he was slowly backing up the stairs as their kisses continued the door opened as he leaned against it and they were then inside the semi dark secluded dormitory hermine kicked the door shut as ron backed all the way up against the edge of his bed where he then lowered her feet slowly to the ground as she was lowered his lips left hers to warmly graze up the side of her face and finally come to rest on her forehead hermione then pushed on him slightly to usher him to sit down on the edge of the bed after he had sat down their faces were level so she stepped in between his legs and hugged her body tightly against his their cheeks touching his hands raked down her back creating a waterfall of chills before coming to rest on her hips they then resumed their passionate kissing hermione placed her hands on either side of ron neck as she deepened their kisses somewhere in the recesses of her mind she briefly heard a creaking noise but it was quickly swept away with the pleasant currents moving through her all of a sudden however hermione heard a low whistle come from the direction of the door the door that had just turned all the way around until she was leaning slightly against ron chest wow maybe we should come back later hermione felt her face turn a bright pink as she faced a smiling dean thomas and a rather timid looking neville no hermione said quickly clearing her throat in an attempt to lose the breathless tone to her voice she crossedher arms in front of her as she pulled her robe tightly together it alright i was um i was just leaving wish i had a girl to leave me like that dean said impishly hermione felt ron tense but fortunately neville cleared his throat and spoke up before ron could reply to dean comment so you two are really dating now neville asked casually hermione nodded as ron said yeah mate we really are he then squeezed her on her side where his hand was resting bout time isntit dean replied hermione found herself smiling as she asked what do you mean she thought she probably already knew but she just liked to hear people say it harry had implied it with the gift of the plastic arm ginny had said it and ron had even said it ron fancied you for ages neville said with a smile it wasntall that hard to spot blimey ron said suddenly i couldnteven fool you two hermione giggled and ron squeezed her side again no mate dean replied in good humor neville and i even had a little bet going at the christmas party but i lost thanks to you what hermione asked suspiciously i bet that you wouldntlet dean cut in hermione neville replied somewhat sheepishly and dean thought it would be ron that would stop him bloody gits ron said with a chuckle hermione turned around and elbowed him in the stomach ronald she exclaimed ooh hoo hoo dean laughed watch yourself ronald hermione even laughed a bit as ron rolled his eyes hey mate dean began more seriously now seamus hasntreally talked to you two since he got sloshed at the christmas bash has he no why ron asked with a scowl well he feels a bit bad about his behavior toward you hermione dean replied looking down at his feet doesntreally remember it but well i told him later that he was a pretty foul prat yeah well he can ron began with a growl but hermione interrupted after elbowing him oh i d already forgotten about that little mishap dean really seamus should just forget it hermione said ron made some sort of contradictory snort so she elbowed him again yeah it forgotten ron said quietly hermione smiled at him before turning to dean and neville um i guess i ought to go on to bed she said feeling a bit awkward wasntshe basically saying since you two interrupted our snog there no reason for me to stay dean and neville both smiled politelyand said goodnight hermione turned around to give ron a goodnight kiss but he stood up and said i ll be back in a bit mates he then placed a hand on the small of her back and led her from the room once in the stairwell hermione turned a questioning gaze upon him what are you doing i thought i d walk you down he said simply and then a bit worriedly is that alright hermione smiled up at him of course it alright i just well i ve never been walked out of your dormitory before i ve never been able to walk you down without worrying about what others might think either right hermione looked down for a moment before asking a question that she knew to be silly but she couldntstop herself so we we re really boyfriend and girlfriend as they say ron smiled brightly i guess that right you guess well it weird he began slowly it like you re still my best friend and the word girlfriend doesntreally seem well suitable you know hermione smiled and nodded she did know she felt the same way about the term boyfriend most boyfriends and girlfriends that hermione had seen in hogwarts seemed to share kisses and some of the same interests but she and ron shared much more than those things i love you hermione ron said quietly and unexpectedlybefore nuzzling her nose softly with his i love you too she whispered back he kissed her then and she returned it passionately but she then giggled a bit he pulled back and raised his eyebrows at her sorry she said but at this rate we ll never get to the bottom of the stairs he chuckled at her but after they held eye contact for a moment they began kissing again hermione didntgiggle this time she wasntsure how long they stood there embracing one another with warm hands and lips however she was sure of just how much she loved ron it was immense love a magical love that only seemed to grow more each day so hermione thought as the bottom of the stairs was completely forgotten that means that every day that ron remains a part of my life my heart can only expand looking at their relationship in this light hermione saw that ron truly did have the key to her heart author note okay once again i am really sorry for the delay the review often comment on my fast updates and i have fallen a little behind but maybe this extra long chapter will make up for it i hope everyone enjoyed this chapter

slang another example of this slang usage is the term septic or seppo to mean american they refer to americans as yanks so they found something pleasant to rhyme with yank septic tank i serious then they use the first word of the rhyming phrase thus i am a septic yay i rhymed death eaters w bird feeders and then used bird which has a double meaning since bird can also be a derogatory term for a

all right i have to admit that i have been having some writer block it like i know what is going to happen in the story but the journey is just giving me a bit of trouble right now dontworry though i will conquer this obstacle but please excuse me if i dontpost every day it might be one chapter every two days until i can get into the groove again and this saturday i will be taking a three day vacation to st louis mo so that will be a bummer for my story writing although i plan to write some while i there or on the road so that i can have at least one chapter ready to post on my return anyway second order of business in regards to the review concerning the usage of australian slang no australian talks like edgar whitman absolutely correct imagine how austin powers does not speak like most brits imagine how snoop dogg fo shizzle does not speak like most americans and imagine how lewis carroll sometimes chose not to speak any language at all as in carroll poem jabberwocky twas brillig and the slithy toves did gyre and gimble in the wabe all mimsy were the borogoves and the mome raths outgrabe well this is how i am attempting to portray edgar he is a bit eccentric along with being what harry would call cool like bill weasley one of edgar eccentricities is the extreme overuse of slang he does this simply because he finds it fun and amusing have any of you ever heard of zen koans well they re formulation in baffling language pointing to ultimate truth koans cannot be solved by recourse to a logical reasoning an example of a zen koan would be a day without sunshine is like night or be modest and be proud of it edgar is the kind of person that casually lives by the rules of zen in other words he doesnttake life too seriously if there comes an opportunity to spice things up a bit as in blasting a jar behind neville head to prove a point in class he going to take it for reference purposes i wanted to list the sites that i used to educate myself on the commonly and or nearly extinct aussie slang also referred to as strine edgar not picky but websites apparently wontshow up on fan fiction but anyway i completely understand if some of the words and phrases i ve found look foreign even to natives of australia because i looked up american slang via the web just for funsies there were many phrases that i had never heard before i guess i assumed that everyone would see edgar slang usage as being unique to him because obviously no one from any culture speaks in constant slang unless they are fictional one of my favorite movies is finding nemo there are many australian accented characters throughout the film that to my memory do not use much if any slang words or phrases and this is how i generally picture aussies but edgar bless him he marches to the beat of a different drum also although edgar is an australian man this does not mean that i have given him an australian personality because frankly i haventa clue as to what that would be i ve never been to australia and i ve never met an australian so edgar struts not because he is australian but because he good at what he does and he knows it and if he seems impolite it might be because as an auror he has learned to say what he means and mean what he says even if he can be hard to understand although i do not view edgar as impolite i quite like him actually lol anyway i hope that this helps to explain the character of edgar whitman but now it is time to get on with the show chapter 31 mmm no no mum notgonnawake goodream ron get up ron mm herm mione wham ron eyes flew open as something impacted with his arm causing a minor throbbing pain however he was so badly tangled in his covers he couldntsee a thing whozair wha after some frantic movements ron finally managed to surface from the sheets harry was looking down at him with slight distress in his eyes sorry i struck you he said slowly ron saw that he was replacing ron potions book atop his bedside cabinet you didntwake to the alarm ron scowled and rubbed at his slowly forming bruise i think i d have rather you poured water on me than slugging me with that book yeah well it probably would ve done you good harry replied with an odd expression on his face what do you mean i mean if you re going to talk in your sleep be careful what you dream he replied with a slight grimace ron was confused for a moment be careful what he dreams had he been dreaming ron didntremember having a oh wait a tick yes he did him hermione an abandoned stairwell pink knickers a great foul pig that what he was damn ron grumbled and then with apprehension what did i say harry grimace deepened you said hermione but it was the way you said it that got you hit in the arm at least the others have already gone down to the showers ron looked about the dormitory seamus dean and neville were in fact gone and that was indeed a good thing the embarrassment he felt burning his face at the moment would have been severe mortification if anyone other than harry had heard his quiet mutterings he really needed to get better control over his dreams the same dream had now visited him two nights in a row he hadntspoken in his sleep the first night or at least no one had heard and then hastily woken him if he had monday night dream had occurred because he had gone to bed with his and hermione recent stairwell snog on his mind but ron wasntsure why he had revisited the vacant stairwell dream again last night for tuesday night with hermione had been a bit less exciting she had come out of ancient runes in a frenzy because she had apparently forgotten the correct translation of mannaz over the holiday so they had made a trip to the library for some intense studying he had definitely not remembered everything from his n e w t classes but he had not been in a frenzy as hermione had the classes had gone fairly well by his standards madam bones acted no differently in class than she had before she had become the minister of magic and to ron dismay she had already given a homework assignment he was to write a report on the discrimination against centaurs in european countries madam hooch on the other hand had entertained the class with a detailed story of her holiday travels she had spent christmas with her husband in zimbabwe so she had many stories to tell such as her sighting the sea dragons of victoria falls it had been quite enjoyable and even more so when she had forgotten to assign the work that she had hinted at toward the beginning of class luckily no one had reminded her late tuesday night ron had finished his report for madam bones and then fallen asleep on the library table only to be awoken by hermione who now that ron thought about it had awoken him by smacking him with a book much softer than harry had but had he said anything in his sleep in front of hermione ron stomach squirmed and as ron got out of bed and prepared for classes his stomach continued to squirm he would be starting the day with snape in potions and ending it with snape in detention there wouldntbe much to enjoy today except for defense against the dark arts it would be their first true lesson with whitman ron had managed to put the winking incident behind him whitman was a teacher he hadntmeant anything by it although there was still a part of ron that cringed when he thought of hermione blushing cheeks after that incident he simply tried not to think about it he was determined to perform to his best ability in defense against the dark arts harry skills were now so far above his own ron was beginning to feel quite the dullard it was important that he keep his head on straight during these classes and that he wasted no time with worries over whitman playful behavior however when ron and harry met hermione that morning ron was immediately reminded of whitman playful behavior and its effect on females hermione came down the girls staircase looking a bit annoyed she promptly marched over to them grabbed ron hand and quickly led them from the common room what the rush harry asked as he climbed out of the portrait hole after them harry robes hung on the edge of the fat lady portrait wha oh hang on he bent down to unhitch himself from the painting while hermione groaned and began to fidget a bit hermione what ron began but just then lavender and parvati came out of the portrait hole as harry was rejoining he and hermione ron heard hermione mumble something as she turned toward the grand staircase that sounded a bit like pudding heads yes i know said lavender from behind them as they made their descent to the great hall for breakfast i ve never seen eyes that color before they re golden brown like parvati began in a somewhat reflective voice like caramel oh and that was so adorable when he called me a little sheila lavender added excitedly so charming parvati said in agreement ron and harry exchanged looks harry looked slightly amused but hermione was huffing and puffing by the time they had made it down the staircase and to their seats at the gryffindor table parvati and lavender had managed to comment on all of edgar attributes from head to toe ron was only too glad when they were able to part ways with the giddy girls they are driving me mad hermione exclaimed as she reached across the table for a piece of toast have they been at that all morning ron asked hermione sighed heavily and nodded it just ridiculous she said rolling her eyes ron couldntcontain a small smile as he looked at her why had he wasted any time worrying about whitman effects on hermione she obviously couldntcare less about his charm harry hermione said suddenly looking across the table with a furrowed brow ron then noticed that harry who was frowning at his plate seemed to be stabbing his kipper a bit harder than necessary with his fork you alright mate ron added cautiously harry looked up and shrugged hey harry hermione began as if suddenly realizing something where ginny ron then realized that his sister was indeed not with them this morning he had been too distracted by lavender and parvati babble to notice until now harry jerked his head to indicate down the table a ways ron glanced down and saw that ginny was eating with the same crowd she had often eaten with before she and harry had become a pair dean thomas was sitting across from ginny and ron didntreally like the way he was looking at his sister well what she down there for ron demanded i told her to eat down there harry replied plainly ron and hermione exchanged looks as harry continued ginny told me yesterday that one of her dorm mates asked her if she and i were dating she denied it of course but i thought it might be best for her to refrain from eating with us at every meal how did she take that hermione asked tentatively harry looked up glumly he didnthave to respond in words that look told them exactly how ginny had taken it the rest of their breakfast was eaten in near silence harry cast a few furtive glances down the table at ginny but for the most part he just stared at his plate hermione still seemed a bit weary from her morning of listening to frivolous twaddle as she called it so ron just ate quietly as he held hermione hand beneath the table and pondered what vile thing snape would have he and harry do for their detention possibly disemboweling some blast ended skrewts or pruning the limbs of the whomping willow as he hermione and harry made their way to the dungeons ron continued to think of unpleasant scenarios for his evening detention snape was milling through the ingredient cabinet when they entered he gave he and harry a most sinister grin when he spotted them and he then promptly reminded them of their detentions the sound of snape voice elated at the fact that ron and harry had to suffer at his hands was possibly the worst greeting one could receive for one morning class psst weasley malfoy had just entered with his squad of swine and was taking his seat as ron harry and hermione took their seats at their own table as ron turned to look at malfoy skinny pale face ron realized that he had been wrong there was actually a worse greeting than snape arrogant voice i know your family dirt poor malfoy began with a sneer but you re still pureblood so why dontyou act like one what is that supposed to mean ron asked dangerously hermione had suddenly grabbed hold of his arm malfoy looked straight at hermione with a hideously ugly look of revulsion and spat if you mate with that thing she ll soil the blood of your child you bastard ron shouted at once gripping firmly to the table until his knuckles turned white preparing to thrust himself up from his seat a surging wave of hot fury immediately flooded his every sense snape looked up from his cabinet with a look of utter confusion but ron didntcare what the consequences of his actions would be he was going to pound malfoy however as he made to stand nothing happened he tried to push himself up from his chair with his legs but they were completely frozen he tried to move his hands but they remained glued to the table he was about to shout an expletive in his confusion but his mouth wouldntopen either hermione now had a viselike grip on ron arm with both of her hands but he knew this wasntthe reason he seemed to be completely immobile well he wasnt completely immobile he could still turn his head from side to side ron turned his head to see malfoy staring at him with a self satisfied yet slightly baffled smirk he didntappear to be performing any kind of binding hex snape hastily began approaching ron side of the table yet with his eyes for some reason on harry looking at harry ron noticed something odd harry was staring at snape but with one hand held to his side his palm facing ron something automatically clicked into place in ron mind harry he shouted angrily suddenly regaining the ability to speak no harry stated sternly hermione was fearfully looking from one to the other you heard him ron exclaimed in slight disbelief did harry not want justice to be served he couldntjust sit still after a comment like that not now harry said impatiently silence snape bellowed looking from ron to harry with anger and a bit of alarm i dontknow nor do i care what you two are talking about but weasley i do not tolerate absurd outbursts in my class detention this friday and fifty points from gryffindor but it not absurd ron shouted still unable to move more than his neck malfoy monday as well snape hissed vehemently and one more word will make it an additional week worth although harry had him in a full body bind ron chest was still heaving up and down with his suppressed rage he glared at snape until his potions master seemed to trust that there would be no more outbursts from him snape then turned on his heel to stalk to the front of the classroom suddenly ron felt his body release slightly he turned to look at harry who was giving him an apologetic frown and whose hand was now resting on the table ron then realized that his torso could now move along with him wiggling his fingers slightly to make sure that harry had released him completely ron opened his mouth to berate harry for preventing him from attacking but his gaze landed on hermione she was staring up at him with a teary eyed worried expression as she released her hands from his arm and took one of his hands in both of hers before resting it in her lap mate with that thing that was possibly the vilest thing malfoy had ever said to hermione yet ron knew that she didntwant him to touch the coward she didntwant him to touch him when every cell in his body was aching to cause him pain well ron thought if hermione doesntwant me to touch him then i won t touch him throughout potions hermione continued to thank the stars that harry was able to perform wandless magic if ron had been able to move she knew exactly what would have happened well maybe not exactly but she knew it would have involved a severely injured malfoy and a much worse punishment for ron than detention mate with that thing how base still hermione knew that malfoy ignorant comment had infuriated ron while it merely perturbed hermione she knew how malfoy felt about her and she didntthink he could say anything that would actually surprise her toward the end of class hermione began to get a bit weary of ron potential intentions for revenge she knew that he had spent the hour class letting malfoy words fester in his mind why couldnthe just forget it and cool his temper because hermione answered herself he loves me at snape dismissal ron took his time loading his satchel while keeping one eye on malfoy and it was making hermione quite antsy ron hermione began wearily please don t hermione didntget to finish because ron grabbed her hand and began dragging her toward the classroom door harry was in their wake and malfoy was ahead of them as they exited the chilly classroom hermione looked up into ron set jawed stony face before she heard a thud and a yelp hermione jerked her head toward the sound and her mouth fell open malfoy was sprawled out on the stone floor his eyes were rolled back in the back of his head and he was jerking around madly it looked as though he were being electrocuted then his body went completely limp and he just lay there moaning softly horrified hermione turned to reprimand ron but she then remembered that she had been watching him when she heard the yelp from malfoy ron mouth hadntmoved at all harry hermione exclaimed turning to him instead harry eyes were wide and he was staring at malfoy limp form it wasnt me he whispered back urgently hermione looked once again to ron and saw that he was slowly tucking his wand back inside his robes while scowling at malfoy form hermione mouth opened with a ready retort but she didntget a chance to speak weasley snape snarled from the doorway of the classroom he strode into the hall and peered down at malfoy whose moans of pain were steadily growing louder mr goyle snape began continuing to look at malfoy with what hermione thought to be uncomfortable disgust take him to the hospital wing snape then turned a stern and suspicious gaze upon ron do you think you can attack a student right outside the door to my classroom without getting caught professor ron stated with surprising calm i afraid i dontknow what you re talking about hermione and harry were both gaping at ron hermione was virtually trembling on the inside how could he be so calm she d never seen him address a teacher in that sort of cool offhand manner dontgive me that caustic cheek mr weasley snape spat angrily let me see your wand and we ll see whether or not you know what i talking about hermione legs felt slightly weak now what ron stared at snape and with a semblance of a smile he replied no hermione actually gasped had he gone completely mad realizing that ron still had a firm hold on her hand she squeezed his hand as tightly as she could as a silent warning he squeezed back but kept his gaze upon snape what did you say snape asked slowly his eyes were squinted into dangerous black specks i said no ron stated just as calmly as if he were talking to her or harry about the weather hermione thought she might be sick she turned to harry who was now looking at ron as if he had never seen him before snape opened his mouth but ron cut him off i dontmuch like the idea of you performing the prior incantato spell on my wand do you think that i care what you like snape growled in anger hermione feared that the vein on his forehead might burst no i know you dontcare but article 32 c of the ministry of magic privacy charter states that only ministry officials have the legal right to perform prior incantato and even they need a warrant constituting probable cause ron said smartly so no professor you may not see my wand hermione was holding her breath causing her heart to beat painfully in her chest as she looked up at ron was this ron weasley where had that spill come from he sounded like a ministry official himself snape pale face had turned a sickly shade of pink let us see what the headmaster has to say about article 32 c mr weasley snape hissed in a near whisper he grabbed ron arm as if to drag him to see dumbledore but ron stood his ground alright ron responded calmly and while we re there we can ask him about article 42 a under the legalities of administering veritaserum i sure we could get permission to give some to malfoy in order to get the full story then he can tell the headmaster what he said in class that you didnt care to hear snape released ron arm as if he d been burned for a brief moment hermione thought that snape was considering striking ron across the face but he simply took a deep breath as his face turned a bright red and he and ron glared at one another he then turned sharply on his heel to retreat back into his classroom where he quickly slammed the door with a wave of his hand as soon as the door slammed shut behind him with a deafening bang hermione let out a long shaky breath she then looked up at ron smug expression she was completely speechless that was harry began slowly looking at ron in a daze the most brilliant thing i ve ever seen ron looked at harry which somehow prompted them both to laugh rather loudly hermione was almost positive that snape could hear them from inside his classroom ron hermione exclaimed suddenly regaining the ability to speak how did you know all that that information i mean the articles and whatnot do they even exist he actually looked down at her and chuckled they exist yeah i just happened to come across those laws last night in the library while doing research for that bloody report hermione just gaped at him he then continued did you know that centaurs werentincluded in article 42 a until a few years ago any ministry official could just slip them some veritaserum whenever they pleased i mean no wonder they donttrust us you know if you think about all the ron shush a minute hermione exclaimed excitedly she d just remembered something did you perform a silent stunning bolt hex ron smug expression faded slightly and his eyes got huge silent blimey did i he whispered in awe yeah mate harry said with a smile not all that hard when you want something bad enough is it bloody hell ron said staring off vaguely ron that your first silent spell hermione said happily he looked down at her and smiled broadly before abruptly bending down to hug her tightly lifting her upward to spin her around in a circle she giggled in surprise when her feet hit ground she stepped up on her toes to lock her lips over his um i going to go on to charms but you two take your time hermione pulled away from ron and looked to harry with a sheepish grin sorry harry she said with a small giggle we re ready harry gave her a somewhat awkward smile before leading the way to the third floor once they arrived to hear flitwick introduction to the lesson ron and harry compared notes on their experiences with silent spell casting hermione attempted to listen while she worked on her charms assignment harry said that his first silent spell was like ron s performed without him really realizing it harry said that the art would come naturally to ron now that he knew he could do it she was extremely proud of ron ability to perform that hex without an incantation which she told him she was not so proud of the fact that he had risked a great punishment by attacking malfoy directly outside the potions classroom which she also told him however hermione told neither ron nor harry that as they continued to talk amongst themselves she attempted the lumos spell silently nothing happened she tried sporadically throughout the entire class period but to no avail so by the time transfiguration rolled around she was feeling quite discouraged luckily mcgonagall quickly introduced the lesson this made hermione listen to mcgonagall voice instead of the voice inside her head which was saying what is the matter with you harry and ron can perform silent charms and hexes why cantyou mcgonagall instructed them to change miscellaneous items into small owls she said this was useful when stranded without a means of communication it was a rather interesting lesson but hermione was having a bit of trouble with the practical bit of it only one of her objects had been turned into an owl which was now merely hopping about her desk because she had neglected to give it proper wings could she not even perform spells with incantations anymore no she wasnt becoming a squib hermione knew much of her troubles with spell casting silent and spoken came from her lack of concentration and her lack of concentration was due to her thoughts on ron he was absolutely livid over malfoy comment would he be able to restrain himself from attacking him in the future if harry werentthere to restrain him especially now that he could perform silent spells hermione stomach didntseem to think so as it was churning uncomfortably there were however some butterflies in her stomach as well they were flying about in excitement over ron love for her he had now acquired two additional detentions for standing up for her and if he hadntbeen so very clever with his knowledge of magical law snape would have surely attempted to get him expelled for the rest of the term unfortunately her stomach butterflies remained the only things that seemed to be flying about at hermione desk she had only managed to make two wingless owls by the end of the class period so when hermione heard mcgonagall call class dismissed she was quite unsatisfied with her work if she were discouraged with her work in transfiguration which she normally excelled at she would be utterly despicable in defense against the dark arts nevertheless she followed ron and harry lead in standing from their chairs to head for whitman class however as they reached the door to exit the transfiguration classroom she heard a crisp and unexpected miss granger i need to speak with you please hermione turned to see mcgonagall taking a seat behind her desk as she shuffled some papers blimey hermione ron whispered beside her looking from her pathetic owls to mcgonagall are you feeling alright i fine she snapped ron raised his eyebrows at her just just go on to whitman class i ll be there shortly she added softly placing a hand on ron arm in an attempt to reconcile her unnecessary callousness after all she wasntupset with ron she was upset with herself no ron whispered harshly you re not walking back on your own especially not after what malfoy said in potions hermione sighed impatiently okay but at least go out in the hall to wait for me she said softly ron nodded and he and harry quickly left for the hallway now it was just hermione and mcgonagall in the large classroom that suddenly seemed cramped miss granger please sit down mcgonagall said as she conjured a wooden chair in front of her desk hermione slowly approached the chair and sat down her throat suddenly felt parched mcgonagall took a deep breath before continuing miss granger you have always been responsible in your use of time as we both know yet you wasted much of my monday class period ostensibly highly distracted and today you made a great mistake with the transfiguring of your owls yes professor hermione began i please let me finish miss granger mcgonagall replied firmly i believe that i know what is affecting your performance in my class you do hermione asked in a small voice her heart was now beating rather quickly did mcgonagall know that ron was in her every thought did she know that she was consumed with him from dusk until dawn thinking back hermione could remember all of the reasons for her recent inability to focus ron ron ron and ron i know all about what happened over the christmas holiday mcgonagall replied it was of course a large topic of discussion at the order meetings hermione just stared at her with wide eyes what why would the order be concerned with her romantic life had tonks betrayed her and ron trust it was hermione asked in the same small voice mcgongall furrowed her brow of course it was do you think the order would simply ignore an attack on your family she asked incredulously hermione suddenly had to fight the urge to release a nervous laugh threatening to burst from her chest of course not how silly of me she replied how silly of her indeed she truly was consumed with ron weasley the attack had she forgotten no of course she hadntforgotten but it hadnteven entered her mind when mcgongall said i know al about what happened over the christmas holiday had she thought of the attack no had she thought of the turmoil between harry and ginny no had she thought about the spontaneous snogs with ron at the burrow and grimmauld place yes well mcgonagall began again i understand how you must be feeling but you mustntlet it conflict with your studies you are much too bright and talented to become preoccupied during your sixth year with your n e w t classes and the new defense against the dark arts teacher you will need the utmost concentration this term yes professor hermione said softly mcgonagall peered at her briefly from over the tops of her square rimmed glasses she then nodded sharply as if satisfied with her warning to hermione but hermione suddenly realized that she wasntsatisfied she had just remembered something that she had considered speaking with mcgonagall about last term professor about defense against the dark arts hermione began slowly i seem to be having a bit more difficulty this year than previous years i ve never been quite as strong as harry or ron but i could not even begin to form the shield charm you taught us last term mcgonagall just stared at her for a moment with an unreadable expression before sighing softly miss granger after i discovered from madam pomfrey that your boggart was a group of death eaters i began to wonder do you often think of the incident that transpired at the department of mysteries yes hermione replied softly not quite sure where this was going mcgonagall nodded a few times i believe that seeing the death eater face to face may have created a fear in you that is affecting your performance in defense against the dark arts sometimes tragedies or horrible ordeals will affect one magical ability i experienced this same problem at one time hermione took a moment to digest this comment before asking may i ask you what happened to affect your magical ability my brother and his wife were murdered during the last war mcgonagall said with a calm yet stony expression my own niece joined the death eaters toward the beginning of voldemort rise she had always been a believer in the views of salazar slytherin so she liked the idea of campaigning for a school of pureblood students only unfortunately she was young and foolish and did not understand the means by which voldemort planned to accomplish his persecution of muggles and muggle borns soon after she joined his followers she was asked to participate in a mission they were to destroy a muggle orphanage killing hundreds of muggle children she refused her punishment was being forced to watch the death eaters murder my brother and his wife her parents oh that awful hermione breathed before adding professor i believe something similar happened to professor sinistra did it not yes mcgonagall replied blandly sobrina is my niece hermione eyes went wide your niece professor yes mcgonagall replied in an almost bored voice like mine own her powers were affected by the tragedy she had been studying to be a healer but after the incident her magical abilities suffered greatly there are many different ways to deal with a tragedy sobrina decided to run from her problem and study astronomy she seems to enjoy astronomy at least hermione said thoughtfully she always referring to the star theory which i not sure whether or not i believe of course you dontbelieve it mcgonagall stated harshly sobrina only believes in that nonsense because she can not seem to cope with reality she has convinced herself that her parents are watching her from the stars which is why they entrance her so to deal with the tragedy she not only ran from her problem but she also created a fantastical world in which to believe hermione was suddenly reminded of luna and her father she thought of all the extraordinarily ridiculous things that they seemed to believe was it possible that the made up stories in the quibbler were a means of escape for mr lovegood from the loss of his wife and poor luna has been swept away into his fantasy world so professor hermione began bringing her focus back to her present conversation might i ask what you did to cope with your brother death i turned my fear into determination mcgonagall stated in a strong voice i became determined to do everything in my power to fight against voldemort and his followers hermione nodded she suddenly felt very at ease although she didntreally know why now mcgonagall said as she began scratching something onto a small piece of parchment with her quill take this note to professor whitman it will excuse you for being late oh um professor i ve mentioned mr potter and mr weasley as well who are undoubtedly waiting for you just outside the door she said as she handed hermione the note one corner of mcgonagall mouth seemed to be twitching hermione smiled as she felt her face become warm thank you professor i expect to see better work from you this friday miss granger mcgonagall said as hermione rose to leave yes professor hermione replied before turning to leave the room at the door she cast one last look at mcgonagall who had already resumed the shuffling of papers bloody hell ron exclaimed as soon as she walked out into the hallway all you did was leave the wings off of those grubby owls and she thought you deserved a ten minute lecture no it fine hermione said smiling up at him she was right i was really slacking in her class she had a right to be upset ron rolled his eyes well what did she say harry asked oh you know hermione stated trying to sound casual she ignored the suspicious looks she was now receiving from ron and harry we need to hurry and get to defense against the dark arts she added hastily before heading off down the hall hermione wasntexactly sure why she didntwant to discuss the conversation she had just had with mcgonagall with ron and harry she knew she would eventually wish to tell them but for now she simply wanted to digest everything that had just been revealed to her especially the parts about her own subconscious mind although she had been a bit concerned with arriving late to their second class with whitman upon their arrival she found that she had nothing to be worried over there was a lot of chatting going on and whitman was at the front of the class setting up large blue targets that were levitated in mid air there were no tables set up so she ron and harry just stood around like everyone else oh look harry said gesturing toward one corner of the room they look a bit lost without their leader dontthey hermione looked to see that crabbe and goyle were standing alone in the corner and they did look quite misplaced without malfoy standing between them ron smiled smugly in their direction oh i just remembered hermione said suddenly removing mcgonagall note from her pocket she explained it to ron and harry before approaching the front of the classroom where whitman was still setting up targets um sir hermione said quietly whitman turned around quickly and flashed her a bright smile call me edgar miss granger he replied swiftly hermione was a bit surprised that he remembered her name after one day of class he must really be taking this job seriously hermione thought oh alright edgar hermione said awkwardly it was so peculiar having a teacher that was nearly your age that expected you to address him by his first name this is a note from professor mcgonagall excusing myself ron and harry for being a bit late he took the note from her and read over it quickly before tucking into his jeans pocket another oddity of this new teacher none of the other teachers dressed quite so casually it did make him a little less intimidating alright there missy ta muchly he said before smiling at her briefly he then turned back around to finish his work with the targets after regrouping with ron and harry hermione began repeating to herself what mcgonagall had told her i turned my fear into determination i became determined to do everything in my power to fight against voldemort and his followers hermione really thought about this for a second i can do this she thought if harry destiny were to face that monster then hermione would do all that she could to help him what if she found herself in a situation in which harry needed her help with attacking someone or something she wanted to be much more help to him than she had been at the department of mysteries clap hermione jumped slightly at the sound of whitman clasping his hands together she guessed that this was his way of starting the class since he had done the same thing on monday it seemed to work because both times it had caused the whisperings to die off abruptly hullo mateys he exclaimed cheerily i hope everyone ate a good brekkie because i ve prepared a bit of strenuous yakka for ya he then turned and gestured toward the targets there were six of them across the front of the room now i told you lot that i wanted to work on perfecting your marksmanship so i d like everyone to rock up here to these targets and form some lines when no one seemed to want to be the first to move he added fang it at this exclamation everyone quickly formed six separate lines in front of the targets hermione did feel nervous but she also felt much more confident than she had this morning before her talk with mcgonagall alright whitman began as he positioned himself in between targets three and four the only way to perfect your aim is to practice it there not really anything i can teach you i find the best spell to practice aim with to be stupefy these targets are enchanted so that the exact point of impact will briefly turn a different color so that youse can see where you ve struck it your goal is to strike as near the center as possible so have at it his instructions were so brief and to the point it took the students that happened to be first in line a moment before they realized it was time to begin hermione and ron were at the end of one of the lines harry was at the front of another hermione couldntsee too well what was going on but she heard some incantations and saw some shots of red good on ya mates whitman exclaimed goyle innit you need to lower that wand arm a bit and finnigan dontspread your plates of meat so far apart shoulder width is plenty good on ya potter next ron hermione whispered he leaned down for her to continue what did harry do i cantsee he hit his target directly in the center he whispered back with a small smile hermione had an urge to turn her head and kiss him but she didn t ron continued it turned green too the others turned red hermione guessed the target turned a different color depending on how close you got to the center the first group moved to the back of the line and hermione was then one step closer to her turn she remembered that night of the boggart incident when she had not been able to stupefy them or even move she had completely frozen up now that mcgonagall had helped her to understand a theory of why she was unable to act it was really beginning to make sense to hermione she realized now that during that incident she had been thinking i cantdo it i cantdo it and during the bi weekly defense classes she had told herself the same thing i cantmake that shield it too hard she had told herself these things because at the department of mysteries she had come out of the fray feeling completely incompetent and useless to her friends the most useful thing she had done was mark the doors with x s so what this attitude of continuously telling herself that she was incapable of difficult magic had created a fear in her of defense against the dark arts after all her second biggest fear was failure but now that she knew all of that striking that target in the center did not seem like much of a big deal at all next whitman called ron nudged hermione gently in the small of her back she turned around to smile at him before approaching the target and aiming at its center stupefy shouted six voices a red light shot from the end of hermione wand and impacted with her target she was very pleased to see a red mark extremely close to the center hermione figured that only bull s eyes turned green because hers was very close alright good grouse whitman said glancing around at the targets miss parkinson i think you d do better to lower that chin a bit but miss granger he said as he approached her and turned to look at her mark bonzer i impressed thanks hermione said happily as she admired her marksmanship she was about to turn around to see ron reaction to her work when whitman moved directly behind her may i make a small suggestion miss granger he asked a bit surprised at being asked this question by a teacher hermione replied of course no teacher had ever asked whether or not they could make a suggestion wasntthat what their job was in the first place alright aim at the target again just like before he said hermione obeyed now tell me if this helps whitman then reached around her from behind and repositioned her fingers on her wand then removing his hand from hers he said try again hermione thought this new grip on her wand felt odd but when she recast the spell she noticed that it actually did give her more control of the spell direction wow she exclaimed excitedly she d never thought to hold her wand in this way but it worked thank you edgar whitman placed his hands on her shoulders and said no worries darl before walking off and calling next on her way to the back of the line hermione approached ron did you see that she asked excitedly she couldntbelieve she d never thought to hold her wand in that way yeah i saw it he replied blandly not looking at her oh hermione said absently looking into his face which appeared a bit red well good luck thanks he said shortly before turning to approach the target hermione walked back to the end of the line why was he being so snippy he must be nervous hermione thought but she was surprised that he didntshow at least a little enthusiasm at her doing well with the exercise hadnthe been extremely adamant about her trying her hardest in this class well maybe he would be a bit moreenthusiastic after he had taken his turn stupefy ron yelled his red mark was not near as close to the center as he new he was capable of but when one hand was shaking from anger it affected one aim whitman started making some comments to the other shooters but ron wasntlistening he was instead wondering what this new teacher was playing at ron knew that it was not necessary to stand behind someone in order to fix their grip on their wand that whitman prat had simply seen an opportunity to reach around a pretty girl and he had taken it and hermione seemed oblivious to what had just happened hey bluey you away with the pixies ron looked up to see whitman approaching him aim your wand again mate he said hastily ron obeyed whitman then repositioned ron fingers on his wand as he had hermione s only he hadntwalked behind ron and reached around his body just as ron had thought now give it another burl whitman exclaimed ron looked at the target and envisioned it as being whitman thick head stupefy he yelled the impact shook the target slightly and turned a spot in the center green well i ll be stuffed whitman said slapping him on the back that more like it eh yeah thanks ron muttered quietly before going to the back of the line where hermione greeted him with a huge smile that was amazing ron she said happily grabbing hold of his arm he nodded and attempted a weak smile what the matter she added quickly ron shook his head at her nothing he muttered she continued to look at him worriedly but she released his arm alright then mates edgar exclaimed everyone had a go right there was a murmured assent bonzer now i going to conjure some more targets so that there one for each of you and for the rest of the hour i want you all to practice individually whitman then conjured enough targets for everyone before setting them up in a circle around the classroom ron hermione and harry claimed three targets beside each other and quickly began practicing at their own paces ron was doing rather well but he attributed some of this to the fact that he was still imagining the target to be whitman head bloody beaut bluey whitman said from behind ron after he had hit a bull s eye this exclamation had however caused his next shot to hit far left oh sorry bout that although you cantlet yourself get distracted by unexpected noises and whatnot in a real battle you never know what you might hear and you cantafford to come a gutzer ron merely nodded as whitman continued walking about the circle death eaters had chased him around dark deserted corridors he didntneed some teasing perv to give him advice on real battles i did it ron turned to his right to see hermione jumping up and down slightly a green mark shining on her target she turned to smile brightly at ron but whitman all but ran to her fair suck of the sav whitman exclaimed excitedly rushing over to hermione target that was a rip snorter of a shot miss hermione was smiling brightly well this really is a much better way to hold a wand i surprised no one ever shown us she said holding her hand out slightly admiring her hold on her wand yeah the way you lot were holding them wands was a bit bodgy but no one ever shown you that whitman exclaimed incredulously well then you probably haventlearned the proper stance either eh well i not sure strewth he said shaking his head you ve got to have a good pozzy stand like this whitman took his stance feet shoulder width apart one foot slightly behind the other shoulders back and hermione was standing as he had instructed but whitman had stopped to look at her with furrowed brows turn your shoulders a bit toward your wand hand no not like that here whitman then once again moved to stand behind hermione where he placed his hands just above her elbows ron felt his face growing warmer by the second whitman then turned hermione a bit to the right before grabbing hold of her wand hand and extending it straight out in front of her there he said cheerfully before walking around hermione to look at her heaps better eh ron realized that he had been staring at them with a scowl he quickly turned back to his target and shot a couple of bull s eyes before glancing to his side once more whitman had now gone on to help a slytherin boy leaving hermione practicing her new stance with a look of stern concentration ron would have normally admired her adorable expressions but he was too busy picturing whitman recent antics toward hermione and hermione still appeared oblivious did she not understand that edgar whitman was flirting with her shamelessly or ron thought his scowl returning did she simply not mind it hooroo whitman called merrily as he brought the class to a close he then began levitating the targets to stack vertically atop his desk as the students began filing out of the classroom talking happily hermione retrieved her satchel from a peg on the wall while she awaited ron and harry who had just been approached by whitman she couldnthear what they were saying but harry was smiling ron on the other hand had a frustrated expression and seemed to be avoiding whitman eye throughout class hermione had stolen a few peeks at ron and each time she had seen his target turn green she had only managed that twice throughout the period why did he look so miserable maybe he was having some sort of lapse in confidence maybe he had attempted another silent spell and failed suddenly whitman and harry strode off to the front desk but ron began slowly making his way toward her his head was down and his hands were shoved into the pockets of his slacks you did really well today hermione said softly as he removed his satchel from the wall thanks he said quietly you too hermione frowned at him as he turned for the door she followed he didntsound very enthusiastic it was right irksome to hermione she had been trying her very hardest in this class and had been thinking of ron the entire time ron will be so pleased i ve been able to make progress ron should be delighted once in the hall he stopped right outside the door and leaned against the wall looking off to the side what are harry and edgar discussing hermione asked curiously i not sure he replied shortly she sighed heavily she was through playing this game what is the matter with you she asked firmly he looked at her for the first time since the beginning of class after making some sort of puffing noise he said hermione that prat hands were all over you what she asked completely taken aback and confused by this comment her heart began thumping rapidly as she realized what he must be referring to professor whitman ron oh professor ron said a bit more loudly pushing himself up from the wall to face her is he professor now what hermione nearly whispered taking a step back he rolled his eyes at her before responding you re the only one in the class that calls him edgar no i i m he asked me to call him that hermione stuttered she felt as if she were being attacked besides harry calls him edgar yeah he said looking at her with a mocking smile well harry doesnthave your assets does he that is such a crude thing to say she spat her temper rising crude he asked incredulously you can be so na ve sometimes he muttered leaning back against the wall ha that funny hermione began taking a few steps closer to him i was just thinking the same thing about you he squinted his eyes at her then you know what actually edgar suits him just fine because he no more of a professor than i am he said jabbing himself in the chest with his thumb she pursed her lips at him well than what is he ronald he a a defense leader he said with a scowl like harry was for the d a that is just that is ridiculous hermione said crossing her arms firmly across her chest he is a professor and he was showing me how to stand properly hermione ron began quietly the anger in his eyes faded slightly i watched him with the other girls in the class he fancies you fancies me she exclaimed in disbelief you know maybe he just appreciates my progress unlike someone i know the anger in his eyes reappeared full force and he pushed himself up from the wall again well if your progress didntinvolve his progressing over you i might be able to appreciate it a bit more he said glaring down at her they were now a mere foot apart ron do you honestly think i would allow him to put his hands on me if it werentcompletely necessary for the lesson she asked in exasperation throwing her hands up into the air i beginning to wonder he stated darkly looking away from her hermione felt a lump form in her throat you dontmean that she said shakily before swallowing hard hermione can you stand here and tell me that this is necessary ron then moved behind her grabbing her hand with his and lifting her arm in front of her he placed his other arm just above her elbow she could feel his quick angry breath on the back of her ear hermione stomach stirred sickly had edgar been this close to her what was she even asking herself this for edgar had shown her the proper way to hold her wand nothing more hermione jerked away from ron hold and turned around to face him just get away from me ron she said curtly she thought she saw a flicker of sadness in his eyes before it disappeared completely ron scoffed and made an unpleasant scowl by raising his upper lip you didntsay that to edgar he stated evenly the lump in hermione throat grew slightly as she murmured you know you should probably shut your mouth before you say something that you re going to regret ron looked at her for a moment with a stony expression his jaw muscle was working furiously you re probably right he said finally before looking away from her and crossing his arms hermione mouth fell open slightly at his comment as her tears began stinging her eyes her breath began coming in tremulous waves and she suddenly felt like running down the hall and up the stairs to gryffindor tower she wouldntlet him see her cry though or run for that matter he still wasntlooking at her so hermione turned on her heel and started for the staircase without looking back

no copyright violation is intended no profit is being made off this site it is for entertainment purposes only chapter 32 you know you should probably shut your mouth before you say something that you re going to regret ron looked down at hermione she looked like she might start crying but as he stood their thinking back on the hour he had spent watching hermione being groped by edgar whitman all he could do was say you re probably right he then looked off down the hall and crossed his arms firmly over his chest although he wasntlooking at her he knew that she was gaping at him suddenly hermione turned sharply before stalking off down the hallway as ron turned to watch her he thought he saw her wipe at her eyes but he wasntsure his insides were screaming part of him wanted to run after her and say i sorry please forgive me i ll forget about whitman but then there was a very large part of him that knew he could not easily forget whitman actions toward hermione was he just completely overreacting ron hated second guessing himself but hermione exasperation at the mere notion of the guy flirting with her made ron doubt his assessment of whitman but referring to someone with pet names winking at them placing your hands on them werentthese all forms of flirtation harry suddenly emerged from the classroom and ron attempted to look casual and unbothered he really didntwant to discuss any of his worries with harry hey harry said cheerfully ron attempted a smile but it apparently wasntgood enough what wrong with wait where hermione harry asked worriedly she uh wanted to go on ahead something about studying ron replied lamely harry really didntlook convinced so ron turned from him and began the walk down the hall oh um harry began following ron lead i really like this edgar fellow he stated casually ron knew that harry was trying to quickly change the subject from hermione man had he taken the wrong direction in cheering him up why that ron asked blandly well for starters he seems to know his stuff harry began his words created a shiver down ron spine and he not making me the guinea pig of the class you know sometimes i just get sick of being singled out that actually what he wanted to talk to me about ron cast harry a curious look as a signal for him to continue maybe ron couldntstand whitman but he was still interested in knowing what he d said to his best mate he told me that dumbledore had informed him of the additional training i received last term to kind of forewarn him i guess just so he would know why i might appear to already know some of the things he teaches us harry said talking rather quickly he stopped to take a quick breath before continuing anyway edgar wanted to tell me that he noticed how many bull s eyes i got on my target but that if he didntpraise me any more than anyone else it was because he knew what it was like to be singled out in a class as harry paused again ron tried to remember how many times whitman had complimented his work ron grudgingly admitted to himself that it had been quite frequently if he didntpresently hate the bloke ron would ve probably enjoyed the confidence boosting he provided harry took another breath he said that he was always the top student in his defense classes and the teachers would always get him to demonstrate and whatnot he said he knows the kind of ridicule you can get from special treatment like that i told him i appreciated it ron nodded and tried to look pleased but he really didntknow what to say he couldntrespond with well i glad whitman knows how to treat you even though he doesntknow how to treat hermione or he seems like a great guy too bad i hate him and the thing was whitman really did seem like an overall great guy there was just the one exception of him not respecting hermione boundaries or rather ron boundaries fortunately ron didnthave to do more than nod and smile at harry because they were now approaching the doors to the great hall would hermione be here for lunch ron highly doubted it whenever she got upset she usually went up to her dormitory it had always been thus why would she change now to ron displeasure there was no bushy haired brunette sitting in her usual spot at their house table harry and ron sat across from each other and began filling their plates with steak and kidney pie so hermione went to study huh harry asked suddenly what oh yeah ron said quietly harry rolled his eyes at him and nodded down the table to his right glancing in that direction ron saw hermione sitting with ginny and her friends she was sitting on her bench so that her back was to him but she had her hair pulled up in a high ponytail which revealed the sides of her splotchy cheeks tear stained cheeks ron thought with a stomach pang you two had a row while i was meeting with whitman i can tell harry said yeah well i dontwant to talk about it alright ron said shortly we ve got that charms homework and that potions essay not to mention snape detention harry looked a bit uncomfortable but he said fine ron wondered if harry were slightly bothered by his and hermione first true lover quarrel these quarrels were in fact different than those they had before their courtship their old rows were usually settled by harry separating them and trying to keep the peace until they could each overcome their seething however lover spats were much more intense and personal harry couldnthelp them mend these rifts it was up to them may i sit here ron turned around to see ginny standing behind him she had a frown lining her face but her gaze was on harry ron stomach began squirming he didntknow if he could handle any advice from ginny at the moment which was undoubtedly why she had just appeared above him like a vulture glancing down the table ron saw that hermione must have left for the tower of course you can harry said a little impatiently ginny sat down hard beside ron on the bench dontgive me that harry she spat i have to ask your permission donti before harry could answer ginny turned to ron he closed his eyes as she began ron what have you done he opened his eyes and looked at her with exasperation what have i done why is it always me do you think that possibly hermione could have done something to me oh i sorry ronnie ginny said in a sarcastic comforting tone what did big bad hermione do ron gritted his teeth and looked down at his plate she she didntactually do anything ginny made some sort of a high pitched hmm sound that clearly said i knew it it sent shivers down ron spine i wasntfinished ginny ron said sternly neither one of us actually did anything we just disagreed on something well why dontyou go agree with her then ginny asked smartly ron gaped at his sister so you re telling me that if you and harry had a disagreement you would want him to just agree with you even if he didntmean it ron said too low for the prospect of eavesdroppers no ginny said and harry actually chuckled a bit which he tried to cover up with a cough she turned to harry then with a tiny smile oh shut up harry harry looked up at her and smiled which ron was thankful for because it seemed to soften her a bit listen ron ginny began quietly hermione wouldnttell me what you two rowed over but she doesntreally seem all that angry she just seems upset i think you should just excuse me ron and ginny turned to see luna standing behind them her protuberant grey eyes were locked on ron she was wearing large carroty earrings in the shape of orange slices um yes luna ron inquired luna immediately took a seat to ron side where she turned to stare at him again might i take a look at your hand she asked softly ron furrowed his brow in confusion and glanced at harry who was frowning at her his hand did she want to read his palm um ron began uncertainly why i wanted to see if it were injured she replied calmly ron was just staring at her in confusion but ginny grabbed his hand and held it up to her own face luna eyes got a bit wider as she looked at ginny but she then grabbed ron other hand and held it up to her face ron looked across the table at harry who was now wearing a confused smirk after ginny released his hand and shrugged luna placed his other hand down gently on the table and replied wistfully hmm they look all right dontthey maybe you should just be careful with them luna then quickly stood up from the table and turned to leave ron turned to harry and raised his eyebrows but then he heard oh and harry you should be careful with yours too luna called before traipsing off to the doors of the great hall well that wasntat all peculiar ron said sarcastically ginny simply shrugged as she stood from the table his sister sighed and looked to harry i think i going to go work on some herbology homework she said suddenly unnecessarily stressing the last two words harry looked up at her rather quickly and gave her a small smile before looking back down at his plate see ya ron said surprised yet glad that ginny wasntgoing to finish reprimanding him with one last smile at harry she walked off toward the exit once she had disappeared beyond the doors of the great hall harry stood from his bench sorry mate harry said but i ve got to run ron squinted his eyes and asked suspiciously herbology homework is it with a sheepish grin harry leaned over the table toward ron and muttered herbology homework is code for meet me in your room she ll be going to fetch the cloak right about now dontlet her smile fool you though i going to get what for over these new eating arrangements ron nodded in comprehension i thought you d already received the what for well ginny can be very harry twisted his mouth in thought stubborn ron offered harry didntseem to want to respond but ron knew he agreed determined strong willed hardheaded harry chuckled faintly before clearing his throat just wish me luck alright good luck ron said with a wave of his hand harry nodded and then added with a slight frown you too he then walked off leaving ron alone with his remaining sprouts and kidney pie ron no longer had an appetite where had hermione gone most likely the dormitory was she truly not angry with him as ginny had said was she merely upset at ron severity outside the door of whitman classroom was she crying ron rose to make his way to the dormitory this was ron and hermione third day as an actual couple and they were already in the midst of an intense disagreement maybe he really wasntready for this type of relationship with hermione maybe he would only make them both miserable the famous hag malodora grymm used a beatification potion to conceal her true form married a king and then created an enchanted talking mirror to reinforce her self image she became jealous of the most beautiful girl of the land and fed her a poisoned apple to get rid of her ridiculous hermione thought as she dipped her quill into her inkbottle to put the finishing touches on her potions essay she moved her head from one side to the other as her neck was quite sore from peering over the library table at her paper all evening what kind of a person would become so jealous that they would result to murder oh yes she thought as she wrote out a conclusion ronald weasley oh bother hermione whispered as she poked a hole through her parchment with the point of her quill with a sigh she took out her wand and uttered a paper mending charm hermione knew that ron would never actually result to murder over his jealous tendencies but he might come close she definitely wouldntput it past him to give someone a good slug in the face but she better not catch him trying to slip a silent hex on edgar whitman because the man honestly hadntdone a thing had he stop second guessing yourself her insides screamed ron had shaken her thoughts and emotions until she was unable to think straight in fact she was thinking in circles glancing at the time she saw that it was nearly ten o clock she had hidden away in her dormitory until it was time for ron and harry detention only then had she come to the library to work on her assignments she just did not want to see him at the moment yet there was a part of her that wondered whether or not he was still in detention and if he weren t why hadnthe come looking for her well no matter if he were back in the dormitory or not hermione was going to turn in for the night she rose slowly from the table and began loading her school bag with all of her strewn belongings then with a sigh she heaved the satchel over her shoulder and picked up the copy of beautification an art to return it to its shelf this report had given her more insight to the extreme vanity of some people using magic to enhance one appearance preposterous lavender or parvati might use one in an attempt to woo edgar hermione thought even though neither of them needed to be more beautiful they were the type of girls that boys turned to look at in the hallways hermione had never been one of those girls and she didntwant to be one either which was one of the reasons hermione found it hard to believe that a young man like edgar whitman would fancy her as ron had said surely he would be more attracted to lavender or parvati let see hermione thought tilting her head slightly to read the spine as she realized that she had been standing in the middle of the library staring off into space authored by sacharissa tugwood hermione quickly made her way to the shelving for t s q r s oh hermione said in slight alarm as she turned down the proper aisle there was someone standing on their tiptoes tracing their finger along the spine oh hello hermione neville whispered brightly he glanced down at her book i see you re getting a head start on snape essay on appearance altering potions hermione nodded with a small smile yes i ve actually just finished what are you doing in here this late the same she asked curiously neville face blushed slightly and he began twiddling with some of the buttons on his robes well actually i ve been researching potions ingredients for the essay hermione asked not quite sure why this would make neville blush not exactly neville twisted his mouth slightly before saying almost too quiet for hermione to hear i haventtold many people but well i ve been working on creating my own potion your own potion hermione asked slowly taken by surprise neville is that legal where ron when you need him hermione thought he would probably be able to state the exact article and whatnot well not unless you have a permit which i ve gotten from professor sprout he said happily apparently she has a relative on the ministry committee for experimental potions that great neville hermione replied trying her best to sound excited rather than skeptical she couldnthelp wonder if neville would actually be able to create a potion what type of potion she added inquisitively again neville blushed actually i d like to create a memory potion it taken me a while but my samples actually work quite well there only one thing that i cantseem to his eyes suddenly went wide hermione you re just the person i need me hermione asked apprehensively did he need someone to experiment on yes you re the brightest witch at hogwarts you might be able to help me find the missing ingredient he stated eagerly his eyes looked a bit wild i using the stinksap from my mimbulus mimbletonia leaves of ginkgo biloba root of angelica and a few other things the only problem is well the stinksap just frankly stinks i ve tried everything i can think of but nothing takes away the smell makes it a bit hard to swallow you know oh well there a simple solution to that hermione said brightly neville eyes were shining with excitement you simply need to add a bit of bundimun fungus secretion i almost positive that will eradicate the odor bundimun fungus neville repeated with a faraway look in his eyes um yes hermione added slowly she d never seen neville like this before their powerful secretions can actually rot away thick woods and metals but once diluted they are commonly used in cleaning solutions to scourge the that it neville breathed suddenly we studied those in our greenhouse three didntwe oh why hadnti thought of it hermione you re the greatest neville suddenly flung his arms around hermione and hugged her she froze in slight shock beautification an art was smashed in between them but neville didntseem to notice he finally pulled away from her smiling broadly when his expression suddenly fell and the color in his round face left him neville hermione asked worriedly he was looking over her shoulder hermione heart began to beat madly oh no she thought please dontbe ron please dontbe ron hermione spun around ron she whispered he was standing at the end of the aisle frozen in mid stride staring at her and neville with his mouth partway open she approached him and reached her hand in his direction but he took a step back ron please dontfly off the handle hermione began rapidly please just let me explain you dontunderstand what neville ron said low in his throat cutting her off hermione turned to see that neville eyes were wide with fear could you walk with hermione back to the common room she really shouldntbe out this late alone he then turned to look at hermione with an intensely pained look i uh neville began in a strangled voice thanks ron said quietly his gaze moving back to neville hermione opened her mouth to once again make an attempt at an explanation but ron turned quickly and left the library with his long strides hermione just stared after him she noticed as she watched him leave that his right hand was bandaged with thick white gauze what in the world had snape made them do anyway she felt a small twinge of anger at her potions master oh who cares right now hermione thought desperately why was this happening to her now ron thought she had been snuggling with neville longbottom in the middle of the library tears immediately sprang into her eyes and she covered her face in her hands hermione i am so sorry neville whispered from behind her i ll talk with ron alright we can leave right now and i ll try to put it right hermione lifted her face from her hands and wiped at her eyes no no dontbother it not your fault i just want to go to the tower you donthave to walk me i ll be fine hermione shoved tugwood book onto a random empty spot on the shelf which said dontput that here she one row up hermione ignored this comment and gripping tightly to her satchel made her way out of the library although she d told him not to bother with escorting her neville was right behind her they made the trek to the tower in near silence the clicking of their heels and hermione sniffs were the only sounds in the corridors ron made sure that he was already in bed with his curtains closed by the time neville returned from the library what was happening it was as if he had been hit with a nothing is going to go right for you today so just give up hex first hermione wouldnteven consider the fact that whitman might be flirting with her and now now he had just stumbled upon her and neville in some sort of embrace ron was beyond confused neville had always been considerate and shy did hermione think him a fool how could he believe that neville longbottom would be hugging her tightly and grinning ear to ear without that meaning something plus neville never hung out in the library especially this late at night when he was normally in bed but what was confusing ron more than neville behavior was hermione s ron knew that she would never two time him so what was going on had he driven her away with his jealousy of whitman had he driven his girlfriend into the arms of another man neville longbottom it was almost laughable in a morbid not at all funny kind of way goodnight harry came a rather tired and despondent voice it was neville and apparently he and harry had just entered the dormitory as soon as snape released ron and harry from detention they had made a trip to the hospital wing for treatment to their wounds from their rather tedious punishment harry had then come straight to the common room to finish a history of the dark arts essay due for tomorrow class ron on the other hand had gone straight to the library after ginny informed him of hermione whereabouts he had planned to reconcile their differences their separation was eating him up inside unfortunately ron plan had fallen through harry must have finished his essay ron could hear his friend climbing into bed he could also hear neville writing something and mumbling january 1997 bundimun fungus secretions ron had no idea what this could mean and he didntreally care what he did care about all of a sudden was sleep closing his eyes ron realized just how tired he was it had been an awfully long day hey weasley are you going to mate with that thing what thing ron didntknow what malfoy was talking about nor did he know why malfoy was glued to a large blue target which was spinning him around in circles that thing malfoy pointed behind ron ron turned around and actually burst out laughing malfoy was pointing at a gigantic wingless owl it was about the size of hagrid you re mental ron shouted between laughs turning back around to malfoy ron yelled stupefy a bright red light shot toward malfoy spinning form upon impact malfoy face turned a bright green ha ron burst out laughing once more we ll see who has the last laugh weasley malfoy said although he suddenly looked more like snape than malfoy snape malfoy began waving his hands in front of him like a conductor until suddenly ron and malfoy switched places now ron was on a target spinning the world was going from being right side up to upside down in a sickening twirl a long line of people were walking by his spinning form and laughing it was a group of slytherins but at the very end of the line was a couple holding hands hermione ron asked the girl the boy answered yeah ron you werentgood enough for hermione you should have listened to everything you d told yourself over the last six years oh well dontworry about it i ll make her a great husband the girl suddenly spoke hermione jane granger longbottom whitman i like it hermione no ron said quietly but she was ignoring him she was now in an embrace with her fianc no hermione please no ron ron wake up hermione yes ron it me ron ron eyes flew open hermione he asked into the darkness one cool hand clasped his own and another was resting on his cheek gradually two brown eyes and a bushy mane of hair came into focus hi she said softly ron sat bolt upright as she continued i think you were having a nightmare ron ran his free hand roughly over his face yeah yeah i was he said remembering the horribly wacky and disturbing dream he d just had then turning his gaze back upon those brown eyes he whispered what are you doing here what time is it may i come inside the curtains first she asked almost timidly as if he could refuse her anything no matter how perturbed he became at this beauty he would never be able to say no to her sure ron released her hand and scooted himself back against the headboard hermione climbed in and then sat facing him lumos she whispered and a particularly dim light emitted from her wand she laid her wand on the mattress it cast a lovely golden glow upon her face as she sat there across from him picking at the nail on her middle finger and biting her lower lip it about two am i had a nightmare too it woke me she said quietly ron frowned at her was it dolohov again ron asked gently she looked up at him with tears in her eyes no she said before swallowing and whispering it was you me ron asked his chest constricted painfully you were yelling at me calling me names like floozy and harlot and then you just left me standing alone in the middle of a large stone room she said quietly and then a pitiful sob came forth from her shaking her small body hermione ron said softly reaching for her she pulled back from his hands no wait she said wiping at her eyes and then between sobs she continued very quickly i dontknow if edgar fancies me or or not but i dontfancy him so so i dontthink you should get angry with me i dontwant his hands on me if he doing it because because of my assets and neville doesntf fancy me he was just happy because i help helped him think of the bundimun fungus he didntknow how to get rid of the smell and i told him and he gave gave me a hug and then you w walked up and then you you you just left tears were now streaming down her face ron heart felt as if it were breaking hermione he breathed as he hastily pushed the covers off of him and then leaning toward her grabbed both of her hands and coaxed her forward ron leaned back against the headboard as she began scooting toward him he pulled her into his arms so that she was sitting across his lap still sobbing she buried her head into the curve of his neck i sorry love ron whispered as he rested his head upon hers stroking her hair ron do you really th think that i want edg professor whitman touching me she breathed against his neck he squeezed her tightly against him rubbing one hand over her back no love hermione i was just angry and shooting my mouth off like a git i know you dontwant his hands on you like that she kissed him on his neck then sending chills over his body taking one of her hands in his he brought it to his lips for a tender kiss she lifted her head and gazed at him with a small smile her tears had ceased ron interlocked their fingers as he leaned forward slightly to kiss her lips sliding his hands under her shirt he rubbed his left palm against the soft warm skin of her back his right palm he kept in a tight fist at the small of her back he then made a trail of kisses up her cheek and to the side of one eye and then the other she cupped his face and kissed him lovingly before turning his head gently and kissing him on his cheek and then his ear he heard her gasp and she quickly pulled away ron she whispered urgently let me see your hand ron had been very caught up in the moment and it took his mind a minute to work through what she d said he was at first utterly confused then he was reminded of luna asking him the same question at lunch and then he felt the effects of dawning comprehension she knew he said vaguely what hermione asked curiously while reaching around behind her and pulling his right hand out from underneath her shirt she then brought it up to her face and squinted at it with intense scrutiny ron kept it in a fist hey how did you know he asked curiously she continued to scrutinize his hand running her finger across the surface i dontknow anything except that you had a huge bandage on earlier i only just remembered she began prying his fingers away from his palm ron she gasped as she turned his hand over and got the first glimpse of his palm and undersides of his fingers she looked up at him worriedly he glanced down at his hand it actually looked better than it had earlier before the bleeding had stopped fully there was one long cut down the length of his palm from the base of his thumb to the base of his smallest digit his fingers were red with shiny white blisters along them what did that monster make you do she asked in angry apprehension ron scowled at the memory of his detention with snape have you ever heard of a volitan lionfish hermione mouth dropped open snape made you de spine a lionfish hermione asked in disbelief ron flexed his hand and nodded but hermione began but their spines are venomous yeah ron said blandly and they re sharp too so this gash is a cut from a lionfish spine she asked taking his hand in hers again and lightly touching his wound with her fingertips ron nodded she looked up at him then with deeply concerned eyes he couldntcontain a small chuckle it alright hermione harry and i went to madam pomfrey after we finished she gave us a salve to apply twice a day for a week she says it ll heal right up those definitely werenther exact words but ron didntwant to trouble hermione with the details does it hurt she asked softly like hell he replied truthfully with a weak smile thinking back on his detention ron was truly surprised at snape ruthlessness of course snape had always been cruel but he had actually watched he and harry de spine the lionfish without telling them the danger of what they were being made to do he had taken them to a room in the dungeons that ron didnteven know existed where there was a large tank full of live volitan lionfish they had to scoop them out with their hands smash their skulls with a mallet and cut the spine out without gloves snape had not informed he or harry that the fishes spines were poisonous but it had not taken them long to realize that they werentharmless they stung to the touch similar to jellyfish leaving white blisters that would have been bad enough but ron had managed to get hold of a rather aggressive one that squirmed around until it slashed ron hand open with its caudal fin madam pomfrey had been aghast at the state of his and harry hands when they had arrived at the hospital wing shortly after snape released them she said the venom in his and harry wounds could have caused them to lose their hands if they hadntgone to her for treatment and received the poison antidote salve why dontyou have it bandaged ron hermione asked bringing ron out of his reverie she was still scrutinizing his wound he shrugged it was cumbersome she looked at him sternly and sighed do you have your healing kit yeah it on my cabinet there i drank a bit of that pain relief potion earlier helped quite a lot hermione abruptly slid from his lap and out of the curtains she looked extraordinarily delightful in her long flannel pajamas when she reentered she was holding his kit which he had already enlarged from pocket size to its original size to retrieve the pain relief potion hermione sat down cross legged in front of him their knees touching and opened the kit slowly so as not to make too much noise she then removed the impermeable gauze the no sting cleaning solution and madam pomfrey salve he just smiled at her as she took his hand and placed it in one of her palms she began dabbing at his cut gently with the no sting cleaning wipes it felt cold and actually pleasant as she worked she kept making small sighing and puffing noises of displeasure when she was finished cleaning the wound she held his hand up close to her face and scrutinized it fully then very gently she kissed his fingertips after opening the jar of salve she removed a liberal amount with two of her fingers she then gently applied the salve along his cut and blisters his hand looked so large lying open in her palm now she said tilting her head to one side and peering down at his hand the gauze came next which she unraveled and snipped with a pair of surgical scissors with great care she lay the gauze across her lap and then brought ron hand to rest on the gauze palm facing up she wrapped his hand just as good if not better than madam pomfrey had hermione wrap wasntnear as bulky okay she said replacing everything back inside the kit that should do until tomorrow afternoon at least then i ll need to clean and rebandage it she then leaned outside the curtains slightly to return the kit to the cabinet thanks hermione he said as she sat back down in front of him she smiled at him hermione ron began somewhat tentatively would you i mean i not trying to be cheeky but would you like to lie down with me a spell her eyes widened a bit before she cleared her throat with feigned casualness she asked you mean underneath the covers ron felt himself blush his request was too forward hermione was a lady why had he asked her that i sorry hermione i shouldnthave i d love to she said biting her lower lip again you d love to ron said croakily he cleared his throat hermione answered by moving the covers back and slowly crawling beneath them she then laid her head down on one corner of his pillow her hair splaying wildly about her porcelain skinned face ron slowly scooted his way back beneath the covers lying on his side he propped himself up on one elbow hermione was lying on her back but looking up into his face ron knew that she had absolutely no idea how beautiful and alluring she looked at the moment which made her even more so as their gazes locked ron lightly brushed her cheek with the back of his hand she smiled sweetly and rolled onto her side so that her body was facing his which beckoned him to lie down fully by her side he wrapped an arm around her and pulled her tightly against him until their noses and bodies were touching we cantfall asleep ron hermione said quietly against his lips she sounded very drowsy as she closed her eyes and placed her hand upon his chest i know he said softly before kissing her to the side of her mouth she turned her head slightly so that his lips moved over hers and locked you called me love she whispered softly after pulling away from their kiss yeah he stated feeling his face grow warm it had just fallen from his lips naturally i liked it she said sounding drowsier by the minute her breathing was becoming deeper he hated himself for what he was about to say hermione maybe you should go on back you re about to fall asleep i think no i not she said clearing her throat and opening her eyes wide and blinking he smiled knowingly at her cantyou hold me a bit longer she added gazing at her he moved his hand under her shirt to caress her waist and back yeah a bit longer he whispered as he felt chills surface along her skin i love you she whispered sleepily i love you too hermione he replied kissing her on her forehead hermione sighed softly as her breathing deepened even more she was definitely asleep ron thought the idea of waking her was immensely unappealing for one she seemed to be so content and comfortable and for two he was extremely content and comfortable but he had to wake her what would harry think ron felt his own breathing becoming a bit heavier yes what would harry think or nean or seville or deamus oh well now that everything was becoming black and fuzzy it didntreally matter did it author note thank you reviewers and readers as always your comments are well appreciated i donthave much to say about this chapter other than aww lol well i hope everyone

dormitory she took note of how utterly relaxed she felt she could hear lavender and parvati moving about the room in preparation for breakfast i think i could go back to sleep for hours hermione thought she decided to get out of bed before she did just that hermione was about to allow herself one long morning stretch when she realized that she couldnt there was something constricting her movement it was a leg a rather long leg that was resting heavily on her leg and there was an arm too hermione reached one hand up to the arm that was lying across her stomach oh merlin beard hermione heart began beating frantically that was not her ceiling and ah damn it what there a hol in me last clean pair o shorts need a pair uh no thanks mate i think i d rather go starkers and those were definitely not the voices of her female dorm mates that was seamus finnigan and neville longbottom outside her and ron curtained nest hermione turned her face to ron s which was a mere two inches from hers his eyes were closed and his long ginger lashes were resting against his freckled cheeks ever so softly hermione breathed ron ron was she mad there was no way she could wake him with a barely audible whisper she scooted as close to his body as possible his leg tightened over hers and his hand gripped tightly on her side just below her ribcage this position was actually very arousing but hermione unfortunately didnthave time to think about that she tried once more whispering ron against his lips he stirred slightly nuzzling her nose against his cheek she kissed him on the corner of his mouth he breathed a low sigh against her lips she then locked her lips over his and to her surprise he kissed her back rather passionately returning his kiss her heart beating rapidly she heard a quite repulsive belch from outside the curtains ahh many pardons shoot what was she doing hermione pulled her mouth away and placed her hands on ron chest attempting to push him off of her while calling ron but somehow he was still asleep how could anyone sleep through a kiss like that the arm he had resting across her stomach gripped her ribs tighter as he began moving his torso on top of her she gasped slightly and he took her mouth again yet this time he deepened it hermione couldnthelp but kiss him back it was such a passionate moment but when her head began feeling fuzzy and her body started tingling madly she had to stop it she pushed against him as hard as she could and he rolled onto his back bringing her with him could he make this any more difficult for her she was now lying completely on top of him but finally he opened his eyes he looked up at her his bottomless blue eyes causing her cheeks to flush as they took in her current position his eyes went wide and he opened his mouth to speak hermione hands were unavailable as they had become trapped beneath ron back in a panic to shush him hermione filled his parted lips with a deep kiss he moaned faintly as his hands gripped tightly to the flannel fabric of her shirt she pulled her lips away quickly and hurried to whisper in his ear before he could speak or heaven forbid moan again ron shh we re in your dormitory and we arentalone he tensed beneath her and she pulled back to peer down at him with a vague expression in his eyes he furrowed his brow and began gnawing on his lower lip although he was staring at her she could tell that the wheels in his head were turning in search of a solution to this predicament her hands were going numb beneath him so she attempted to free them ron arched his back slightly to aid her which did as she was then able to remove her hands and rest them on his chest however him arching his back had also sent a current of awareness through her that was a bit startling the door suddenly creaked open and hermione and ron eyes both went wide yes hermione thought leave however she was sorely disappointed as the door was creaking open to allow someone entrance not exit bout time yeah well some prats took most of the hot water rubbish admit it dean you were buffin yer wand shite seamus shut your trap suddenly two large hands closed over hermione ears she cast a puzzled glance down at ron who was rolling his eyes and shaking his head slightly without looking at her she reached up to grab his hands and remove them but he wouldntlet her looking at her with his eyes squinted slightly she could tell that he was still listening to his dorm mates conversation his expression was hard to read for it kept changing frustration disgust more frustration now that one looked a bit like amused more frustration what in the world what could they possibly be discussing that she wasntallowed to hear once again hermione tried to pry his hands away from her ears but this time he smiled weakly and brought her face down to his for a light kiss he then slowly released his hold are you ready yet hol yer horses ya big arse do you think we should wake harry and ron hermione heart jumped into her throat as silent fear screamed through her she slowly lowered her head to rest on ron chest his heart was beating just as quickly as hers along with her fear she had a sudden bout of curiosity harry wasntyet awake and ready either that was odd ron squeezed her waist a couple of times she raised her head and looking down at ron she saw that his eyes had gone a bit wider he slowly and quietly rolled onto his side sliding her off of him ron looked as if he were about to speak possibly to holler i skiving classes today or bugger off but before he could neville spoke nah leave them i uh they told me yesterday that um that they were going to skive healing a small smile crept onto ron face which hermione shared oh well if you say so suddenly there was the sound of three sets of footsteps and three sets of robes crossing the room and exiting the dormitory ron waited a moment after the door closed shut at which time he gave hermione the shushing sign with his index finger he then slipped out of the curtains hermione was left alone under the covers her heart beating painfully fast she heard the shuffling of ron feet followed by the hasty movement of a curtain and a soft thud that must be harry getting out of bed hermione thought hey harry said hey ron replied neither of them sounded like themselves why haventyou gotten out of bed harry asked suspiciously there was a pause i uh i just couldntsleep well last night so i decided to skive like neville said did you tell him that we were both going to skive lessons harry asked curiously no actually did you no harry replied another pause so why arent you ready for classes ron asked i uh hermione heard more rustling of curtains and another softer thud because of me hermione eyes went wide ginny ginny harry said anxiously what in the bloody hell do you think you re doing in there ron asked heatedly oh no hermione thought sitting up straight we were having wild passionate sex all night ron didntyou hear ginny asked with heated mock innocence blast it ginny harry exclaimed well it none of his business what we do she yelled back what did you do ron asked in a low dangerous growl hermione knew he was directing this question at harry she had to do something harry response to this question could result in many things most of which made hermione stomach squirm hastily throwing the covers off of her she moved the curtains and slid out of bed hermione harry exclaimed in shock hermione ginny echoed with an astonished smile ron turned to look at her his face was already red from his anger at harry and ginny but as he looked at her he heaved a heavy sigh hermione he said in a low whine and then his eyes traveled down from her face and went a bit wide he approached her in twoquick strides his back to his sister and harry he then hastily reached up to button the top button of her nightshirt at the middle of her sternum making her heart leap her face went very hot her buttons were loose on this shirt anyway and all the rolling around she and ron had just done had caused a very curious looking state to her clothing ron arms then dropped down to his sides as he cast her a sheepish look before turning back around to harry what did i do harry suddenly shouted approaching ron until they were a foot apart what did you do harry jabbed at ron chest with his index finger the bright smile ginny had flashed hermione upon her surfacing from the bed faded instantly as she watched harry and her brother glare at one another both of their faces were flushed now harry i swear dont push me right now ron growled harry looked as if he might definitely push him so hermione grabbed hold of both of their arms listen harry she began looking into harry eyes it my fault that we slept together last night and slept together harry cried looking up at ron who rolled his eyes at harry what did you do did you did you actually hermione silently cursed her poor choice of words ron jaw muscle was working furiously and hermione released her hold on harry to grip ron bicep with both of her hands ron looked scornfully at harry do you really think that i would ron face somehow turned an even deeper shade of crimson i would never take advantage of her harry he yelled harry glare lessened slightly as he looked from ron to hermione and back ginny suddenly approached ron and harry opposite hermione no one got lucky alright she exclaimed impatiently for heaven sake hermione and i are both quite pure she finished actually blushing a bit herself ron peered down his long freckled nose at ginny you two really just slept he asked sternly harry opened his mouth to respond but ginny scoffed i didntsay that harry head dropped back and he looked to the ceiling in disbelief at ginny blatant honesty damn it harry ron exclaimed turning his back to his friend he ran his hand angrily through his hair hermione glanced at harry and actually gasped he looked at her suspiciously so she cleared her throat and turned to ron had she seen that green glow again she must be going mad she decided as she approached ron ron she began timidly holding a tentative hand toward him he looked down at her and despite his anger stricken face he grabbed her hand with his and held it gently as she continued we i mean hermione glanced to harry and ginny who were watching and listening intently they probably just snogged a bit you know i mean no more than than we did ron jaw muscle worked a bit more as he looked at her and to hermione relief the corners of his mouth twitched slightly see ginny said suddenly squinting her eyes at her brother hermione right you big hypocrite now can we please take our showers and be off we might can make breakfast if we hurry hermione nodded in agreement and harry and ron looked at one another sorry mate harry said looking down guiltily dontmention it ron mumbled also looking down at his feet hermione nudged him in the side oh um i sorry too ron added hermione caught ginny eye and she had to look away for fear of laughing harry turned to ginny and shook his head at her while he gave her a disbelieving smile she actually looked down looking slightly guilty he approached her and bent down to kiss her gently on her nose ron still had a gentle hold on hermione hand which he began absently stroking with his thumb as he stared at harry and his sister hermione tugged gently on ron hand he looked down at her and she jerked her head toward the door once outside in the stairwell hermione whispered give them a minute okay i going to go on to the showers he nodded at her and brought her hand to his lips for a kiss she smiled at him before making the descent down the stairs well hermione thought as she replayed the course of this morning in her head that was a bit frightening yet well worth the fright i think i left it under hermione looked up to see lavender and parvati entering the portrait hole door her heartbeat faltered they both stopped in their tracks as they looked at hermione who was standing on the last step of the boys dormitory stairwell in her nightclothes lavender looked away quickly and cleared her throat um under the table there yes there it is she said crossing to the coffee table in front of the fire where she retrieved a book on muggle studies hermione waited until the two girls had left hurriedly through the portrait hole before she stepped fully into the common room and headed for the showers things just got a bit more frightening ginny sat with them at breakfast that morning there were still school bags separating her and harry on their bench but ron had the distinct impression that they were playing footsie under the table after all he and hermione were and it seemed that he and harry had the same ideas when it came to intimate moments with their girlfriends brilliant minds think alike ron reckoned sleeping with hermione had been wonderful her body was so warm against him and ron had discovered something he loved to snuggle snogging was amazing obviously but snuggling ah it was blissful he had slept peacefully and soundly throughout the rest of the night with hermione in his arms only to be awoken with her lying on top of him in an attempt to wake him that had been surprising pleasantly surprising and then she had kissed him very deeply he could get used to waking up like that every morning now in the great hall eating and playing footsie ron looked at hermione and smiled what had made last night slumber even better was the fact that his worries over whitman and neville had been mostly exterminated he still felt suspicious of whitman but not of hermione feelings toward the bloke excuse me ron snapped out of his thoughts to hear the faraway voice of luna lovegood she sat down by his side and looked from him to harry i noticed both of your bandages from the hufflepuff table she stated plainly was it the fish ron and harry exchanged looks of slight awe before harry responded yeah detention with snape i know she said almost sadly that why i didnttell you details you wouldnthave been able to do anything about it anyway so why make you worry right you knew that they would have to de spine the lionfish hermione asked curiously as she had not been at the table with them yesterday during luna warning luna nodded serenely that really amazing that you re able to see in that way hermione said with an awkward smile at luna ron knew that luna knew how hermione felt about the quibbler and luna beliefs hermione knew as well and ron could tell that she felt badly about it luna smiled back at hermione and responded with thank you you are very smart and talented hermione looked a bit surprised at this blunt comment but she smiled thank you hermione replied quietly well luna said standing from the table and looking around at them all pleasantly bye she then turned and walked off toward the exit doors that was nice hermione ginny said sincerely hermione shrugged well i ve felt a bit bad for her besides she really is a nice girl hermione said agreeably before taking a bite of her bacon ginny and harry then began carrying on a conversation about quidditch ron actually didntjoin in because he noticed that hermione was no longer responding to their game of footsie he had his foot hooked around hers at her ankle every so often ron would rub his foot against hermione s who then repeated the action but hermione not only wasntresponding to this game she was also staring off into space with a contemplative look hermione ron asked nudging her in the side you alright she looked up at him her thoughtful expression remaining well i ve just been thinking she said casually why would dean be buffing his wand harry and ginny conversation stopped abruptly as ron felt himself choke he coughed a few times before resting his forehead in one hand hermione he said quietly as his face and ears began to burn she could be just as blunt as luna sometimes well why was he she asked again he looked up at her in disbelief hermione he said in exasperation what do you mean why you know why he was hermione he wasnteven really sighing heavily ron looked up at harry whose nose was a few inches from his plate he was moving his food around with his fork ginny was smirking at him hermione however was looking at him with furrowed brows as she shrugged well i sorry ron i ve just never heard of anyone buffing their wand before of course i know some novelty stores make polishes but i ve always heard that they dontreally work at this harry fork suddenly flew out of his hand and hit the stone wall behind him he turned around on his bench and ducked down to retrieve it hermione cast a puzzled look at harry before continuing it not even a big deal but it kind of odd that he would take his wand with him into the shower rooms anyway ron just gaped at her harry was coughing rather loudly now still looking for his fork and ginny was slapping him on the back with an amazed look at hermione hermione ginny began softly are you serious i mean you don t hermione seamus was talking about ginny ron and harry exclaimed together harry had sat straight up and was now turning around on his bench to stare back down at his plate ginny rolled her eyes at them hermione looked utterly confused with a sigh ginny said fine i wonttell her but someone should honestly hermione wha hermione began looking a bit offended along with her confusion she turned a hurt expression to ron first you cover my ears and now i find that i the only one that doesntknow ron hermione just he began slowly grabbing hold of her hand under the table we can we can talk about this later alright ginny actually giggled as she stood to grab her satchel ron shot her a warning look hermione just stared at him with her brows furrowed deeply before they followed ginny lead of preparing to make their way to their first class on the way ron and harry didntlook at each other it was almost as if they thought that if hermione saw them looking at one another she might figure out the answer to her question this was extremely awkward because he and harry had never talked of anything even slightly sexual in front of hermione it was like an unspoken rule of courtesy toward her of course he and harry didnteven talk about such things when hermione was absent either seamus was the only one of their dorm mates that could be so indiscreet with his words and thoughts hermione brow remained furrowed as they took their seats in sinistra classroom ron was positively astounded by her innocence did she really not know surely she had come across the topic in the many books she read didntshe ever read science books ron stomach was squirming with anxiety he would just have to tell her to ask ginny at a time when he and harry werentaround there was no way he could be the one to give hermione the talk sinistra walked in her lips and nails painted deep plum the baccaberrys box was sitting atop her desk so apparently they would be having a practical lesson today ron also noticed that there were three rather large and menacing needles atop their tables she opened the box and motioned with her hand for everyone to claim his or her own hare ron volunteered to get two on his trip to the front of the room so that hermione wouldnthave to bother however once he approached the box of hares he suddenly wished hermione were with him lavender brown and parvati patil were looking at him with strange smiles upon their faces after they d gotten their hares he heard them giggle on their way back to their table he had no idea what that was about but it was a bit odd he returned to his table and handed hermione her hare she had turned in her seat slightly to watch lavender and parvati return to their table with a small scowl on her face she must have seen them giggling and looking at him do i have something on my face or something he asked her curiously hermione looked at him for a moment as if trying to decide whether or not to tell him something just freckles she replied with a smile he returned her smile weakly but her face suddenly went back to frowning ron why wontyou tell me about hermione he said softly just trust me alright i will tell you but not now she nodded at him without looking a bit comforted he fancies ginny weasley ron started at the sound of his sister name coming from a table behind them hermione wrinkled her brow and harry looked up at ron ron glanced over his shoulder it was cho and marietta edgecombe in a seemingly deep conversation they appeared to be whispering but their voices trailed easily to ron ears yes i dontunderstand what he sees in her she so marietta seemed to be having trouble thinking of a proper word gorgeous cho asked snappishly i understand what he sees in her that not the point harry and ron exchanged bewildered looks were they truly not aware that harry could hear them perfectly and how did they know about ginny and harry cho sounded so sure in her statement he fancies ginny weasley of course ron thought with trepidation as he looked at harry whose jaw was set they might not be referring to harry ron looked at hermione who was looking worriedly at harry the point is cho continued despondently he flirted with me all last term and now he just ignores me completely i thought he might ask me this term i mean it is my last year okay ron thought i pretty sure they re not talking about harry harry had definitely not flirted with cho chang to ron knowledge but cho he shh he just come in ron harry and hermione all turned to look over their shoulders at these words their curiosity superseded any concern they might have had over appearing to be eavesdropping entering the door was dean and seamus dean thomas hermione had put a hand to her mouth and ron scooted his chair a bit closer to her he didntwant to be too near harry if he spontaneously combusted harry expression was stony and unreadable however as he turned back around in his seat alright class sinistra began calling ron eyes away from harry today lesson is going to be a tad different than what you re used to in here we are going to be draining and bottling the clear secretions from the baccaberry hares baccaberry secretions act as an anesthetic i have been informed by st mungo hospital that it would be much appreciated if we could help them replenish their supplies there are many casualties and injuries being inflicted daily in our world at the present time so once a week we will devote one class period to milking baccaberrys mixing pain relief potions or any other task i see fit now she continued you may have noticed the bottles and hypodermic syringes on your table i would like for each of you to attempt to fill three bottles of secretion more than three might negatively affect your hare health so simply insert the needle into your hare arm or leg fill the syringe and deposit the secretion into the bottles two of your bottles will be sent to st mungo s while i will allow you to keep one for yourself since the secretions will not be diluted a mere drop will be enough to numb a three to four inch area of skin it is quite helpful when dealing with cuts and lacerations you may begin did you hear that ron harry hermione said leaning in toward them that will come in handy while you two wait for your hands to heal wontit you can put them in your healing kits yeah ron replied absently looking at harry he didntthink his mate had even heard hermione at all harry was staring intently at a random spot on the sterile white table and biting the inside of his cheek ron actually didntknow if harry had even heard sinistra instructions ron turned to frown at hermione who looked quite perturbed harry she began ron shook his head at her she frowned at him before rolling her eyes and reaching for a needle hermione always had good intentions but sometimes she didntknow when to let harry be ron on the other hand knew that harry was in intense thought he was working out everything cho and marietta had said word for word thinking of questions he might like to ask ginny ways he might be able to investigate without appearing suspicious ron hermione and harry worked throughout the hour without talking they were each able to fill three bottles ron had dropped a bit on his hand on accident and hermione had to help him fill his last bottle as he wasntable to use his hand properly after it numbed after class harry left for history of the dark arts with a vague brooding demeanor barely waving to ron or hermione ron then walked hermione to arithmancy on the way they briefly discussed cho and marietta comments i dontunderstand hermione had said i thought ginny had broken off her fling with dean before the summer holiday even got underway ron had informed hermione that his sister and dean had written throughout the summer and it had looked as if they might start dating at the beginning of term however ginny had changed her mind abruptly a few days before classes were to start ron had been suspicious of her abrupt change of heart and he thought it was probably due to her feelings for harry she had tried to overcome them but they had remained so she had turned dean down the only problem with the way she turned him down was that she had given him the reason of i not ready for a relationship right now that was a very open ended refusal to a typical smitten male it simply meant i think i like you but you need to try a bit harder to win me over hermione had scoffed at this saying but that not at all what ginny meant maybe hermione was right but ron knew that it didntmatter he hadntreally learned anything new from cho dean fancied his sister anyone could tell but until today no one had said this out loud ron would never dare mention it in front of harry and harry would never dare mention it at all if he could help it but now ron gave hermione a light kiss before heading for his geography of the magical world class with madam hooch he was a bit anxious because this would be the first time he d seen neville since the library incident the inevitable hour ahead had awkward written all over it and sure enough as soon as ron entered the room he saw neville sitting in the back looking rather peaky he was tapping the desk rapidly and bobbing his knees up and down as hermione sometimes did ron approached the table and sat down slowly without making eye contact who should speak first probably me ron thought with dread neville ron began neville tapping finger and bobbing knees ceased immediately and he looked to ron nervously um i ve talked to hermione about the well about what i saw she told me that she had just helped you find something now that ron thought about it hermione hadntactually told him what neville had been so ecstatic over neville began nodding his head fervently he cleared his throat yeah the bundimun fungus i guess i kind of went overboard when she helped me find the last ingredient i needed to finish my memory potion memory potion ron asked curiously didntshe tell you neville asked before continuing well i making a potion i have a permit to do so and i putting the finishing touches on it you and harry get free samples whenever you like alright oh um alright thanks ron replied with a polite smile although he wasntsure if he wanted to try a potion made by neville he was worse than ron in potions class hey neville ron began hesitantly he suddenly had the urge to do a bit of investigating can i ask you something about edgar whitman neville looked a bit confused but simply nodded i uh have you noticed how he acts around hermione ron asked yeah neville stated plainly he a bit brazen isnthe yeah a bit but i wouldntworry about it too much ron he a bit cheeky with all the girls except pansy who i pretty sure tried to hex him when he tried maybe he more so with hermione but i think it because he respects her intelligence ron merely nodded as an awkward silence fell over them neville comment made him feel better and worse at the same time he was hopeful that whitman was just flirtatious by nature but he didntlike that neville had noted whitman giving hermione extra attention was it truly because of her intelligence ron began glancing around the room as if he might find an idea for something to talk about floating around in the air he actually did there was a notice board on one wall of the class that said flying lessons with madam hooch every tuesday at 2 00 on the quidditch pitch two o clock hey neville ron began slowly this morning um you said that harry and i told you that we were skiving healing but i saw them he said almost apologetically hermione and well ginny i couldntsleep last night i couldntseem to stop thinking about my potion so i kept waking up frequently one of the times happened to be around one am that was ginny the other was around two am well that was hermione ron felt his face and neck burn but he simply nodded and neville began again i know why harry not dating ginny the secret safe with me i think it really noble of him but you ought to tell her not to take the invisibility cloak off until she in the curtains she took it off right after she entered the door that why i saw her kind of spooked me to be honest ron nodded again thanks mate i ll tell her looking down ron pondered over what he was thinking of saying his and neville conversation had already been awkward why not push it about hermione and me we didn t i mean hermione a lady you know i know neville said with a small smile just as madam hooch entered the classroom ron returned neville smile before turning his attention to the front ron was able to enjoy hooch class more than he had anticipated after he and neville had righted their misunderstanding the awkwardness between them only lessened as the hour went by the only thing ron wasnttoo pleased with was the area that they were studying today australia it seemed like a nice enough place but it only reminded ron of whitman they had learned about two magical creatures from the area bunyips and dropbears bunyips were horrible creatures with flippers walrus like teeth and horse like tails that preyed upon human women dropbears however didntactually exist they were merely a tall tale as hooch said they were said to be carnivorous koalas that dropped out of the trees to attack passerby by the time ron left the classroom and headed for the third floor to meet hermione ron had an unpleasing image of whitman dropping down upon hermione during defense against the dark arts whitman was a bit predatory now that ron thought about it and ron couldntstop thinking of what neville had said about him he a bit cheeky with all the girls maybe he more so with hermione but i think it because he respects her intelligence ron decided that during the fifteen minute break he and hermione shared on the third floor he would speak with her about whitman before he left her for magical law ron would have to get this off of his chest as soon as ron saw hermione he dashed toward her and grabbed her hand giving her a weak smile she looked slightly worried and anxious as he began dragging her toward a large stone statue of a gargoyle ron is something wrong she asked urgently he didntanswer her instead he pulled her behind the statue into the shadows they could see those passing by butthey couldntsee them ron would have to remember this spot for later more passionate fifteen minute breaks what was he doing thinking about those things right now with a heavy sigh he looked down at her slightly fearful eyes ron she began hesitantly but he cut her off hermione i ve just talked with neville he said quickly her face fell even more ron you werentmean to him were you he really doesntfancy me what oh no hermione it not that it about ron took a deep sigh neville says that he noticed whitman favoring you above the other girls in the class hermione looked rather taken aback neville said that but ron why would he fancy me i just dontunderstand she said earnestly he frowned at her what do you mean you dontunderstand hermione he asked why could she not fathom this well hermione said suddenly avoiding ron eye there lavender and parvati dontyou think he would fancy them instead no ron stated simply what was she talking about she looked away from him again as she continued it just that they re both much more well flirtatious than you ron guessed with questioning eyes hermione that doesntmatter men like whitman like women that play hard to get i not playing hard to get she said heatedly glaring up at him that not what i meant hermione i mean that if you dontshow any interest in him he ll see it as a sort of game he said quickly her gaze softened oh she said quietly she looked as if she were trying to understand what he d just said but she shook her head and began again well that not what i was going to say about lavender and parvati anyway i was going to say that they re much more again she faltered at this point of the sentence with a deep breath she finished much more attractive than i am and ron actually started laughing low in his throat and he pursed his lips together to try and stop himself what there to laugh about hermione asked sounding slightly heated once more his smile faded a bit and he placed his hands on her waist taking a step closer hermione you really dontunderstand how beautiful you are do you hermione rolled her eyes as she blushed ron that sweet but i know that i not beautiful i m just you re mental ron interrupted shocked she jumped slightly at his exclamation squeezing her waist he leaned down a bit closer to say quietly believe me hermione with you sitting on the front row in his class i d be surprised if he really even seen lavender or parvati hermione gave him a feeble smile before clearing her throat and stating in a serious tone but ron you do believe me when i say that i dontfancy him hermione yes i believe you but would you at least try and and really watch him next time he asked trying not to sound too desperate hermione took his hands from her waist and interlocked their fingers she then closed the small space between them tilted her head back and closed her eyes he leaned down without delay to kiss her when he leaned back she opened her eyes to smile at him i ll watch him she said simply a rush of relief moved through him she ll watch him there was hope maybe she would finally see ron was on the verge of saying thank you when he heard something rather unexpected hermione granger wasntin our room this morning when we woke was she parvati said the voice of lavender brown ron hold on hermione hands tightened as she looked up at him with surprise hermione removed her hands from his and moved to peer through the crevice under the wing of the gargoyle sculpture ron stood directly behind her gripping her waist with his hands as he peered over the top of the wing his heart pounding she wasn t parvati answered and asked some brunette girl that ron thought he recognized as a fifth year ravenclaw well this morning we were on our way to breakfast when i realized that i d forgotten one of my textbooks said lavender excitedly in a whisper parvati added after going back to the common room to fetch it we saw her leaving the boy staircase in her pajamas ron heart leapt into his throat why hadnthermione told him better yet why were these girls running their mouths anger was beginning to pulse quickly through his veins no the ravenclaw girl whispered isnthermione granger that girl that always acting so high and mighty right the bookworm ron gripped hermione waist a bit tighter well she is very smart but she actually quite nice parvati said softly ron actually thought that she was beginning to look uncomfortable yes she nice lavender stated in a bored voice she then continued with wide smiling eyes but i just didntexpect her to be well like that especially with ron i always thought she might have a thing for harry though wait the brunette said which one ron the irish fellow no lavender said he the cute redhead ron felt his face blush and hermione suddenly scooted back against his chest oh the freakishly tall redhead with like fifteen siblings the ravenclaw girl said i mean he is pretty cute but his family mates like mad dontthey i guess he has to get started soon if he wants a big family of his own right lavender giggled while parvati smiled feebly crossing her arms uncomfortably ron encircled hermione waist from behind pulling her completely against him she was trembling he felt absolutely horrible how could he let this happen he should have made hermione go back to her room suddenly hermione pulled away from ron who made to grab her and missed as she stepped out from behind the statue ron heart clenched painfully in his chest as he realized that hermione was trembling out of anger peering over the stone wing he saw that hermione was now face to face with a very horrified looking lavender parvati was red faced and wide eyed and the brunette looked stunned hi lavender hermione said casually although ron knew there was an internal boiling cauldron sitting inside her stomach hermione oh i lavender began shakily which hermione ignored and interrupted lavender i hear there a quidditch game this weekend ravenclaw vs slytherin i was just wondering do you and seamus have your seats reserved under the bleachers ron mouth fell open as did lavender s anger flashed in lavender eyes before she straightened up to her full height she then flipped her hair off of her shoulder and turned to stalk off down the corridor the ravenclaw girl still looked shocked but she quickly turned and headed out of sight without a sound parvati looked at hermione for a moment with an extremely shame faced expression she took a breath as if about to say something but she then quickly ducked her head turned and hurried down the hall after lavender ron was in mild shock he had forgotten about the story ginny had told them last term seamus had been dating that april hannings girl yet two timing her with lavender shaking his head in an attempt to clear it ron reached around for hermione hand and pulled her back behind the statue hermione he began in a near whisper this is all my fault what are you talking about hermione asked sharply he grabbed hold of her arms and slid his hands down to her hands which he held tightly that story they were blabbing it ll pass by every student in days hermione he said gently people are going to think that you and i are well ron hermione began with her head held high it just as much my fault as it is yours we should have been more discreet actually it more my fault i just waltzed right out of the boys stairwell without thinking ron felt miserable but the rumors this is going to i dontcare about rumors hermione said haughtily they can say whatever they like ron felt his heart tighten in anxious remorse she was so innocent she hadnteven had an inkling as to what seamus dirty comment had meant and now her name would be slandered throughout the school as a floozy what had he been thinking by inviting her into his bed gazing down at her she honestly didntlook worried in the least just heated ron sighed and shook his head hermione baby i dontthink you understand what i do understand ron she said softly suddenly hugging him around the neck and resting her head on his chest he wrapped his arms about her as she continued i know what they re going to say about me but as long as the rumors are about me and you i dontcare i mean even if the rumors were true i wouldnthave anything to really be ashamed of would i she lifted her head and looked at him questioningly he was speechless she continued i mean when two people love each other well of course i not saying i want to i just there nothing wrong with well she was turning increasingly rouge as she continued i of course want to remain pure until i married but i ron couldnttake it any longer he bent his head down and kissed her lips softly and lovingly she had no idea the effect her words had just had on him his heart felt so full of emotion for her the excess seemed to be washing through his veins cleansing his soul hermione slowly pulled away kissing him gently on his chin with a sigh she said we better go before you re late for the minister of magic ron smiled down at her squeezing her once more before releasing his hold hand in hand they walked down the hall looking at one another every few steps to speak silent i love you once they reached the door to her ancient runes class ron released her hand she smiled and turned toward the doorway but she stopped abruptly and turned to him oh and just so you know she began with complete seriousness you are not freakishly tall i find your height to be quite attractive and with that hermione entered the classroom and left ron standing in the corridor smiling stupidly like the besotted fool that he was author note oh my that my two syllable review of my chapter lol but what do ya ll think i have been loving your reviews and in response to whether or not i mind combined chapter

violation is intended no profit is being made off this site it is for entertainment purposes only chapter 34 lavender brown was quite frankly a blabbering blatherskite a gluttonous gossipmonger a quick tempered quidnunc it was friday morning and hermione was viciously attacking her mass of untidy wet hair with her comb she d just gotten out of the shower dressed and returned to her dormitory to finish her morning preparations hermione normally enjoyed these duties what better way to start each day than by cleansing however on this particular morning she was nearly shaking with agitation by the time lavender left hermione alone with parvati in order to take her shower the nerve of some people they had blabbed on about something they knew nothing about insulted ron family and then complimented ron appearance hermione actually wasntcompletely sure why this last offense had bothered her but it had made a vein in hermione temple pulse with agitation when lavender had referred to ron as the cute redhead hermione was very proud to be dating ron weasley who was indeed a cute redhead but he was so much more than that and lavender really didntknow him from merlin it really bothered hermione that lavender had complimented ron appearance in the midst of defaming his name what a hypocrite but hermione had truly meant what she d said about not caring about the inevitable rumors mostly she was a bit anxious of having to deal with whispers and stares but she would survive harry had survived much worse rumors so what if the school thought her to be copulating with the man she loved at least they didntthink she was the heir of slytherin hermione could handle the rumors what she couldnthandle was the remark that fifth year girl had made on ron family combined with lavender giggle parvati had looked very uncomfortable after this remark which was why most of hermione anger was focused on the other two girls that ravenclaw girl didnteven know whom ron was until they d told her his hair color yet she had the gall to make that crude comment it was this comment that had caused hermione self restraint to break and she had then been prompted to make her own awful comment about lavender and seamus she had felt immensely better after her vengeful remark until she had been lying in her bed last night and had thought over what she d said she had never said anything like that to anyone before a feeling of guilt for her words had nested in her stomach coupled with anger at not being able to properly enjoy the afterglow of revenge by the time sleep had taken her hermione had actually decided to speak with lavender this morning when the morning came hermione woke early and returned from the showers just as lavender and parvati were waking parvati had whispered a timid good morning but lavender had openly scowled at her and stalked past her toward the showers her nose high in the air this unnecessary behavior had simply enraged hermione had the girl forgotten what she d done to stimulate hermione insult was the girl not the least bit sorry for her gossiping any guilt that remained in hermione stomach had quickly disappeared to be replaced with anger and it was this anger that had hermione viciously combing through her tangles it was quite painful when she caught a particularly stubborn tangle but hermione wanted to leave the room before lavender returned once the tangles were somewhat under control she performed a strong drying charm on her wet locks grabbed her satchel and made for the door however just as she reached for the handle she heard hermione she turned around slowly to face parvati who was looking at a random spot on the floor um parvati began wringing her hands together i know that saying i sorry canttake back what i said but if i could take it back i would hermione nodded and swallowed the rising lump in her throat she chose not to speak she didntwant to let on that she was somewhat hurt by parvati and lavender words and hermione she continued lavvy angry right now but she no right to be angry with me hermione said louder than she d intended parvati looked quite anxious as she continued in a hurried voice i know i know um it just that in a day or two when her pride deflates a bit she ll be sorry too she looked down at her feet after she d finished hermione remained silent not quite certain what to say to this statement she wasntentirely sure that she agreed the scowl lavender gave hermione that morning surely didntlook like it could go away in one or two days if anyone asks me about well what me and lavvy saw i ll tell them that we were mistaken parvati said suddenly hermione sighed slightly she actually felt like laughing at this comment parvati thank you but i think if there to be any damage it already been done she said blandly parvati expectant face fell well what did she expect that ravenclaw girl did after she heard an interesting piece of gossip forget about it not likely plus hermione comment to lavender may have set her on a vengeful path to spread the rumor further i really sorry hermione parvati whispered hermione nodded but she didntlook at her dorm mate for fear that parvati might start crying hermione was appreciative of parvati apology but she didntreally know how to respond after an attempted half smile in parvati direction hermione turned to exit the dormitory it was beginning to feel quite cramped besides lavender would be returning soon hermione would just wait in the common room for the others since she was ready an hour earlier than usual she would just meditate in front of the fire she needed to stop thinking about lavender and parvati if she were to concentrate in her classes today transfiguration hermione thought with a groan she d promised mcgonagall that she would try to have better concentration she really did need to clear her mind but the only thing that could help her do that properly at the moment was the one thing that had messed with her concentration in the first place the only thing that could help her clear her mind was ron hermione had just reached the bottom stair to see ron tall frame stretched out over the sofa his eyes were closed and his brow furrowed his head was lying at one end with his long legs draped over one arm it looked as though he had already showered and prepared for classes his satchel was even sitting atop the coffee table he apparently hadntheard her so she approached him slowly and sat down on the lounge chair beside him ron she tried again he quickly sat up straight swinging his legs off of the arm as he turned to look at her she noticed that his eyes were a bit dark underneath yet he was smiling what are you doing down here at this hour he whispered she smirked at him as she whispered back i was about to inquire the same of you but why are we whispering he looked slightly confused for a moment before smiling at her again and whispering i dontknow she giggled at him as he stood from the sofa where are you she began but he quickly crossed to her and squeezed down beside her on the roomy lounge chair he then slumped down and laid his head upon her shoulder with a tired groan i slept like hell last night he began hermione would ve reprimanded his swear if his warm breath hadntfelt so pleasant on her neck i just decided to get up early and wait for you down here why didntyou use a sleeping potion she asked curiously he popped his head up quickly and looked at her with his mouth partway open i forgot all about the things bloody hell he grumbled ron she reprimanded as she slapped him on the knee now that twice and the morning barely begun he gave her a sultry smile that she guessed was merely intended to be playful but no it was sultry he then placed his arm around her to rest his hand on her upper arm as he leaned in and nibbled softly on her earlobe before kissing her neck and laying his head back down upon her shoulder that not a very fair way to get out of trouble she whispered as chills washed over her he looked up at her with another playful smile it worked though didntit he whispered back their noses were touching oh and why are we whispering again she squinted her eyes at him and pulled her head back slightly you re hopeless he chuckled at her but she continued why couldntyou sleep anyway the adorable smile he had been wearing faded he was silent a moment before he muttered i not sure hermione opened her mouth to press him for a more believable answer but she was interrupted hey you two hermione and ron both looked up to see dean thomas approaching them from the boys stairwell i dontmean to interrupt but well ron i saw you leave early this morning so i thought i d take the opportunity to um ask you something dean said quietly um sure ron replied with a touch of apprehension in his voice hermione wondered if ron were thinking the same thing as she she had a feeling that she knew exactly what dean meant to ask i actually wanted to know if well if harry fancied ginny he said quietly glancing nervously toward the boys stairwell even though hermione had anticipated this question her heart still jumped into her throat ron hand tensed around her upper arm harry fancy ginny ron began in a tone that hermione did not think worthy of a casual manner my my sister you mean no dean hermione answered quickly they re simply good friends well i thought so dean said brightly his nervous expression fading instantly but you never can tell with friends can you he asked wagging his eyebrows at them he then took his wand from his pocket and waved it in the air to create confetti just as whitman had done in class that first day hermione and ron both attempted chuckles and hermione actually wasntthat pleased with the intended nonchalance of her own but dean seemed to be too relieved by her answer to notice well thanks guys guess i better finish getting ready he said as he turned for the stairs see you two in class as soon as dean had ascended the steps ron turned to look at her hermione he whined what she asked hastily they re simply good friends he said with a frown couldntyou have i dontknow betrayed harry trust by telling dean the truth hermione spat heatedly no but made up something that made ginny appear to be unavailable she prompted again yeah he replied with enthusiasm hermione leaned back as far away from him as she could and crossed her arms okay ronald what could i have said you seem to have a brilliant solution so please share your knowledge he stared at her with his brows furrowed for a moment before his eyes went wide and he breathed krum what hermione asked hesitantly viktor krum he exclaimed with wide eyes we can tell dean that ginny talking with krum and that they re dating via owl oh that ridiculous hermione said as she rolled her eyes at him although there was a part of her that thought it might not sound all that ridiculous it was just that the idea of someone dating viktor through the post held a negative undertone with hermione why is it ridiculous he asked suspiciously because hermione began haughtily because she blew a curl out of her eyes and looked away from ron no one dates via owl charlie dated a girl from hong kong for over a year via owl ron argued back charlie went to china hermione asked surprised yeah ron replied with a shrug he was studying chinese fireballs and he he stopped abruptly and raised one suspicious eyebrow at her you re trying to change the subject hermione mouth dropped open as she scoffed ron that is so his eyes suddenly went wide as he interrupted did you and krum date through those letters hermione stomach began to ache no she cried too quickly oh why was she digging herself in this hole she had nothing to hide even though she had been hiding something ron we never dated we just well i mean you kissed him didntyou he cried angrily no hermione cried back impatiently ron we never dated or kissed but i i asked him at one time if he would consider dating me through the post but he said no she finished in a near whisper as she watched the color drain from ron face hermione words had taken the anger out of ron instantly but they had also made him feel intensely sick she asked krum to date her she d never told him that a horrible sinking feeling came over him so am i like ron began his heart beating frantically am i your second choice or something a horrified look appeared on hermione face and she practically flung herself against him he held her to him with her head on his shoulder and her arm around his waist no ron please listen to me she began desperately against his chest viktor was my second choice he was sure she could feel how much harder his heart had begun beating against his chest at these words she lifted her head and looked up at him ron you have always been my first choice but i spent a lot of time thinking that you didnteven know i was a girl our fourth year is when i started telling ginny to move on from harry and start dating other people i guess i thought it was only fair to advise her to do that if i did it too so i only asked him in an attempt to to get over you i never liked him in that way ron released a breath that he d just realized he d been holding so he began slowly looking down at her face he felt the tension leave him slightly at the sincerity in her brown eyes so why did he refuse your offer he wanted to be able to date other people while i was at hogwarts hermione said calmly before taking a breath and looking away from him but well he wanted me to come and live with him in bulgaria after my seventh year as an intern in some sort of post graduate program live with him ron exclaimed his anger returning live with well you didntconsider it did you hermione looked at him and began gnawing her bottom lip not a good sign in ron opinion hermione he began in disbelief how could you have considered something like that ron i hermione began slowly i only considered it because of the opportunity of an internship in bulgaria believe me it had nothing to do with viktor it had nothing to do with the guy that you d just asked to to ron stopped mid question as he realized that the word date was giving him difficulty at the moment i told you that i only asked him that to to get over me yes i know ron said harshly he regretted it immediately at the saddened look that came over hermione face he would ve rather her looked angry hermione i sorry he said softly she looked away from him but he gently took her chin and turned her to face him i believe you alright he added before guiding her face to his alright she whispered against his lips after their kiss i just wish that you would have told me about you asking krum to to ron sighed heavily he still couldntsay that word you know and about him asking you to to he couldntsay that either i just knew how angry you d be she said quietly placing her head on his shoulder hermione ron began suddenly remembering something last term you told me that viktor would cross the line sometimes but you d always set him straight with her head still resting on his shoulder she responded with a soft sigh i decided after the department of mysteries that i wouldntbe going to bulgaria after that night i knew i couldntleave you or harry i told viktor but he continued to ask me about it over the summer when i continued to tell him no he invited me to spend christmas with him he said that i would fall in love with his country if i gave it a chance but i wrote to him and told him that i couldntbecause i d already fallen in love with you ron heart turned over a few times and skipped a few beats in the process you told him that you d fallen in love with me he asked quietly she lifted her head from his shoulder to look up at him yes she answered at the time i didntthink that you felt the same way but it didntmatter to me i knew i couldntmove off and leave you unattended unattended he asked confused she smiled sheepishly before resting her head back down on his shoulder well i think i thought that if i stayed here with you harry and i could be such good friends to you that you wouldntneed anyone else you know and that maybe i wouldnthave to suffer through you falling in love with with some other girl ron felt a lump in his throat at these words hermione really had loved him as he d loved her all that time he pulled her tightly to him and he felt her hand move up his chest as she hugged him around the neck he turned his head slightly toward her and kissed her lightly on the cheek let not keep secrets from one another alright hermione he whispered let always be completely honest i love y her head shot up from his shoulder suddenly and she glared at him ron froze immediately but he then actually looked over his shoulder to make sure that there was no one else standing there that might be receiving this horribly intimidating look but no it was definitely directed at him ron hermione cried suddenly leaning back away from him and lifting her chin with that look that always warned ron to prepare himself for something unexpected and possibly dangerous ron how can you ask me to not keep secrets from you she asked firmly what ron asked in exasperation how can i hermione what gotten into you all of a sudden ron you harry and ginny are all keeping something from me as we speak she said with genuine hurt in her eyes what are you talking about hermione ron asked in total confusion as he absently stroked her arm i know why too she said with a slight quaver to her voice ignoring his question then in a whisper she began again he doing something illegal or or dangerous and you all think i ll turn him in because hermione always so high and mighty and wanting to do the right thing but you never listen to me even though i almost always right like that dagger have you even told harry what you said you would i bet you haven t you still think it a cool dagger even though he found it at the black home she finished in a near hiss ron eyes had to have been the size of snitch when she d finished this unexpected diatribe he realized that hermione had a bottomless memory for everything that ron had ever told her anything he said to her could and would be held against him if he werentcareful were all women like this he shook his head at her as he began hermione what in bl and she interrupted i bet he found some sort of illegal wand enhancement polish or wax that has to be used in water dontlook so shocked ronald did you think i d forgotten well i haven t but dontworry i wonttell anyone what he doing i wonttell anyone that he been going into the shower every morning to try and illicitly enhance his ron hurriedly covered hermione mouth with one hand to stifle her as he quickly glanced around the luckily empty common room she was glaring at him with annoyed bewilderment and trying to take his hand from her mouth with both of her hands he almost chuckled almost he leaned down to her ear and whispered hermione promise not to say what you were about to say out loud and i ll take my hand from your mouth but believe me you dont want anyone to overhear you saying that she growled into his palm and he decided to take that as her promise he leaned back and slowly removed his hand i can not believe you she exclaimed incredulously what in the world do you mean by covering my mouth like that that is just the most hermione seamus wasnttalking about the kind of wand that you re thinking of ron said quickly avoiding her eye her brows furrowed briefly before she gasped so it not illegal polish he gotten an illegal wand it not the one he was waving about earlier is it thank merlin no ron said shaking his head at her hermione seamus was just making a crude joke when he said when he used the phrase buffing your wand a crude joke hermione asked in confusion blimey hermione ron sighed heavily as he leaned in close to whisper a crude sexual joke she leaned away from him with her brows furrowed suddenly however a look of comprehension washed over her her eyes went wide and her hands moved to cover her now gaping mouth ron looked away as his face began to burn with embarrassment although there was a lot of relief mixed in with his embarrassment he was immensely relieved that hermione had comprehended the meaning of the euphemism without further explanation oh i such an idiot she cried as she put her face completely in her hands and leaned forward to rest her elbows on her knees ron kept his arm about her shoulders as he leaned over her you arentan idiot hermione you just didntknow her hands dropped suddenly and she looked at him with wide eyes and harry yesterday i asked you about it in front of harry oh no she groaned as she returned her face to her hands harry probably already forgotten about that ron lied rubbing a hand soothingly over her back forgotten about what ron and hermione both looked up so quickly ron was surprised one of their necks didntsnap harry had just approached them and was now staring at them suspiciously when neither of them answered he simply rolled his eyes ron if you re talking about what cho said i haventforgotten but hermione dontworry yourself over it all right ginny and i talked last night cho hermione said blandly her brows furrowed ron nudged her knee with his and her eyes went wide cho hermione exclaimed in relief harry looked puzzled i mean yes i know that you haventstopped thinking about what she said she replied quickly and um i not going to worry about anything ginny loves you not dean harry nodded with a half smile just as ginny entered from the girls stairwell ron noticed that his sister didntlook too chipper this morning she actually looked very tired as she walked slowly to them her hair seemed to be thrown up in some sort of messy bun with strands falling everywhere and she wasntwearing any make up so ron began as his worried gaze left his sister to fall on harry what did you two talk about exactly i mean what do you two plan to do about about him ginny scowled at harry as she responded when confronted by dt as we shall call him in code be polite but not flirtatious avoid being alone with him and if it gets out of hand simply tell him that i not interested she said in a singsong voice does that sum up your latest list of guidelines for me harry she spat before abruptly turning for the portrait hole door ron stared after his sister as she marched out of the common room her loose hair falling down even more from its bun ron quickly stood from the chair and reached a hand down to help hermione up i sorry mate he muttered to harry who was staring after ginny with a deep frown i shouldnthave asked no harry grumbled without taking his eyes off of the exit you shouldnthave he then tightened his grip on his satchel and stalked off toward the door ron exchanged a look with hermione before he gripped her hand tighter they then set off in pursuit of their two quarreling friends the morning had already taken some unexpected twists and it didntseem to be getting any less interesting on their way to the great hall they passed colin and dennis creevey huddled in one corner of one of the landings their heads were together and dennis was showing his brother some pictures harry didntgive them a second glance but ron craned his neck slightly to see if he could catch a glimpse of what they were looking at so suspiciously colin saw him however and grabbed the pictures from dennis hands shoving them in a pocket of his robes what that about hermione whispered beside him ron shrugged as he watched the creevey brothers hurriedly climb the stairs for some reason their covertness had bothered him a bit okay ron thought tiredly i going to have to make it through the rest of this day with a mere hour of sleep behind me i donthave time to worry about two titchy kids and their strange habits ron hadnttold hermione the reason for his lack of sleep but it was completely her doing of course not in a way that angered him it just frustrated him he had slept through wednesday night with her in his arms and he had slept better than he could ever remember sleeping and then the next night he was supposed to just go back to sleeping with his pillow which didnthave even one of hermione beautiful curves well he couldntdo it and he couldnttell her why he had insomnia either knowing hermione she would offer to sleep with him and ron couldnttake the chance that he wouldntbe able to say no it was his fault in the first place that the inevitable rumors would begin to spread he d invited hermione into his bed allowed himself to fall asleep and allowed her to just walk right out of his dormitory in her pajamas he might not be able to reverse his blunder but he could prevent it from growing although ron thought sadly as he looked at harry troubled expression it looked as if someone had a growing blunder of their own breakfast was awkward just awkward that was the best word for it ginny was pouting and barely eating anything harry was completely expressionless and silent ron was incredibly antsy as if he wanted to say something a few times he had even opened his mouth to speak but quickly closed it again and as for hermione she felt as if she couldntlook harry in the eye so she guessed it was good that he was entranced with his plate the more hermione thought about her misunderstanding of seamus comment the more she remembered snippets of yesterday morning breakfast chat she had just gone on and on about it no wonder harry had been extra quiet around her the whole day of course now he was being quiet for a different reason a reason that actually disturbed hermione more than embarrassment between herself and harry obviously ginny still wasnthappy with the fact that harry wanted to keep their feelings hidden hermione had thought that she would grow accustomed to it but it seemed as though she only grew more edgy with each passing day and it was only a week into the term i have an idea ron said suddenly calling everyone attention to him hermione nudged him under the table with her foot but he trudged on ginny i know what you can tell people to get dean to leave you alone ron hermione began apprehensively she really didntthink it was a good time for him to talk about this matter with harry and ginny a better time might be when at least one of them regained the ability to smile no i want to hear this ginny said with slight interest harry looked doubtfully at ron rather eagerly ron explained his idea of creating a false relationship between ginny and viktor the whole while hermione was watching harry and ginny expressions after ron had finished harry had his eyebrows raised slightly as if considering it but ginny interested expression had faded to something that looked almost like boredom it wontwork ginny said plainly why not ron and harry asked in unison because everyone that reads quidditch today knows where krum eats how many showers he takes every day and especially who he currently dating she replied that not true ron said in exasperation i ve been a subscriber since i could read and i ve not once read anything about krum girlfriends that because you dontread the gossip columns in the back ron ginny said impatiently well who does ron asked testily no one cares about those rumors unfortunately people do care about those rumors ginny said with a sigh hermione stomach cramped slightly at the word rumors and she glanced down the table to see lavender and parvati eating with their usual crowd of friends and ginny continued with a sigh dean happens to be one of those people that care about that rubbish he used to drive me mad always talking about ginny voice trailed off at the uncomfortable look on harry face anyway ginny said after clearing her throat it just wontwork what if harry began quietly what if we just made up a person you know just some random joe or john yeah ron breathed we ll tell him you re dating some prat that fred and george met one day at their shop or something we could make up a whole story about him and no one would ever know ginny looked miserable it wontwork you two she said quietly ron sighed heavily and looked to harry in disbelief at his sister stubbornness why harry asked calmly because she began as she played nervously with her fingers dean has always been able to tell whether or not i lying he ll just know and and i dontwant to lie to him he still my friend harry looked at her a moment before sighing and looking down at his plate dontroll your eyes at me harry ginny said sternly it not my fault that hey guys dean called merrily hermione looked up to see the one person that they all least wanted to see at the moment coming to stand directly behind ginny whose eyes had gone a bit wide before any of them could properly return his greeting dean leaned over ginny placing his hands on the table top on either side of her hermione saw her tense as he leaned down to whisper something in her ear hermione knees began bobbing up and down as she anxiously watched dean and ginny hermione chanced a glance at harry and gasped harry didntseem to notice seeing as how he was burning a hole through the wooden table with his glare but ron grabbed her hand under the table and quickly leaned in to whisper urgently you saw it too hermione turned her head to look at him with wide eyes yes she whispered back his eyes you ve seen it before ron nodded at her as he gnawed on the inside of his cheek do you think he knows he asked under his breath hermione shrugged but she then leaned in a bit closer to whisper we ve got to ask him about it ron nodded at her again but as an afterthought hermione added let wait until lunch alright harry got enough to worry about throughout today classes she then gave ron a peck on his cheek and took a piece of his toast so they didntlook too suspicious when hermione looked back up at ginny dean was leaning back away from her ginny then gave him a small smile and nodded he beamed at her before walking off to join seamus who was waiting for him at the double doors exiting the great hall after watching him leave ginny sighed and rested her head in one hand he having trouble in potions and he wants me to help him with an essay over the weekend i didntknow he had trouble in potions hermione stated absently watching harry to see if his eyes would glow again i didntknow we had an essay for the weekend ron added with a scowl harry rolled his eyes at them we don t he stated darkly before turning to ginny so where the date ginny turned to him with a glare dontstart harry she said through gritted teeth well you know he doesntwant to study harry replied we wontleave the common room she spat as she stood up to grab her satchel you re acting like i did something wrong harry i would have loved to have told him no but that would have upset you more ginny i told you that if it got out of hand to tell him flat out that you arentinterested harry said firmly looking up at her i consider him asking you to join him in a private study session that we all know he doesntneed to be out of hand harry looked away from her then ginny reached up with one hand and took her hair down from a loose bun she then slammed the golden butterfly barrette harry had given her for christmas down on the table in front of him he picked it up slowly and gazed back up at her you can keep that until you decide to stop playing this game with me she whispered with tears in her eyes i trying to play by your rules but i cantdo it anymore he started to reach for her but he stopped himself and placed his head in his hand she swallowed rather hard before turning on her heel and stalking hurriedly out of the great hall harry stood to grab his satchel so hermione and ron followed hermione heart was hurting for harry and ginny both she understood why harry would not publicly date ginny but she could also see how hard it was on ginny hermione was beginning to question whether or not their secret relationship was for the best at the top of the stairs leading down into the dungeon hermione glanced over at harry his jaw was working but hermione eyes then went to his hand which was closed tightly about his satchel strap she hastily grabbed his wrist harry she said attempting to pry his hand out of a fist from which a thin line of blood was trickling down harry looked down and released his grip from his strap holding his bloodied palm up hermione saw ginny barrette lying in the middle of his shaking hand hermione took out her wand and uttered a healing spell on his palm and a cleaning spell on the bloodstained barrette i cantsee snape right now harry muttered darkly as he placed the barrette in his pocket i skiving harry hermione began quietly but he turned and headed straight for the grand staircase hermione felt a single tear roll down her cheek as she watched him go ron squeezed her hand gently as he urged her to follow him down the cold stone stairs author note hey everyone i back but unfortunately this chapter isntas long as i d like it 6000 words but if i finished their day it would have been like 12 000 and i didntwant to keep you waiting any longer for new material so i hope i ve given you all a bit to chew on while i begin work on chapter 35 which i promise will be more juicy maybe it wonttake me too long to get back into the flow thanks everyone for being patient while i was on vacation i had a good time in st louis and i went up in the arch for the first time i afraid of heights but luckily i made it back to solid ground without hyperventilating lol well i off to write thank you readers and reviewers the characters and situations of harry potter depicted in this story are the legal property of j k rowling bloomsbury and aol time warner and have been used without permission no copyright violation is intended no profit is being made off this site it is for entertainment purposes only author note okay i finally figured out what i d done wrong with the postings of chapters 34 and 35 and i think i ve fixed it so this is a new chapter for a day it was just chapter 34 repeated but now it the real chapter 35 so please read and enjoy author note part ii um thank you to for informing me of the um rather inappropriate alteration of the spelling of the word shoulder i have fixed that in this version of chapter 35 so yeah lol chapter 35 hermione transfigured her third quill into a perfectly formed silver needle and she had no idea how she managed it she felt as if she had less concentration than she d had in her last two transfiguration classes however this time her lack of concentration was not related to the handsome man sitting by her side who was not even attempting to concentrate in the least this time hermione was confounded by the recent turn of events between harry and ginny ginny had just given harry that barrette back and told him that she couldntplay by his rules anymore was that spoken out of anger or was she truly unwilling to continue to play by harry rules and what did that even mean hermione honestly could not imagine harry without ginny in his life or vice versa for that matter now that they fully realized their love for one another how could either of them deny it surely ginny hadntmeant that she would not even secretly date harry that was just too awful to think about hermione was reminded of that horrid week at grimmauld place in which ginny quit eating because of harry refusal to be with her surely she wouldntput herself through that torture unless of course the torture of being in a secret relationship with harry was worse than no relationship with him at all but that was absurd but it wasntso absurd that the idea of it wasntdriving harry mad he never skived lessons but he did not go to potions nor had he shown up for charms or transfiguration it was probably for the better that harry did not face snape today who seemed to be feeling especially cruel he had reminded ron of his detention for this evening as soon as he d laid eyes upon him hermione and ron had both forgotten that ron had two more assigned detentions ahead of him so hermione spent most of potions worrying over what horrid task snape had set for ron would he make him endure more painful labor like the de spining of the lionfish ron hand still wasnthealed from wednesday hermione guessed that there was a subconscious part of her that wanted to ensure that mcgonagall was not disappointed in her work for the third time in a row for there was no other fathomable way she could be doing so well with mcgonagall assignment with the current worries she had roosting in her mind as hermione began the incantation on her fourth quill a soft snoring interrupted her she looked to her right and saw that ron had dozed off with his cheek resting on his fist ron hermione whispered urgently as she placed her hand upon his knee under the table and shook it gently his head shot up quickly as he muttered something that sounded like chocolate frogs he then looked at her with a rather puzzled expression was i dreaming he asked quickly looking a bit anxious for some reason i dontknow if you were dreaming hermione began with one eye on mcgonagall but you were sleeping and i dontthink this is the place to catch up on your sleepless night ron he sighed heavily and picked up one of the needles hermione had transfigured so he began in a bored voice we re turning these into quills hermione rolled her eyes at him and began explaining the lesson to him under her breath she demonstrated it for him more so because she wanted to remain inconspicuous than because she actually thought he needed a visual aid however she must have really been concentrating on her transfiguring because she was startled when she heard a snippy voice from overhead mr weasley hermione looked up slowly to see mcgonagall peering down at ron with a disapproving pursed lip frown yes professor ron asked in a voice that sounded as if he d just eaten something rotten mrs granger is doing an exemplary job today and i sure she would appreciate it if you d listen to my instructions at the beginning of the class period so that she would not have to recite them to you multiple times throughout the hour she responded in one long breath yes professor ron replied as he scooted his chair a couple of inches away from hermione and picked up a quill mcgonagall nodded and took a deep breath before saying in a somewhat secretive tone i hope that you have plans to begin busying your team with practices starting next week i hear that hufflepuff has a promising group of players this term i would hate for a pitiable year of quidditch to affect your performance in my class mr weasley ron looked quite taken aback but he straightened up in his seat well professor i wasntsure if we would be allowed to use the pitch after four pm with the new rules and all of course you can she replied briskly as long as you hand in a schedule of your practices at the beginning of each week clearing her throat she added now please mr weasley that enough idle chatter about quidditch resume your work hermione watched her walk to the next table and peer over the frustrated scowling face of seamus finnigan who seemed to have turned his quill into a nettle instead of a needle he had apparently pierced himself with one of its thorns as he was sucking on his thumb the rest of the class period resulted in three more exceptional needles from hermione and two very nice needles from ron since he had been cheered up considerably by his chat with mcgonagall on their way down to the first floor for defense against the dark arts hermione turned to ron and asked anxiously do you think harry will show ron yawned a rather large yawn before responding with a casual shrug and an i dontknow hermione she wasntmuch satisfied with his answer actually it quite irked her for some reason harry absence and his and ginny spat had really bothered hermione you dont know hermione repeated as she mocked his shrug are you not the least bit concerned over harry or your sister ron frowned at her well hermione ginny was just angry with harry at breakfast she not really going to break it off with him believe me i watched her drool over him for five years she wontbotch it up now botch it up hermione said in slight disbelief she not botching anything up she just not happy with the mixed messages harry giving her his messages dontseem all that mixed to me ron replied calmly hermione sighed heavily and walked the rest of the way with a good two feet between them and her lips pursed why was he acting so unconcerned ginny had left the great hall in tears and harry had been too upset to notice that he was cutting into his hand with a metal barrette and what did ron mean his messages dontseem all that mixed ginny we cantact like we re dating but nothing else in our relationship will change ginny you canteat with us all the time yes you can ginny be nice to dean but not flirtatious no ginny not like that it made hermione head hurt just thinking about it she knew harry was only doing it because he cared greatly for ginny safety but still it was enough to make anyone go mad and ron was acting like there was nothing wrong with anything he didnteven seem worried that harry had just skived three full class periods which to hermione recollection had never happened before hermione could feel ron eyes upon her as they continued to their next class but she didntlook at him she was just so miffed about his flippant attitude however once they d reached the landing of the first floor he unexpectedly grabbed her hand and pulled her into the corner nearest the doubled archway leading from the entrance hall to the classroom corridor hermione he began taking both of her hands in his i ve been thinking tonight i ll say something to harry about that dagger and about how he been treating this situation with ginny alright hermione gazed up into his concerned blue eyes and quite without warning she lowered her head and burst into tears ron immediately bent down to peer into her face with a frantic look of desperation ah damn me to hell he said under his breath as his hands left hers to stroke her arms ron she reprimanded in a choked sob looking up into his still frantic expression i sorry hermione i wontsay anything to harry alright he said soothingly hermione couldntspeak so she simply shook her head in an attempt to tell him that he was mistaking the meaning of her tears no okay so you do want me to not tell him or no he looked up to the ceiling temporarily before quickly looking down at her and squeezing her upper arms is this about me falling asleep in transfiguration he asked almost hopefully she continued to shake her head and his shoulders slumped slightly blimey hermione just tell me what to do and i ll do it alright hermione tears slowly began to subside so she took a deep breath and attempted to speak ron i just crying because she swallowed another rising lump in her throat before whispering i l love you s so m much his confused frown turned into the most endearing smile ever hermione he said through a deep chuckle as he pulled her to him with his arms tightly about her he kissed her gently on her cheek i love you too he whispered low in her ear she wrapped her arms as tightly as she could about his waist as she continued to cling to him hermione tried to understand where that strange outburst had come from she had been almost as startled over it as ron she guessed that spending over two hours worrying about the possibility of two of her best friends splitting up and denying their love for one another had stressed hermione to the limit the limit that was breakable by ron sincere concern for her obvious annoyance at him on the way to the first floor she could only imagine the thoughts he must have had as he attempted to understand why she was angry with him he seemed to have come to the right conclusion as he had offered to speak with harry over his treatment of ginny ron still amazed her sometimes with the many ways he showed his love for her which brought hermione to the realization of another reason for her tears the current dispute between harry and ginny had made hermione really appreciate her love with ron she was so glad that she and ron had a relationship that they didnthave to hide any longer oi there let keep our halls nice and clean hermione and ron pulled away from one another to see whitman just arriving on the landing from the staircase he had been smiling smugly but as he looked at them his eyes went wide bluey is that you and miss granger he asked in disbelief as he approached them with a flashy smile you two cracking on each other he asked in surprise but when neither of them answered he turned to ron well from one man to the next defense against the dark arts can only get you so far he said in mock seriousness and then pointing to hermione with his thumb he added with sheilas hermione was surprised to see a hesitant yet genuine smile from ron yeah ron said quietly before looking to hermione she keeps me on my toes whitman and hermione both chuckled a bit but then hermione looked to ron and had a sudden urge to do something actually hermione said playfully you keep me on mine he raised his eyebrow at her as she approached him and stood on her tiptoes to kiss him on the cheek oh i think she got you there mate whitman said as he chuckled you ve got him grinning like a shot fox miss granger hermione smiled sheepishly but ron simply stared at hermione with a silly grin which was of course her intention she knew showing affection toward ron in the presence of whitman would thrill him or at least make him feel a bit more comfortable well whitman began as he slapped ron on the back i think i ll rack off on that note he then moved past them to head for his classroom still chuckling slightly keep him on his toes miss granger he called over his shoulder after whitman left the entrance hall for the corridor ron smile broadened she beamed at him and it looked as if ron were about to say something but he was interrupted by a loud cackling they both turned toward the staircase to see peeves the poltergeist floating down the stairs quickly pursued by ginny she was waving her fist at him and shouting give it back hermione then noticed that peeves was holding what looked like a satchel just above ginny reach peeves stopped right in the middle of the entrance hall giving hermione and ron a perfect view from their corner in the corridor ginny was now jumping for her satchel but to no avail the next horrible set of events happened in quick succession too quick for hermione to really even consider trying to aid ginny in retrieving her bag the whole while hermione and ron were just staring at the scene from the safety of their corner yet hermione still felt as if she would be wise to conjure a shield around her and ron as ginny continued to jump at peeves dean thomas came down the stairs to the landing surveyed the scene and then proceeded to smile from ear to ear like a shot fox as whitman would say dean then approached ginny and began jumping for her bag along with her unfortunately peeves only flew higher although hermione had no idea what would happen next she found herself hoping that harry would actually skive defense against the dark arts as well however her hopes were unfulfilled as harry appeared on the landing from his descent of the staircase mere seconds later harry looked from ron and hermione still huddled in the corner to ginny and dean still jumping for the satchel his stare was one of frustration and just plain stress harry remained by the stairs as he too became a member of the audience which seemed to be growing there were now students gathering about the entrance hall watching in either amusement or sympathy only a few students actually entered the classroom harry moved partway behind the banister of the stairs and hermione was fairly sure that ginny had not even seen him enter wheee shouted peeves as he did a couple of flips in mid air to dodge a rather large jump from dean which actually got close to making contact with ginny bag oh almost caught it did you peeves taunted peevesy too quick peevesy too clever oh just forget it ginny cried in frustration as she roughly pushed her long strands of hair from her face and shoulders dean continued to jump for it is wee wittle weasley going to pout peeves asked in a singsong voice pouting shantget you your sack pouting shantget you nothing wittle weeper give us the bag peeves dean said impatiently as he too stopped jumping dean then looked down at ginny with a somewhat timid smile as he said let me just give you a boost alright before she even had time to answer he reached down and gripped a startled ginny by the hips and hoisted her up into the air a few bystanders whooped harry wasntone of them actually he now had his head ducked low ginny looked as if she might yell for dean to put her down but she glanced upward and saw how very close to the cackling peeves she now was she swiftly reached for her bag and actually got a firm hold on one of its straps but she lost her balance in the process with a gasp she wrapped her arms tightly about dean neck to keep from falling backward but dean must have seen this as an invitation to kiss her because he did peeves blew a raspberry at them and flew up through the ceiling apparently bored with them now that ginny had retrieved her bag hermione thought she heard a muttered damn from ron and a few low whistles from some bystanders but her gaze was on dean and ginny ginny hastily removed her hands from his neck and pushed on his chest he took his mouth from hers and looked down at ginny shocked expression he too appeared startled at what he d just done but he didntremove his hands from her which had somehow moved to her waist suddenly however dean gasped and pulled his hands away from her as if he d just been burned he looked at ginny and then down at his hands in slight shock and even took a step back hermione immediately looked over to harry who was in the same partially concealed spot behind the banister but who was now squatting on the ground with his head in his hands ron hermione whispered urgently as she pointed to harry ron brows furrowed as he looked from harry to dean hermione was almost positive that harry had just mildly cursed him ginny wasted no time in reaching down to the ground for her satchel which hermione actually couldntremember falling from ginny grasp she then slung it over her shoulder and all but ran for the stairs dean was frowning after her but he was still occasionally looking down at his hands with confusion when ginny reached the landing she ran straight up the stairs without a glance at harry squatted form hermione didntthink that ginny even saw him or knew that he had witnessed the entire thing suddenly hermione heard a wheezing sound and looked up to see that dean was clutching at his chest and taking big gasping breaths of air or trying to his face was contorted into a panicky gape hermione seemed to have lost all ability to move or speak as she was glued to the spot watching in horror it seemed that most of the onlookers were suffering from the same stunned silence although some were whispering fiercely and pointing in confusion toward dean looking around at them all hermione saw someone standing in one darkened corner malfoy he was watching the scene with intense interest seamus had run out of the crowd in the adjoined corridor to stand beside dean with a terrified and helpless expression dean he was shouting at his friend ron suddenly ran past her toward harry who was still squatting on the ground his head in his hands harry ron shouted leaning down over harry and gripping him by the shoulders now everyone in the hall had noticed harry crouching form everyone was looking from ron and harry to dean who had now fallen to the floor on his back his wheezing continued at a complete loss as to what to do hermione ran to dean and knelt on his other side opposite seamus who was now kneeling as well what he doin to im seamus shouted at her angrily she simply looked at him as tears began stinging her eyes she didntrespond but instead looked down at dean panicked face dean she cried what should she do hermione grabbed his hand and he held it tightly there were now tears his eyes which were staring into hers with fear she placed her free hand on his forehead and he was freezing cold yet sweating ron do something hermione screamed harry stop ron began shouting but harry remained squatted in the floor with his head down suddenly neville surfaced from the crowd of students and ran to ron side harry ron shouted again i trying harry bellowed in a strangled voice ron looked at neville and they each bent down to grab hold of harry arms however they couldntseem to lift him what all this chinwagging about out here it sounds like a herd of hermione looked up to see whitman standing in the door to the entrance hall with wide eyes on her and dean hey he shouted ashis eyes moving to harry ron and neville whitman pushed through a group of students and began running toward them but he stopped in his tracks as harry shot up from the ground knocking ron and neville to the floor quite a few people screamed then including hermione harry had one hand over his face as he backed up against the wall but his hand couldntconceal the green light emitting from his eyes the green glow was so bright it could be seen through the spaces between harry fingers what the f whitman breathed before shouting everyone get inside the classroom he then retrieved his wand and pointing it at harry he muttered something no one obeyed his order to leave the scene they all continued to stare as a blue translucent orb encircled harry harry hand then fell from his eyes and hermione saw them fully his eyes they looked just as they had in his animagus form there were no pupils just green glowing globes more people screamed and she suddenly felt faint nonetheless she kept her hold on dean hand who had stopped wheezing and was now coughing and breathing heavily now however harry was clutching at his own chest and wheezing hermione stood from dean and ran to whitman what happening she cried through tears ron stood from the ground and ran to her make it stop hermione screamed as harry kneeled back down to the ground stop you bloody ron shouted at whitman look what you re doing to him whitman hand was shaking as he held his wand on harry it not supposed to ah he dropped his arm and grabbed at his wrist as soon as he did so the blue orb faded and hermione heard a yell from dean who again began clutching at his chest and wheezing even seamus eyes were glossy as he looked back down at his friend ah whitman shouted as he jabbed his wand in harry direction a red light shot forth and impacted with harry chest harry let out a low groan before crumpling the rest of the way to the ground unconscious no hermione screamed making to run to him ron caught her around the waist and held her back hermione it s it not safe ron said in a strange low quavering voice whitman approached harry and bent down to lift him up in his arms he then took a few steps toward the opposite end of the hall as his classroom before stopping and calling uh cl class dismissed he then hurriedly carried harry toward the hospital wing hermione looked up at ron who released his hold around her waist grabbed her hand and followed so you two are telling me that his eyes started glowing because he was crook with a poltergeist ron and hermione exchanged tired glances whitman had taken harry straight to madam pomfrey who was currently tending to his still unconscious form stretched out on a bed whitman had then sent for dumbledore and begun an interrogation on ron and hermione while they waited peeves can be rather annoying you know ron replied trying to sound convincing whitman just gave him a very disbelieving stare what was he supposed to say he couldnttell him the truth he couldnttell him that harry was mad at dean for kissing ginny because that would give away harry feelings although ron highly doubted that the bystanders that had watched the entire scene hadntbecome suspicious of harry and ginny whitman hadntseen the kiss he d just seen dean thomas suffocating and harry glowing but for those that had seen the kiss wouldntit be easy for them to piece together that bit of information with harry attack i ve never seen that happen over a prankster chyacking whitman exclaimed dumbledore told me that harry was learning some advanced magic but what in the bloody hell was that oh and hazza was attacking that thomas fellow not that peeves larrikin but he wasntattacking him on purpose hermione said standing up from the bed next to harry s where she and ron were seated and stamping her foot whitman sighed and turned his back on her but ron grabbed hermione hand and urged her to sit back down beside him which she did grudgingly she turned toward ron and crossed her arms he didntattack him on purpose she said with tears welling in her eyes of course he didn t ron said soothingly as he scooted a bit closer to hermione on the bed and put his arm around her waist he kissed her lightly and she then rested her head on his shoulder the only problem with ron soothing words was the fact that he didntreally know whether or not they were true what would ron have done if he had witnessed someone kissing hermione during his and hermione brief secret relationship ron wouldnthave been surprised if his eyes had glowed as well when ron had approached harry kneeling form and touched him harry had been very warm to the touch and when harry had stood ron had felt some sort of invisible push throw him to the ground as whitman had said what in the bloody hell was that alright madam pomfrey said suddenly standing up straight from harry peaceful form he should wake in a few more minutes wake whitman asked in disbelief turning around to face the beds again have you got kangaroos loose in your top paddock madam pomfrey pursed her lips and stood up straighter the headmaster has asked that he be woken he wishes to speak with him she said firmly and then thrusting a bottle of pink potion into whitman hands she added here make sure potter drinks this when he wakes it an energy restorative potion she then briskly headed for the door and exited making sure it closed softly behind her whitman sat the potion down rather hard on harry bedside table energy restoration the silly codger not only does he want him awake he wants to make sure he got heaps of energy hermione scoffed and turned her body away from whitman ron squeezed his arm a bit tighter around her waist but he didntsay anything he sort of shared whitman concern what if harry was still unable to control his power when he awoke should they give him more energy to work with where was dumbledore ron needed some answers suddenly there was a quick knocking on the door before it opened with a creak dumbledore stuck his white bearded head in slowly before pushing the door open a bit more to enter oh bonzer headmaster you re here whitman said approaching him with his hand outstretched holy dooley dumble whitman began as dumbledore took his hand whitman suddenly stumbled however as to ron surprise ginny walked in with deep concern knotting her forehead dear whitman finished with a small smile as he looked at ginny actually it pronounced dumble dore though i once thought of changing it to dumb lay dore dumbledore said calmly as whitman absently shook his hand his eyes still on ginny dumbledore continued after whitman released his grip sounds a bit french doesntit nice country france you re miss weasley correct in my fifth years class hey bluey is this lovely blue sheila your sister whitman asked completely ignoring dumbledore babble yeah she my sister ron stated with unconcealed bitterness ginny turned around from softly shutting the door behind her and then looked up at whitman in confusion he approached her and held out his hand in greeting ginny didnttake whitman hand and he sort of shrugged before placing both hands on his hips your sister whitman said after clearing his throat and flashing ginny a winning smile well she a beaut isntshe ginny blushed yet furrowed her brows at him edgar let all have a seat shall we dumbledore asked calmly as he cast whitman a barely detectable glance of amusement he then conjured five plush purple lounge chairs ron and hermione rose from the bed and took two of the seats dumbledore sat down gracefully in the largest of the five and whitman sat down with a half shrug ginny however glanced from harry to dumbledore may i sir she asked quietly dumbledore nodded serenely at her ginny then turned to harry and slowly approached him she sat down gently on the edge of the bed and peered over his sleeping face tears abruptly began falling from her eyes hermione made to stand but ron grabbed her wrist as dumbledore held his hand up to stop her she slowly sat back down whitman looked a bit baffled as he stared at ginny and harry ginny leaned down to rest her forehead on harry s placing her hands on his chest suddenly ron saw harry hand twitch slightly before he reached up and took hold of one of ginny hands she raised her head and ron saw that harry eyes were now open and they werentglowing anymore ginny took his glasses from the side table and placed them on harry face before kissing him on his forehead on his scar she then wiped at her eyes harry sat up and swung his feet off the edge of the bed so that he was sitting hip to hip with ginny he was still fully dressed in his robes dumbledore vanished the armchair that had been intended for ginny and softly cleared his throat how are you feeling harry he asked calmly harry looked around at them all before looking down somewhat shame faced alright i guess he muttered oh yeah hazza whitman said suddenly snapping his fingers together you re to down that pink juice he indicated to the potion ginny reached for it and handed it to harry who took a sip he looked to whitman as he swallowed and said blandly you stunned me or cursed me or something whitman smiled at harry apologetically well i was afraid they d throw you in azkaban if old thomas carked it a worried expression replaced whitman smile ah shite did anyone send for dean you just left him in the harry began frantically making to stand from the bed dumbledore held his hand up to harry and interrupted him no no he said shaking his hand slightly he been sent for and madam pomfrey has agreed to tend to him in her office since you and he seem to be at odds with one another dumbledore replied nonchalantly harry simply nodded absently placing his hand on ginny knee he drank some more of his potion squinting his eyes as he swallowed dumbledore suddenly turned to whitman oh and edgar he began calmly i do ask that my staff keep their language clean around my students whitman looked confused for a moment before a dawning look came over him certainly beg your pardon headmaster he said politely dumbledore nodded and then gave a small sigh before stroking his beard absently i think he began slowly his gaze moving to harry that we should discuss a few things ron noticed hermione sit up a bit straighter in her seat as dumbledore continued now i have been told that a seemingly uncontrollable power caused your eyes to glow green which somehow hindered mr thomas ability to breathe properly correct harry ron and hermione all nodded ginny looked worriedly at harry well dumbledore began what is the rest of the story sir harry began slowly if that is all of the story that you know why did you bring along ginny ginny looked curiously at dumbledore as if she hadntconsidered this as of yet dumbledore took a deep breath before beginning harry i have known for some time that your feelings for mrs weasley run deeper than that of two friends how ginny asked quietly have we forgotten your brief courtship while at grimmauld place dumbledore asked peering over his half moon spectacles at ginny and harry oh yeah ginny responded as harry blushed but you still didntknow that harry was angry at dean kissing ginny hermione said suddenly dumbledore inclined his head just slightly and raised his eyebrows well that makes more sense than that yabber about the ghost whitman exclaimed with his eyes wide dumbledore looked to whitman with his eyebrows still raised and whitman leaned back in his seat with an almost embarrassed expression is that what happened then dumbledore asked with interest turning to harry he then clasped his hands tapping the tips of his index fingers together hmm i see well i believe that my suspicions must be correct no one spoke everyone seemed to be sitting on the edges of their seats waiting for dumbledore to continue ron wanted to stand up and scream what what suspicions but he didn t of course suddenly dumbledore stood from his chair and vanished it he then took a seat on the edge of the bed across from harry and ginny harry is there anyone present that you would like to leave before i divulge my suspicions of this ordeal dumbledore asked harry looked around the room very briefly before shaking his head no he didnteven pause on whitman which slightly surprised ron but ron reckoned whitman already knew enough to where a bit more information wouldntmake much of a difference harry in the prophecy dumbledore began but ron coughed loudly causing the headmaster to turn a questioning look at him um sorry sir but the prophecy ron began casting a furtive glance at whitman i mean do you think it alright to edgar is in the order mr weasley dumbledore responded good naturedly he joined last summer after i d hired him oh well still ron said avoiding looking at whitman who was remaining silent he felt awkward displaying his qualms over disclosing the prophecy to his defense against the dark arts teacher but he just hadntbeen expecting it all order members are told of the prophecy dumbledore began and no order member can repeat the contents of the prophecy outside of an actual order meeting due to a special charm similar to that of the fidelius charm ron blushed slightly but simply nodded he didntlook over at whitman of course dumbledore wouldntjust give out the prophecy to anyone how could it have remained a virtual secret for so long if dumbledore were careless with it dumbledore turned his gaze back upon harry harry as you know there is a line in the prophecy which refers to a power that you have that the dark lord knows not dumbledore began quietly harry was staring at him intently and i ve told you that i believe this power to be your ability to love yes harry said blandly well dumbledore began again wait what hermione interrupted suddenly you never told us that part of the prophecy harry ron felt as confused as hermione looked harry had indeed refrained from mentioning some power he had that voldemort didntknow harry sort of shrugged i guess i never really put much thought into that part of the prophecy i mainly dwell on the whole part about me being destined to be a murderer of the second most powerful wizard in the world sir harry began as he addressed dumbledore do you know the prophecy well enough to repeat it for ron hermione and ginny with a somewhat sad smile dumbledore nodded oh yes i have reviewed it a few times he sighed heavily before beginning the one with the power to vanquish the dark lord approaches born to those who have thrice defied him born as the seventh month dies and the dark lord will mark him as his equal but he will have power the dark lord knows not and either must die at the hand of the other for neither can live while the other survives the one with the power to vanquish the dark lord will be born as the seventh month dies so ron began feeling slightly dazed if he marked you as his equal but you have a power that he doesnt then you re actually stronger than him arentyou the corners of dumbledore whiskers twitched a bit i ve said the same thing many times myself mr weasley i sorry sir ginny began almost desperately twiddling with her fingers could you please hurry and tell us the rest of your suspicion he gave her a small smile and nod alright where was i love harry ginny hermione ron and even whitman responded in unison right dumbledore replied serenely love you have it running through your veins as you know i performed an ancient magic charm that was sealed upon you when lily last remaining relative petunia took you into guardianship i have of course told you all of this before but what i have not told you are the details of the charm i placed upon you in ancient times harry many witches and wizards practiced these blood bonds before going into war to add protection to their warriors they would generally nominate one among them to sacrifice they would then use that person blood to perform rather complicated spells and charms for protection in your case your mother sacrificed herself for you out of love more so than loyalty so i was able to perform a very rare blood bond with lily blood now after the incident at grimmauld place in which you damaged the ceiling with a simple stare i began to wonder if it might have something to do with a one miss ginny weasley simply because i couldntthink of anything else that might have happened while at grimmauld place that could have upset you so was i correct yes sir harry replied quietly was this incident also related to jealousy dumbledore asked curiously harry nodded and unexpectedly whitman chuckled you bring a whole new light to the phrase green eyed monster eh he said grinning at harry harry gave him a small smile as dumbledore continued as i said harry i became somewhat suspicious after the incident at grimmauld place and i decided to research blood bonds a bit further for i had heard tale of a few instances in which the charm could become altered under certain circumstances altered ginny asked apprehensively i should say enhanced harry still has the protection of lily loving blood but i suspect he has now found another form of love not motherly love a love that he has never known before a romantic love with you miss weasley harry and ginny looked at one another ginny blushed and harry smiled at her briefly before turning his gaze back to dumbledore who continued after another deep breath in my research of these particular blood bonds which are forged with the intent of using the actual love in the blood to create a shield i found cases in which some individual developed new powers after they fell in love had children or even made strong friendships so harry began slowly the love i now have for ginny has has reacted with the blood bond and given me some new power i think so yes dumbledore said but i i cantcontrol it harry said in a small voice yes you can dumbledore said confidently it just something that we will have to work on during your training lessons with myself and remus which coincidentally resume at the start of next week harry nodded but didntlook entirely convinced so what is the power exactly ron asked i mean is it just can he just suffocate people with his eyes or what of the actual abilities he has gained with this new power i am not sure dumbledore said although i suspect there is more to it than that mr weasley knock knock knock suddenly there was a quick rap on the door to the infirmary which then opened slowly madam pomfrey peeked inside looking rather frazzled and then quickly went to dumbledore side she leaned down and whispered something in his ear ron watched as dumbledore beard seemed to droop at the corners and his brows furrowed tell them that i on my way dumbledore said quietly to madam pomfrey who nodded sharply and scurried from the room with a heavy sigh dumbledore stood gracefully from the bed i afraid that my presence has been requested i regret leaving all of you with an undoubtedly long list of unanswered questions but i will of course be glad to answer your queries at another time edgar could you please spare a moment whitman looked rather worried as he stood from his chair which dumbledore vanished of course headmaster he replied promptly well you four feel free to visit as long as you like dumbledore said as he and whitman headed for the door i ll inform poppy not to rush you off ta ta dumbledore and whitman said together they each stopped and looked at one another briefly with mildly interested expressions before turning to exit the door and closing it softly behind them what do you suppose that was about hermione asked worriedly i wonder if it to do with the order ginny offered he invited whitman along i sure people are always needing to speak with dumbledore nowadays harry said absently staring off into space ron was sure harry like himself was thinking more on this new power than dumbledore hasty departure ginny looked at harry for a moment as if considering something you need me she replied plainly harry turned to look at her what he asked curiously you need me harry she said again we should stop hiding you re stronger when you can love me he looked at her and smiled but i always love you ginny eyes began tearing up but as harry reached for her she leaned away from him and held out her hand give it back she said firmly wiping her tears away with one hand yet keeping the other outstretched what he asked in confusion i want my barrette back he sighed slightly and chuckled at her as he stood up and reached into the pockets of his robes to retrieve it she reached for it but he pulled it back let me he said softly ron glanced at hermione who was smiling and biting her bottom lip as she watched harry and ginny harry sat back down on the bed as ginny stood up ginny then stood in between harry legs with her back to him he gently gathered her hair into his hands with his fingers after he had gotten all loose strands from her face and about her neck he clipped her hair together in a low ponytail as soon as he was through she spun around and hugged him tightly around his neck he wrapped his arms around her waist and ron heard harry whisper i sorry ginny was now sobbing on harry shoulder and harry was kissing her tenderly on her hand which he was holding in one of his hands ron then felt a hand cover his he looked up to see hermione nodding her head toward the doors they stood up from their lounge chairs and quietly slipped out of the infirmary harry and ginny were so consumed with one another ron doubted that either of them knew that he and hermione had left as soon as ron and hermione had exited the hospital wing they heard the chattering of voices and saw the swarm of hungry students entering the great hall for lunch ron gripped onto hermione hand and looked down at her are you ready he asked with a sigh she looked up at him with a feeble smile no are you no but i hungry hermione giggled slightly well shall we ron shrugged and began leading her into the crowded entrance hall holding tightly to her hand as soon as they entered the crowd they heard them the whispers do you think he really is the heir of slytherin after all did you see those eyes he knocked his best mate to the floor i hear dean wants to be an auror harry must not want any competition will he go to azkaban for attempted murder did you see that kiss between ginny weasley and dean thomas harry must fancy ginny weasley will professor whitman be fired for attacking a student did you see how hermione granger was all over thomas the rumors about her must be true ron stopped in his tracks at these last words and turned to glare at the perpetrator hermione was pulling on his hand to try and get him to just leave it and continue toward the gryffindor table it was pansy parkinson and she was looking straight at ron and sneering come on ron hermione said urgently let just get to the table ron continued to glare at pansy but he then heard a small please from hermione he looked down into her imploring eyes and grudgingly followed her to their table after casting one last glance at pansy who was now taking her seat beside malfoy and whispering into his ear malfoy laughed loudly and looked up at ron with a snicker ron realized his pace had slowed down considerably as hermione again began tugging on his arm he then quickened his pace until they finally reached their area of the table and took their seats ron could feel dozens of eyes on him and hermione even from their fellow gryffindors hermione scooted as close to ron as she could grabbed his hand and pulled his arm about her waist like a belt resting her forehead on his chin she whispered oh that was so awful why cantthey just keep their thoughts to themselves ron sighed heavily and tightened his arm about her waist i dontknow hermione twiddling with her robes on her stomach ron began hesitantly hermione do you think harry will be able to control his power she leaned her head back to look at him yes she stated firmly he has to and dumbledore will be helping him ron nodded at her she sounded very confident but ron stomach was still squirming he just couldntget the image of harry glowing green eyes out of his head author note yay well i hope this was an enjoyable chapter for everyone all of this content was originally going to be in chapter 34 but i was crazy to think i could manage

asking questions i love them especially good ones like this one lol i wondered if anyone would be wondering about that and actually his eyes were glowing b c he didntlike what ron was implying about he and ginny activities harry like ron would never dream of taking advantage of the woman he loves and just as ron shouted at harry in anger for accusing him of that deed harry eyes began to glow in

just quiting or giving up b c never i say never i will prevail sorry i dontreally know what that was all about but i just felt the need to get that off of my chest lol chapter 36 saturday mornings were not supposed to be stressful you could sleep in until noon if you wanted and you could stay up late and not have to worry about morning classes the following day they were supposed to be the one day of the week that you could be guaranteed a sunny cloudless fun filled day of course ron knew that this was not always the case but he had really been looking forward to this saturday and it was rainy wet cold and just plain taxing this saturday was the first class free day of ron and hermione courtship no flirtatious defense teacher overbearing transfiguration professor or spiteful potions master ron had been hoping that he and hermione could walk about the grounds but it was wet and cold outside he had also hoped to sit before the fire with her without the worries of homework but that was actually sounding less and less appealing as he and his friends entered the great hall the common room was always rather crowded on rainy days but in a somewhat cozy way however if the stares and whispers he felt on the way to the gryffindor table were going to follow him about the castle he didntwant to be around people at all ron and hermione had informed harry and ginny of the whispers that they had to endure at lunchtime and this seemed to take all four of their appetites away for dinner nonetheless they had all decided to come to breakfast together ron had thought that in a group a bit larger people might be a little less obvious with their idle gossip but he had been wrong it was really vile whispering was one thing but then there was also pointing laughing and some who didnteven try to whisper at all of course there were also those that would give them timid smiles of support but every time ron received one of those he felt as if he heard two new rumors at least the great hall wasntas crowded on saturday mornings as it was the rest of the week and ron was very relieved to see that malfoy was not at the slytherin table this morning his skinny scowling face might have been the last straw preventing ron from punching the rat in the jaw again blimey ron exclaimed when they all took their seats he immediately grabbed hermione hand under the table it was sort of habit by now did you hear that one fellow at the hufflepuff table which one harry grumbled as he reached for a link of sausage said something about about you being a death eater ron replied in disbelief hermione sighed heavily and ron could tell by her expression that she must have already heard that one from quite a few people yeah harry began blandly i think the story about dean killing avery over the holidays is widely known people are assuming that voldemort wants me to take on avery unfinished assignment like you would kill him in the middle of the hogwart entrance hall ginny said while rolling her eyes hermione nodded at ginny in agreement although as ron remembered the panicked look on dean face while he lay suffocating he had definitely thought that dean might take his last breath in the middle of the hogwart entrance hall luckily dean was released from the hospital in good condition yesterday evening ron had been in detention during dean release but hermione had been in the common room studying over her arithmancy she had told ron that many people had greeted dean upon his entrance to the common room but that he had simply gone straight to bed without talking to anyone when ron had returned that evening from his detention of helping hagrid in the forbidden forest dean had already been asleep with his curtains closed it seems to me that there are three primary rumors being thrown about hermione said suddenly i ve heard many but from what i heard while studying in the common room and during yesterday lunch i think there are only three that people are really all that worried over yeah that what hagrid said too ron said glumly ron reckoned snape hoped ron would be doing something dangerous which was what hagrid chores usually were but they had only visited grawp which thankfully was no longer all that dangerous so he had actually had a fairly nice visit with hagrid and his brother well what were hagrid three hermione asked curiously he wouldntsay ron stated with a shrug said he didntwant to talk about it anymore anymore harry asked he said the attack had ron began but ginny slammed her hand down on the table i swear ron not you too she said aghast i so sick of people calling it an attack it was an accident ron just stared at his sister with his mouth partway open for a moment before regaining his train of thought hermione had even jumped slightly when ginny slammed her hand down but harry was simply staring at his plate ron cleared his throat before beginning in a more quiet voice hagrid said that the accident was a topic of conversation at the order meeting last night order meeting harry asked with interest looking up from his plate ron nodded i reckon that why madam pomfrey came to fetch dumbledore from the hospital hagrid said the meeting wasntabout you mate but i think dumbledore must have brought it up sighing heavily ron added anyway hagrid wouldntsay what the meeting was actually called for or what three rumors they suspected would circulate the most so what do you think the three primary rumors are hermione ginny asked leaning forward a bit well hermione began matter of factly there the one about harry being a death eater like ron mentioned there the one about harry not wanting competition as an auror which is ridiculous ginny spat angrily harry gave her a small smile but she was too busy stabbing at her eggs with her fork to see it ron suddenly noticed that there was a good foot between his sister and harry of course there was always a space between them at mealtimes but ron had allowed himself to hope that harry would not see a need in hiding his and ginny feelings any longer after yesterday events ron realized that hermione hadntresumed talking since ginny interruption he looked down to see her staring at ginny with her head tilted to one side and hermione ron prompted squeezing her hand gently hermione looked up at him looking a bit confused for a second before nodding her head oh yes and hermione continued there the one well obviously some people figure that harry fancies you ginny which is the truth ginny began as she cast harry a sad look i think ginny harry said in a low voice ginny sighed and crossed her arms i dontsee why you want to keep pretending if everyone knows now she said in a soft whine we ve talked about it ginny harry said tiredly people will forget that rumor if we continue to appear to be just friends harry mate ron began tentatively do you really think people will just forget it i mean it they ll forget it harry said harshly giving ron a warning look ron just sighed so you would rather them think you a death eater or an egotistical maniac than my boyfriend ginny asked heatedly harry didntlook at her or respond he simply used his fork to play with the eggs on his plate ron reckoned he could still see both sides of the galleon but he couldnthelp feeling as though harry were being unrealistic in his idea of keeping his and ginny feelings hidden ginny began whispering something fiercely to harry who began whispering fiercely back ron looked down at hermione to see what her reaction was to all of this and was surprised to see that she actually looked a bit teary eyed as she watched harry and ginny quarreling ron released his hold on her hand and wrapped his arm around her waist she looked up at him and he gave her a kind smile leaning close to her ear to whisper he said playfully you ll get your breakfast soggy if you dontstop she simply nodded at him with her brows furrowed in concern clearly trying not to cry he rubbed his fingers along her side and added softly it going to be alright hermione hermione swallowed rather hard before kissing him gently on the cheek ron she whispered looking across the table at ginny and harry who were still whispering urgently to one another hmm do you think you could change their topic so they dontget in another big argument like yesterday morning ron gazed at her a moment change their topic what could he possibly bring up that would capture the attention of both harry and ginny there was absolutely nothing he could hmm ron smiled at hermione before leaning down to kiss her lips i ll try he whispered as a plan began forming in his mind leaning away from her ron sighed heavily hey he said to call harry and ginny attention they both looked up with scowls uh i was wondering what would you two say to a bit of quidditch practice ron asked casually it raining you know ginny asked in a somewhat bored voice pushing her plate forward it just drizzle ron stated harry stood up quickly sounds great harry said at once i need to get out of this castle ron beamed at him as he too stood up from the table brilliant he said as he looked down to hermione who was standing up slowly from the table with a slight frown hermione cleared her throat and in a somewhat sad tone said i ll just get a bit ahead on my ancient runes ancient runes ron thought no that not what he d had in mind for his first saturday with hermione as his girlfriend ah hermione ron whined grabbing her hand she looked up at him in puzzlement i was hoping you d come along hermione actually laughed as she led ron down their side of the table toward the double doors of the hall come along she asked in disbelief to quidditch practice well yeah ron said excitedly she looked at him in confusion as they met up with harry and ginny who were waiting for them at the base of the grand staircase ron i not too keen on sitting out in the cold rain while you three fly hermione said ron grabbed her hand as they began climbing the stairs the silent harry and ginny following close behind i know he said with a somewhat playful smile hermione stopped in her tracks and ginny actually bumped into her no ron hermione said evenly i i hate flying and i i donteven own a broom it not that bad when you get used to it hermione harry said matter of factly she turned around and raised her eyebrows at him harry you were brilliant on a broom after your first flying lesson she said with her hands on her hips harry merely shrugged please hermione ron begged as they all resumed their climbing of the stairs ron i told you i donthave a broom hermione repeated beginning to look a bit nervous i promise i wontlet you fall ron continued trying to sound casual hermione turned to him with wide eyes ron no you want me to she looked from him to harry and ginny as if expecting one of them to be as astonished as she however they were just staring at her ron i am not letting you fly me around one hundred feet up in the air it not safe for two people to ride a one man broom yes it is hermione ginny said plainly hermione glared at her well it is fred and george used to fly me around all the time i sure they did when you were three hermione countered ginny shrugged ron was still holding tightly to her hand hermione what do you say he asked she looked away from him as she muttered ron i don t we wonteven be flying around all that much ron added and we ll only be fifty feet in the air not one hundred i keeper remember hermione stopped again but this time harry and ginny just moved around them and continued up the stairs you mean you actually want to guard the posts with me up there with you hermione asked incredulously they were now one floor shy of the entrance to gryffindor tower hermione made to step onto the next landing but ron moved in front of her and kneeled down on one knee grabbing both of her hands in his ron what are you doing she asked as her face turned red there were students walking up and down the stairs going to and from breakfast and ron knew that they were receiving many curious glances please hermione he begged with a big toothy grin that made hermione give a small giggle if you hate it i ll never ask you again ron people are looking hermione said under her breath shielding her face with one hand oh who cares ron asked i getting quite used to the stares arentyou hermione giggled again which caused ron to chuckle along with her as he stood up then feeling a bit bold ron grabbed her and hoisted her over one shoulder causing her to yelp ron she cried he was carrying her up the stairs and people were definitely looking now i haventagreed to fly with you sure you have he said as they reached the fat lady lemon meringue after ron proceeded in carrying her over the threshold to the common room he sat her down gently in front of the girls stairwell ginny was waiting on her now he said excitedly dress warmly and meet me back down here ronald hermione called desperately but his long legs had already taken him halfway to the boys dormitories ron hurriedly climbed the stairs and entered the dormitory where harry was moping about in his preparations harry didntseem all that excited about their spontaneous flying trip which was rare for harry but ron was too excited about taking hermione up on a broom to worry much over his best mate mood ron changed into an older pair of jeans a blue thermal shirt and a thick jacket he and hermione had never been flying before ron had never been flying with anyone before he needed something to take his mind off of all the rumors and worries this first week of the new term had created and what better way to do that than by flying around with hermione granger practicing his favorite sport in the world of course ron didntactually expect to do much practicing there was no way he was going to risk hermione getting hit with a quaffle he would need to take it much slower than usual too seeing as how hermione was scared of heights but if he could just show her how amazing it was up in the air maybe she would learn to love it after ron and harry had finished dressing they each grabbed their brooms harry grabbed his practice snitch he d gotten from ginny for christmas and they headed for the common room they stopped short as soon as they d left their dormitory because they had come face to face with dean thomas dean had a towel thrown over his shoulder and appeared to have just left the shower rooms all three of them stood frozen just staring at one another dean didntseem to have sustained any injury he looked as healthy as ever the only difference in his appearance was the uncomfortable almost fearful expression he wore finally dean mumbled excuse me and quickly moved past them up the stairs as soon as dean entered the dormitory and closed the door shut behind him harry continued down the steps he didntmention the confrontation so ron decided that he wouldnteither ron reckoned that was the first harry had seen of dean since the incident it could ve been worse than an awkward silence ron thought at least harry eyes didntglow green again ron and harry were only left waiting in the common room a few minutes before hermione and ginny descended the stairs together hermione had on a white thermal shirt similar to ron only hermione sized he reckoned she d borrowed it from ginny she was also carrying a thick jacket in front of her with her arms crossed at her stomach and for some reason she seemed to be blushing quite a lot you ready ron asked as he approached her she nodded quickly without looking straight at him alright ron replied hesitantly was she really all that nervous about flying maybe he shouldnttake her up if she were this worried he wanted it to be fun for both of them harry and ginny headed for the portrait hole door so ron reached for hermione elbow to guide her ahead of him however she backed away from him hermione what wrong he asked worriedly her cheeks seemed to turn a deeper pink look hermione i dontwant to take you up if you re this scared no it not that she replied quickly before looking down and saying quietly i um i d rather you walk ahead of me walk ahead of her she was beginning to act a bit mental why ron asked confusedly she rolled her eyes at him are you two coming ginny called impatiently from the door yeah ron called back just as impatiently before looking back down at hermione with furrowed brows he then asked gently hermione why would you rather ginny used a charm on my jeans so that the broom wouldntgive me sore spots hermione said quickly for a moment ron just looked at her without comprehending what this had to do with anything she rolled her eyes at him again and then quickly moved the coat she d been holding in front of her away from her body before quickly moving it back she hadntmoved it from her for long but it had been long enough for him to see how skintight ginny shrinking charm had made hermione jeans blimey ron muttered feeling quite dazed before clearing his throat in an attempt at sounding casual he said i um i dontsee anything wrong with them he could tell that she was trying very hard not to smile but a serious look quickly took over her ron i dontfeel comfortable walking out of the castle like this if she walked out of the castle holding that coat in front of her no one would see anything then again ron attempted to peer around her body to see the backs of her jeans but she took a step back from him well ron began suddenly feeling warm as he imagined what the backs of her jeans might look like i dontfeel comfortable with that either and that was the honest truth he didntwant anyone else seeing her figure in those jeans just put your jacket on he added she sighed slightly before pulling the jacket on ron had never realized how sensual the act of putting on clothing could be until now looking up at him as she straightened the sleeves she whispered alright then i ready ready she was ready ron didntthink so he was looking up and down her form and he at least knew that he wasntready her jacket barely covered her hips and it did nothing to shield the curves of her legs ron she groaned crossing her arms self consciously in front of her he shook his head slightly and looked up into her eyes wear mine ron said hastily handing hermione his broom and then removing his own jacket which went down to his mid thigh why she asked curiously yours isntlong enough he said quickly trying not to continue staring at her it just i can still wear mine he stammered as she began taking her jacket off again he then took his broom and her jacket from her and motioned for her to turn around she did so and it was impossible for his eyes not to wonder over her legs and well from this angle bloody hell quickly he helped her into his jacket so that he could cover her and regain the ability to think properly when he d finished the jacket nearly reached her knees and her hands were not visible at the cuffs he couldnthelp but chuckle at her what she asked apprehensively turning around to face him as she fixed her collar he shook his head at her you re adorable he whispered as he placed his hand on the small of her back to lead her from the common room adorable and desirable he thought to himself harry and ginny were waiting with unconcealed impatience in the corridor neither of them seemed at all happy and ron was considering telling them to just go back so that he and hermione could have a nice romantic flight in the rain but he didntdo that he decided that they each would be better off if they too got out of the castle so all four of them made the trek to the quidditch pitch the clouds were dense and grey but the drizzle was very light it really wasntraining hard at all just a nice mist that seemed to be making hermione hair curl even more than usual ron liked it okay captain harry began unenthusiastically once they d reached the stadium what the plan well ron began calmly i dontreally want ginny throwing the quaffle at me while hermione up there so i just going to practice on my maneuvering of the broom around the posts you and ginny can use the practice snitch to seek against one another how is that going to help my chasing ginny asked moodily with her hands on her hips it always good to practice basic flying skills ron said with a shrug did you even bring the quaffle she asked with a frown no ron said plainly ginny rolled her eyes at him mounted her broom and shot up into the air harry sighed heavily as he mounted his own broom ron exchanged glances with hermione harry and ginny had been so doting on one another yesterday afternoon in the hospital wing what had happened between now and then ron actually knew exactly what had happened ginny had like ron expected the rumors of harry fancying her to make their hidden relationship pointless she thought that harry would openly date her but he was still being stubborn would the rumors about him and ginny really just go away like harry believed and did harry really even believe that swoosh ron looked up from his daze and saw harry zooming upward into the drizzling rain he then looked down at a visibly shivering hermione crossed to her and wrapped his arms about her you re freezing cold arentyou he asked her quietly we donthave to fly today hermione okay she looked up at him with wide eyes and shook her head quickly n no i w w want t to fly w with you she said through chattering teeth hermione he began disbelievingly r really she added nodding he continued to give her a questioning look and she suddenly took his jacket off of her and handed it to him hermione no he said trying to hand it back you keep it r ron she began tenaciously pushing a damp strand of hair from her face can y you wear m my jacket ron looked at her jacket which he was still holding from earlier well no but i w wontf fly if you d donthave a j jacket she said with her chin stuck out stubbornly ron was really beginning to doubt whether or not going flying with hermione were as good an idea as it had seemed earlier he hadntthought it was all that cold but hermione sure seemed to be fairly frigid and there was also the rain and the longer he waited the wetter they were each becoming so hermione was standing their frigid wet and jacketless he really needed to make a decision her white thermal shirt was getting increasingly more damp and and ron quickly handed hermione her jacket before turning away from her and donning his own he only turned back around after he d given her plenty of time to properly button and zip her jacket she had but she was standing with her arms crossed and her teeth chattering hermione ron began his brow furrowed you re miserable we can seriously just go back inside and ron hermione nearly shouted stamping her foot on the damp earth okay okay he said quickly mounting the broom once he had the broom steady and hovering beneath him he held his hand out to her alright come on she slowly and awkwardly got on in front of ron with her back to him he put one arm tightly around her waist and the other on the broom handle in front of her he could tell how heavily she was breathing from the expanding of her abdomen beneath his palm ron closed his eyes and prayed to the stars that he would be able to concentrate on his flying despite the warm damp body of the woman he loved pressed firmly against him had this really been his idea ron wondered as he pushed off from the ground hermione gasped and grabbed ron arm with both hands he had just risen into the air and they were ascending slowly five feet ten feet fifteen feet ron she whispered urgently but the light rain which was becoming less and less light and the wind swallowed her voice twenty feet twenty five feet hermione rested her head back on ron shoulder closed her eyes and turned her head to call him once more ron she said a bit louder his hold tightened around her and the broom suddenly stopped to hover oh hermione thought i dontlike hovering however from this position she could see harry and ginny zooming about the goalposts at the far end of the pitch her untrained eye couldntsee the snitch but she was sure each of them had it in sight did you call me ron said low in her ear which gave hermione a shiver that was quite unrelated to the cold i w want to go b back down she said her head still resting against his shoulder he squeezed her just a bit tighter and kissed her warmly and tenderly on her cheek as he began lowering them slowly to the ground as soon as her feet touched ground hermione dismounted i sorry hermione ron began i knew i shouldnthave what are you doing he asked confusedly hermione remounted the broom while ron watched her in confusion but this time she sat facing him she hooked her legs under his slid her hands underneath his jacket and around his waist and then rested her head on his shoulder okay she said against his neck we can go back up now again one arm gripped the broom while the other encircled her you re sure ron asked she leaned her head back to look up at him as she nodded he smiled broadly at her and she felt his legs tighten over hers as he pushed off from the ground just as before he raised them ever so slowly you ll never get proper practice in with me tagging along she said gazing up into his stern expression he looked very attractive as he focused on not only flying but also keeping her safely on board he looked down at her as they continued to rise exactly he said simply before giving her a wink her heart fluttered as it always did when he did that what about ginny though hermione asked suddenly her teeth had stopped chattering ron body was very warm against hers what about her ron asked simply well i think she might have been a bit angry about not being able to practice with the quaffle no ron said with an unconcerned lip twist she just like that because she and harry have been rowing yeah hermione said quietly she hated that harry and ginny were arguing so much lately they were just going to have to work out some sort of compromise before they both went mad hermione looked up to see ron looking at her he wasntsmiling or frowning just staring they each began leaning in to one another at the same time their lips met in an incredibly tender and slow kiss but as they continued to kiss hermione realized that something was different ron hands since one of his hands had to remain on the broom for balance and the other around her waist for support he couldntreally rub her back or touch her face or hands all of the things that he usually did when they kissed so hermione removed her hands from their warm haven under ron jacket and she then grabbed hold of his lapel she pulled him to her and he deepened their kiss the chills hermione had because of the cold seemed to multiply hermione released his lapel and cupped ron face placing a warm kiss on his rain dampened lips the feeling of kissing him in the rain was very exhilarating and hermione couldntseem to stop however the broom shook slightly and hermione quickly pulled away it okay ron said quickly and a bit breathlessly it just the wind hermione nodded as she realized that the wind was picking up a bit along with the rain which could no longer be called drizzle she was actually becoming quite drenched look hermione ron said with a smile as he looked about them she looked over ron shoulder to see the three golden hoops standing tall and graceful in the rain the hogwarts castle was strong and still on its hilltop and the lake was rippling with the falling of the raindrops it beautiful up here she said softly yeah it is ron replied in a strange deep voice that made hermione look at him he was gazing at her with slightly furrowed brows and as she met his gaze she felt his arm tighten around her back harry ginny hermione heart was already beating frantically from the passion that had been growing in her and ron kisses but now it was beating even more rapidly from fear hermione tried to turn around to see behind her but ron was holding her too tightly against him for her to move much she could see ron expression however as he looked over her shoulder and it was an expression of amusement what is it hermione asked urgently they re just he began before shaking his head slightly and maneuvering their position so that hermione could view the opposite end of the pitch hermione looked out across the way to see harry and ginny flying about for the snitch only they both seemed to be laughing hysterically as they raced neck and neck for the small golden ball har ry ginny shouted as harry made a nosedive on his broom which ginny mimicked hermione giggled a bit before turning to look at ron i think you had a fine idea in coming out here ron weasley she said in a mock serious tone why thank you hermione jane he replied with a smile hermione was smiling as well and was about to kiss him once more when her eyes truly looked down for the first time since they d risen into the air she gasped loudly and lunged forward to cling to ron by throwing her arms about his neck whoa he said as the broom wobbled for a moment after her lunge he quickly steadied it hermione sorry she cried still clinging to him i just i we re really high and i you re trembling ron exclaimed as he held her tightly to him without another word hermione felt them descending from the air slowly she knew all along that they were fifty feet in the air but when you look straight down and realize that the only thing between you and the effects of gravity is a broom it sort of takes your breath away well maybe it didnttake ron s or harry s or ginny breath away but hermione was now as ron had noted trembling eventually however she felt her feet touch ground ron dismounted rather quickly and immediately helped hermione off the rain seemed to be falling in steady sheets now hermione wondered if it had been doing this moments ago or if it were just more noticeable on the ground ron grabbed her hand and began leading her toward the locker rooms once inside he led her to a bench where she sat down while he went over to a cabinet and began rummaging through some things although it was cloudy outside it was still brighter out on the pitch than it was in this tent like structure hermione looked about her as she had never actually been fully inside the quidditch locker rooms before there were double doors that led onto the pitch two benches were bolted down at one end of the tent which was where hermione sat then there were the actual lockers some cabinets and a door to the shower rooms at the opposite end hermione heard the shutting of a metal door and looked up to see ron coming toward her he had a couple of thick white towels in his arms he unfolded one and handed it to hermione before sitting down on her other side with the other towel he ran it over his head a few times which almost completely dried his hair that wasntfair hermione thought it took her a good ten minutes to fully dry her hair do you know a drying charm we can use he asked y yes hermione said nodding her shivering had returned so it was probably a good idea that they get warm and dry before they caught their death of cold setting the towel down beside her she began unzipping her jacket which was completely soaked through it would be easier to perform the drying charm if they werentcovered in layers before removing her jacket she stood up and motioned for ron to stand up as well for some reason he seemed to be avoiding looking at her however he did stand up she reached up and moved the jacket off of his shoulders getting the idea he removed it the rest of the way and tossed it down on the bench after retrieving her wand from her jacket pocket she did the same with hers ron then turned his back to her completely so she guessed he wished her to dry his back first as she cleared her throat to perform the spell she couldnthelp but notice the lean form of his back clearly visible beneath his dampened blue shirt maybe if she just stared at ron long enough she wouldntneed a drying charm to warm her she actually giggled at herself but not loudly enough for ron to hear okay hermione she thought get on with it exar r resssc co hermione stammered a pitiful spurt of air came forth from her wand sighing hermione tried again e exaresss c co another pitiful spurt of air she tapped ron on the back he would have to do it the longer she stood there in wet clothing the colder she got he turned around but he seemed to be fighting some sort of battle with his neck and eyes they couldntagree on where to turn suddenly a light went on in hermione brain she looked down gasped and hastily crossed her arms over her chest hermione had never been an expert at riddles but even she should have known what happened to the dim girl that got soaked while wearing a white shirt and blue bra here hermione ron said quietly reaching for a towel and handing it to her she took it turned away from him and wrapped it around her torso hermione slowly turned back around to look up at an awfully red faced ron he wasntsmiling or laughing or doing anything that would make her feel more embarrassed although his jaw muscle was working furiously and hermione remembered what that meant he was using self restraint it made hermione blush even more is it exaresco ron asked removing his wand from his jeans pocket hermione nodded at him he closed the space between them and slowly coaxed her hand to release her towel which she then allowed to fall to the floor he placed one hand on the small of her back to hold her against him they were so close hermione didnthave to worry about ron seeing anything other than the top of her head she wrapped her arms around his waist and rested her head on his chest his heart was beating rapidly exaresco ron muttered hermione heard the strong jet of air streaming from ron wand but she could not feel it yet suddenly however one of ron hands moved slowly up her back and into her hair while the other held the wand up to dry her mass of wet curls the warm air felt marvelous she looked up at him and he was looking down at her with an incredibly appealing stern look she realized that they were swaying back and forth as they stood there similar to when they danced with one another at christmas hermione couldntstop herself from reaching her hands up to rest on the back of his neck he continued to dry her hair running his one hand through it lovingly as he bent down to kiss her as they kissed hermione felt the warm air move from her now dry hair to drift over her back her heart was beating like mad and she was positive that her teeth would no longer chatter if she attempted the drying spell on her own how could they chatter she was closer to sweating than shivering hermione slowly pulled away and reached in her back pocket for her wand ron took a step back from her and turned around giving her privacy she smiled to herself as she began drying the front of her shirt he truly was a gentleman he had turned a potentially mortifying moment into a romantic tryst after she was completely dry hermione performed a spell on her jeans to take them back to their normal size ron then began drying their jackets while hermione went to the doors of the tent and glanced outside the rain was returning to a light drizzle and a timid sun was peeking through the dispersing clouds at first she did not see any sign of harry or ginny but she then saw them up in the stands where the commentator usually stood they were under an awning watching the subsiding rain together sort of watching the rain as hermione stood watching them she saw something quite unexpected an owl no two owls one was flying straight up into the stands toward harry and ginny and the other was flying straight toward the tent ron hermione called his drying charm stopped and he quickly came to her side ron look the owl was now slowing down as it neared them and hermione could see that it was carrying a letter why would two owls be delivering letters at this hour of the morning breakfast had come and gone and they werentowls that hermione recognized she and ron backed away from the door to allow the owl entrance it swooped in dropped the letter at ron feet and then quickly circled the tent and departed ron hastily picked it up and turned it over where it simply read ronald weasley he ripped it open with a furrowed brow before reading aloud mr weasley your presence is requested at the entrance hall of the hogwarts castle as soon as possible please make haste professor m mcgonagall hermione looked up into ron troubled face as he stared out over the pitch ginny and harry were now zooming toward them hermione opened her mouth to ask what this letter meant but no sound came forth hermione ron asked in an odd strangled voice do you think you could ride with me long enough to get to the castle of course hermione responded at once she ran to the benches and snatched up their jackets she threw hers on quickly and handed ron to him she then grabbed hold of ron hand as they went back out into the mist once they reached his broom ron brought her hand to his lips for a gentle kiss before helping her on backward harry and ginny pulled up beside them to hover as ron quickly mounted the broom hermione noticed that ginny face was quite pale and their letter was in her hand harry and ginny then sped off but ron gripped hermione even tighter than before and leaned down to whisper i going to go fast all right hermione she simply nodded before swoosh they were flying at full speed behind their two friends toward the castle hermione kept her eyes closed and her head pressed firmly against ron chest there was no need to worry about getting wet in the drizzle at this speed but hermione wasntworried about the dampness of her clothes anyway she was worried about that urgent letter why would ron be receiving a letter that urgent in the middle of a saturday morning and it looked as though the other letter had been delivered to ginny hermione stomach cramped painfully with worry and it had nothing to do with speed or heights harry and ginny landed quickly and were able to nearly jump off of their brooms once they d touched ground however ron lowered he and hermione slowly to the ground and helped her down they all four entered the huge castle doors to the entrance hall and were immediately greeted by professor mcgonagall mr weasley miss weasley she began with her brows furrowed as she wrung her hands together could you follow me please mr potter and miss granger may follow along before anyone could respond she turned abruptly on her heel and began walking toward the corridor off of the entrance hall professor ginny said in a small voice as the four of them followed has something happened if you four will just follow me to my office please mcgonagall said crisply ignoring ginny question ron was beginning to go quite pale too professor harry began firmly has this to do with yesterday accident mcgonagall sighed mr potter i afraid that there was more than one accident yesterday she said as she continued through the doubled archway and down passed the classrooms what do you mean ginny asked somewhat desperately she had stopped in her tracks with tears in her eyes everyone else stopped with her including mcgonagall who looked incredibly anxious hermione noticed a few passerbies now looking curiously at the four of them there was an opened door to the courtyard at the end of the hall thus this corridor was heavily trafficked on saturdays please miss weasley she began quietly i will tell you everything once we ve reached my office but i want to know now ginny said in a pitiful beg harry looked very uncomfortable he was looking around the hall at the few onlookers but then back to ginny with an intensely pained expression mcgonagall also looked uncomfortable but with a small sigh she clasped her hands and said in a near whisper i am afraid that there was a confrontation between some of you know who men and some order members and no ginny whispered as tears began welling in her eyes ron was just staring at mcgonagall with a very stern expression miss weasley mcgonagall began firmly calm down there was an injury but he who ginny nearly shouted there were some concerned passerbies continuing slowly down the hall trying to overhear the commotion without looking too suspicious harry had one eye on them and the other on ginny and he seemed to be having trouble deciding whether or not to keep his arms crossed or down by his sides who ginny repeated is it dad is it my dad no miss weasley no mcgonagall said firmly before adding quietly it your brother fred he no ginny breathed before grabbing at her stomach tears were now falling freely from her eyes as she shook her head over and over ron had gone completely stony faced hermione grabbed his hand and squeezed it but she wasntsure if he even noticed because he just kept staring at mcgonagall he is at st mungo emergency ward miss weasley mcgonagall continued your parents are there with him but i is h he alright ginny asked between sobs hermione could tell that mcgonagall did not know how to answer this question he mcgonagall cleared her throat before answering calmly he is alright but we need to hurry because your parents are waiting on you at st mungo s you four can floo there from my office hermione wasntsure that she entirely believed that fred was all right because mcgonagall almost never faltered in her speech but saying he is alright seemed to give her a bit of trouble ginny must have noticed because her crying only worsened and she actually turned to look at harry who was still fidgeting harry she whispered harry glanced around at the current passersby there were probably ten students walking through the hall looking at them all peculiarly he sighed heavily before taking two long strides toward ginny and encircling her in his arms she clung to him desperately and her sobbing increased hermione looked up at ron who was still stony faced she didntknow what to do there was nothing she could say the only thing she could think to do was squeeze his hand as hard as she could so she did he looked down at her for the first time since they had met mcgonagall in the entrance hall his blue eyes were worried but he squeezed her hand back gently hermione then lifted the back of his hand to her lips and kissed it softly mcgonagall cleared her throat calling hermione and ron attention harry was prying ginny fingers from about his neck but he did not release her hand as they all followed mcgonagall up the marble staircase and into her office author note omg this chapter gave me so much trouble first i didntget to post it 8 18 b c of writer block and then 8 19 i had a lot of interruptions including my internet not working properly argh i logged on at about five o clock to post this and my internet was down and then it remained down for ever well anyways i sorry it taken a while for this chapter to be posted i hope it was enjoyable i was frustrated with internet problems and such while writing it so i hope it didntaffect my writing but ah well time to move on chapter 37 is coming up next thanks everyone for reviewing the characters and situations of harry potter depicted in this story are the legal property of j k rowling bloomsbury and aol time warner and have been used without permission no copyright violation is intended no profit is being made off this site it is for entertainment purposes only in response to mrsteven question i really try my hardest to keep everyone in character the whole reason i was motivated to write this fic in the first place was b c jk had created such wonderful characters that i couldntseem to stop thinking about i love them all so much i wanted to read about them in more detail but instead i decided to write about them in more detail anyways in answer to your question i do not feel that ron or hermione are ready to go all the way i think that they are both still very innocent even though ron sees hermione as being this very innocent being in truth so is he so no i will not step over that boundary b c i dontfeel that ron or hermione would step over that boundary i hope this sufficiently answers your question thank you chapter 37 ron was staring blankly into the roaring orange and red flames in mcgonagall marble fireplace fred was hurt they were going to st mungo because fred had been injured in a fight with voldemort men it didntmake sense for some reason mcgonagall had made a mistake of some sort fred and george were at their apartment in diagon alley they were probably about to take their lunch break before they sold some more gelatinous growing gumdrops or whatever newly invented treats they had harry had his arm about ginny waist who was still crying and ron wasntsure that she would remain standing if harry werentthere by her side if mcgonagall had made a mistake she should hurry up and rectify it it really wasntgood to leave them in such a worried state at the moment mcgonagall was talking to someone head in the fireplace and telling them the four are on their way the male voice of the head sounded familiar but ron view was obstructed because mcgonagall was kneeling in front of the flames ron could have leaned to one side or the other to peer around her but he couldntseem to move suddenly mcgonagall rose from the fire and turned around to face them all there will be an order member waiting for you at st mungo floo station she said with a worried note in her voice harry why dontyou go first harry walked with ginny up to the fireplace before kissing her gently on her lips and ensuring her that he would be waiting for her on the other side as harry was using the powder to floo ron glanced down at hermione she was holding tightly to his hand but she wasntcrying however she was blinking profusely and her lips were pursed in a stubborn pout hermione ron whispered she looked up at him and he saw by her eyes that his suspicions were correct hermione if you feel like crying then cry she shook her head quickly as if to say no i dontfell like crying but even as she did so tears began welling in her eyes ron knew that she was trying to remain strong for him but he actually wanted hermione to cry if she cried then he would have someone to comfort if she cried then he wouldn t because he would be too concerned with making sure that hermione was okay miss granger mcgonagall called harry and ginny had already gone hermione released ron hand and stepped into the now green flames before shouting watching hermione disappear into a burst of flames sort of made ron stomach ache he was suddenly reminded of the time harry accidentally ended up in knockturn alley without waiting for mcgonagall signal ron speedily stepped into the flames now mr weasley mcgonagall said hastily as ron stood in the tickling flames if any of you would like to stay the night arrangements can be made you can send an owl or reach me through my fireplace ron nodded thank you professor he said feeling slightly numb as he shouted st mungo ron immediately felt the familiar dizzying whirl this mode of transportation always spun him near the point of being sick when he stopped this time he found himself in a room he d never seen before it was a long rectangular room with concrete walls and bright yellowish lighting there were quite a few people running about but he saw no harry ginny or hermione step forward please step forward called a high pitched yet bored voice ron stepped out of the fireplace and saw a short dumpy older lady with white curly hair and a dark green uniform she had her wand out and pointed directly at him this wasntst mungo s surely he d done something wrong looking about the long room ron saw two double glass doors at one end and outside the glass doors he saw harry ginny and hermione just standing there okay ron thought so even if this isntst mungo s at least we ve all arrived at the same place glancing along the wall ron saw that there were about thirty fireplaces just like ron s and at each fireplace there stood a uniformed witch or wizard with their wand raised at those arriving at their station there was also a gate behind each uniformed person okay come on come on what the hold up the lady called ron hesitantly took a step toward her he was then able to read her nametag rosa on the platform on the platform empty your pockets she said hurriedly my pockets ron asked as he stood up on a small circular platform your pockets your pockets she screeched impatiently waving her wand about at his chest in her other hand she was holding a small plastic tub for him to put his belongings rosa cantyou hurry this kid up came a low voice from behind ron he turned around and saw that there were actually two or three people crammed into the fireplace that ron had just exited the closest a tall man with a mustache appeared to be less patient with ron sluggishness than rosa so ron quickly added his wand to the rest of his belongings in the tub which wasntmuch a few coins and a couple of taffies rosa began looking over the coins and taffies as if she thought they might contain some sort of poison or curse she then placed his wand on a scale similar to the one at the ministry of magic which printed out some sort of card while she read over the card ron overheard a conversation from the fireplace to his right what empty my pockets said a bristling white haired man wearing a very fine pair of black silk robes well i never do you know who i am no sir i dontknow who you are said an extremely monotone voiced uniformed wizard not much older than ron it st mungo policy to check the pockets and pat down all arrivals before entrance it is not said the older man why i ve been to this hospital countless times boy and not once has anyone asked me sir percival eubanks to empty my pockets ron rolled his eyes at the irony percival of course this pompous bloke name would be percival yes sir i understand sir said the boy in the same monotone voice his eyes looked extremely tired and a bit annoyed this is a fairly new policy to ensure the safety of our staff patients and guests we at st mungo want the best for oh i bet it that amelia bones shouted eubanks interrupting the boy somewhat rehearsed sounding speech minister fudge was doing a fine job in my opinion dontknow why he was so mistreated is amelia bones asked to empty her pockets well i would surely think not why in my day ron didnthear the rest of the man ranting because rosa began patting down ron legs torso and arms she even stuck her pudgy fingers down into ron shoes clear rosa yelled at the gate in front of ron fireplace which opened with a creak he started to exit when something began banging into his arm it was the small tub of his belongings oh yeah ron thought as he reached in for his things and pocketed them i must be really out of it if i were about to leave behind my wand the tub then floated back to a small table beside rosa and apparently ron was free to go he walked quickly to the big glass doors which opened automatically he then found himself in the familiar st mungo waiting room but where had hermione gone ron called hermione from a chair in the center of the room she was sitting in between well someone the torso of a large burly man was seated to her right with his eyes squinted in pain while his legs sat to hermione left crossing and uncrossing harry and ginny were seated across from hermione and the not all together man ron rushed over to them ginny straightened up in her seat when she saw him harry told the receptionist that there are four of us she said weakly holding tightly to harry hand they have to get permission from the healer on duty in the emergency ward before we can go see him where the order member that was supposed to be waiting on us ron asked curiously we dontknow harry said as he rubbed ginny back with his free hand it was supposed to be remus though that whose head mcgonagall was talking to anyway they ve really bumped up security huh ron asked blandly staring at a woman across the room with a clawed hand protruding from her head yes hermione said sounding a bit miffed and they took my healing kit you d think that since they sell them here they would be considered safe but apparently not maybe they re afraid people might smuggle in illegal potions or something harry offered will you get it back ron asked slightly amazed that hermione could look adorable even in the midst of a possible tragedy while sitting quite perturbed in between two halves of one man yes hermione said glancing nervously at the legs sitting next to her which were becoming more and more restless they ll mail it to me i asked them to um send it to hogwarts um obviously hermione was looking at the man fidgety lower half with a slight scowl as she scooted a bit closer to the man torso you told her four right harry ginny asked fretfully glancing about the room in a way that reminded ron of pig yes ginny harry said softly i told her four ahh all of a sudden the head connected to the torso of the man hermione was seated beside yelled loudly he then reached across hermione and grabbed hold of his knee which ron noticed looked a bit swollen beneath his slacks in comparison to his other knee hermione was now leaning all the way back in her seat looking slightly terrified sir sir ron said firmly grabbing a hold of the man hand and prying it away from his knee hermione escaped from her chair as soon as she had sufficient space to do so ron then quickly released the man who went back to grabbing his knee i sorry little girl the man breathed through tears of pain his eyes shut tightly sorry the pain is just so ah the man was now kicking his leg roughly out in front of him hermione was standing slightly behind ron and gripping tightly to his arm all four of them were staring at the man there was a smiling seemingly good natured healer aid walking about the room with a cart of biscuits and coffee who didntgive the man a second glance weasley four ginny jumped up from her chair at the sound of their name almost yanking harry to the floor as she still had her death grip on his hand ron looked up toward the front of the room to see a young witch in lime green st mungo robes she had a clipboard and was looking about the room with her eyebrows raised harry and ginny led the way with ron and hermione close behind hi the girl said pleasantly as they approached visitors for frederick weasley in room one thirty two yes ginny said hastily as she twirled a long strand of hair around and around her finger follow me please the girl said briskly before turning around and heading down a long corridor with white walls and white floors it seemed to ron as if it took them quite a while to reach room one thirty two they must have taken four different turns a right and a left and a left and a right passed a man with a shrunken head and then a woman with an enlarged neck and then finally the girl stopped in front of a large white door with a small lime green one thirty two on it and a plaque beneath the number that read weasley alright she said looking down at her clipboard mr weasley surgery prep is at twelve noon so that gives you about ten minutes until healer asa gadgil comes for his consultation thank you ginny opened her mouth to say something but the girl had given them a speedy smile and scurried passed them flipping frantically through her clipboard papers without allowing time for questions although ron was sure he knew what question ginny would have asked surgery prep what kind of surgery harry approached the door and knocked tentatively ron heard the quick shuffling of footsteps and then the door swung open revealing the red tear stained face of his mum she stepped out into the hall and closed the door behind her mum what ginny began immediately but mrs weasley motioned for her to be quiet listen fred is awake mrs weasley began in a hoarse whisper mr gadgil is his healer and he will be here soon yes yes for his consultation we know mum ginny began desperately but what happened mrs weasley sighed and brought one hand to her forehead ginny i just cantrepeat the story again not now besides dontyou want to have time to visit with him before the healer arrives she asked tiredly ginny simply nodded with a frown suddenly the door opened and tonks walked out her hair was a deep magenta this afternoon she gave a very brief nod to everyone and then went straight to harry where remus she whispered urgently he didntmeet us harry said tonks rolled her eyes and sighed heavily oh i knew i should ve gone instead she said snapping her fingers in aggravation why why should you have gone hermione asked he just bound to have set the alarm off again tonks said more to herself than hermione that the only explanation that stupid pointless alarm oh i ll be back in a bit molly she added with a wave of her hand before hurrying down the corridor what was that all about ron asked security is just so tight now dear mrs weasley said with a tired frown remus set off the hospital werewolf detection alarm when we first arrived he had to show them his immunization card and oh it must have been so embarrassing for him right in the middle of the floo station mrs weasley smiled feebly at them all before shaking her head sadly and opening the door be quiet now she whispered as she silently motioned for them to enter the room it was very dim and cool inside the small squareroom there were chairs set up around a small hospital bed which was nearly in complete shadow because of some sort of privacy canopy glancing around the room ron saw his father george bill and to his slight surprise angelina johnson they were all seated away from the bed with solemn faces everyone was silent ron mum motioned for them to approach the bed harry led ginny to one side but he remained at the foot hermione then joined harry as ron slowly approached the other side of the bed and peered down over his brother ron immediately felt a lump form in his throat as he gazed down into fred face fred was extremely pallid and he seemed to be sweating his normally brown eyes were almost gray or was that the dim lighting so thin was his face that when he looked up at ginny and gave her a weak smile it stretched his bluish lips taut across his teeth ginny started crying again as she looked down upon him fred moved his hand from underneath the covers and held it up for ginny to grab onto which she did ron had to consciously close his mouth which had opened in horror at the sight of his brother hand it was bony his wrist was just bone dontcry ginny baby fred whispered in a croaky voice he was taking raspy breaths between his words i ve looked worse he added with every word his chest moved up and down heavily ginny was shaking her head at him no you haven t she squeaked through her tears fred made a strange coughing wheeze sound that ron thought was some sort of chuckle oh yeah i forgot i must ve been thinking of ronnie ugly bloke he then turned to look up at ron who tried to smile at his brother but he doubted he did a very good job this wasntfred and that moping guy in the hospital chair wasntgeorge what was going on ron had been telling himself that his parents would be safe behind the walls of grimmauld place but he hadntgiven any thought to fred and george why should he the twins were invincible they got away with everything they didntmope or lie in hospital beds with raspy voices and blue lips you re not going to die are you ron blurted out at ron question ginny who was now holding fred hand to her cheek gasped his mother started wailing he wanted to kick himself as soon as he d asked it but it just fell out of his mouth in some sort of a high pitched voice that wasnthis own fred just continued to smile up at him weakly however i can t he rasped still got a list of things to do ron just stared down at his brother who was now turning his feebly smiling face back to ginny a surge of unexpected anger was running through him all of a sudden voldemort death eaters ron was so sick of them hurting people he didntunderstand why why did they hate muggles why did they hate muggle borns why did they hate those that didn t knock knock knock the door opened a bit and in walked a nice looking man around lupin age or older he had dark black hair and olive colored skin and he was wearing lime green robes with the st mungo logo of a crossed bone and wand he had a nametag which ron was sure read asa gadgil but he couldntsee properly in the dimly lit room ron mum motioned for he and ginny to move from the bed and take seats so they did ron took hermione hand and led her to two empty seats beside his father who patted him on the back as he sat down hermione was wiping at her eyes and ron put his arm around her she molded so well into the crook of his arm he noticed his father giving them an odd look and he suddenly remembered that no one outside of hogwarts other than tonks knew of ron and hermione courtship good afternoon weasley family and friends the healer said in a pleasant yet strong voice he went to stand to the right of fred in the same spot ron had been standing okay gadgil began in a tone that demanded everyone attention i have some good news and some bad news alright should i tell you the good news first he asked looking down at fred ron saw his brother nod well your chance of survival has risen from around seventy percent to around eighty five percent over night the healer said matter of factly everyone in the room seemed to let out a slight sigh of relief or gratitude except for the four newest arrivals hermione had gasped and put a hand to her mouth ginny was sobbing into her hands and ron was just staring straight ahead of him the healer good news was that fred had a lesser chance of dying not that he wouldnt die there was a strip of paint missing from the footboard of fred hospital bed that ron was studying intently he was afraid to look anywhere else for some reason it seems that your twin here may have saved your life the healer continued motioning to george who looked much less distraught now that the healer had given his good news the jelly leech you mean george asked the gadgil yes the healer said with a small smile before turning back to fred after performing some tests on your blood we discovered the snake you were bitten by to be an inland taipan at these words hermione gasped and bill whistled low and shook his head taipan was that supposed to mean something to ron he didntthink so no one other than bill and hermione seemed to have had an epiphany of sorts but hermione began with one hand running nervously through her hair an inland taipan is the most poisonous snake in the world bill finished hermione nodded at him yes gadgil replied sounding slightly impressed by hermione knowledge well ron thought as he looked down at hermione concerned expression he not the only one ron wasnt surprised that hermione knew he was never surprised at anything hermione knew just fascinated however the healer began immediately after fred was bitten this young man the healer indicated to george gave his brother a what was it again jelly leech rasped fred they double as a sugary goo filled gummy or a well a leech george said quietly smart boy the healer said looking back to george after you attached that sweet to his bite most of the venom was immediately absorbed into the gummy and what remained we were able to eradicate with potions the healer then took a deep breath but we were too late to properly treat the limb that was bitten we have been able to isolate the venom in your arm here the healer indicated to fred right arm which was concealed by the sheeting but the poison has already infected all of this limb tissues i afraid son that you will have to lose your arm hermione felt as if the lump in her throat that she d been so desperately trying to swallow all morning burst in her throat it caused a silent torrent of tears to fall from her eyes ron arm tightened about her shoulders oh she felt like such a namby pamby she should have her arm around ron shoulders but all she could do was cry if we do not amputate the bite will be fatal in a matter of days everyone was silent unless of course they were crying mrs weasley was crying on mr weasley shoulder ginny was crying on harry shoulder and angelina was crying into her own hands hermione was luckily able to cry silently ron was resting his head in one hand hermione didntthink that he was crying but she felt so badly for him for the whole weasley family for fred a taipan bite contained enough venom to kill up to one hundred muggle men of course wizard resistance to such things was much stronger but it was virtually a miracle that fred was still breathing but george said suddenly standing from his chair he crossed to stand beside fred opposite the healer before continuing in a shaky voice but isntthere a way to just cantyou just he stopped and swallowed hard looking down at his twin fred was lying perfectly still with his eyes on george if this had been the first time hermione had seen the two she never would have guessed that they were twins the poison had really taken a toll on fred of course it had an inland taipan no son i sorry gadgil said firmly but your brother here is very lucky to be alive an arm is actually a small price to pay for a taipan bite small george asked incredulously he lifted fred good arm up by the wrist and said this isnta small price what about about riding brooms or or what about clapping or what what about snogging he then looked over at angelina who seemed to be blushing george continued what about george fred croaked loudly before having a harsh coughing fit he removed his bad arm from the covers and used his hand to cover his mouth his right arm was swollen to twice its normal size and it was a hideous reddish purple color once he d recovered from his fit of coughs he sat up a bit against the back of the bed and looked at george george we ll still have three he said with a small and somewhat forced smile george frowned down at his brother yethe ruffled his hair playfully just then the door opened and tonks and lupin walked inside they both looked a bit tired and irritated pardon us tonks said quietly as she and lupin moved to stand against one wall the healer nodded at them in greeting before turning back to fred alright young man if you agree to the surgery we will begin prepping you in about half an hour i agree he said without delay the healer nodded and patted fred on the shoulder before quickly exiting the room as soon as the door shut behind him mrs weasley jumped out of her seat and ran to fred side oh my poor baby oh your precious little arm as mrs weasley continued to hug on her son hermione noticed that lupin was leaned down toward bill who was whispering something to him hermione figured he was informing him of the healer news because lupin face was becoming increasingly more worried can i get you anything is there anything at all that you need mrs weasley asked fred as she continued to pat on him and unnecessarily fix his covers air fred croaked from somewhere underneath his mum fussing george chuckled at his brother before motioning for angelina to take his side by the bed she quickly got up from her seat and went to peer down over fred she then bent down to his ear and started whispering something his mum patted him once more on his head before taking her seat beside mr weasley who hermione was pretty sure she saw wiping his eyes a bit hermione turned to look at ron and was surprised to see that he was staring at her she tried to give him a loving smile and she received a feeble one in return are you okay she whispered as she wiped at her eyes that she only now realized were still damp as long as he going to live i reckon i dontcare what surgery they have to do he whispered back she nodded at him i want to know what happened though ron said quietly me too hermione replied but i dontthink we should ask right now she added looking around at all the worried faces tonks and lupin will know ron said it sort of sounded like a question let ask them hermione said quickly standing from her chair ron followed her as she walked slowly to the door motioning for tonks and lupin to follow them hermione saw that ginny still had her head on harry shoulder and harry was stroking her hair it might not be wise to inform ginny of the details of the attack at the moment hermione thought so she ron tonks and lupin stepped out into the bright hallway what up tonks asked as they exited the room we want to know what happened ron said quickly where did he encounter the world deadliest snake and why tonks sighed heavily and looked to lupin who nodded at her i ll tell it lupin offered sturgis podmore do you two remember him he was a member of the order he in azkaban hermione replied yes lupin said well no not anymore he dead wait wait wait ron said holding up his hand podmore was the guy that got sentenced to six months for trespassing and attempted robbery of the ministry of magic right right hermione said quickly but he was under the imperius curse when he committed the crimes and he wasnteven able to defend himself at the wizengamot right ron said nodding at her well lupin began again minister bones got his sentence shortened to five months due to him being under the curse at the time of the crimes unfortunately however upon his release friday morning he was kidnapped by death eaters oh how awful hermione said as a sickening cramp formed in her stomach she felt ron steady hand come to rest on the small of her back and her stomach cramp lessened yes lupin said with a nod as soon as his abduction was detected dumbledore was notified immediately and he then notified the order yesterday around noon hermione said quickly looking up at ron who nodded that what had happened to cause madam pomfrey to interrupt the headmaster visit to harry in the infirmary well yes lupin said with a curious look at them both anyway the order formed a rescue team of volunteers to try and track podmore down the team consisted of myself tonks fred and george moody kingsley and whitman we were able to track them we caught up with them in a harbor town at the coast of belgium called zeebrugge tonks said belgium hermione asked in disbelief why in the world would they be taking podmore to belgium well we dontthink that they were lupin replied with a sigh you see zeebrugge serves as an international port with ferries to the united kingdom there is an expressway that connects it to the european motorways and its harbor is important for the importation of cargo from all around the world the thing is this town is a crossroad for traffic from all directions they could have been going anywhere anywhere tonks added shaking her head sadly but why would they be using muggle forms of transportation ron asked with a confused scowl hermione was wondering the same thing to reap havoc lupin said with a shrug to throw us off tonks added we dontknow lupin replied firmly all we know is that we caught up with them and a fight broke out a fight tonks said with a scoff okay a skirmish lupin said with a small smile at tonks we estimated there to be about five to ten death eaters but there were only three only three tonks said with wide eyes we still dontknow who they were though kept their masks on the cowards cowards lupin said with a grimace before shaking his head and beginning again anyway they were obviously outnumbered so one of them used the killing curse on podmore as soon as they saw us coming then two apparated so there was only one left tonks replied blandly just one but he managed to conjure that snake it latched on to fred arm before whitman was able to kill the beast apparently taipan are from australia and whitman knew what curse to use that would kill it instantly lupin said but the snake had already gotten its bite tonks added george went all panicky because fred went rigid and started sweating a lot but he had one of those blasted leeches lupin said with a smile what happened to the bastard that conjured the snake ron asked darkly lupin smile faded instantly and he looked down apparated he replied softly something suddenly occurred to hermione hey she began do you think that they might have been heading to that slytherin school of magic hey yeah ron breathed maybe it near belgium they might have led you straight to it if they hadntspotted you we have definitely considered that possibility tonks replied with a glance at lupin and just between us there are some trained aurors stationed at zeebrugge now they re disguised as muggles and they ll be watching for any suspicious activity any suspicious activity lupin repeated with a scowl well if you can discover something about that foul school maybe something good can come out of this hermione said softly the door to fred room suddenly opened and out walked harry ginny wasntwith him however hey he said quietly before looking up at ron you alright mate he asked yeah ron murmured before adding we need to tell you what happened though so hermione listened to the story for a second time she even helped a bit in the telling of it harry reaction was to be expected he was very angry with the death eaters yet intrigued by the area to which they were tracked he told them that he d left ginny in the room with her parents because he thought that the corridor conversers might have been talking of such things just as the second telling of the story was coming to a close the door to the hospital room opened again it was mr weasley excuse me guys he said quietly it appears that fred has something he d like to share with everyone he wants all of you to come inside and take a seat however clueless as to the meaning of this unexpected meeting hermione entered the small dim room she and ron took their seats again and again ron put a comforting arm about her fred was actually sitting up in bed and angelina was sitting by his side she seemed to be holding tightly to his good hand everyone fred began in his rasping voice once everyone had taken their seats once more we have something we d like to share fred was smiling quite broadly for a recently poisoned man who was about to lose an arm angelina was also smiling although rather sheepishly tell them angie fred croaked angelina nodded at him before addressing the room everyone one week ago today fred asked me to marry him and i said yes hermione eyes went wide as the room burst into a loud uproar of chatter applause laughter and excitement that was completely opposite of the mood that had recently left the room ginny was crying yet again but this time they looked like tears of joy mrs weasley was also crying as she shot up from her seat and crossed to hug angelina around the neck mr weasley looked stunned but very happy ron looked stunned just very stunned congrats you guys harry cried over the commotion married ron asked in what sounded like disbelief you two are getting married you look shocked ron said angelina with a bright smile well yeah ron replied slowly it just that marriage i mean dontyou understand what that means fred fred raised his eyebrows at ron who continued it means that you cantdo whatever you want anymore mate and then kids you two will have some titchy rugrats running about your store have you thought of that he asked with wide eyes angelina laughed saying i ll take all that as a congratulations if it all the same to you ron ron just sort of shrugged before staring off into space hermione watched him as the happy chatter continued he was just staring off into thin air with a blank almost bothered look on his face it was a look that made hermione feel sick to her stomach it was a look that scared her ron brother had just announced his engagement and ron reaction was shock and something akin to worry was it worry what had he said dontyou understand what that means you cantdo whatever you want anymore hermione had a horrible suspicion as to what was going on in ron mind at the moment as he stared blankly into nothingness he doesntlike the idea of marriage hermione thought it scary to him it sounds smothering did it sound smothering to hermione no not at all it sounded wonderful to hermione all of a sudden another horrible thought occurred to hermione if the idea of marriage bothers ron how much space does he really need from me as his girlfriend does he have enough space does he need more am i already smothering him and if i am what does a man do when he can no longer breathe hermione knew what men did when they couldntbreathe they rid themselves of the obstruction was she an obstruction author note well there you have it chapter 37 what do

paragraphs if you want to check it out you should probably start with the last three paragraphs chapter 38 all of my babies are growing up ron was slumped down in a rather uncomfortable emergency waiting room chair halfway listening to his mother this waiting room was much less busy than the one in the main lobby this room merely contained worried family members many of which were sleeping in awkward positions in the gray plastic chairs ron didntknow how any of them were managing to sleep in the things he was having enough trouble sitting in one actually ron didntknow how they were sleeping through his mum ranting either she was having one of her nervous floods of jabber whenever something happened to really rattle his mother nerves she would plunge into an endless sea of prattle it would either be extremely angry prattle or overly sugared prattle when they d first arrived in the waiting room a good fifteen minutes ago she had begun with angry prattle ginny had asked to hear the full story of fred incident and ron mum had played storyteller very frightening storyteller especially when she got to the part about the death eater conjuring the snake and then apparating like a what had she called him a gutless spineless yellow bellied toad thankfully however her angry story had been replaced with sugarcoated drivel ron would have preferred silence but this was definitely better bill honey you re almost thirty charlie spends all of his time in romania and then percy is well he s mrs weasley stopped to dab at her eyes with mr weasley handkerchief before continuing and then the twins have always been so absorbed with their inventing i just worried and worried that i would never have any grandbabies mr weasley was holding on to his wife hand and patting it absently as he stared off down the corridor in which fred was currently in surgery healer gadgil had agreed to fred request to take one family member back with him and fred had asked for george ron was a bit surprised that he hadntasked for angelina but she didntseem at all bothered actually she had seemed relieved she had said thank merlin oh i just couldntbear to watch but now fred is getting married mrs weasley continued looking to angelina who attempted to smile as she nervously twiddled her fingers ron had never seen the girl this quiet and harry mrs weasley looked to harry who was sitting on a small bench with ginny who had her head in harry lap he was stroking her hair oh i can just see it now a beautiful baby girl with black hair and mum ginny exclaimed sitting up from harry lap and leaning into the crook of his arm my word you re going to embarrass harry to death i fine harry said quietly with a small smile but ron thought he did look rather flushed well i sorry dear but you know i cantstop talking when i like this mrs weasley shook her head as she turned to look at ron and hermione hermione was like ron slumped down in one of the hospital chairs she had her head resting on his shoulder and they were holding hands his mum hadntnoticed the change in he and hermione relationship until they d settled themselves in the waiting room when she first saw that they were holding hands she had actually squealed with glee and you two mrs weasley sighed and dabbed at her eyes again oh it just so wonderful i would have never imagined would you arthur yes mr weasley said confidently as he looked at hermione with a smile she lifted her head from ron shoulder and ron saw that she was blushing worse than harry hermione dear you knit dontyou mrs weasley asked i well a bit hermione said with a small shrug of course someone once told me that my hats looked like woolly bladders she glanced up at ron with one raised eyebrow he winked at her and her blush deepened a bit as she gave him a coy smile he bit the insides of his cheeks to keep from smiling broadly like a fool he was just amazed that he could still affect her in that way with a simple wink he glanced up at his mother who had gone a bit quiet she was smiling warmly at them and nodding her head mmhmm a little boy with adorable brown curls oh i can teach you a beautiful pattern for maternity sweaters you just mum ron groaned in disbelief as he shielded his burning nose and cheeks with one hand ginny actually giggled for the first time since fred surgery had begun oh i sorry dear mrs weasley said putting a hand to her mouth i just cantseem to stop myself ask me about my love life mother bill offered blandly it ll be a short story mind you mrs weasley actually did turn to her oldest son and begin chattering as ron took a glance at hermione she was still blushing a bit but she also looked a bit worried ron nudged her softly with his elbow and she looked up at him with an almost sad look in her eyes sorry about that he muttered she shook her head quickly before looking down at her bobbing knees hey ron said sitting up a bit straighter are you okay she smiled but it looked forced before saying yes i just um just a bit nervous for fred he simply nodded at her as she went back to staring at her knees was she this nervous over fred surgery at the moment she looked antsier than ginny which was saying something as ginny was now twirling a strand of her hair around her finger so quickly ron half expected her to rip it out ron reckoned he was nervous about fred surgery and he did want to rip his own hair out but oddly enough the two werentrelated as far as the surgery went ron really felt like everything would be all right his brother had been bitten by the deadliest snake in the world and he was still alive so if fred had just been bitten by a snake ron wouldntwant to pull his hair out however fred had also been bitten by the love bug fred weasley getting married ron was very happy for his brother but as soon as he had heard that one of his brothers would be getting married he had felt a couple of strange sensations a slightly shocked sensation followed by a panicking sensation as soon as angelina had announced their engagement ron had felt shocked marriage for one of the twins fred weasley whose entire life had been focused on playing practical jokes and having fun along with george the twins always did whatever they wanted and never worried about answering to anyone except for their mother whom they could usually sidestep ron had imagined his brothers would both remain bachelors for life he d been stunned to discover otherwise thus ron congratulatory remarks hadntbeen very appropriate he d just asked fred if he understood what marriage entailed as if he even knew himself however before he could congratulate him properly the second sensation had hit him panic marriage he d forgotten all about marriage ron had always wanted a family wife kids pet house everything and of course through the years he had dreamed that hermione would be in that picture but he d never actually believed that that was a possibility it was a fantasy but now hermione loved him they were dating he was dating hermione granger and ironically this was what had made ron forget about marriage he had been so thrilled that hermione loved him and wanted to date him that he had forgotten that there were actually steps that followed courtship hermione wasnttruly his yet if he wanted her to be his if he wanted to ensure that he wouldntlose her to someone else he would eventually have to pop the question would hermione want to marry him well ron thought i ll find out because somewhere down the line he would have to ask her he could not and would not lose her so he would have to ask her now harry ron mother began breaking into ron thoughts she had apparently finished her chat with bill how are you feeling dumbledore told us about the incident with the thomas boy i alright harry replied quietly he didntlook all that comfortable with this new topic of conversation and ginny was frowning at her mother mum let not talk about that right now she said softly ron mum nodded at her daughter you re right sweetie i sorry i know you dontwant to think of that harry dear it just reminds you of those nonsense rumors doesntit oh the nonsense you being a death eater oh i just ron sighed heavily as his mother switched into her angry prattle mode he noticed ginny rolling her eyes and looking apologetically at harry who smiled at her and leaned down to whisper in her ear whatever he said earned him a kiss on the cheek ron glanced down at hermione who was nodding politely at his mother at sporadic intervals if hermione really were as worried over fred surgery as she seemed at least his mother would keep her mind off of it what was he thinking he doubted hermione wanted to trade her worries over fred for worries over harry kiss on the cheek she could probably use one squeezing hermione hand gently ron leaned down and kissed her on the cheek which seemed to surprise her a bit she jumped slightly and then peered up at him with a warm smile before turning her gaze back to his rambling mother she was definitely preoccupied but whether or not it was over fred surgery ron was all that sure maybe she needed some food they hadnteaten anything since breakfast ron then turned to harry to inquire if he would like to take a trip to the tearoom hermione was frustrated ron was being as doting and kind as ever if he were feeling at all cramped by her he wouldntact like that so maybe she wasntsmothering him not yet but something about marriage seemed to bother ron his reaction to fred and angelina news had been so odd was it the commitment or the responsibility he had mentioned the issues of titchy rugrats and not being able to do what one wanted when his mother had revealed her desire for hermione to bear her a grandchild ron had reprimanded her had it just been to prevent his mum from embarrassing them both further or had he not wanted to think of it am i just overanalyzing everything hermione wondered for years hermione had told herself that ron did not like her she wasnthis type she was too much of a bookworm and not pretty enough what if she had been right what if ron loved her as a friend and he was getting his emotions confused what if he was just infatuated suddenly hermione was beginning to feel like she had that night in the lean to at ron house after they d snogged she had started panicking a million questions had hit her at once and no matter how ridiculous some of them seemed she couldntstop herself from asking them she wanted to scream hermione hermione snapped her head up as ron called her yes she asked quickly in a higher voice than normal she cleared her throat ron brows were furrowed in concern i was asking you if you were hungry he asked slowly oh no not really she breathed before taking some deep steadying breaths he nodded at her with a deep frown lining his face well after fred surgery we still wontbe able to see him for an hour or so ron said me and harry are going up to the tearoom want to come what about ginny hermione asked concernedly looking over at her friend who was lying down on the bench she and harry had been sharing harry had already stood she staying he said plainly before standing and tugging gently on her hand come with me hermione nodded as she stood from her chair maybe she could calm her nerves with a brisk walk she ron and harry then walked around a corner to the stairs and began the ascent to the fifth floor where the tearoom and hospital shop were located by the time they reached the fifth floor hermione legs were aching a bit from the many stairs but her head did seem to be a bit clearer there was a large open area at the landing to the left was a quaint tearoom with circular tables draped in green tablecloths to the right was the brightly lit hospital shop ron led her into the tearoom harry was close behind as soon as they took their seats at one of the small tables a waitress brought them each a cup of hot tea for them to sip and menus to browse ron and harry each perused their menus while hermione sipped on her tea she truly had no appetite but the boys both ordered sandwiches after the waitress had left with their order harry cleared his throat and leaned over the table a bit toward ron and hermione i need to ask you two something harry said in a low murmur listen i ve really screwed things up what things hermione asked things with with ginny harry replied quietly screwed things up ron asked incredulously mate she been clinging to you like a tick on a yeti everyone knows about what happened yesterday with dean and surely no less than a dozen people saw ginny and i embracing in the corridor today harry continued ignoring ron statement i dontknow what to do harry hermione began tentatively you have this ideal of keeping your feelings for ginny hidden from voldemort but harry it just not feasible it was feasible harry said calmly until i he sighed and shook his head slowly harry it not your fault hermione said softly who else is there to blame hermione harry asked rather harshly just as the waitress appeared with ron and harry sandwiches the girl looked at harry curiously before smiling briefly and scurrying off to the kitchen hermione took a sip of her tea it not your fault that you have a new power that you cantcontrol hermione began in a whisper and it not your fault that ginny had that outburst in the middle of the corridor harry didntrespond or look at hermione he simply took a bite of his sandwich so hermione decided to be a bit bolder with the issue i think it time that you admit to yourself that you can not keep ginny on this roller coaster ride any longer harry i would be surprised if roller coaster ron asked suddenly hermione looked up at his confused expression it a sort of ride ron hermione said muggle entertainment anyway she began again even though ron still looked confused i would be surprised if voldemort doesntalready know about your feelings for ginny but what if he doesn t harry asked quietly harry you cantlet yourself believe that you can shield ginny from all harm because you can t hermione said feeling a bit impatient all of a sudden especially not now not during this war you cantjust take on the responsibility of eliminating the chance of voldemort hurting anyone not me not ron not ginny that is my responsibility harry shouted hermione flinched as she saw the edges of harry irises begin glowing faintly an older couple the only other customers in the small restaurant cast worried glances toward them as they paid their bill and left damn it harry chill out ron said sternly throwing his arm across hermione lap and gripping her knee harry glared at him chill out harry repeated in disbelief his eyes still glowing dimly it is my responsibility to we know harry hermione said delicately harry turned his gaze upon her and ron abruptly stood from his chair and reached across the table he grabbed harry shoulder roughly turning harry to face him dontlook at her he exclaimed breathing heavily if you cantcontrol that that just dont look at her right now harry looked confused for a moment before his expression softened and he closed his eyes tightly i sorry hermione he said in a voice barely above a whisper it alright she responded softly ron released harry shoulder and hermione tugged on his jeans pocket coaxing him to sit back down hard in his chair he turned to hermione and just stared at her for a moment while harry remained silent ron then reached one hand up to her face and traced down the side of her cheek with the back of his finger she clasped his hand in hers and scooted her chair a bit closer to him harry look ron began in a quiet yet firm voice as he turned to face his friend harry opened his eyes and hermione noted that they were no longer glowing i understand why you want to keep this from voldemort but the whole school is talking the whole school harry think about it there malfoy crabbe goyle and parkinson and hell snape and sinistra they say they re reformed but who knows now i wouldntwant anyone other than you dating ginny but if you dontstart dating her and i mean really dating her you re going to to break her heart hermione finished quietly harry sighed and slowly removed his glasses to rub at his eyes with one hand alright he said evenly as he put his glasses back on you two are right but i have a favor to ask ron and hermione exchanged glances before nodding at their friend ron i need you to help me with something harry began i want to drop my defenses again i need to at least try if there anything important that i would be missing by keeping my defenses up i d never forgive myself hermione felt a horribly sick feeling in her stomach as harry continued i know you dontlike the idea hermione but i doing it either way with or without ron it would be safer with him he paused looked down at his half eaten sandwich and stood up slowly i going to go on back down you two can talk about it i d prefer to drop them as soon as we get a chance alone in the dormitories once we re back at hogwarts hermione and ron just stared up at him without speaking as he reached into his pocket and placed some coins on the table enough to pay for his and ron meals he then did some sort of tired wave before turning around and striding from the tearoom as soon as he was out of sight hermione placed her elbows on the table and her head in her hands ron placed his hand on the small of her back and slowly glided it up her spine and back down again i wontdo it unless you say it alright hermione he said softly leaning down to her ear you were disgusted with me after that time at grimmauld place and it was one of the worst feelings in the world hermione looked up from her hands to see deep concern and sincerity in ron eyes excuse me hermione glanced up to see their waitress smiling down at them can i get these plates out of your way she asked sweetly as she poured hermione and ron more tea ron sat his plate atop harry abandoned one and the girl quickly picked them up and rushed off i want you to help him hermione said regretfully he ll do it anyway and it safer when you help him like he said you re sure ron asked his hand still sliding up and down her back hermione leaned toward him and kissed him lightly on his lips before resting her cheek against his and whispering i wontbe angry with you ron she felt his hand move around her side where he rested it on her waist i didntget to thank you for taking me flying hermione said as she pulled away from him slightly ron raised his eyebrows at her thank me he asked disbelievingly for what freezing you half to death scaring you half to death or nearly drowning you hermione giggled i actually quite enjoyed myself she said how that he asked doubtfully i was with you hermione responded in truth causing ron to smile at her in a way that prompted her to ask the question that was burning in her stomach ron hmm i wanted to ask you something about fred and angelina hermione began trying to sound casual ron remained silent as his smile faded she cleared her throat okay she told herself just ask it does an engagement like theirs frighten you just seven words hermione ron pressed he looked a bit anxious well um when do you think the wedding will be hermione asked quickly shoot those were the wrong seven words plus one he actually looked almost disappointed as he responded i ve no idea oh hermione said quietly okay hermione she thought maybe you should start out slow ron yeah do you think angelina and fred are together a lot like everyday i not sure they probably see each other quite a bit why he asked sounding a bit suspicious well hermione swallowed her mouth was very dry do you think that she ever overwhelms him like does he ever well get sick of her being around ron frowned at her in slight confusion as he replied i wouldntimagine i reckon he really loves her really hermione asked hopefully ron raised one eyebrow at her oh double shoot we re supposed to be talking about fred and angelina not us hermione reminded herself hermione why are you suddenly so worried about my brother and angelina ron asked well hermione began hesitantly they ve been really good friends all throughout school you know they were both in gryffindor and in the same year they ate together at lunch and went to the games together i mean played together hermione added quickly before continuing and then out of the blue they start dating well once two best friends start dating how can they possibly go backward they d ruin everything their friendship if they moved backward so they have to move forward dontthey but what if he doesntreally want to marry her and he just asks because he thinks it the next step and then and then they get married and she just ends up driving him mad because she smothers him i mean sometimes he might just want to grab a bottle of butterbeer and find tickets to the next chuddly cannons game right but if he has other responsibilities then he might not be able to just grab a butterbeer and then what will he then realize that he doesntlove her as more than a friend once hermione had finished she began taking deep steadying breaths ron was staring at her with his mouth partway open great hermione thought way to be subtle hermione ron began and she actually thought he looked as if he were trying not to smile are we still talking about fred and angelina he asked before grabbing hold of her hand with one hand and covering his growing smile with the other he was smiling smiling was good smiling was very good hermione opened her mouth to respond but realized she had no idea what to say so she closed it again fortunately she didnthave to think of anything to say because completely without warning ron leaned forward and wrapped his arms around her waist he pulled her to him tightly and one of his hands came to rest on the nape of her neck hermione i love you more than you could ever know he whispered low in her ear and definitely more than a bottle of butterbeer tears immediately began stinging hermione eyes at these words of comfort he pulled away from her and rested his forehead against hers she saw that he was grinning broadly despite her tears she tilted her head back and locked her lips over his the panic and fear in her had been pulled from her chest leaving her feeling almost lightheaded or was that feeling caused by ron kisses she didntknow and she didntcare what did it matter nothing in the world could shatter the feelings of happiness she had at the moment buzz buzz buzz buzz buzz ron pulled his lips from hermione instantly what is that hermione asked breathlessly as she stared up into his face with her beautifully damp brown eyes before ron could respond a lime green card appeared in front of his face out of nowhere there was one in front of hermione face as well they each snatched theirs out of the air and hermione began reading out loud guest of st mungo s please do not panic this alarm indicates the possible detection of an unwelcome intruder if alone try to find a partner or group remain calm while locating an adequate place of obscurity remain hidden until alarm has ceased and an announcement of safety has been given thank you st mungo staff ron and hermione looked up from their cards and into each other eyes ron hurriedly stood from his chair grabbed hermione hands and looked about his surroundings the alarm was still sounding and the waitress that had been serving them was now wailing at the back of the restaurant okay ron thought so unless that girl new here this alarm doesnthappen often keeping a firm grip on one of hermione hands ron ran back to the girl is this the werewolf detection alarm he asked as he retrieved his wand no she sobbed shaking her head furiously it s it s oh what it what ron asked harshly one of his men his men you know who she wailed before running back into the kitchen and slamming the door ron mind was racing there was a death eater inside the hospital how had they gotten passed all of that security he couldntjust stay in this tearoom what about his family and harry what if they needed help but hermione was with him should he leave her here in the tearoom would she be safe in the kitchens with the workers no he couldntleave her ron what are you waiting for hermione asked suddenly we have to go to harry she was tugging on his hand as she tried to make her way toward the door her other hand was holding tightly to her wand without hesitation ron ran with her to the door the hospital shop lights were out but ron could see some guy with a st mungo hat peering over the top of the cash counter looking around quickly ron crept out of the tearoom his wand ready hermione was ready as well he led her to the stairs which he then began descending quickly at each landing he would slow their pace and they would each peer about the area before descending further all of the wards seemed to be in darkness and the corridors looked abandoned ron reckoned most everyone had stayed put when the alarm had sounded with every step ron mind began going through scenarios of what he would do if they came in contact with the intruder what spells would he use what would he do with hermione finally they reached the second floor where there were three separate stairways one leading to the emergency ward waiting room one leading to the main lobby and one leading to the dingy patient ward for creature induced injuries as they reached the top of the stairs that led to the emergency ward waiting area the buzzing stopped and two more cards appeared in front of ron and hermione faces they each snatched them from the air as they had in the tearoom this time ron read aloud guest of st mungo thank you for remaining calm during this alarm the unwelcome intruder has been detected and removed from the facility it is now safe to abandon your current place of obscurity this has been an announcement indicating the reestablishment of your safety thank you st mungo staff ron breathed a sigh of partial relief however he wouldntfeel completely satisfied until they found the others and found out what had happened exactly hermione hand was still clasped tightly in his they looked at each other for a moment before he led them quickly down the last flight of stairs as soon as they reached the waiting room ron mum ran to them and hugged them both around their necks she looked quite frazzled as she dabbed at her eyes with her handkerchief harry and ginny ran to them next they both looked completely together yet somewhat angry are you two alright harry asked quickly ron nodded harry looked at hermione with a strange expression in his eyes before he hugged her tightly around the neck hermione looked a bit taken aback when he released her are you alright hermione asked harry nodded but ginny was frowning at hermione with a very concerned expression what happened ron asked quietly do you know who it was harry and ginny exchanged looks as ron mum ran over to his dad and began whispering angelina and bill were sitting in their waiting room chairs looking quite worried tonks and lupin suddenly appeared behind them on the stairs descending them hurriedly to stand before the four teenagers they ve just arrived harry said quickly lupin exhaled a breath and tonks nodded sharply the security wizards told tonks that the intruder had used some sort of complex disillusionment charm and polyjuice potion to get passed the detection sensors lupin said calmly as tonks nodded in agreement he had the actual wand of the wizard he was impersonating he must have killed the bloke taken his wand and made a potion from him but apparently his potion began fading in the main lobby tonks began with a note of sadness in her voice when the receptionist noticed his changing hair color she activated the alarm so was it a death eater ron asked anxiously tonks simply nodded at him well where is he ron asked hurriedly tonks and lupin exchanged a quick glance lupin answered he escaped he managed to flee out the main entrance doors using a powerful stunning charm on three security wizards at once did anyone discover what he was doing here hermione asked i mean why would he come solo to a place as busy as st mungo s tonks and lupin exchanged another quick glance as did harry and ginny which made ron stomach squirm before tonks cleared her throat and began in a steady yet quiet voice the death eater asked the receptionist if he could see the list of visitors for fred weasley and he he seemed particularly interested in whether or not there were any female visitors ron heart began beating frantically as he stared at tonks had he heard her correctly female visitors he croaked tonks simply nodded at him again ron looked down at hermione distant expression he clenched his hands into fists that began shaking slightly at his sides fred alright ginny said quietly looking sadly from ron to hermione healer gadgil sent a healer aid to notify us that the surgery went well and that fred was in a highly secure recovery ward we ll be able to visit him shortly an hour tops ron nodded at his sister he felt completely numb everyone seemed relatively calm yet disturbed his brother was going to be all right that was great news news that would have given him a great deal of relief if he d been told moments ago in the quiet tearoom now however they seemed to seep into his mind slowly and without much effect the death eater had seemed particularly interested in the female visitors to fred weasley his mum tonks angelina ginny and hermione ginny and hermione were the two most likely to interest a man of voldemort but somehow ron knew that the intruder had not come for ginny he knew with a sickening and unexplainable certainty exactly who the death eater had come for that death eater had been here for hermione to kidnap her to finish the task that had gone wrong over the holidays how could they have known she was here they would have obviously known that fred was injured in an attack they might have assumed he would come to st mungo and that he would have a number of visitors or had they known for sure that hermione was here had someone told them that they had seen harry ginny ron and hermione talking openly of coming to the hospital in the middle of the first floor corridor at hogwarts as ron felt a small delicate hand clasp softly over his shaking hand he was suddenly very eager to go back to the castle and help harry with his recent request author note wow i hope everyone enjoyed this chapter i had fun with it what did ya ll think thanks for the great reviews on 37 they were well great i cantwait to see what everyone thought of this chapter it is my future mother in law birthday tomorrow and we are going to go celebrate tonight but i would like to start working on chapter 39 later tonight well thanks again to my readers and reviewers the characters and situations of harry potter depicted in this story are the legal property of j k rowling bloomsbury and aol time warner and have been used without permission no copyright violation is intended no profit is being made off this site it is for entertainment purposes only author note well guess what i believe that it is necessary to inform everyone of the nearness of my story finale i have had sooo much fun writing this story and it not over by any means but i thought that i should warn everyone of how close the ending is becoming imagine that behind closed eyes is an actual bound book well you are now at the point that when you close the book and look at your bookmark you say oh my gosh how in the world is the author going to wrap everything up in so few pages i have almost laid everything out there and now the time for me to tie all loose ends is approaching also the ending of chapter 38 was altered very slightly b c of a mistake on my part uh oh thank you to katherinep for bringing something to my attention after you said i still dontreally get harry glowing eyes i read back over the parts of this chapter that involved harry eyes and i realized that i jumped the gun a bit with ron train of thought the part at the end where he thinking harry eyes werentglowing if he thought that this incident had anything to do with ginny wouldnthis eyes be glowing that was just a flat out booboo on my part b c he shouldnthave come to that conclusion yet i forgot that there is something you guys and ron dontknow about harry power that made me angry with myself that i did that i tried to find a way around not changing that part of 38 so i wouldntconfuse anybody further but i decided i really needed to there more that harry is going to discover about his new power that will hopefully clear everything up not necessarily in this chapter though if anyone is thoroughly confused now dontbe afraid to ask me what the heck i talking about because there a slight chance that i might know lol now please enjoy thank you chapter 39 seven words in over two hours that wasntnormal for ron was it hermione ron harry and ginny were all walking slowly and lethargically up the grand staircase to their tower they had just returned to hogwarts from the hospital and hermione felt as if she had been given some of fred anesthetic only her emotions were numb not her body after tonks and lupin had explained the break in to hermione and ron everyone had resettled themselves in the plastic waiting room chairs during the rather tense hour of waiting ron had asked hermione are you alright quickly followed by are you sure but the rest of the hour he had simply stared blindly into space when healer gadgil summoned the weasley family and friends to room one thirty two they found fred fast asleep from heavy dosages of sleeping and anesthetic potions he was lying peacefully underneath the covers of his hospital bed but the outcome of his surgery was evident from his elbow down fred right arm was gone the base of the stub was thickly bandaged since fred was asleep no one had really said much of anything hermione made it through the visit without crying actually she hadntfelt even the tiniest of lumps form in her throat even after angelina approached fred form and kissed his right shoulder no tears had fallen from hermione eyes angelina had started crying which had prompted ginny and mrs weasley to cry but still no tears from hermione it had been a very touching scene hadntit hermione had felt numb to it charlie had finally arrived from romania to see his brother he hadntbeen able to come sooner because he had been on the reserve with some injured norwegian ridgebacks at his entrance ron had said hello but nothing more shortly after charlie arrival tonks decided that due to the unexpected break in it would be best for the four teenagers to return to hogwarts before the hogwarts grounds curfew of four pm the four had not been able to speak with fred but they had each written him a short get well letter before flooing back to mcgonagall office they had waved to percy who was grudgingly emptying his pockets for one of the guards in the floo station but none of them including ron actually spoke to him before entering a fireplace tonks had urged them to rush through the floo station without loitering so here they all were walking up the staircase and hermione could count the number of words ron had spoken since the break in on her fingers she had seen the poorly concealed horror on ron face as tonks and lupin had explained what they knew of the intruder intentions she knew exactly why he was being so silent he was thinking about that death eater well hermione was too and in fairness she could count the number of words she d said over the past two hours on one hand although she couldntbegin to count the number of words she d said to herself i can handle this i can turn my fear into determination just as mcgonagall suggested earlier in the week then i wontbe afraid any longer i will be determined to help in the fight against that awful monster she had repeated these words to herself over and over yet she still felt numb numb to every emotion except fear ron had believed for some time that harry dream was authentic but hermione had not fully accepted it it was always in the recesses of her mind she could remember harry words he was really angry because wormtail had failed at some important mission the mission had something to do with kidnapping a muggle born but despite the horrifying assumptions that vision evoked hermione had found ways around believing that it was her that voldemort was after there were tons of muggle borns besides harry dream might not have been real in the first place then lucius malfoy had escaped over the holidays the day before her family home was attacked she knew that it had been this incident that had truly confirmed ron belief in harry dream he believed that wormtail failed mission over the summer was aiding in the breakout of malfoy whom was to have the task of kidnapping hermione but no hermione had thought once the fear and anger subsided the attack on her home over the holidays could have been conducted simply because she was muggle born that what moody had said they werentafter hermione granger they were after any and all muggle borns but now what excuses could she develop what explanation could she conjure to escape from her fears the first time she d left the grounds of hogwarts since the start of term a lone death eater had appeared looking for a female visitor of fred weasley her mind had yet to find an adequate explanation and the result seemed to be this horrible numb feeling lemon meringue harry muttered to the fat lady the portrait door swung open wide allowing them entrance into the quiet common room there were quite a few students scattered about undoubtedly waiting for the evening meal and the fire was roaring she spotted parvati in one corner reading a book seamus was playing chess with an older boy several young girls were sitting around the lounge chairs in quiet conversation i am so sleepy ginny said through a long yawn why dontyou take a nap harry asked quietly she nodded at him and smiled weakly i think i shall she replied before giving a slight wave and turning for the girls staircase just as she turned however harry grabbed her hand ginny turned to him with questioning eyes can i at least get a hug he asked with the smallest of smiles ginny glanced about the room before whispering harry you donthave to do this without hesitation harry pulled her to him and wrapped his arms about her ginny body shook with a soft sob as she clung to him hermione noted a small drop in the noise level of the room and glanced around to see quite a few people watching her friends and as harry bent his head to kiss her hermione saw someone descending the stairs to the boys dormitories dean faltered a bit on the last step as he saw harry and ginny embraced and kissing but he ducked his head and began walking toward the portrait hole door after harry and ginny broke their kiss harry happened to glance up and see dean just as he was reaching the exit dean harry called dean stopped in his tracks and slowly turned to look at harry the room noise level decreased again and hermione saw many people blatantly staring i d like to speak with you harry said evenly dean looked a bit hesitant but he nodded hermione glanced over at the chess table and saw that seamus was staring intently at his friend and harry you go take that nap harry said softly as he looked down at ginny she smiled up at him and wiped her damp eyes before standing on her toes to kiss him one last time she then ascended the stairs to her dormitory harry turned back to dean who was staring straight down at the floor hermione grabbed hold of ron hand and quickly led him to the boys dormitory stairs she knew that harry meant to apologize and she figured that he and dean should probably have some privacy of course the two boys would probably have to leave the tower altogether in order to have adequate privacy but hermione didntwant her eyes and ears to be a part ofany eavesdropping so up the stairs she led ron and into the empty dormitory empty harry words from earlier suddenly echoed in her mind he had said that he d prefer to drop his defenses as soon as we get a chance alone in the dormitories ron hermione began apprehensively where is neville it saturday he said quietly not even looking at her his voice was almost lifeless as he took a seat on the edge of his bed no one stays up here much on saturdays hermione simply nodded she knew that they would find a moment alone in the dormitories sooner or later but hermione had hoped it would be later hermione ron began in the same lifeless tone only he did look at her dontfeel like you have to stay in here when harry drops his defenses hermione crossed the room to sit down on the bed next to ron i dontfeel like i have to she began quietly i want to ron expressionless eyes turned sad just as the door opened slowly with a creak harry entered closing the door behind him he waved his hand over the handle and hermione heard a soft click she had never been claustrophobic but she suddenly felt as if the walls were closing in around her we need to hurry harry said hastily as he crossed to the middle of the room i dontexpect seamus dean or neville to return any time soon but i dontknow how long ginny will nap so you arentgoing to tell her about this hermione asked blandly no he replied taking off his glasses and tossing them on his bed ron stood up from his own bed and slowly approached harry how d it go with dean ron asked i apologized he apologized harry said hurriedly let get this over with ron sighed alright ready he asked hesitantly it looked as if ron were just as apprehensive about this as hermione harry closed his eyes and nodded just as he d done at grimmauld place ron moved to stand behind harry where he then put his arms firmly around him pinning harry arms to his sides harry took a deep breath and then everything was completely silent except for the sound of hermione jeans rustling as she bobbed her knees up and down rapidly harry and ron both had their eyes closed and neither of them were moving a muscle hermione harry said suddenly causing her heart to stop ron eyes shot open as he looked to her worriedly imperturbable harry added quietly hermione breathed a deep sigh as she slowly stood from the bed blimey harry ron said as he breathed a sigh of his own you trying to kill me sorry harry said sincerely keeping his eyes closed tight hermione quickly crossed to the door and uttered the imperturbable charm alright hermione said once finished her legs suddenly felt a bit unstable so she decided to remain by the door in case she couldntmake it all the way back to ron bed once again everything became silent from her current location she could only see the back of ron standing tall she couldntsee harry face and that was a good thing she remembered the horrible pained look on harry face from last time and she didntwant to see it again maybe he just wontsee anything hermione thought oh please dontsee anything suddenly however hermione heard harry take a sharp intake of breath and she saw ron readjust his footing harry wasntmoving or convulsing as he had before but his breathing was quickening was his expression pained were his eyes still closed were his eyes open and fearful oh hermione thought miserably i cantstand this she quickly marched around ron and harry so that she was standing a few feet from them ron blue eyes were open and anxious as his gaze met hers harry expression didntlook pained yet his eyes were still tightly closed he was breathing heavily with a worried wrinkle above his nose he suddenly took in another sharp breath his frown seemed to deepen as his shoulders flinched one time this was horrible he was seeing something he was receiving a vision one of those awful visions and hermione was confined to standing and watching in silence her numbness to emotion seemed to lessen a bit as sadness coupled with her fear the only thing that was keeping her from crying was the eye contact that she held with ron no harry said firmly hermione heart rate quickened it wasnta whine or a plea it almost sounded like a command harry then clenched his hands into tight fists as he spoke again no i wont leave you bastard harry shouted hermione didntrealize she was backing away from him until she bumped into the stone wall behind her ron was still gazing at her but his eyes were now wide with confusion and worry what was happening who was harry talking to was he talking to hermione head was beginning to feel fuzzy it been a while harry said through clenched teeth haventyou missed me some sort of a deep almost malicious sounding chuckle followed harry question is that fear in your voice you sick coward ah harry suddenly jerked his head back fiercely into ron chest and his knees began to buckle ron moved his own head back but stood his ground harry eyes slowly flickered open and he looked straight at hermione with pain now etching every feature of his face he was completely still again harry hermione asked tentatively taking a step toward him it over he said weakly ron slowly released his hold on harry who stumbled to his bed and sat down quickly he pressed two fingers to his scar and closed his eyes harry ron asked quietly i entered his mind harry muttered i entered his mind and he he saw me or felt me or whatever he knew i was there does your scar hurt ron asked yes harry said as he lowered his fingers from his forehead and looked up at them both before he knew i was there i saw him torturing lucius malfoy harry looked down after these words with a disgusted look malfoy hermione asked feeling her numbness return with the cruciatus curse harry shook his head slowly before glancing up at hermione with a look that appeared somewhat apologetic it made hermione stomach churn voldemort said that harry began he faltered and took a breath before continuing he told lucius that he d had his last chance then he he told him that he needed to remind him of his oath he grabbed malfoy arm and began cutting the outline of the dark mark into his skin with some sort of wandless cutting spell hermione put a hand to her mouth as the sick feeling in her stomach worsened last chance ron asked hoarsely ignoring the last bit of harry comment yeah harry said not looking at either of them what were his exact words to malfoy ron asked hurriedly hermione could see that ron was breathing heavily by the heaving of his chest harry looked from ron to hermione and back you ve failed me twice harry began quietly that was your last chance the task is no longer yours harry looked down at his knees before muttering after that is when he felt me in his mind hermione watched as the color drained from ron face and he turned to look at her she was now leaning fully against the cold stone of the wall because she felt quite faint ron broke their stare and ran one hand roughly through his hair before taking two long strides to his bedside cabinet he gripped the top of it with both hands and leaned against it briefly she could see his knuckles turn white and she thought that he might turn the cabinet over but instead he picked up an empty water glass and turned to throw it across the room where it shattered against the wall opposite hermione he then shouted an expletive that she had never heard him use before but she wasntabout to reprimand him he sat down hard on the edge of his bed rested his elbows on his knees and dropped his head to his hands closing her eyes tightly hermione willed herself to refrain from running to him if she did she would start to feel again and she found slight solace in her numbness so what task is he referring to hermione asked dully both ron and harry looked at her with puzzled expressions she knew the answer to her question but she needed to hear someone say it then it would be real then she might comprehend it because at the moment nothing seemed real not even the moment itself she felt as if she would soon wake from this nightmare hermione harry began softly i think it s it about you hermione simply nodded ron was staring at her sadly and he made a move to stand but she stepped away from him he slowly settled back down with a look of slight confusion and hurt he had been about to come to her side and comfort her but if he did that she would definitely start to feel again she might even break down and cry she chose to remain numb it was better this way were you talking to him hermione asked and she was surprised that her voice sounded steady and almost casual harry nodded once he knew i was invading his mind he yelled for me to get out i could feel him trying to push me from his mind he was afraid he said firmly almost to himself he was eventually able to push me out but he was afraid were you asked hermione no harry stated firmly before looking up at her and thenron who now had his head in his hands again listen that vision i had of ginny over the holidays harry began dazedly now staring out of the window i dontthink it was from voldemort what do you mean hermione asked ron looked up from his hands i mean i didntsee it through voldemort eyes harry began i know what it feels like when he in my mind and i know what it feels like when i in his when i had that vision of ginny i was seeing it through my eyes hermione and ron exchanged a quick glance before ron spoke in a hoarse voice are you saying you saw it as in you have an inner eye he asked skeptically yes no harry replied before releasing an impatient sigh i dontknow but hermione began harry you ve had visions before that you didntrealize were from voldemort harry shook his head and stood from his bed no this is different i cantexplain it hermione it just different you should tell dumbledore then hermione said firmly if you go now you might can catch him before dinner harry nodded at her alright he said as he began walking toward the door if i not back for the meal tell ginny the truth i ve gone to speak with dumbledore about my vision of her just leave out the part about me dropping my defenses again he exited the room without waiting for a response leaving her and ron alone in the dormitory ron was staring absently into the center of the room hermione didntknow what to do seeing him throw that glass across the room had been one of the angriest outbursts she d ever seen ron have did he want to be alone did he want her to comfort him and what about her did she want to be alone did she want to be comforted she honestly didntknow anymore harry you cantlet yourself believe that you can shield ginny from all harm because you can t those were hermione exact words to harry just hours earlier ron had agreed with her completely harry needed to get a firm grip on reality because it seemed to be slipping from him he had to understand that he was only human but now ron was looking at those words in a whole new light turning the tables a bit he tried to tell himself ron you cantlet yourself believe that you can shield hermione from all harm because you cant in that light the words angered him he was sitting on his bed in silence but his insides were screaming screaming in fury and confusion disgust and hatred he shouldnthave shown his feelings like he had after harry revealed voldemort words he hadntmade hermione feel any better by blowing up like that and she had even backed away from him suddenly however ron felt a warm body sit down beside him on his bed while in his daze hermione had come to his side with an unreadable expression how was she being so calm so seemingly unconcerned ron hermione began as she locked her eyes on his with an intense gaze i dontthink he going to stop until someone completes his task until someone has taken me ron felt as if her words had taken the breath out of him but he swallowed hard and turned toward her to take her hands in his you dontknow that he said in the strongest voice he could muster lucius malfoy is probably one of his strongest men and he failed twice we re one step ahead of him and that why he wontbe able to to find you ron finished with some difficulty he had meant to say to take you but he couldn t hermione began shaking her head as he finished his statement ron we re talking about the most powerful dark wizard of our time he knows that if he wants to live he has to kill harry and he found a perfect way to get harry to come to him me she said quietly but it not a perfect way ron said firmly he ll never be able to get to you hermione you re too well protected hermione suddenly stood up from the bed lord voldemort ron voldemort he been sending death eaters to take me she yelled as she began pacing and it not as if malfoy mistakes were huge if i had been at my house over the holidays he would have succeeded if his polyjuice potion hadntworn off when it did he would have succeeded these are small mistakes ron one that can and will be easily rectified i am only standing here in front of you right now because of luck it has nothing to do with me being well protected hermione please ron muttered low in his throat as he stood from the bed she took a step away from him again so he stood his ground you know what mcgonagall said to me after class that day hermione asked feverishly without giving him time to answer she told me that i wasntperforming well in defense against the dark arts because i had developed a fear of death eaters but she also told me how to fix that problem she said i just have to change my fear into determination to fight against them so i just have to be determined to fight ron hermione paused looking into his eyes before adding i cantbe afraid hermione voice broke slightly on this last declaration she turned her back on him then and quickly covered her face with her hands as a soft sob shook her he didntknow whether or not she wanted him to touch her but he had to ron approached her slowly from behind and placed his hands gently on her shoulders she immediately turned toward him and threw her arms around his neck where she began sobbing against his chest his arms encircled her i scared ron she cried into his shirt i just really scared a huge lump formed in his throat but he only allowed one tear to roll down his cheek he had to be strong for hermione her arms were still about his neck so he scooped her up and cradled her her small body went almost limp as he carried her to his bed and laid her down gently sitting down beside her he leaned over her placing his arms on either side of her head and resting his forehead against hers listen to me hermione ron began whispering against her damp cheek as she continued to sob i know you re scared love i know you are but i right here and that where i always going to be he placed a warm kiss upon her cheek as her sobs subsided slightly and she looked into his face and nodded he thought she looked as though his words had really meant something to her she brought one hand up to wipe at her eyes ron she asked in a pitiful tone that prompted him to kiss her on each eyelid yes love can i ask you for something anything can i have one of your shirts ron leaned back from her slightly so that he could see her face her eyes were red and puffy her hair was messy and her cheeks were splotchy she d never looked more beautiful one of my shirts he asked curiously removing a stray strand of her hair from her forehead had he heard her right she simply nodded at him why do you want one of my shirts i want to enchant it to hermione began sounding a bit timid to smell like you and and sleep in it this unexpected comment caused ron to raise his eyebrows and smile dumbly you want to sleep in a shirt that smells like me ron asked actually quite flattered she bit her bottom lip and nodded so what do i smell like he inquired the earth hermione said matter of factly and soap this made ron chuckle for some reason she gave him a small smile yet her eyebrows were still raised in an inquisitive arch of course you can have one of my shirts ron said softly as he took hold of her hands and lifted her into a seated position take your pick he added indicating to his trunk at the foot of his bed she wrapped her arms around his neck giving him a soft kiss before she stood slowly from the bed and crossed to his trunk she then sat down on the floor after opening it he sat watching her as she rummaged through his things watching her was bittersweet after the revelation of harry most recent vision sweet noting how absolutely adorable she looked picking up articles of clothing looking them over only to replace them and scrutinize another yet bitter knowing that because of her fear she was looking for a shirt to sleep in that could possibly give her a bit more comfort and feelings of security suddenly however she gasped and looked up at ron with wide eyes what ron asked hurriedly standing from the bed she reached one hand into the trunk while keeping eye contact and pulled out a small pair of pale pink knickers ronald bilius weasley she exclaimed standing hastily from the floor with the knickers held out in front of her with two fingers oh blimey ron groaned they arentyours hermione i can explain i thought yes they re mine she cried her eyes still wide with shock really ron asked with an unintentional smile that he quickly wiped from his face as hermione eyes got even wider did you nick these she asked in disbelief no ron exclaimed quickly i did not nick your knickers his face felt very warm as she raised a disbelieving eyebrow at him he continued quickly my mum stuck them in my laundry by accident over the holiday i just threw them in there and forgot about them honest hermione well ron thought that was honest for the most part he had thrown them in there and forgotten that the actual article of clothing lay in his trunk but he hadnt forgotten the images that they evoked of course he wasntabout to tell her that hermione eyes had gone from wide to squinting and her lips were pursed well she began slowly still holding the garment out from her i believe you but if this ever happens again ronald could you please return my unmentionables ron tried not to smile at her stern expression but he didntdo a very good job fortunately hermione response to his smile was a timid one of her own just then however something very unfortunate happened the door to the dormitory swung open without a bit of warning and hermione eyes went wide once more as she quickly shoved her knickers into her jeans pocket ron spun around and saw to his great dismay seamus finnigan a wide eyed and roguishly smiling seamus finnigan be the bleedin oly seamus breathed if yer two are playin dress up can i make a suggestion as ter who gets ter wear those beauties seamus ron warned trying to keep his cool despite seamus smirk seamus chuckled before looking at hermione and wagging his eyebrows at her a couple of times although i prefer green sweetheart he said hermione crossed her arms uncomfortably and looked down at her feet shut it seamus ron said harshly as he moved slightly in front of hermione i just jokin around mate seamus said with a shrug as he crossed to his bedside cabinet to dab on some cologne for the evening meal dontget yer knickers in a knot he added with a mischievous smile ron took a deep breath as his heart rate began to quicken considerably his tolerance for this playful banter about hermione undergarments was virtually nonexistent i warning you now to stop ron said quietly hermione was remaining very silent as she averted her eyes from seamus completely seamus rolled his eyes ya know yer not as bad as harry but you could both chucker with a better sense o humor i wontforget tha shite he pulled on dean yesterday apology or not he said sounding quite agitated as he headed for the door where he paused if yer worried bout them rumors dontbe why would i give a pixie arse who ya screw anyway ron eyes began to burn with his anger as he took a couple of long steps toward seamus who looked a bit startled ron grabbed a handful of seamus shirt collar as he glared at him seamus startled expression quickly turned to anger though as he balled his fist and reared it back if she werenthere i swear seamus said glaring at ron ron don t hermione cried suddenly he heard her approaching and then felt her squeeze in between himself and seamus she then wrapped her small arms around his waist with a sigh ron encircled hermione waist with his free arm and released his dorm mate collar taking care to push him quite hard in the chest in the process which caused him to stumble into the door seamus quickly and roughly righted himself and straightened his collar i take it back seamus exclaimed angrily yer as much a nutter as yer bloody friend before ron could retaliate to this remark seamus had hurried out slamming the door shut behind him ron took a deep breath as he glanced down at hermione who was still clinging to him i sorry hermione he said for what she asked lifting her head from his chest with furrowed brows she actually truly looked confused for that ron said with wide eyes if i hadntkept those he patted her pocket containing the knickers in my trunk like a prat that wouldnthave happened ronald if you re going to apologize hermione began moving back from him slightly and placing her hands upon her hips apologize for almost taking seamus head off you really need to work on your temper what if i hadntbeen in here would you have punched him ron looked down at her serious expression they were only a foot apart and he d really like to embrace her again but he knew she would only back away from him until she d had her say yes he responded truthfully well you ll just have to work on that she said matter of factly walking over to his still open trunk and squatting down beside it to rummage some more not that he didntdeserve to be slugged she added as she rummaged it just that well you are a wizard and it doesntmatter that your brute strength could throw him across the room like your water glass while he could probably only push you mildly hard ron smiled to himself hermione had never complimented his brute strength before of course it was in the midst of a reprimand but he d still enjoyed it she finally stood from the trunk with a plain white t shirt in her hands after holding it up and looking it over she smelled of it and actually hugged it to her before turning to him and continuing as if she hadntjust lovingly embraced a piece of his clothing you are a wizard she repeated with a nod of her head you may throw a punch but your opponent could throw a really bad curse or hex slight boys like seamus wontalways use their hands to defend themselves ron okay so so just be more careful ron approached her slowly and placed his hands on her hips she smiled up at him and she seemed to be blushing a bit at his sudden nearness i ll be more careful ron replied she nodded at him and he noticed her eyes move to his lips as he began bending down to kiss her however she placed her fingers over his mouth with one hand the light touch was a tease even if she didntrealize this fact oh and she began thank you for he asked against her fingers before kissing them she traced her fingers down over his chin and down over his adam apple and then removed them as she placed a tender kiss at the center of his collarbone he gripped her hips tighter and she whispered against his neck for almost punching him he chuckled at her but she kissed him just under his chin in a way that he found very seductive it stopped his laughter abruptly are you three coming to dinner the unexpected and frankly unappreciated voice of ginny called as the door creaked open ron and hermione both turned to look at her tired and cross expression which was quickly changing to confusion as she looked about the room where harry she asked grudgingly taking a step away from hermione ron told his sister about harry trip to see dumbledore the three of them then made their way out of gryffindor tower and down to the great hall a few people stopped them along the way to offer their condolences to ron and ginny for fred injury surprisingly lavender brown was among them and she and hermione shared decently civil smiles the three of them then stayed in the great hall long after they were finished eating and until all of the plates had been cleared just in case harry had shown he hadn t only then had they left for the common room where they resumed their wait for harry it was now nearing nine o clock and ron was really beginning to wonder how his friend meeting was going ginny seemed to be wondering too but a bit less patiently than ron she kept asking the same two questions over and over as they sat in the common room playing wizard chess so what was he going to ask him about exactly the vision he had of you over the holidays hermione replied calmly moving a pawn in a not so strategic position he doesntthink it was from voldemort she added right ginny said nodding her head absently and looking toward the portrait door but when do you think he ll get back she asked anxiously ron sighed heavily as he took one of hermione knights ginny ron began as hermione was busy reprimanding her knight for being too slow you know harry and dumbledore talks always end up being hours long i know ginny said softly but you dontthink ron and hermione both looked up as ginny voice cracked slightly and she swallowed hard her eyes looked teary but she was keeping her tears at bay ginny hermione prompted gently turning in her seat to address her well ginny said in a small voice you dontthink that dumbledore would advise harry not to see me anymore do you ginny hermione said crossing to sit beside her friend on the small sofa and put her arm about her that is truly something you dontneed to waste one moment worrying about harry has made up his mind on that issue how do you know ginny whispered i just know hermione said soothingly glancing up at ron he knew that one of the reasons hermione was so firm in that belief was because they had recently witnessed harry willingly dropping his defenses again but they werentto tell ginny that ginny nodded at hermione looking slightly mollified and rested her head upon her friend shoulder i think i d like to go on to bed i wontworry about him if i asleep ginny said softly lifting her head hermione stood up immediately well then that what we ll do she said firmly let all go to bed we ve had a long and stressful day that was true ron thought was it the same saturday that he had enjoyed a romantic broom ride on the quidditch pitch with hermione and he was a bit sleepy maybe an early bed would be best for all of them he and ginny stood up with hermione who looked down at the chess table and gnawed on her bottom lip she reached down and moved one of her pieces to take one of ron s she then looked up at him rather innocently causing him to bite the insides of his cheeks to keep from grinning as he looked back down at the board his poorly concealed smile escaped him glancing back up at hermione with an innocent look of his own he reached down and moved one of his knights without bothering to look at the board he deliberately kept eye contact with her at the sound of a shattering piece ron simply said checkmate hermione mouth fell open slightly and ginny giggled hermione placed her hands just below ron ribcage where she then squeezed hard causing him to jerk and wheeze with laughter she began giggling as she continued her sudden bout of tickling instinctively ron grabbed hermione wrists and pried them away from him while he continued to laugh ginny apparently got bored as she waved at them both halfheartedly and headed for the girls stairwell with hermione small wrists clasped tightly he placed her hands on the nape of his neck as he pulled her to him he heard a couple of low whistles which caused hermione cheeks to rouge and ron stomach to turn i sort of forgot we werentalone he muttered truthfully he anxiously thought of the rumors of he and hermione and realized what some of the minds in this room would be thinking as they watched them flirting me too she whispered but she stood up on her toes and placed a lingering kiss on his lips this got them a few more whistles and a couple of claps but ron ignored them and hugged hermione to him it meant a lot to ron that she didntcare enough about the rumors to hide any emotions she had for him he would have loved to invite her up into his dormitory for a while seamus and dean usually stayed up late on saturday nights but he wasntabout to walk up into his empty dormitory with hermione in tow with all of the people currently present so as they broke away from their embrace he kissed her once more on her lips before leading her to her stairs where they bid each other goodnight once ron was in his empty dormitory changing into his pajamas he began smiling to himself hermione wanted to sleep throughout the night wrapped in his scent wow that thought definitely made the room feel a bit warmer ron decided he could just sleep in his flannel pants it was just too warm for a long sleeved shirt as ron tossed his shirt back inside his trunk he thought of the wide eyed look he d seen on hermione face when she d found those knickers that truly were hers wow ron wiped a hand over his brow as he pulled the covers back on his bed of course he then saw the stupid smiling face of seamus finnigan when he d seen those knickers now it was even warmer but for a completely different reason ron stripped his pants and threw them in his trunk as well before closing it shut this was definitely a night for boxers careful sorry hermione whoa watch it oh shoot that was close hermione and ginny were slowly maneuvering their way between the many gryffindor students still awake in the common room on this rainy saturday night they had finally reached the boys stairwell when a fifth year boy had run passed them and had almost barreled right into hermione that would have been horrible they were so close to ron and harry a few minutes earlier hermione had been lying awake in her bed trying her hardest to go to sleep she just wasntall that sleepy and she missed ron terribly he had been so caring earlier so she had been pleasantly surprised when ginny voice had whispered through her curtains inviting her along on a late night run to the boys dormitory of course she had consented she had been lying awake in her bed for a full hour and she was nowhere near drifting off to sleep ginny hadntbeen asleep either when she d overheard one of her dorm mates exclaiming excitedly that harry potter had just arrived in the common room and held a brief yet civil conversation with dean thomas ginny had then wasted no time in donning the invisibility cloak and coming for hermione and now they had finally reached the dormitory pushing the door open ever so gently they stepped inside the quiet dark room harry ron and neville bed curtains were all pulled closed ginny quickly led hermione over to ron bed their feet patting softly on the hard floor hermione moved the curtains back slowly and peered inside all she could see was a large mass hidden under the covers which seemed to be breathing heavily she already had experience by now with waking ron and knew that it could sometimes take a moment so she went ahead and crawled onto the bed waving at ginny who then tiptoed away allowing the curtains to fall closed around hermione and ron he was definitely asleep she could now hear a soft snoring from him maybe she could jus slip under the covers without waking him gently hermione pulled a section of the covers down and slipped beneath them into the cool sheets with some awkward maneuverings she was finally able to lie down beside ron warm body very warm body naked body hermione heart began beating rapidly in her chest as she reached a hand out to ron shoulder he was lying on his back with one leg bent at the knee she slid her hand down his bare chest slowing as she past his navel okay hermione thought good elastic waist she breathed a sigh of relief and scooted in closer to him wait her legs were touching his as she lay next to him on her side with her hand now resting on his chest but hermione moved her hand down to one of his legs and rubbed her hand across his thigh his bare thigh was he in his boxers hermione covered her mouth with her hand she had just gotten in bed with ron while he was merely wearing his underwear he would be mortified if he awoke with her lying here beside him he d never let her back in his bed again should she leave should she just get out of the bed and run for it no the common room was packed suddenly ron stirred and hermione froze okay hermione thought she had made up her mind she would go over to harry bed and get ginny to walk her back to the girls dormitory hermione slowly raised back into a seated position pulling the covers down off of her but as she turned her torso to drape her legs over the side of the bed she felt a warm hand clasp tightly over her arm hermione closing her eyes tight hermione sighed slightly before turning back around to look at ron who was sitting up on his elbows the covers were now down around his waist exposing his naked chest to her wandering eyes he looked incredibly appealing with his sleep tousled crimson locks accentuating his pale freckled face his face was so stern and handsome with his current expression of disorientation since hermione was too engrossed in gazing at ron body to speak he sat up fully and turned toward her which caused the covers to move down to his mid thigh exposing his red and orange plaid boxers she closed her eyes tightly as she felt his hands grip her upper arms hermione what wrong he asked urgently she slowly opened her eyes and forced herself to keep eye contact with him you you re unclothed she breathed even in the dim light hermione could see his face turn a darker shade as he glanced down at his body he quickly released her arms and pulled the covers up around his waist again he then opened his mouth a couple of times without saying anything and she knew the mortification she feared he would suffer was taking effect i sorry ron she whispered i just couldntsleep and then ginny invited me under the cloak i really wanted to see you again but i hadnteven thought that you might well that i might see you in in your shorts i going to get ginny to take me back no ron whispered quickly grabbing hold of her hand before she could move one muscle please just just wait right here quite without warning ron threw the covers from him flung his legs over the edge of the bed and exited the curtains leaving hermione with her mouth hanging open he had left the bed with haste but she had still seen a glimpse of his body in the moonlight and she was suddenly quite breathless she still hadntmoved a muscle by the time the curtains moved once more and ron entered now wearing flannel pants he still had no shirt on and for that hermione was glad she could honestly stare at him all night and be perfectly content what was the matter with her was she so base that ron nude form could strip her mind of rational thought a large yet gentle hand suddenly gripped her chin and turned her face upward to look into two blue eyes smiling eyes sorry hermione said quietly it quite alright ron replied with a grin i seem to be missing my favorite white t shirt though so i was forced to sleep without one he said placing a hand on his chest oh is it really your favorite hermione asked glancing down at ron t shirt which she was sporting over her blue cotton sleeping shorts it is now he replied evenly she glanced up and saw him looking at her with a playful smile ron she chastised slipping back beneath the covers he chuckled at her and joined her in lying down fully they were each on their sides facing one another and gazing into one another eyes ron immediately wrapped his arm around her waist and pulled her against his chest a warm current moved through her body that was only intensified when he moved his hand under her shirt to rub her back her hand which was resting on his chest soon slid around the side of his torso to his back hermione ron began their faces were touching and she felt his lips move across hers as he spoke yeah i have a confession hermione leaned her head back slightly to better see his expression which was frowning a confession hermione had no idea what that could be but it was causing her to hold her breath so she wished he would hurry and tell her hermione you know how i ve been sleeping like hell lately ron okay you know how i ve been sleeping poorly yes it started the night after we slept together oh hermione asked a bit breathlessly she was fairly sure she knew where this was leading and it had caused her heart to begin beating rather quickly ron squeezed her a bit tighter and the hand that was rubbing her back stopped to hold her i slept better with you than i think i ve ever slept he whispered his mouth now moving against hers again me too she replied truthfully after her response ron lips locked over hers he began kissing her so slowly and passionately it nearly took hermione breath away all things were swept from her mind except this strange rhythm that began coursing through her veins she didntunderstand it really but it was a rhythm that matched ron kisses which were actually more like loving caresses it was a rhythm that was guiding her hand along his back and it was a rhythm that made her entire body suddenly move against his causing him to moan deeply and her to gasp she turned her head from his lips as she tried to catch her breath and understand what had just happened ron hand had now moved from her back to her waist where he was continuing this rhythm in the way he moved his fingers along her side she opened her tightly closed eyes to peer into his which were however still closed his jaw muscle was working fiercely she had bet on that and his chest was heaving with his breaths she was fairly sure that he wasntreally consciously rubbing his fingers on her side in that strange rhythm which is what had happened to her it hadnthappened consciously embarrassment at her action was flooding her face but she didntknow what to say what had come over her what was ron thinking and why despite her embarrassment did she really just want to kiss him more hermione even the unexpected sound of his voice and the feeling of his breath on her cheek sent wonderful chills over her she tried to open her mouth and say i sorry but nothing came out hermione are you alright ron asked tentatively hermione took a deep breath and then let it out before rolling onto her back and looking up into ron concerned face he was peering down at her now propped up on his elbow i dontreally know what to say to that she replied truthfully well what do you mean he prompted as his hand moved around to rest on her stomach i mean that i dontknow if i alright she said softly i didntmean to to move against you like that i wasnttrying to be more desirable to you or anything it just sort of happened and i sorry when hermione finished her lame excuse for an explanation ron just continued to stare at her gnawing absently on his bottom lip hermione realized that she was rapidly tapping her fingers on his back so she stopped herself hermione ron began with a note of uncertainty in his voice i a beginner at this too but i know that you moving like that is just well natural i mean i think it is i dontknow because i ve never been with anyone else obviously and i know you werenttrying to be more desirable quite frankly i honestly cantimagine how you could become any more desirable to me than you already are he said with a somewhat nervous chuckle before clearing his throat and continuing with a serious expression anyway the point is you shouldntbe sorry for anything it just shows me that you find me desirable too well i mean i reckon you do he finished before glancing down nervously of course i do hermione cried placing her hand over his which was still resting on her stomach my heart is still beating like mad justfrom kissing you a small smile spread across ron face still he asked with an adorable expression of boyish excitement yes still she replied softly and truthfully her heart was still beating frantically and its pace was beginning to quicken at the urge she was suddenly tempted to act upon as they stared at one another hermione held her breath as she took hold of ron hand and keeping eye contact placed it over her heart can you feel it beating she whispered she was sure he could now as it had begun beating so hard she could feel it in her ears he simply nodded slowly as his look became stern she glimpsed his jaw muscle twitch once before he glided his hand gently across her chest and tucked it underneath her shoulder blade she gasped slightly and by his stern expression she thought he might swoop down and kiss her madly as they had done many times before but he didnt he lowered his head down slowly to rest beside hers as he slid his arm down her back and pulled her onto her side to face him closing his eyes he rested his forehead against hers and said simply i love you hermione against her lips i love you too she whispered back before closing her eyes and kissing him tenderly he returned her kiss and they soon found another rhythm however this one was different this rhythm was slow it was extremely caring it made hermione feel secure this rhythm lulled hermione into the most peaceful sleep she d ever experienced author note well i hope everyone enjoyed this chapter i know it took a while for me to post it

profit is being made off this site it is for entertainment purposes only chapter 4 ron was smiling at his eggs not because he particularly liked their taste this morning but because he was a besotted idiot he had gone to sleep the night before smiling and he d woken up that way all because of a simple kiss on the cheek it was only the second one he d ever received from hermione but he cherished the memory of both of them why couldnthe be normal like harry not in the sense that harry was a famous wealthy and talented wizard destined to save their world but in the way that he could look at hermione like a sister ron had not once caught harry goggling at hermione ron had caught himself doing it a multitude of times if his theory of every boy crushes on his female best friend at some point were to hold up harry was going to have to goggle sooner or later but ron really didntthink he would he d better not ron are you okay harry asked from across the wooden table ron looked up to see his best friend looking at him curiously hermione was sitting down a ways with ginny it seemed to ron that hermione had been ignoring him this morning maybe she was regretting kissing him maybe it had grossed her out once she realized what she d done maybe he was paranoid fine ron replied simply looking back down at his eggs suddenly hermione got up from beside ginny to come sit beside harry she looked a little disturbed just look back down at your eggs both of you hermione said rummaging through her book satchel ron and harry exchanged looks of suspicion uh hermione what are you looking for ron asked simply nothing she said looking up at him with wide eyes i pretending to look for something luna is coming over here from the ravenclaw table so ron said exchanging another suspicious look with harry hermione looked up at him with her lips pursed and her eyes squinted that look had always made him want to either kiss her or arm wrestle her ron we have our n e w t classes ahead of us in addition to our first healing class ever she slammed her satchel on the table and brought her elbows to rest in front of her tapping the pads of her fingers together nervously i dontwant her coming over here and talking nonsense i need to be mentally prepared for the day not worrying about some made up creature or imaginary whatever harry turned to look at hermione with an annoyed expression she really nice hermione not to mention a bit unpopular i think you should give her a chance hermione looked at harry and her frantic expression immediately melted into an apologetic frown she opened her mouth a few times without saying anything ron noticed that while hermione was busy feeling guilty luna was in fact coming straight toward them she sat down quietly by ron and stared at him with her humongous light gray eyes hermione normal sized eyes were having trouble finding one expression they were apologetic guilty and a bit mortified as she looked at luna hello luna said in a small whispery voice still staring at ron he smiled at her kindly remembering what harry had just said ron really didnthave a problem with luna he didntunderstand why she bothered hermione so much you broke draco malfoy jaw yesterday she said casually to ron before she looked up at the partly cloudy ceiling her sandy blonde hair nearly touching the floor harry was smiling at ron with amusement hermione still looked remorseful but had now turned her gaze upon ron how do you know ron asked disbelievingly he hadnthit malfoy that hard had he luna looked down from the ceiling and looked at ron tilting her head to one side as if trying to find the meaning of some sort of abstract painting well i saw him lying in the hospital wing and madam pomfrey said that if he didntstop whining his jaw restructuring potion wouldntwork so naturally she had to use an adhesive charm on his mouth to keep it closed ron felt as if christmas had come early harry reached across the table laughing and slapped ron shoulder i broke the bastard jaw brilliant ron laughed and pounded the table a couple of times with his fist before seeing the worried look on hermione face his smile slowly faded what wrong hermione didntyou hear what luna said hermione simply nodded and smiled weakly luna looked over at hermione calmly i really did see him you know dennis creevey had fallen out of a tree on the grounds and i took him to the hospital wing that when i saw draco oh i believe you really i do hermione said reassuringly to luna her face resumed its guilty and apologetic look harry and ron exchanged knowing looks before a loud screech echoed through the great hall ron looked up to see the owls arriving luna stood up suddenly i see my owl bye and with that she turned and walked slowly over to her seat at her own house table hermione looked after her miserably pigwidgeon flew straight down to ron shoulder with a small letter tied to his leg harry hadntreceived anything but a hogwart barn owl had dropped a copy of the daily prophet in front of hermione who dropped a coin in the owl pouch and grabbed the paper quickly tearing it open her eyes went wide she spread the paper out in the middle of the table so all three of them could see the headline as hermione began reading aloud new school formed for pureblood students many years ago two wizards and two witches joined together to form hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry the four talented individuals were godric gryffindor rowena ravenclaw helga hufflepuff and salazar slytherin each of them had a different view of what type of students hogwarts should teach slytherin believed in teaching pureblood students exclusively however the other three coordinators who decided to teach all young witches and wizards overruled his opinion this year at hogwarts however a total of ninety seven slytherin house students did not reenroll why a new school for young witches and wizards has been formed in our world slytherin school of magic has been founded with the creed submission to ambition virtually nothing more is known about this mysterious new establishment cornelius fudge minister of magic has reportedly corresponded with the creator and headmistress of the school she wishes to remain anonymous even i dontknow her true identity but she has informed the ministry that her school is in no way affiliated with he who must not be named or his followers fudge stated in an exclusive interview by reporter natalie pry the location of the school remains unknown submission to ambition well that clears everything up ron muttered sarcastically hermione folded the paper up and shoved it into her satchel with a sigh harry had a strange look in his eye you okay mate ron asked harry shrugged i just dontlike the sound of this school something up ron shrugged back at his friend obviously something was up why was harry suddenly acting so strangely ron reached up to his shoulder to retrieve his letter from pig leg the tiny owl had fallen asleep he was actually cute when he wasntflittering about madly the letter was from his dad ron realized by the scratchy lettering he read over it quickly hmph dad just sent me a cryptic warning dontyou kids start nosing around to find out more about this school leave it up to us well ron said with a sigh i guess us is referring to the order sounds like something mum made him write hermione stood up suddenly from the table well we better head to healing it up on the fifth floor hermione told ron and harry that she was fine for the sixth time as they made their way up to professor sinistra healing class they probably think i worrying about that foul school hermione thought but she was actually thinking about what luna lovegood had told them ron had broken malfoy jaw she was very flattered that ron had stood up for her like that but he had gotten into a fistfight on the first day of school it felt like a bad omen to hermione but that was silly she didntreally believe in omens one thing she did believe in however was malfoy ability to get revenge on his enemies like their third year when he d tried to get revenge on hagrid and buckbeak would he try to get back at ron hermione stomach twisted uneasily so has sinistra always taught healing along with astronomy ron asked as they finally reached the fifth floor yes hermione replied perking up a bit i actually very excited are you healing should be fascinating and rather handy i ve read that professor sinistra went to school to be a healer to follow in her father footsteps her father was a famous physician but shefelt called to study astronomy before finishing healing school ron was looking at her with a silly smile but harry still looked concerned he d had that look since she d read that article in the daily prophet about the slytherin school the paper hadntreally told them anymore than they already knew why was he suddenly so concerned once inside the classroom hermione ron and harry grabbed some seats up front there were several small sterile white tables each with three gray plastic chairs around them each table had a small metal box which appeared to be locked hi harry hermione turned around to see cho chang standing behind their table looking at harry with a demure smile harry had turned bright red and ron had turned to look at hermione with a small smirk hermione was about to get annoyed at ron immaturity when he winked at her knowingly it sent chills up her arms he d never winked at her before had he all she could do was smile at him dumbly uh hi cho harry said casually his blushing face slowly returning to its normal shade alright cho nodded in an annoying way that hermione guessed was an attempt at being charming it didntseem to faze harry though he simply smiled back politely a brief look of disappointment flashed across cho face before she smiled and did some sort of irritatingly cutesy shrug before walking off to her own seat her black hair swinging behind her she was sitting with marietta edgecombe and another ravenclaw girl hermione had seen a few times before harry turned around and shook his head slightly frowning i think she still fancies you ron said matter of factly yeah now that she dumped michael corner she has to start liking someone doesntshe harry said scornfully hermione tried to imagine how she would feel if cho had flirted with ron the way she had done with harry it made her blood boil just thinking about it why is she even in here she in her graduating year isntshe ron asked curiously harry just shook his head but hermione spoke up this class is available to sixth and seventh year students she must be taking it as an elective course just ignore her harry she ll get the idea dontworry harry said darkly suddenly a quick clicking of heels caught everyone attention professor sinistra was walking to the front of the classroom her rigid posture and long black hair worn in a tight bun had always reminded hermione of professor mcgonagall but sinistra was much younger her robes and pointed witches hat were black she wore dark purple lipstick and had long fingernails in the same shade her eyes were amazing a dark black rimmed by silver specks her face was really quite pretty good morning sinistra began in a soft soothing voice the class collectively leaned forward in their seats to better hear her welcome to basic healing i am professor sinistra as you all know obviously each of you has successfully passed my astronomy course but i do hope that you have retained what we studied healing will most likely be much easier for those of you that have a rich understanding of the cosmos hermione thought she heard ron groan under his breath she knew that he had not found astronomy interesting in the least and she felt a little pang of pity for him it was one of hermione favorite subjects however she wasntquite sure she saw the connection it had with healing hermione sat up a bit straighter as professor sinistra continued all magic is made possible through the heavens because each one of you in this room receives your magical ability through the energy of the stars which in my opinion is why a school for pureblood students is absurd one drop of magical blood is all that is needed to make a witch or wizard it is the amount of energy one is connected with through the stars that determines one talent in magic sinistra said reflectively before pausing glancing around the room as if daring someone to disagree with her no one did now on the table in front of you is a basic healing kit i believe every witch or wizard should have one with them at all times they can be purchased at st mungo hospital i want everyone to take a moment and just browse through the contents on your own professor sinistra then waved her hands in front of her with one stroke causing all of the boxes lids to unlock and clatter open she then went calmly behind her desk and sat down where she began gracefully writing something with a long black quill hermione ron and harry leaned in close and peered inside the box it smelled like rubbing alcohol which made hermione eyes sting a bit it contained about ten small corked bottles of blue and purple potions they each had small white labels the blue ones were labeled as pain relief potions while the purple ones were labeled as sleep inducing potions there were a few rolls of impermeable gauze a no sting cleaning solution for minor cuts and lacerations and a couple of packages of smelling salts reckon she d notice if i nicked a few bottles of sleep inducing potion ron asked hermione smiling innocently harry chuckled a little apparently recovering from his encounter with cho you better not hermione whispered urgently playing along ron started slowly inching his hand toward the potions keeping one eye on hermione she couldntcontain a giggle as she slapped at his hand ron jumped exaggeratedly and smiled a beautiful smile at hermione that made her heart skip a beat alright everyone that will do sinistra announced standing up from her desk and clapping her hands twice the contents of the kits returned to their boxes which then closed locked and floated to a shelf behind her desk where they stacked themselves neatly now today i am going to teach you how to perform a simple mending charm for minor cuts if everyone would repeat after me please without wands resarcio resarcio the class repeated blandly sinistra nodded with a barely visible thin mouthed smile now take out your wands sinistra took hers from the inside of her robes hermione noticed that it was a dark shiny wood with a curvy engraving at the base when performing healing spells charms and enchantments for skin irritations or wounds the wand tip should be placed directly upon the area being treated for example sinistra placed her wand tip upon the back of her right hand and glided it across saying vegrandiscindo a clean two inch cut appeared on the back of sinistra pale white hand as if with an invisible knife the class gasped as bright red blood began to rise slowly from the cut but she didntflinch one muscle or even blink she simply placed her wand tip directly beside the cut and said resarcio the cut immediately mended itself not even leaving a scar her hand was just a bit pink now and that is the mending charm please do not attempt to cut yourself for practice she said sternly hermione doubted anyone in the class was displeased to hear this request i have brought along some friends to help us hermione was beginning to feel a bit anxious she didntknow if she could cut some poor creature just for practice she looked over at ron and harry neither of which looked bothered by the thought of lacerating a few of sinistra friends sinistra waved her wand causing a large cardboard box at the back of the classroom to levitate to her desk she opened the lid slowly and reached in with one hand when she pulled out her hand she was holding a small hairless rabbit that yawned widely revealing dull yellow teeth well at least it resembled a rabbit except its skin was black and it had short green horns where its ears should ve been it wasntvery cute in fact it was sort of revolting but hermione didntwant to hurt it now before you girls start distressing yourselves at the thought of harming this poor little creature this is a baccaberry hare they do not feel pain you could cut its entire leg off and it wouldntfeel a thing so one person from each table come get a hare and then each of you take turns cutting and mending remember vegrandiscindo to cut and resarcio to mend and dontworry you wontactually be able to cut its leg off vegrandiscindo is a spell for minor cuts only harry stood up quickly and anxiously to get a baccaberry hare ron turned to hermione so what do you think of her as a healing teacher does she pass the hermione granger teacher assessment hermione smiled at him and sighed with mock exasperation she seems to be a very learned witch of course i not sure that i believe all that talk on cosmos and star energy hermione said plainly she d read about the star energy theory but she still wasntsure if she believed it or not harry approached the table and sat down the baccaberry hare it immediately began sniffing the table and twitching its folds of black skin ron grabbed it by the scruff of the neck and held it up well who first he asked staring at the ugly creature with mild disgust for the remainder of class they each took turns cutting and mending the baccaberry hare a clear watery liquid came out of its cuts instead of blood the hare was definitely not feeling any pain he actually fell asleep after the first few cuts harry and ron were better at cutting than hermione her hand wouldntstop shaking long enough to make a smooth cut so she let the boys handle that part as for the mending however hermione was able to perform the charm perfectly on the first try neither ron nor harry managed to mend the hare without causing strange scarring or half mended wounds she noticed that ron raised one eyebrow when he was really concentrating it was a dreadfully attractive expression after class she told ron and harry that she would meet them in the great hall for lunch after their n e w t classes on the way she entertained herself by remembering the wink that ron had given her it was always bittersweet to joke around with ron like that sweet for obvious reasons but bitter because it only intensified hermione crush on him as she walked to proffesor vector arithmancy class hermione wondered if professor sinistra might know of a healing charm for love sickness author note well i ve been ina writing frenzy this week so keep checking up on the story

chapter once this story closes i will be able to see what ahead for me more clearly chapter 40 a faint light was filtering through ron bed curtains early sunday morning casting a lovely glow on hermione serenely sleeping face ron had woken a few minutes earlier and decided that he should wake ginny so that she and hermione could then sneak back to their dormitories under the cloak however he had yet to leave hermione side as soon as his eyes had opened to see the most beautiful creature he d ever seen lying next to him he had become transfixed for six years he had stolen glances at this face cutting his eyes at her in class deliberately sitting across from her at dinner feigning the need to sit next to her while she helped him with homework and now he was staring openly at hermione granger who was lying in his bed not only was she lying in his bed she was wearing his shirt blimey was she wearing it it was just a plain white t shirt for merlin sake but ron had never appreciated the beauty of simple white cotton t shirts until now it had become a bit twisted overnight so that it had risen up above her navel which was exposed due to the state of his covers only one side of hermione was covered with blankets ron reckoned she had gotten warm at some point and had ridded herself of them one of her perfect white legs was thrown over the blanket completely bare and beautiful save for her adorable blue cotton shorts one of her perfect pale arms was resting above her head while the other was resting innocently upon her chest as the light filtering in began to become less and less faint ron decided that he really did need to send her on her way if he watched her sleep until he grew tired of it he would never wake her so propping himself up on one elbow ron took his free hand and rubbed his fingers gently over her arm she stirred a bit turning her head away from him so that a succulent curve of her neck was exposed he stretched his free arm across her stomach pulling her close and then placed a warm kiss upon her neck she breathed in deeply and arched her back into a very attractive stretch before her eyes flittered open and she turned to look at him ron she breathed in a sleepy drawl that stirred a warm sensation in the pit of ron stomach hi he said smiling at her hi she replied with a smile wha time zit i not really sure i reckon it around seven thirty or so without warning hermione sat straight up with a slight gasp why didntyou wake me she whispered urgently her drowsy tone gone we ll be late for potions no we won t ron said calmly taking hold of her wrist lie back down she looked at him with wide eyes no we wont ron we have to hermione what day is it ron interrupted with a playful smile what day she asked in confusion but then her tense expression relaxed to be replaced with a small smile as she slowly lay back down beside him oh yeah she said simply he lay down fully next to her and she kissed him sweetly on his nose she then glanced down at his bare chest and reached one hand out to rub her fingers along his skin he was so sensitive to her every touch it almost tickled not enough to make him laugh but plenty to make him smile may i kiss you she asked bluntly he raised one eyebrow at her what do you mean may you kiss me he asked in confusion of course you can she smiled at him before to ron surprise she leaned in to kiss him on his chest oh ron thought as his heartbeat quickened that explains the question he swallowed hard as she moved her mouth slowly up his chest to kiss his neck blimey hermione ron muttered as she continued to kiss his neck with soft slow caresses i woke you so that you could get back to your dormitory but if you keep that up i might not let you leave hermione ceased her kisses to look into his face i dontwant to leave she said with a slight pout he liked her pouts i dontwant you to either but what about seamus and dean it sunday she replied before asking with slight uncertainty we could at least stay in bed until they leave couldntwe ron couldntbegin to contain a large grin is my company really all that pleasant he asked earning an adorable smile hermione ron began as she closed her eyes and nuzzled against his chest if you d like to go back to sleep i ll stay awake and listen for them to leave that very considerate ron hermione replied lifting her eyes to his gaze before continuing with a coy smile but to be completely honest i d really rather you snog me ron mouth actually fell open a bit at this statement hermione had never been that straightforward before on this subject and it was quite arousing hearing her request a snog from him she had left open an opportunity for him to make a clever and flirtatious comment but his mind had gone somewhat blank so he instead coaxed her to lie back she gripped the nape of his neck with one of her small hands and pulled him down into an amazing kiss but not before he saw the love desire and innocence in her brown eyes with just one glance he had seen all of that and it had given him a small boost of daring after the kiss he gazed down at her may i kiss you he asked boldly with one hand fingering the cotton fabric of her shirt at the base of her sternum she didntrespond for a moment and looking into her eyes ron saw apprehension and hesitancy join her desire nonetheless she nodded but her troubled look remained ron smiled comfortingly as he made his decision he raised her shirt just above her navel as it had been earlier then leaning down over her stomach he placed a gentle kiss right beside her navel before lying his head back down beside hers on his pillow ron watched her troubled expression fade into a small smile just before their lips met in a kiss a small kiss followed by a stream of kisses as their passion began to grow however ron felt hermione pressing on his chest with her hand he began to pull away but she just continued the kisses and the pressing on his chest so he lay back on the mattress ron then felt a delicate leg moving over his waist and hermione mouth leaving his he opened his eyes to see her climbing on top of him to straddle his hips ron had never heard of a case in which a man died from a fantastic hallucination that made his heart stop but there was a first for everything after she had situated herself properly she laid her torso down upon his resting her head near his shoulder is this alright she asked in his ear sounding a bit breathless and nervous encircling her to hold her to him he responded hoarsely perfectly she then began kissing him deeply did she know what she was doing to him did she understand ron wasntsure but he was too busy enjoying every second of this unexpected snog to think on it he was keeping his hands firmly pressed upon her back so as not to stray but as hermione moved her lips down his neck to his shoulder his hands moved to her wonderfully soft legs from their current position he could rub his hands over her thighs actually he could have reached every part of her from their position but he only allowed himself to glide his hands down her thighs where he then rubbed circles just above her knees with his thumbs suddenly ron heard the curtains move he gripped his hands on her knees tightly and then froze completely except for his chest heaving from his rapidly beating heart hermione must have heard the rustling fabric as well because her kisses stopped as she lifted her head from his neck to look at him with wide eyes gripping his hips tightly with her legs ron ron groaned in frustration at the sound of ginny harsh whisper he turned to see her head peaking in through the curtains hermione sat up straight but she didntremove herself from her straddling position ron if you ever scold me or harry for snogging again i will tell harry about this ginny exclaimed as she crawled onto the bed and sat beside them letting the cloak fall from her shoulders oh ginny please don t hermione whined bouncing up and down slightly with her plea ron bit into his cheek so hard he actually tasted a bit of blood okay ginny ron said quickly as his face burned i wontscold you or harry but could you please leave and next time say something before you barge in hermione has to come with me you buffoon ginny said as she rolled her eyes unless you want her to get caught again and i did say something but you two were too busy to hear me oh well could you just wait outside the curtains for two seconds ron replied impatiently well you two need to hurry up because harry wants to tell you something over breakfast ginny said tell us what hermione asked absently rubbing her index finger over the hair just below ron navel he could not believe that hermione and his sister were about to strike up a conversation whilst hermione was straddling him and driving his body mad about his talk with dumbledore ginny replied he told me about it last night she smiled slightly more so to herself anyway i going but hurry up just as she was about to don the cloak hermione grabbed her arm wait will you look at something she asked quickly what ginny and ron both asked apprehensively hermione looked down at ron chest and began poking around a spot under his nipple i saw this earlier hermione said casually leaning down to peer at it some of her curls fell into his face is it a freckle or a mole right here under his well it darker than his other freckles she said worriedly ginny leaned over him as well and began poking at the spot ah bloody hell ron muttered as he rolled his eyes could we do this another time or maybe even never ever again he asked agitatedly ron what if it some kind of spider bite or something hermione began unless you take us to the showers with you ginny wontsee it again she added smartly this made ron smile at hermione playfully the showers well if we left ginny behind i might consider ew ginny squealed moving back from them and grabbing the cloak hermione it just a freckle ron no shower talks in front of me ew and both of you hurry up with that ginny disappeared under the cloak and quickly left the bed to wait outside the curtains hermione looked down at ron and abruptly laid down burying her head in the curve of his neck and kissing him thank you for an absolutely fantastic morning she whispered before lifting her head to look into his eyes with a bright smile it was brilliant wasntit he whispered back squeezing her knees gently she bit her bottom lip and nodded before slowly moving off of him i eager to hear about harry chat with dumbledore are you hermione asked as she situated her clothing and scooted toward the edge of the bed grabbing the curtain yeah i am ron replied truthfully while sitting up and grabbing hermione hand she smiled sweetly at him we ll do this again sometime wontwe she asked he brought her hand to his lips for a kiss before responding absolutely after one last smile hermione opened the curtains stepped out underneath the cloak with ginny and let the curtains fall behind her ron immediately collapsed onto his back and stared up at the ceiling that was definitely the most brilliant good morning he d ever received he honestly could have happily stayed inside the curtains with hermione the entire day without food or water who needs food or water when you have the woman you love in your arms unfortunately however she was no longer in his arms so he would have to arise from his bed and greet the day which he did grudgingly on the way to the shower rooms harry informed ron that he not only told dumbledore of his vision of ginny but also of his vision of lucius and voldemort dumbledore said that he the order and the ministry aurors were doing all that they could to find out where voldemort and his followers were hiding this information had only brought ron a meager amount of solace not that he didnttrust that dumbledore was doing all that he could it was just that ron wasntsure if that were good enough anymore so after ron had showered and dressed he had to consciously smile convincingly for hermione as they met in the common room as she had said they had had an absolutely fantastic morning he didntwant to worry her by being mysteriously quiet after a morning like that apparently hermione had bought his fa ade of cheerfulness because she was positively glowing on the way to the great hall actually ron was feeling much better by the time they settled at the gryffindor table and began filling their plates it was impossible to feel gloomy and distant with hermione smiling at him and hanging on his arm and ron noticed that hermione wasntthe only one glowing at the table ginny and harry were sitting so close ginny shoulder was actually resting against harry chest this was what she d wanted from harry all year an openly recognized relationship and now they had just that they like ron and hermione didnthave to hide anything from anybody are you two ready this may take a while harry asked as soon as they d all filled their plates with their arms tightly linked and hands clasped ron and hermione both nodded at harry to continue alright harry began with a deep sigh i actually going to give you the condensed version because ginny and i have a date after breakfast a date ron asked disbelievingly ginny and harry exchanged smiles well ginny began it not your conventional date dumbledore is tagging along i asked dumbledore if he had time to work with me this morning and he said he would make time harry began so i supposed to go to his office after breakfast he going to start training me on how to better control this power he told me i could wait until monday if i wanted to enjoy the rest of the weekend but i insisted on starting today ron noticed hermione nodding approvingly at harry words good harry early training is good she said earnestly ron smiled at her and kissed her lightly on the cheek alright harry began with another sigh so i told dumbledore about the vision i had of ginny while at grimmauld place i saw it from my perspective it was like just as last year i felt as if i were nagini this time i felt as if i were well me dumbledore agreed that it didntmake sense for voldemort to send me that vision one ginny was with me at the time so i knew automatically that the vision was not through his eyes unless he could somehow show me the future two i didntrecognize the place so i wouldnthave been able to go there even if i d wanted to dumbledore also agreed with my next point if that were a vision from voldemort then that would mean that he had been waiting to enter my mind that was the first time i d dropped my defenses in months that right hermione said with a look of sincere intrigue mere seconds after you dropped your defenses you were hit with that vision right harry agreed before i had time to leave my mind and seek his i had the vision he then paused and stared at a spot on the table harry keep going ginny said excitedly this is my favorite part she then kissed him on the cheek causing harry to turn and smile at her before turning back to ron and hermione this is her favorite part harry said unnecessarily before clasping his hands in front of him on the table and beginning you two heard what dumbledore said about my love for ginny reacting with the blood bond and giving me a new power well he still says that he cannot know for sure what my new power involves exactly but he now has a new suspicion he has developed the idea that my new power was not only activated by my love for ginny but that it is directly related to my feelings for her meaning that i can only call forth the power when i have strong emotions running through me that are particularly related to her why would he suspect that ron asked looking to hermione furrowed brows and wondering if she were experiencing the same confusion well the first time i experienced the actual power when i blasted the ceiling it was from jealousy anger and frustration over mine and ginny relationship at the time the second time i experienced the power after dean and ginny kiss i was feeling the same emotions and again it was because of our relationship at the time and yesterday at the hospital hermione began you became frustrated with me because i told you that you should accept the fact that you cantfeasibly protect ginny from all harm correct harry said with a frown at hermione but hermione i wouldnthave hurt you i know i can control my emotions toward you ron and ginny but wait ron began remembering something the first time i ever saw your eyes do that glowing thing we were at the burrow it was when my dad apparated to our house to take us to grimmauld place i was under the impression that someone was about to attack the burrow harry said simply ginny home i remember seeing it for the first time after he d seen that vision of me ginny added i remember the first time i saw it as well hermione said quietly it was on the train ride home after holiday after dean flirted with ginny a bit so you can only suffocate people or whatever when you re experiencing strong emotions related to ginny ron asked well harry began slowly yes that what dumbledore suspects but about the suffocation thing you see after dean kissed ginny the first thought i had was man would i love to strangle him right about now then before i knew what was happening he was suffocating but at grimmauld place i had looked up at the ceiling and wished i could just blast a hole through it and well i did i hope you never get the urge to really hurt me ron muttered with an impressed smile at harry who smiled back so what did dumbledore say about your vision hermione asked sounding somewhat worried well once he d begun suspecting that my power could only be summoned by emotions caused by ginny another suspicion grew he thinks that i may have acquired the ability to see things in mine and ginny future no way ron said in awe he looked to hermione who still had furrowed brows hermione did you hear him he asked placing his hand on her knee she looked at him and nodded absently but then turned to harry but harry she began slowly if you can see visions because of a power that within you then why did occlumency block them out i mean wouldntyou have been able to see them before that day at grimmauld place when you dropped your defenses i asked dumbledore the same thing harry replied and he said that if i were a more accomplished occlumens i would be able to block out mind invasions while retaining the ability to have my own visions but because i have not fully compartmentalized my mind i have been shutting down the compartment that now has the ability to see these visions i have not yet learned how to put up walls around some areas of my mind shut down others and leave others exposed can you just summon these visions whenever you want ron asked curiously i not sure yet harry responded but i dontthink so i feel like i ll just have them randomly sort of like luna she never knows when she ll get another vision you know ron feeling slightly dazed simply nodded at harry wow harry we should go ginny said suddenly after grabbing harry wrist and looking at his watch dumbledore wants us to be in his office in fifteen minutes what are you going for again ron asked his sister to watch ginny replied with a smile as she and harry both stood up harry took hold of her hand once they d stood i dontknow how long we ll be harry said dontwait on us for lunch or anything he added before turning to walk down the side of the table ron watched them walking hand in hand from the great hall and noticed that quite a few people turned to stare at them one of which was draco malfoy ron spotted him at the slytherin table his grey eyes squinting after harry and ginny as ron was watching malfoy turned to look straight at him he sneered his usual not so formidable sneer before turning to whisper to his two goons ron stomach churned a bit at the sight why did he feel like they were planning something hermione was sitting motionless and staring at her breakfast plate which suddenly disappeared the scraping of benches echoed through the hall but she continued to daze at the table harry could have visions of his and ginny future that thought had not left hermione feeling too well it was an awesome power but if dumbledore were right then that vision harry had of ginny was real hermione knew that harry and ginny were both just happy to have an explanation for his power they had believed for a month that the vision of ginny was real but hermione hadn t hermione had fully believed that it was a false vision but now hermione knew that sometime in the future ginny would be bleeding and screaming for harry she glanced up at the ceiling to see a blue sky and sporadic clouds here and there ron would you like to go for a walk on the grounds hermione asked maybe some fresh air would do her good when he didntanswer her hermione looked down from the ceiling to see ron turned around in his seat and staring toward the big double doors ron she asked he turned around quickly and looked at her what oh yeah um a walk sure he stammered standing up from the table and taking her hand are you alright she asked worriedly standing up with him he nodded yet his tense expression remained was he worried about ginny too ron quietly led her from the great hall through the entrance hall and out of the huge oak doors there was still a nip in the air but hermione was perfectly comfortable in her sweater and no jacket ron was definitely worried about something hermione thought as they began walking hand in hand onto the grounds he was staring straight in front of him and gnawing absently on his bottom lip this was a huge change in his playful yet loving mood from this morning their morning tryst had been marvelous hermione had been surprised and flattered at ron bold question may i kiss you and although she had consented ron had somehow known that she didnttruly feel comfortable with it his self restraint and the gentle kiss he had placed upon her stomach had been very sweet and comforting enough to give hermione the daring to move on top of him lying atop his chest had been so wonderful comfortable secure warm sensual the memory of it was enough to bring a smile to hermione lips even now but she didntsmile she was too worried about ron mood change at the moment squeezing his hand she asked would you like to go and see hagrid looking up she could see hagrid hut in the distance he might ask us to come along on one of his feedings you know ron asked as his stern expression turned into a playful smile well hermione began thrilled to see him smiling again i quite like grawp actually he fancies me you know oh ron asked with raised eyebrows their hands were still clasped and they were now swinging their arms back and forth as they walked do i have competition now hermione giggled but before she could respond she saw something behind them out of the corner of her eye stopping in her tracks she turned around to glare at the unwanted company causing ron to do the same look here malfoy exclaimed throwing his hands out to his sides with crabbe and goyle following behind him it the weasel and his mate ron gripped hermione hand tighter and took a step in front of her he then immediately removed his wand from his back pocket prompting hermione to do the same malfoy was the last person she wanted to see on her walk to take her mind off of harry vision especially since he reminded her of harry encounter with voldemort mind and lucius if you want something get to the point she said crossly if not beat it malfoy sneer turned into a hideous glare as he stopped about six feet from them you know weasel you should teach granger some manners before she crosses the wrong person path and you should shut your mouth before i curse your sorry ass ron said through gritted teeth as he raised his wand to point directly at malfoy if you haventnoticed malfoy hissed with a malevolent smile there three of us and only two of you i dontthink you can afford to curse me then again i dontthink you can afford much of anything can you crabbe and goyle laughed heartily at this and hermione watched ron face turn a bright shade of red as he just continued to glare at malfoy if you haventnoticed hermione began as anger began to make her hands shake slightly there two brains among us but only a half of one among you malfoy mumbled something under his breath before taking a couple of steps forward ron released hermione hand and his arm went out in front of her crabbe and goyle then split and began walking slowly around them until hermione and ron were standing in the center of the three boys what do you think you re doing ron asked harshly looking around at all of them yet keeping his feet firmly planted in a defensive stance we re just having a little chat malfoy said in a jeering voice are you scared weasley he not scared of you hermione shouted this time malfoy and ron both looked at her malfoy was glaring but ron was shaking his head hermione let me handle him he muttered while taking hold of her hand again i told you to teach her some manners malfoy spat but then an awful smile curved his thin lips but granger i do hear you ve been taught some new tricks care to show us as soon as the words left malfoy lips ron released hermione hand and began approaching him however goyle reached ron first clamped one large hand around his neck and lifted him off the ground ron hands grabbed onto goyle wrists as he began making horrible gurgling noises no hermione screamed she waved her wand at goyle and a red light shot forth and impacted with goyle side he immediately stumbled backward and released ron who fell hard to the ground on his back she had just performed her first silent spell however it hadntbeen very powerful as goyle hadnteven fallen to the ground hermione ran to ron and knelt down clasping one of his hands ron she whispered urgently he coughed a couple of times and then began to sit up hermione was reaching down with her free hand to help him when she felt someone grab a handful of her sweater and thrust her hard to the side where she landed painfully on her shoulder malfoy had his wand pointed down at ron now but ron performed a silent expelliarmus on him causing malfoy wand to fly behind him ron then kicked out with his leg and hit malfoy in the knee malfoy cursed loudly and bent down to grab his wand however hermione didntget to see more because she spotted crabbe and goyle both approaching ron from the side petrificus totalus she shouted at crabbe his eyes went wide for a second before his body went completely rigid and he fell with a thud to the ground goyle however had taken two long steps toward her she started to raise her wand but he grabbed her wrist roughly and threw her wand to the ground he then moved behind her and grabbed her arms to hold her back now ron and malfoy were alone on the ground somehow ron had ended up on top of him one hand grasping a handful of his white blond hair while the other held his wand pressing it firmly into his neck hermione was squirming quite a bit but to no avail however she did get a yell from goyle when she raked her foot down his shin and slammed her heel into his toes ah hold still mudblood bitch goyle growled as he squeezed her arms even tighter she could feel his thick fingers digging into her skin ron looked up his eyes flashing with malice before rounding on malfoy tell him to let her go he yelled while jerking hard on malfoy hair not unless she keeps away from her wand malfoy spat angrily ron lifted malfoy head by his hair and slammed it into the ground hermione gasped and felt goyle grip tighten even more you re hurting me she yelled angrily slamming her heel down on his foot again ron looked up very briefly before bending low over malfoy face with a simple cutting curse i could slit your worthless throat right now we re not negotiating this let her go you wouldn t malfoy began but then he gasped and hermione saw a trickling of blood running down the side of his neck greg malfoy screeched in fear hermione felt goyle hands release her at once he then took a few steps back to stand beside crabbe who was now wiggling his fingers as the body bind curse was wearing off hermione quickly picked up her wand from the ground and held it on the two of them as she backed up to ron once she dreached him she could hear ron whispering fiercely to malfoy spoken to your father lately or voldemort have you ron hissed a mere three inches from his face malfoy kept his mouth closed tightly but hermione saw him flinch at voldemort name which was spoken from ron for the first time i swear if you so much as look at her ron began again i will not think twice about ripping your black heart from your chest hermione watched as malfoy pale face got paler ron then slammed malfoy head into the ground again before standing up from him and taking hold of hermione hand malfoy continued to lie on the ground the side of his neck still bleeding from a three inch cut as crabbe and goyle stood their ground a few yards away ron quickly began leading hermione toward the castle doors as soon as they entered he led her straight to the staircase and up the many flights of stairs to gryffindor tower the first words she heard him speak since his threat to malfoy were the password for the fat lady as they entered the common room ron didntslow his steady march to his dormitory stairs and all the way up to the sixth year boys room the room was quiet and empty and as soon as the door closed shut ron turned to her and pulled her into a tight hug she couldntcontain a small whimper as pain throbbed through her arms he released her immediately and looked into her eyes with a very intense stare hermione it nothing hermione said quickly i think i might have a bruise or something from goyle he asked in a dark whisper she nodded how tightly was he holding you when hermione hesitated to answer ron grabbed her hand and gently rolled her sweater sleeve up to her elbow hermione was a bit surprised herself to see the many bruises she knew goyle had been holding her tightly and it had been painful but she hadntrealized just how fierce his hold had been hermione looked up at ron who now had his eyes closed and his brows furrowed his jaw muscle was working slightly he then opened his eyes and slowly led her to the bed can you heal them he asked softly as they sat down hermione nodded as she removed her wand ron stared at her as she began muttering the appropriate incantations on her bruises did you have your mirror on you she stopped momentarily and looked at him no she said simply did you he shook his head no look hermione i want you to keep your mirror with you at all times from now on i will too we can shrink them and keep them in our pockets alright what good would they have done us out there she asked ron was quiet for a moment before he responded we could have used them if malfoy crabbe or goyle had tried anything drastic like taking me hermione asked calmly ron flinched slightly do you think it malfoy task now instead of his father s she added ron looked at her sadly but didntrespond he instead scooted closer to her and rested his forehead against hers just promise me you ll keep your mirror with you always he whispered before kissing the corner of her mouth i promise she whispered back they continued to rest their foreheads against one another until hermione lifted hers to inquire something ron do you think they would have tried anything on a sunday morning in broad daylight did you see the way they were circling us he asked with raised eyebrows it my fault that it got out of hand like that she said quietly before pointing her wand to her bruises and finishing the appropriate incantations for that arm what are you talking about hermione ron asked in confusion well i taunted them some and then i threw the first spell she replied looking up from her arm she then rolled her sleeve down and raised the other to perform the same healing spells on theremaining bruises ron grabbed her hand to stop her however when she looked up at him he actually wore a small smile you were brilliant hermione he said sincerely bringing her hand to his lips for a kiss that spell you cast to save my neck was that silent he asked yes she replied with a small smile like you and harry said when you want something bad enough it not all that hard ron simply watched her rubbing her back soothingly as she finished the last of her healing spells he still wore his small smile but his brows were furrowed in worry she wasntsure what he was thinking of exactly but she guessed it might be similar to the thoughts circling her mind ron had threatened malfoy from even looking at her and the rat had actually looked quite fearful but hermione almost felt certain that malfoy would not obey ron warning author note i apologize for the brevity of the chapter in comparison to the amount of time

this site it is for entertainment purposes only chapter 41 after the first week of the term a cadence was found that rushed february into march march into april and april into may the weather was pleasant plants were flourishing and summer holiday was nearing what had happened to the term actually ron knew exactly what had happened to it it had been trampled and stomped on by his teachers ron had always heard hogwart upperclassmen particularly fred and george complain about their sixth year classes but ron had thought them to be exaggerating now however ron was one of the complaining upperclassmen and he was not exaggerating when he grumbled on about his weekly potions essays daily magical law assignments complex transfigurations and difficult healing spells nor was he exaggerating when he complained about his ridiculous final exam study schedule his final exam study schedule that had been designed by a miss hermione granger ron looked up from his copy of quidditch today and glanced at hermione who had her nose buried in her arithmancy textbook she was flipping through the pages furiously and running her hand through her hair every few seconds with a look of intense worry etched upon her face hey ron said nudging her knee with his under the wooden table why dontyou take a breather whitman will be in here any second hermione glanced up at him briefly wrinkling her nose as she looked at his magazine you could be using this time to study you know you didntget to look over the last bit of those charms notes last night she said testily my two hours were up ron said defensively she simply rolled her eyes whatever she whispered harshly before looking back down at her book the solution to the equation for perfect love is somewhere in chapter thirty four i think giving your boyfriend the time of day is a factor ron muttered she actually looked up at him with furrowed brows what she asked with a note of panic in her voice i dontremember that ron just stared at her open mouthed as she again began her frantic searching through her textbook g day mates whitman called as he entered from the back of the classroom hermione jumped before hastily shoving her arithmancy book into her satchel and retrieving her defense against the dark arts text ron just sighed and leaned back in his chair this new distracted hermione had come to life over the last weekend and ron was really beginning to miss his old hermione exams truly put her in a state ron had always known this but not until this term had they been dating whilst she was in one of these states it was a bit different and worse for ron as her boyfriend during these times in the past ron had been able to just ignore hermione and keep a safe distance from her when exams approached but they had now been dating for over four months four wonderful months of giving taking sharing loving laughing and the occasional argument he couldntjust ignore her for two weeks after four months as her boyfriend yet she was successfully ignoring him lest she was reprimanding him for not studying enough and what would ever be enough for this woman hermione had made out her own study schedule in march and had been sticking to it inflexibly ever since fortunately she had only become edgy the past week or so and more fortunately still she hadntbestowed a study schedule upon ron until mid april however this was only because ron birthday was at the beginning of march she hadntpostponed the issuing of his study schedule as a birthday treat but because she had felt it necessary for him to focus his attentions on gaining his apparition license in mid april however ron had taken his apparition test a tester had been coming to hogwarts from the a t c once a month to distribute tests and ron had passed without a problem but as soon as he had received his license hermione had given him his study schedule two hours of study per day six days a week finals were not until the beginning of june for ron this meant that one needntstudy until the month of may and not even then did one need to study six days out of the week but for hermione it meant that one only had three whole months to study at the close of february the day she had approached him and laid the schedule upon his lap ron had known that he and hermione had stumbled upon the source of their next big argument it hadnthappened yet but ron could feel it brewing there was no way the two of them would ever agree on the amount of time one should devote to academics hermione felt that if you could be studying then you should be studying ron felt that if you could be studying then you could probably be doing a lot of other things too and ron had always chosen to do the other things until a month before finals however this term he was actually trying to stick to hermione study schedule this term she was his girlfriend and ron reckoned you were supposed to do whatever your girlfriend asked of you especially if your girlfriend were hermione granger in the afternoons they would go to the library for an hour and at night they would study in the common room for another hour even on days with quidditch practice ron would follow up his practice with a quick shower and an hour of study and this was in addition to the loads of homework thrown at them each week now however a week before the final game of the season and two weeks before exams ron needed a break from studying he needed to take this week off to concentrate on saturday game he was quidditch captain after all he had scheduled three practices a week since the second week of the term but would that be enough cho chang had caught the snitch when ravenclaw faced slytherin and hufflepuff of course harry had done the same for gryffindor but harry had also regained the dark circles under his eyes that he had acquired last term the only difference was this term ron knew why harry appeared so worn and it had nothing to do with flying or walks through the corridors glancing around hermione at his best mate ron saw that harry had his head down on the wooden table and he was obviously asleep ron and hermione had adopted a new rule no matter where they were if harry fell asleep let him sleep until it became absolutely necessary to wake him harry was continuing his lessons with dumbledore and lupin with dumbledore harry would study occlumency and how to control his new power apparently harry was already becoming a more accomplished occlumens because he could now summon his vision of ginny whenever he wanted which he did at least once every day neither ginny nor hermione were aware of this fact but harry had begun reviewing the vision daily in order to memorize every detail of it what ginny was wearing the color of the rocks the condition of the sky ron and harry had agreed that the girls would only worry about the vision more if they knew of harry reviewing of it therefore they had also agreed not to tell either of them harry was also learning more and more about his new ability he had now discovered that he could actually summon it at will it was similar to the patronus charm yet instead of using happy memories to conjure a creature of light he used unpleasant thoughts of ginny to conjure his new power the more disturbing his thoughts relating to ginny the more internal power harry could gather and the brighter the glow in his eyes just as the more happy one memory the more powerful one patronus now dumbledore was trying to train harry to be able to choose whether or not he used his gathered power if harry had been able to do this the day he attacked dean thomas he could have let his power lay dormant until his anger faded ron had tried to convince harry to gather his power and drop a suit of armor on malfoy greasy blonde head but ron had then received a small punch from hermione with lupin harry continued the study of dueling with silent spells magic bursts and wandless magic whitman and tonks had even aided lupin during some of harry lessons so that harry could get a feel for dueling with multiple persons at one time harry didntgo into great detail about his lessons but ron knew that he was being pushed each week to perform his absolute best today was not the first day harry had fallen asleep during class clap all whisperings died off as whitman brought the class attention to the front ron noticed whitman glance briefly at harry who hadntawoken with whitman loud clap whitman then however turned on one of his brilliantly white smiles and addressed the students alright then he said cheerily we re going to continue our target practice but i ve enhanced the targets a bit hopefully i ll have youse zonked by the end of class whitman quickly moved to the back of the room and retrieved a large box where he now kept the small targets they used nearly every class period the class had graduated from practicing with the large blue stationary targets to practicing with smaller moving targets these targets could be used to practice spell casting or hand to hand combat whitman had taught them some basic punches and kicks which he claimed to have learned in auror training whitman was spending the remainder of the term incorporating both spells and hand to hand techniques together in an attempt to train them to recognize when to use spells against an enemy versus when to use physical attacks let me demonstrate one time whitman said removing about five small targets from the box the blue targets which whitman threw up into the air were about the size of ron palm they immediately began swarming around whitman at a fairly fast rate they didntappear to be any different than what they d been using nearly all term yet whitman was standing in his defensive stance and watching the targets closely then very suddenly whitman let out a grunt as he kicked out with one leg threw his elbow back behind him and cast a silent spell all at one time taking out three separate targets which each fell to the ground this was when ron realized what the enhancement was to the targets for the remaining two targets began shooting small blue lights at whitman who was dodging and blocking he quickly took these two targets out with a simple punch and a spoken stupefy everyone in the class was silently staring at him after this performance except for harry who was somehow still dozing well whitman asked excitedly as he picked up the five dead targets and returned them to the large box do those blue lights hurt if they hit you parvati asked curiously who cares seamus stated i wanna hav a go hey professor can you take on ten at one time neville asked from the back of the room hey no drama kiddos whitman called through a chuckle everyone going to have a go but i going to start youse off with three each if you get hit with one of the targets counterattacks you ll feel a small shock but nothing more so everyone fang it and move your tables against the walls no one hesitated to stand and quickly move the tables out of the way ron reached over and shook harry by his shoulder he woke up with a jerk and looked around in confusion before realizing where he was and standing slowly from his chair once the room had been cleared everyone found an empty spot and whitman began going around the room box in hand handing out targets to each person hey edgar are these the enhanced targets harry muttered to whitman as he took his targets from him yeah hazza whitman replied moving next to hermione who took her three targets oh harry began with a confused look i only got three whitman smiled at him and whispered in a voice that ron had to strain to hear yeah and what would your classmates think if you cactused twenty at one time ron and hermione exchanged a quick wide eyed glance after this statement oh right harry muttered before shrugging and throwing his three targets into the air whitman then approached ron with three targets before continuing about the room have you practiced with these already harry hermione asked she ron and harry were standing in a triangle with one another harry merely nodded as he was in the middle of a pretty hefty yawn why arentyour targets shooting at you she added watching harry rotating targets with great curiosity they wait for you to make the first move harry replied in a slightly bored voice ron heard a small yelp from across the room and saw lavender sucking on her thumb and swatting at one of her targets which had apparently just shocked her with one of its small discharges quite a few people had already begun dueling with their targets so ron threw his up into the air as well dontforget to try silent casting whitman shouted over the growing commotion in the room monday whitman had begun to encourage silent spell casting although everyone in the class had tried only a few had succeeded obviously ron hermione and harry had already cast silent spells by this time but so had dean which ron had forgotten about until he noticed how well he was doing with the silent spells then ron had remembered that dean used a silent avada kedavra on avery when avery had attempted to kill him ron glanced up at his moving targets he wasntso sure that he could use one hand to cast a spell the other to punch and his leg to kick all at once without falling over backward so he instead decided to take a different approach he waited until the there were two targets on either side of him at which time he shot the target to his left with a silent spell and hit the target to his right with his left hand as he suspected the remaining target flew around to his front and shot straight at him he managed to duck under the shot however and then rise up to kick out in front of him as soon as his foot impacted with the target it fell to the ground before he could really congratulate himself on his dueling however he heard a shrill squeal from across the room he turned to see a delighted pansy parkinson hanging on malfoy arm malfoy looked incredibly smug good onya whitman said half heartedly as he walked toward them is that your first silent spell malfoy simply nodded with his chin jutting out pompously i just imagined the targets to be three enemies like you instructed he then glanced over at ron hermione and harry however hermione and harry seemed to be too involved in practicing their dueling to notice just remember that real enemies can strike back whitman said as he followed malfoy gaze malfoy scowled at whitman and traced a finger absently down the side of his own neck before turning to glare at ron again ron turned his back on malfoy and flashed a hand signal in his direction as he pretended to scratch at the back of his head ron ron dropped his hand quickly and turned to see hermione approaching him with a frown i saw that mr weasley she whispered fiercely and i think whitman saw it too really ron asked with a curious smile what did he do hermione pursed her lips for a moment before responding he laughed but that not the point she said firmly malfoy saw you too and he not laughing she then turned to go back to her own dueling space but ron caught her hand hermione i think i might be able to better behave myself if you give me a kiss he said with a smile her face softened as she turned to look up at him again after class she said with a smile but ron didntrelease her hand he knew that as soon as class ended hermione would rush to lunch where she would somehow manage to eat with one hand and study with the other so ron brought her hand to his lips and kissed it lightly before releasing her and giving her a small wink she blushed slightly and mouthed i love you as she returned to her space this left ron with a silly smile on his face for a while but as he picked his targets back up and threw them into the air to practice again his smile slowly faded malfoy had performed his first silent spell ron stomach cramped painfully as he remembered the confrontation he and hermione had with malfoy in mid february what would the outcome of the fight have been if malfoy could have used silent magic at the time and what if hermione hadntbeen there to blast goyle with her first silent spell the two hundred some odd pound goon would ve definitely won the fight ron didnthave an ability like harry s he couldntthink of hermione and suddenly be able to blast through solid objects and suffocate people if ron couldntstand up to three prats without hermione aid what would he do if faced with death eaters he would fail and failure was not an option in the issue of hermione safety even though malfoy hadntso much as looked at hermione since that sunday morning on the grounds ron would never trust the rodent malfoy might now have a three inch scar on his neck from ron cutting charm but ron was scarred much worse he worried about hermione every single day after that confrontation ron had even decided that it would be best if hermione did not leave the castle unless accompanied by well the whole school so the only time ron allowed her to leave was in the event of a quidditch game which consequentially was the absolute only thing that had the power to take his mind off of his worries about hermione quidditch this was one of the main reasons ron wanted a break from studying when he fixated on his favorite sport it took all of his concentration all of his focus all of his energy until he had no room for worries but as soon as his thoughts strayed from quidditch they were filled with hermione after defense against the dark arts ron hermione and harry rushed to lunch where they ate rather quickly ron scheduled quidditch practices on mondays wednesdays and fridays the sooner they ate the sooner they completed their hour of study in the library and the sooner ron would be able to get to the quidditch pitch to warm up once they had reached the library ron sat at a table with his sister and harry ron was slouching low in his chair his feet propped up on the empty chair across from him and his head bent low over a detailed drawing of the woollongong shimmy which was disguised by his geography of the magical world textbook the shimmy was a high speed zigzagging maneuver used in quidditch to throw off opposing chasers could he teach the team this move before the match the last game of the year was to be played in four days gryffindor vs ravenclaw ron wished he could ask his sister what she thought of the move but that was a bit too risky hermione was nearby sitting at a table by herself lost in rolls of parchment with ancient runes translations upon them she was scratching away additional annotations on her already covered notes with a large quill her hair was even bushier than usual and every few minutes she would gasp or grunt and then begin hastily rummaging through her piles of work ron would have sat beside her but she needed an entire table for her strewn papers so he was instead sitting with harry who was leaning across the table helping ginny study for her o w l s and ron could honestly say that he was a bit jealous why couldnthermione be as calm about her exams as his sister then ron might be able to help her study as harry was helping ginny but ron knew that if he tried to quiz hermione it would only end up with her attacking him he would either not quiz her quickly enough or she wouldnttrust him to check her answers thoroughly with her notes of course if hermione caught him studying a quidditch play as opposed to his geography he would be in much worse trouble even though this was the first time ron had used a study hour for something other than schoolwork he would still be in trouble but he had just found the shimmy in quidditch today this morning chaser a seemed to do most of the complex maneuvering that should be ginny chaser b would need to be katie ron stuck one finger in his ear and shook his head slightly he must be going mad he could actually hear hermione disapproving voice in his head ron ron ron suddenly a small hand reached over the top of his textbook and snatched his drawing of the woollongong shimmy ronald ron heart jumped into his throat sighing heavily he slowly shut his book and peered over at hermione who looked incredibly small yet intimidating behind her mounds of work she was not wearing a very happy expression actually she looked quite astounded as she stared at the quidditch drawing held tightly in her hands harry and ginny were now looking from ron to hermione to the quidditch drawing with raised eyebrows the woollongong shimmy hermione breathed slamming the paper back down on the book on ron table i can not believe you is that what you ve been doing during our study hours in here quidditch no ron whispered urgently as he shoved the paper inside his book and closed it shut i just found that move this morning in quidditch today she gave him a disbelieving pout and ron stood from his chair and crossed to her table to sit beside her hermione i have honestly never even thought about quidditch during our library time ron began calmly until today but i quidditch captain and there is a game this saturday ron final exams are in two weeks hermione said aghast we are talking about exams for n e w t level classes i ve been studying for over a month ron exclaimed earning a glare from madam pince who was seated behind the circulation desk he gave her an apologetic smile and hermione whispered as if a month of studying meant nothing i have been studying since march and i am no where near ready ron rolled his eyes at her and leaned back in his seat hermione you re mental you could take any one of your exams right now and ace it no i couldn t she replied evenly shaking her head back and forth with a look of pure disbelief yes you could no yes ron no i couldn t hermione you could pass the seventh years exams no i couldn t ron hermione do you two mind ginny hissed suddenly ron and hermione both looked up to see ginny staring at them with wide eyes while holding up a sheet of her transfiguration notes sorry ginny hermione replied quietly as she stood up from her chair we ll take this upstairs we will ron asked with a sinking feeling in his stomach taking it upstairs was never a good thing with hermione unless they were taking a snog upstairs hermione didnthave to answer ron question with words her pursed lips and squinted eyes were very clear they were definitely taking this argument upstairs ron stood slowly from his seat gathered his books from his table and slung his satchel over his shoulder he then waited for hermione to collect her abundance of notes and books before following her out of the library and up the staircase to their tower he tried to take her satchel from her but she jerked away from him uh oh ron thought refusing his attempts at chivalry meant that she was really peeved they didntspeak to one another the entire way to the portrait hole door where hermione muttered the password there were a few people scattered about the common room and ron wished that he could just convince hermione to play a game of wizard chess with him instead of having a discussion but the possibility of that happening was almost laughable once they reached the boys stairs ron took his time with each individual step the longer he postponed this discussion the better although hermione didntseem to want to wait until they got to the sixth year boys dormitory because she began talking as soon as they reached the stairs ron i have been so proud of you all year hermione said with her hand upon his arm uh oh ron thought again whenever hermione threw compliments into the middle of their discussions he knew she was only luring him into a false sense of security then when he least expected it snap you have done wonderfully in your n e w t classes she continued you are whitman best student in defense against the dark arts you what about harry ron interrupted looking down at her earnest brown eyes harry doesntcount she said simply you cantcompare yourself to him ron he has been receiving private lessons from albus dumbledore and lupin for a full year i am talking about you right now you are whitman best student you ve even improved in transfiguration i have ron asked curiously hermione gave him a disbelieving look yes ron but all of your accomplishments and improvements will be wasted if you fail your exams hermione i not going to fail my exams ron said in slight exasperation i ve studied more this year than all past years combined and i promise i ll resume our study schedule after this week but right now i just need to concentrate on this final match hermione sighed and rolled her eyes how can you put quidditch before your studies the grades you make in this school will follow you for the rest of your life ron academics are oh great ron thought here goes the academics are speech ron took a deep breath to prepare for the next hour or so of reprimands as he and hermione reached his dormitory however as hermione hand reached for the handle he noticed something that caused him to grab her wrist and pull her back down one step ron what in the world are you doing she asked snatching her wrist from him i only saying all of this because i love you and i concerned for your future our future hermione i know it just that ron began but then he realized what she d said he looked down at her our future he repeated a semblance of a smile showed at the corners of her mouth ron continued i think that the first time i ve ever heard you say those words our future he said quietly using one hand to cup the side of her face she leaned into his hand slightly and closed her eyes i just know how much you want to be an auror and i want that for you too she said before lifting her head from his hand and reaching for the door again remembering why he stopped her the first time ron grabbed her wrist to stop her once more ron wha hermione ron began we shouldntgo in there right now why dontyou see what on the door handle hermione looked down at the door handle and then back up at ron a tie she asked with an unconcerned shrug it was indeed a tie it was a red and gold gryffindor tie with a bright green shamrock pin on it that tie belonged to seamus hermione seamus tie is there for a reason ron replied as he tried to lead her back down the stairs she was resisting as she looked from ron to the tie i dontunderstand she said simply it a sort of warning sign among hogwarts males that the owner of the tie is within the dormitory and that they well have company ron replied hermione just continued to look confused for a moment before her eyes got wide is he she began i mean he s he actually in there with a girl yeah ron replied taking a precautionary move down one step that disgusting hermione said boys put their ties on the door handles to warn their dorm mates that they are in there with a girl having having relations relations ron asked with a small smirk although the look on hermione face caused him to clear his throat and lose the smirk have you done anything to try and stop this she prompted what ron asked he honestly thought he must have just misheard her have you done anything to try and stop this she repeated clearly hermione i cantstop people from having relations he exclaimed it none of my business but you re a prefect she stated shortly it is your job to make sure the dormitories stay clean advocating an unwritten code that announces when two people are having sex she whispered this last word before continuing is just unacceptable i not advocating it ron began defensively i just ignoring it ron she exclaimed in exasperation you cantjust hermione ron exclaimed louder than intended she looked a bit taken aback so he softened his voice as he continued hermione i am sorry that i not the perfect student or the perfect prefect you are those things not me and i also sorry that i going to have to say no to you no i will not continue the study schedule this week i need quidditch i need this break and no i will not try and stop guys from leaving ties on the doors as a code because hermione guys like seamus will do it with or without the ties and quite frankly i d rather be forewarned ron watched as hermione mouth went from pursed to gaping in one nanosecond she then abruptly brushed passed him to descend the stairs he tried to grab for her but only succeeded in stumbling down a few steps hermione he called as he followed after her she ignored him however and marched straight into the common room and sat down in an empty armchair in front of the fireplace she then began rummaging through her satchel ron sat down across from her in another armchair and watched as she removed a textbook opened it closed it returned it to her satchel removed it once more and then again returned it to her satchel before standing up harry and ginny entered the common room at this time and slowly made their way toward a couch near ron and hermione they were both casting slightly curious glances at them hermione what are you doing ron asked with a sigh as she slung her satchel over her shoulder he stood from his chair and approached her she looked up at him with her jaw squared i am going to finish my studies in my dormitory i wontbe able to concentrate in here meaning you dontwant to be around me because you re angry with me ron muttered edgily she squinted up at him for a brief moment before turning for the girls stairwell hermione can we not talk about this he asked taking a few steps toward her and successfully grabbing her arm i dontwant to talk right now ron she said quietly i tired and i d like to take a nap i thought you were going to study ron replied smartly she blushed slightly before jerking her arm away from him and stalking up the stairs hermione he shouted up the stairwell but she didntrespond he slammed his hand into the wall in frustration but he only did this once because it hurt quite a lot and it got him a few strange stares from his fellow gryffindors two of the strange stares actually came from harry and ginny ginny dontsay anything ron said harshly he could tell by her expression that she had an opinion on the matter at hand and he was not in the mood to hear her tell him that he was an ignorant prat that needed to apologize for doing nothing wrong i was just going to say that i on your side ginny said calmly hermione needs to give you a break she just being too ginny looked up to the ceiling as she searched for the appropriate word hermione ron offered what ginny asked she being too hermione ron said as he slouched back down in an armchair well yeah ginny stated with a sigh just donttake anything personal mate harry said as he stretched his legs out in front of him and yawned putting one arm around ginny she always like this at the end of may everything will be back to normal between you two after exams yeah ron grumbled with a shrug but i dontwant to wait two weeks well what else can you do ginny said ron didntrespond for a moment then reaching into his pocket he retrieved his tiny square mirror engorgio he muttered quietly as the twin mirror enlarged to its original size ron said hermione the mirror immediately began to glow with a blue tint at first all ron saw was blackness once his own reflection disappeared but then he saw some movement and heard a soft voice say engorgio then two brown eyes looked into the mirror but not into ron eyes hermione please come and talk to me ron whispered into the mirror she wouldntlook him in the eye but she appeared to be mulling over his request ron i really cantright now she said softly i sorry but i need to study and i cantbe in the same room with you right now without thinking about about about me not saying anything to seamus about me not studying twenty four seven what ron asked impatiently apparently a little too impatiently hermione expression turned fairly cold goodnight ronald she said shortly before she turned the mirror away from her and ron was again looking into blackness hermione he asked in exasperation looking up at harry and ginny he saw that they were both looking down at a quidditch magazine of ginny s pretending to read yet their eyes were not moving i can not believe her ron exclaimed as he shrunk his mirror once more and shoved it into his pocket they each looked up but didntrespond this irrational side of hermione was not necessarily new but ron had never experienced in this way he would have to talk to her before the night was over this would not fly come on ginny finally said standing up from the sofa let go to practice early i want to try that shimmy ron sighed heavily but nodded in concurrence after practice ron thought i ll give hermione some time but then she going to talk hermione was sitting on her bed with her back against the headboard the curtains were closed tightly to shield her quirky antics from her dorm mates view parvati and lavender were sitting in two armchairs discussing so and so new haircut and such and such new boyfriend hermione on the other hand was tuning them out as she faced a major dilemma she had two objects lying atop the covers in front of her which had begun causing her great anguish the last hour or so her ancient runes textbook and her small silver mirror she needed to study she had to study exams were in two weeks and she was going to fail for sure but how could she study when she couldntstop thinking about ron weasley she should call him on her mirror she d been up in her room all evening surely he was back from quidditch practice it had to be nearing ten o clock she should call him and consent to discussing their disagreement but how could she discuss their disagreement when she couldntstop thinking about studying okay hermione whispered to herself she took a deep breath as she looked form her textbook to her mirror i am going to to call him she hastily grabbed the mirror and looked into it after another breath she opened her mouth to utter his name r r ridiculous she muttered throwing the mirror back down beside her book i ridiculous she thought placing her head in her hands poor ron he been studying much more than he used to without much complaint other than an occasional sigh or groan and i canteven talk to him what if he fell off his broom and died my last words to him would be an angry goodnight ronald what is the matter with me why do i always get this way my boggart used to be mcgonagall showing me a failing grade for goodness sakes i a basket case no you re not hermione whispered as she lifted her head from her hands he is she began nodding absently as she reminded herself that she was simply a devoted student there was nothing wrong with wanting to prepare for exams three to four months in advance but there was something wrong with allowing your dorm mates to behave like wild animals if she found out that one of her dorm mates were doing that in her dormitory they would definitely get an earful of course hermione and ron snogged in his bed but that was entirely different she would never even consider consummating their relationship in gryffindor tower how utterly disgusting and ron just blatantly said no he wasnteven going to consider saying anything to seamus not only was there nothing wrong with hermione own exam preparations but there was also nothing wrong with wanting her boyfriend to do his best on his exams as well she really wasntasking much two hours a day and one full day off each week twenty four seven please hermione scoffed and shook her head as she reached for her textbook opening it to the chapter that she was currently studying in class hermione began reading she could do this she could study without thinking about ron hermione hermione gasped as she looked down at the small silver mirror out of which a damp haired redhead was peering sighing heavily she closed her book and set it down beside her as she picked up the mirror to peer into his attractively stern eyes she noticed that he wasntwearing a shirt hi she said shortly hermione come down to the common room and talk to me he said in a soft voice i checked after i got out of the shower and there no one down there will you talk to seamus about his extracurricular activities hermione asked haughtily is that an ultimatum ron asked disbelievingly hermione felt herself blushing but she didntrespond ron rolled his eyes and muttered you are being ridiculous hermione through slightly gritted teeth ridiculous hermione repeated as her heart rate began to quicken in anger her calling herself ridiculous was one thing but hearing it from ron yes ridiculous ron began now come downstairs he ordered i will not hermione exclaimed not caring whether or not lavender or parvati overheard you cantorder me to do anything well i tried being nice hermione and you gave me a bloody ultimatum he said sternly and i told you no earlier i not saying anything to seamus hermione just glared into her mirror for a moment as she and ron had a stare off when she saw his mouth open slightly she closed her eyes and turned the mirror facedown on the bed she heard a muffled damn it but then the faint buzzing sound ceased she picked up the mirror and actually felt an ache in her chest when she saw her own reflection as she placed the mirror back down and picked up her textbook however she actually began to feel strangely calm ron was probably already in his bed now and would be asleep shortly and after he d slept on this little spat hermione knew that he would see everything her way he would see that reprimanding seamus behavior fell under his duties as prefect and he would see that studying for exams was much more important than quidditch and in the meantime she could study if she started now she could get a good two hours in before she needed to turn in for the night settling back against her headboard hermione flipped open her book tap tap tap hermione heard her dorm mates gasp and she sat up a bit straighter parvati hermione called tap tap tap there was that tapping noise again it sounded as though it were coming from the window hermione parvati called in a strange breathy voice it ron hermione sighed and rolled her eyes pigwidgeon ron had actually resorted to sending her a letter he was really not going to give up oh good grief hermione exclaimed tossing her book down on her bed let him in she called blandly um okay parvati said in that same strange voice hermione then heard the pattering of feet and the window creaking open quickly followed by a loud thud and a whistle hermione jane hermione heart dropped into her stomach that was not the sound of a small twittering owl and the heavy footsteps she heard were not the sounds of tiny fluttering wings you have armchairs in here ron asked in surprise i mean never mind which bed is hers she heard him mutter there was no audible answer but hermione heard the footsteps grow closer until they stopped directly outside her curtains are you clothed hermione opened her mouth to speak but a small squeak was the only sound she could make suddenly the curtains flew open and she was staring up into ron glaring face she wouldnthave been surprised if his eyes had begun glowing blue he was so intimidating in fact all she could do was stare up at him with wide eyes as she pulled her knees into her chest he was wearing the red muggle gym shorts she d gotten him for his birthday but he wasntwearing the matching shirt he was shirtless and the tops of his ice blue boxers were visible she now understood what the whistle was for you wonttalk to me in the common room you wonttalk to me through our mirrors so guess what you re going to talk to me right here he said firmly crossing his arms in front of him hermione looked from ron to her dorm mates whom were both staring at ron with wide eyes and opened mouths actually lavender and parvati expressions probably werentmuch different than her own as dim witted as the words in hermione head sounded she couldntprevent them from spilling from her mouth are you mad at me she asked in a small voice yes he stated in a somewhat calmer tone i angry with you because you re angry with me and i have done nothing wrong but ron hermione began but he interrupted hermione do you remember that day in the hospital last term when you made me promise to never refuse to talk to you about anything hermione nodded slowly well ron continued i think you should keep that promise too i ve tried my hardest to be good enough for you hermione and i know that i fall short but that because no one could ever be good enough for you you re as close to perfect as as anyone or anything but as perfect as you are i think you re wrong for not talking to me about this he finished with a deeply serious look upon his face hermione was stunned into silence but she was apparently the only one lavender and parvati both had something to say aww lavender began looking up at ron with an astonished stare that is the sweetest thing i have ever heard in my life i have never heard of a guy who would fly through a window just to talk parvati added with a dreamy look in her eyes ron turned around to look at hermione dorm mates and when he returned his gaze to hermione she saw that his face had flushed a deep scarlet he looked as if he d just remembered that they had a small audience taking a step forward he kneeled down beside hermione bed and motioned for her to come to him without delay hermione scooted to the edge of the bed letting her legs drape over the side ron leaned his chest against her legs and took both of her hands in his will you talk to me he whispered pleadingly hermione nodded and made to stand from the bed you two can stay in here lavender said quickly hermione we donteven care if he stays the night i promise we wontsay anything to anyone parvati was nodding fervently in agreement hermione glanced down at ron who shrugged okay hermione replied lavender smiled dreamily as she crossed to the window which she pulled shut she then picked ron broom up from the floor and leaned it against the wall scooting back against her headboard hermione grabbed her book and mirror and placed them on her bedside cabinet ron removed his shoes and sat down across from her on the bed he then waved his wand around at the curtains which closed leaving them in a private haven hermione muttered an imperturbable charm on the curtains so that they wouldnthave to whisper and she then simply sat still her gaze upon her fidgeting legs nice shirt ron said softly hermione looked up to see him looking at her he wasntexactly smiling but his expression was no longer stern she was wearing one of his chuddly cannons t shirts oh she began with an apologetic smile i meant to tell you i borrowed this a couple of days ago i thought to borrow something you needed permission he said casually well i guess i stole it then she replied she saw the corner of his mouth twitch a bit but he quickly regained control as his face began returning to that rather stern look ron i know you re angry with me but can you just hug me before we start discussing hermione asked quickly as she began to scoot toward him no he said firmly hermione heart clamped at his denial of her but then he continued in a soft voice hermione i ll be honest with you i d like nothing more than to hold you right now but if i do that then i ll probably just agree to anything you ask of me and well i really want to have my say hermione remained silent as she scooted back up against the headboard and nodded for him to continue do you think seamus should be expelled for having sex in the dorms he asked calmly no hermione replied in slight confusion ron i not asking you to hermione what you re asking me to do would lead to his expulsion ron said evenly seamus would not listen to me i guarantee you he would just ignore anything i ordered him to do so i would then have to go to go to the head of our house because if i didntenforce my own rules my prefect badge wouldntmean anything would it and do you know what mcgonagall would do to him expel him hermione replied quietly she was beginning to feel about an inch tall yes ron said with a nod now sometimes i cantstand seamus and i dontagree with what he doing but then again if you took me into my dormitory and asked me to make love to you what do you think i would say hermione felt her face grow warm and her mouth go dry i i not sure she managed to say in a slight croak he gazed at her a moment before giving a barely detectable nod and looking down at his hands well i couldntsay no he muttered suddenly having relations in gryffindor tower didntseem utterly disgusting anymore after a short pause hermione cleared her throat in an attempt to find her voice can we finish talking so i can get my hug hermione asked reaching forward to run her fingers over his arm ron looked up from his hands with a small smile before moving to sit beside her in one swift movement he pulled her into his lap and hugged her tightly as he leaned against the headboard she wrapped her arms around his neck and rested her head against his shoulder neville was asleep when we got back from quidditch practice ron began softly resting his head upon hers but he d left me and harry a sample of his potion there was a small vile on each of our bedside cabinets with a note saying that he had finally perfected the memory potion and gotten a patent for it a patent that great hermione said with genuine interest although she wasntsure where this comment had come from she raised her head and looked at ron as he continued i just wanted you to know that i i he swallowed rather hard and cleared his throat i still saying no to you hermione i taking a break from studying this week but i think that potion might help me study twice as hard next week hermione couldntcontain a smile you re so adorable hermione said kissing him gently on his freckled cheek why you really hate refusing me anything dontyou yes i do ron replied matter of factly as he squeezed her a bit tighter hermione smile slowly faded as she began to think on her recent foul treatment of ron ron she began rubbing her fingers along his collarbone i cantremember every awful thing i ve said to you over the past few days but i take it all back it really has nothing to do with you around this time of year i just start freaking out you know i know that i have to study or else i ll fail everything but everything feels like it closing in around me and i cantseem to focus even though focusing is the most important part of studying i love reading and learning new things but this time of year those things become completely scary for me and then i end up driving everyone i love away from me hermione was surprised to hear him chuckle softly does it look like you ve driven me away he asked while patting her gently on her bum well maybe i haventdriven you away but i truly am sorry for being so overly demanding hermione stated before smiling mischievously although i do have one more demand which is ron asked with one raised eyebrow spend the night with me ron answered by pulling her covers back and climbing beneath them hermione quickly joined him between the cool sheets laying atop his chest and entwining her legs with his hermione kissed him on his earlobe before breathing in his earthy scent ron she whispered in his ear hmm he muttered low inresponse sending chills down her back you think i perfect hermione began but in truth you are ron breathed heavily after this statement and thanked her with a deep kiss after this kiss hermione nuzzled as close to him as possible closed her eyes and made a silent promise to herself if ever ron asked her to talk with him no matter what the circumstance she would not refuse him as she repeated this promise to herself she felt ron tucking the covers around them both it wasntlong after this that hermione began to breath deeply kissing ron chest lightly at sporadic moments before drifting off to sleep author note oh my goodness this is the longest i ve gone without posting but i have some fairly good news i completely moved into my apartment i have a much clearer outline for chapter 42 than i had for this filler chapter and tomorrow is a national holiday whoop e for no school i do have some assignments to finish but i hope to be able to write a lot too thanks so much for everyone

night with hermione in her dormitory he woke early and left for his own room of course not until they had exchanged proper good morning and goodbye kisses but as soon as they had ron was out of the window and up the tower ron reckoned hermione must have taken their discussion to heart he hadntread any book that didnthave a picture of a broomstick or a quaffle on the front cover since wednesday and hermione didntseem to mind she actually seemed to be taking more frequent breaks from her studies herself presently however she was taking no such break she was eating less this evening than usual as she remained silent and hidden behind her healing book ron was all right with this though she might need both hands to read her book but he had one hand resting over her delicate yet bobbing knee and every few minutes she would turn her head and kiss him on the shoulder before diving back behind her book the great hall was usually quite cheerful on friday evenings weekends were always welcomed however the approach of end of term exams seemed to have sucked some of the cheer from the air on this particular friday though ron was all right with this too his team had a match in less than twenty four hours and he wasntreally nervous just eager for tomorrow at noon ron credited this to the fact that he could now become consumed with quidditch without the threat of hermione becoming exceedingly angry with him good blocks this afternoon ginny said earnestly from across the wooden table where she and harry were sharing a treacle tart ron nodded at his sister as he swallowed a forkful of steak and kidney pie thanks he replied and as an afterthought he added you katie and jessica were brilliant on the hawkshead attacking formation well we ought to be ginny replied with a tired sigh stretching her arms to one side and then the other how long were we out there anyway two and a half hours hermione muttered absently from behind her healing book ron smiled to himself he wasntsure how hermione could listen in on a conversation while engrossed in a textbook but he was definitely enjoying the fact that hermione was now paying him a bit more attention she had actually pouted a bit over the amount of time ron held the team outside for today practice it wasntbecause he was refusing to study but because he wasntspending the time with her after ron had shown her just how distant she had been with him lately she seemed to crave time with him and although ron craved the very same thing he unfortunately wasntquite through with practice for the day i think we should go back out to the pitch for a little while after dinner ron said casually hoping his recent compliment to ginny would lessen the resentment his statement might evoke what ginny asked with wide eyes harry remained silent but ron could tell that his friend looked slightly anxious hermione looked up briefly from her book but then ducked back behind the pages just the three of us ron stated absently squeezing hermione knee i know we ve been working all week but ginny i think you could stand to work on the shimmy a bit more what about the other chasers it a three chaser maneuver ginny asked with a touch of defensiveness in her voice well you have the most difficult role in the move ron said matter of factly at the indignant look on his sister face he added because you re the best ginny expression seemed to soften a bit so ron decided to push his luck i ve been meaning to tell you ginny i saw you blagging in the hufflepuff game i did not blag ginny exclaimed looking highly offended she what hermione asked looking up from her studies again she grabbed the broom tail of another player harry replied with amusement in his voice ginny shot him a warning look but harry just smiled well you did he added i did ginny asked now looking truly concerned yes and you blatched too ron added now that he had someone on his side on the issue of ginny tendency to sneak foul plays into the matches what is bl she intentionally collided with zacharias smith ron answered hermione who had now set her book down completely are you actually interested in a conversation about quidditch ron asked with a surprised smile hermione just shrugged and took hold of his hand under the table i only blatched him because he blatched me first ginny said defiantly and it not like you ve never flacked before ron blimey how many times do i have to tell you that i wasnttrying to block that shot i had to put my arm through the hoop ron began with slight frustration i would ve fallen off of my broom if i hadn t it was really windy that day this was mostly true although he could ve chosen to steady himself on the hoop that didnthappen to have a quaffle flying toward it but i did sort of regret blatching him later ginny said ignoring ron argument good ron said firmly not because i hit him ginny said pursing her lips at him because i broke off two of my broom tail bristles in the process she turned to harry and added which reminds me i hear cho likes to blurt so watch out yeah i ve heard that too harry replied ron looked down at hermione who had one inquisitive eyebrow raised cho likes to lock her broom handle over the handle of the opposing seeker to try and pull him off course ron explained as long as none of you get hit with a bludger tomorrow hermione began as the plates started disappearing i ll be fine it those worthless beaters that should be removed from the game entirely no beaters in quidditch ginny cried in disbelief as she and harry stood from their side of the table no beaters in ginny ron interrupted as he helped hermione load her satchel with her books and notes forget about the beaters okay will you and harry please practice with me for another couple of hours it passed four pm ginny said almost hopefully i approved an evening practice with mcgonagall ron stated i told her it would just be us three and she didntseem to have a problem with it ginny did a poor job of hiding her disappointment at this news let go fetch our brooms harry said picking up his satchel and taking hold of ginny hand ginny shoulders seemed to slump slightly before she looked from harry to ron and nodded fine ginny sighed tiredly before a slight smirk appeared on her face but i think you should have to practice the starfish and stick ron and harry both chuckled deal ron replied jokingly what the starfish and what it hermione asked as she and ron stood from their bench it where the keeper hangs from his broom by one hand and one foot to block a wide area ginny replied with a smile hermione looked up at ron with her eyes slightly squinted ron you better not she said worriedly grabbing hold of his forearm harry and ginny both laughed hermione the starfish and stick is only performed by professional quidditch teams ron said smiling down at her i ll be practicing the double eight loop will you be sitting on the broomstick properly she asked with both eyebrows raised yes ron replied leaning down to kiss her before adding you can come and watch if you like i really do need to practice for the most part but i could take you up for a bit hermione looked from ron to her satchel and back with furrowed brows and an apologetic frown i d like to ron but she began as they started the walk toward the exit doors i really need to do a bit of research in the library ron highly doubted that hermione needed to do research but he nodded well we should be finished by eight or so hermione suddenly smiled up at him as she asked you know what i d like to do when you get back what that play you at wizard chess is that so ron asked returning her smile as they reached the grand staircase i know i wontwin but we haventplayed in a while and i really do enjoy just watching you play it is a spectacular sight isntit ron asked in mock seriousness causing hermione to giggle when they reached the fourth floor ron walked hermione down the corridor to the entrance of the library it a date then eight o clock hermione asked leaning into his chest it a date ron replied before their lips met in a tender kiss okay decameron decameron decameron hermione was slowly edging her way down one of the silent aisles in the studying her healing book at dinner she had come across a very brief passage on a particular witch from the 1800s she probably had plenty of information on nessy wellbrooks but hermione always felt as though she should research topics that were not discussed properly in the texts decameron hermione reached down to the bottom shelf to retrieve the 19th century most influential withces by candi decameron surely this book would have a more detailed account of nessy wellbrooks accomplishments in the field of healing hermione hoped she would have enough time to take some adequate notes from this text ron harry and ginny had already been practicing for about an hour so hermione had approximately one hour to study before ron would be coming in from the pitch she wanted to be completely finished with her studies for the night before he got back so that they could have a nice quiet evening together as hermione returned to her table strewn with paper and books she thought she heard the sound of footsteps running down the hall outside the library but she ignored them it was most likely an underclassman not yet familiar with madm pince rules for the fourth floor hermione sat down amidst her papers and opened the 19th century most influential withces to its table of contents but before she could even read the title of the first chapter she was interrupted by madam pince harsh whisper mr weasley there is no need for that sort of disruptive running in the halls mr weasley hermione thought it was only seven o clock what was he doing back early and why was he running jerking her head up from her book hermione saw ron coming toward her being closely watched by a disapproving madam pince hermione heart jumped into her throat at the sight of him but not because she was excited that he was back early her heart was jumping because of the stern urgent and anxious look on ron face hermione quickly stood from her chair as he approached her and took hold of her arm ron what s hermione we have to go now he whispered urgently his chest heaving what happened she asked her heart beating madly she reached for her satchel but ron was pulling her away from her table leave your things we ll come back for them he said before he all but dragged her from the room once in the corridor hermione had to run to keep up with his long hasty strides ron could you please tell me what going on did something happen on the pitch yes he replied shortly as they reached the stairs he grabbed her hand and began descending it harry harry hermione croaked as her heart began beating even more rapidly we were out on the pitch and he just he just ron looked at her with worried eyes and shook his head he let out this awful yell and then he he just flew from the pitch and took off toward hagrid hut i i probably should have followed after harry but hermione i dontknow what going on and i was afraid to leave you up here by yourself ron we have to tell someone hermione exclaimed i told ginny to alert hagrid and then wait for us at his hut so do you think he had a vision or something hermione asked as they reached the base of the stairs i not sure ron said as they headed for the huge double doors of the castle i just know that i ve never heard harry yell like that before as she followed ron out into the warm dusky evening she heard a bit of commotion behind her turning around she glimpsed a group of students crowded about the doors to the great hall before the castle front doors closed with a low boom as they hurried across the grounds in silence hermione saw hagrid hut slowly coming into view but she saw no ginny or hagrid and no harry ron must have noticed this too because his grip on her hand became tighter and his brows became more furrowed ron where ginny hermione asked as a small bubble of panic began to form in her stomach maybe hagrid wasntin his hut and and ginny has gone to find him ron offered squeezing her hand tighter still hermione had heard the uncertainty in his voice however and she knew that if harry had flown off in the direction of hagrid hut but wasntactually in hagrid hut there was really only one other place he could ve gone the forbidden forest and if there were anyone brave enough to fly into the forest alone in search of harry it would be ginny once they were standing in front of the hut ron released hermione hand and ran his nervous fingers through his crimson hair he then approached the door and knocked loudly fang barks began instantly but no one answered he knocked again but again no one ron we ve got to go tell dumbledore hermione said urgently that may be where ginny gone but we canttake any ch before hermione could finish she heard the loud snap of a twig coming from the direction of the forest she then saw ron eyes get wide and his mouth drop open slightly spinning around on her heel hermione saw the tail of black robes disappearing just beyond the front wall of trees into the forest harry ron called as he jumped down from hagrid front doorsteps and ran toward the forest harry he yelled into the trees hermione ran after ron and caught him by his upper arm that was him she asked breathlessly yes i saw his face he exclaimed looking frantically into the trees hermione he muttered before looking down at her his blue eyes were filled with an emotion that hermione couldntplace hermione i have to go after him i going with you she proclaimed as she looked into the dense trees hermione i going hermione shouted impatiently she was sure she had just seen a glimpse of a lone figure walking deeper into the forest ron closed his eyes briefly and let out a long sigh before grabbing hold of her hand and pulling her into the forest it was beginning to get rather dark anyway and with the canopy of trees visibility was even poorer however there was nothing to prevent hermione and ron from hearing snap harry they both shouted together before breaking into a run the night air was a bit cooler in the forest and it seemed to sting hermione eyes as they ran causing them to water beyond the tears however hermione sight was beginning to adjust to the darkness every few seconds she would see the figure ahead of them who was running as well his robes billowing behind him but then she would lose sight of him again leaving her running blindly her hand held firmly in ron s although hermione feet were carrying her through the forest tripping into small dips and ruts and jumping over fallen limbs her mind seemed to be stagnant all she could think of was stopping harry but as for the important question of what they were stopping him from hermione had no room to fathom why was harry running into the forbidden forest deeper and deeper into the forest they ran until hermione felt as though her lungs might explode in her chest every breath she took was painful her robes kept catching on fallen branches and twigs a cold sweat had broken over her entire body and she could almost feel the eyes of various creatures upon them and then without warning ron stopped in his tracks causing her to stumble slightly hermione turned to him to inquire the reasoning for him stopping but a mere ten feet behind him she saw their suspect staring straight at her and it was not harry and he was not alone ron hermione screamed in warning squeezing his hand tightly while pointing behind him before she could speak the names crabbe and goyle however ron grabbed her arms and thrust her roughly against a tree pinning her body with his and covering her mouth with one of his hands hermione whole body froze as she looked up into ron face with complete bafflement a cold chill ran through her his eyes were cruel and he was smiling just slightly he leaned in toward her until his mouth was upon her ear you ve done perfectly thus far granger now i just ask that you dontscream he whispered in a low hiss his breath was warm yet it turned her very blood to ice hermione gasp was stifled by the hand that was still pressed firmly against her mouth after a brief second of shock she began trying to move her arms or hands but they were pinned upon her captor chest she then tried to move her legs but they were pinned against his there was only one thing she could think to do which she decided to do once he was distracted by his own voice in a mocking voice he began but hermione i dontknow what going on and i was afraid to leave you up here by yourself pathetic he chuckled before leaning back from her ear long enough to look at her with those familiar yet foreign blue eyes she briefly glimpsed a faint three inch scar appearing on his neck closing her eyes tightly she managed to open her mouth and bite malfoy hand between his index finger and thumb he jerked his hand away as he growled an expletive but not before she tasted blood hermione then attempted to move from being pinned against the tree but his body was still pressed against hers before she could even scream he had gripped her neck painfully with his other hand he was glaring at her and suddenly she was looking into a face she d never seen before it was ron face but she d never seen her ron look at anyone with so much hatred his grip on her neck was only getting tighter as he glared at her and a numb feeling began to spread throughout her skull he then leaned in until his face was a mere two inches from hers you want to be careful he snarled in anger tearing his eyes from her to look at the blood trickling down his palm i bite back he added wiping his bloodied palm upon her cheek before ducking his head to her neck as soon as she felt his teeth begin to clamp onto her neck she also felt his body release some of the pressure from hers hermione then lifted her knee as swiftly as she could until it impacted between his legs a pained cry tore from malfoy throat and he immediately released her hermione ducked away from him gasping for air as she darted into the growing darkness get her you idiots she heard malfoy yell she could hear the sounds of footsteps upon leaves and twigs but she didntdare turn around she was suddenly in the department of mysteries again she was lost in darkness while being hunted by followers of him the same terrified yet somehow quick and clear thought process was taking over her mind where am i she thought frantically she hadntbeen paying a bit of attention to the path they had followed while in pursuit of one of malfoy goons and even if she had she couldntsee anything other than the outline of trees but wait she could hear water there was a stream near grawp cave hermione changed her course slightly in search of the stream she wanted to scream for grawp so badly but what about the centaurs they would kill her if they saw her wandering through the forest alone at night wouldntthey or what if there were death eaters in the forest what if the forest were their hideout what if voldemort were amongst these very trees were the footsteps behind her growing quieter or was she making too much noise on her own to hear properly maintaining a steady run hermione managed to remove her wand from her robes her robes which were not appropriate for running through a forest should she just remove them she was still wearing her school uniform underneath was there anything in the robes she might need the mirror why hadntshe thought of it sooner reaching into her robes hermione retrieved the mirror she held her wand to the tiny mirror engorgio hermione managed to rasp between pants r ah hermione fell hard to the ground a numbing pain was shooting through her entire body something had just hit her in the back it felt like a brick but from the blue flash she had seen briefly light the area around her before the impact she knew it was a spell it seemed to have paralyzed her legs lying there panting hermione realized that the mirror had fallen from her grasp after the fall she could now hear the sound of rapid footsteps approaching panic was coursing through her but all she could do was use her arms to pull her along the ground the crunching of leaves was growing louder and louder and louder no hermione screamed as she felt a hand clasp over her ankle she was telling her leg to kick but it wouldn t got her goyle yelled as his other hand grabbed hold of her other ankle before he had a chance to do more hermione shot behind her with a silent spell she heard an angry groan and managed to turn herself over on her back to see goyle stumbling away from her a sharp pain suddenly shot through her left leg which she had fallen on just moments before her legs were beginning to feel again hermione clumsily hoisted herself up onto her two feet she didntknow where crabbe and malfoy were but she didnthave time to think on it goyle was leaned against a tree groaning in pain after hastily wrenching the robes off of her and allowing them fall to the ground hermione was about to turn and run when she saw it the mirror hermione had just seen the glass reflect a bit of the minimal moonlight shining through a hole in the canopy of branches overhead it was just one step from her she made to lunge for it but a figure stepped in front of her malfoy she started to raise her wand but he was so close he grabbed it with his hand pulled it from her fingers and threw it to the ground she turned to run again but she felt his arms encircle her hermione struggled with all her might but his arms only held her tighter the longer she struggled his hold was so tight she felt as though she couldntbreath ron she screamed in hopes that the mirror would detect her strangled voice she then kicked her feet until she felt her toe collide with the small bit of metal and glass she had to propel it away from her and malfoy if malfoy or the others saw it glowing they would surely smash it she heard it skid along the ground a bit before it stopped hermione prayed to the stars that she hadntsmashed it herself just one more time ginny ron shouted across the pitch then i promise we ll head inside ron wasntsure if his sister believed him he had given her the one more time encouragement about three times already but ron really meant it this time he was tired it was getting too dark to see properly and mostly he was ready to see hermione he had a date with her and a chessboard looking out over the pitch ron had a clear view of harry who was practicing nosedives and ginny who was perfecting the shimmy she was doing so well now he was having trouble finding things to criticize as ron watched his best mate and his sister he began to feel a bit guilty and a bit like oliver wood he d been telling hermione to calm down with her studies but maybe he should back off just a bit from quidditch with this thought mulling around in ron mind he decided to cross the pitch to tell harry and ginny that practice was officially over ron leaned forward as he zoomed ahead the wind was whipping across his face which felt pleasant although the wind also seemed to be causing ron to hear things he almost thought he d heard a scream what the ron muttered as he halted mid pitch he could feel a slight vibration against his leg and as he looked down he saw a dim blue glow visible through his jeans pocket reaching into his pocket ron clamped his hand around the tiny silver mirror and removed it he didntsee his reflection in the glass just darkness and he could hear the sound of rushing water had the mirror accidentally activated from hermione pocket on a trip to the lavatory ron was just opening his mouth to call hermione name when he heard a familiar voice a voice that caused the blood in his veins to freeze lumos a bright light flashed and suddenly ron could see two people standing they seemed to be standing almost directly over the mirror because he was looking up at them he wonthear you out here mudblood malfoy hissed ron felt his heart accelerate yet as fast as the beating was he felt paralyzed you made sure of that didntyou coward hermione yelled as she struggled to break free of malfoy hold suddenly malfoy pushed hermione roughly to the ground ron was gripping the mirror so tightly now it was painful a feeling of dread was numbing his mind which was suddenly filled with vital yet unanswered questions where were they malfoy seemed oblivious to the activated mirror what would happen if ron made his presence known what would happen if he didn t as ron stomach churned with the weight of the decision he was trying to make he saw something quite unexpected malfoy leaned over the mirror slightly yet ron found himself looking at himself polyjuice potion for a split second ron thought malfoy was looking directly at him through the mirror however ron soon realized that hermione had fallen beside the mirror and malfoy was peering down at her with grey eyes the potion was wearing off ron could hear hermione quick breaths and it was all he could do to keep himself from screaming her name but if he did malfoy would surely smash the mirror and then ron might miss something important like where the hell they were had malfoy drug her to a bathroom he could still hear the water was there more to the chamber of secrets than they knew ron was about to fly straight for hogwarts when he heard malfoy voice again dontcall me a coward malfoy said through gritted teeth ron then saw malfoy raise one hand and bring it down sharply there was a loud smack and a scream from hermione although there was a monster inside of him ready to explode from fury ron had just seen something vital a hill a large familiar hill and then the soft buzzing ceased and he was suddenly looking at his own blue eyed reflection harry ron cried as he bent low on his broom and began zooming in the direction of the forbidden forest he didnteven look behind him to see if harry had heard he had to get to grawp cave i positive that was grawp cave ron repeated to himself as he flew faster than he d ever flown before as soon as hagrid hut came into view ron dove low and made a somewhat sloppy landing in hagrid garden ron then ran to the door of the hut and banged as hard as he could he heard fang barking but he heard no heavy footsteps or cheerful voice ron ron spun around at the sound of a fearful voice for a split second he had thought it was hermione but it was only his sister she and harry were looking at him with wide eyes as they approached him their brooms held firmly in their hands it hermione he got her malfoy grawp cave ron shouted as fang continued to bark he couldntseem to get enough breath to make much of a coherent sentence malfoy has hermione in grawp cave ginny cried her hand flying to her mouth outside the cave ron exclaimed impatiently running toward harry and gripping him by the arms i dontremember how to get there harry i dontremember i ll go get hagrid harry said he had gone awfully pale but he quickly mounted his firebolt ron shoved his mirror into his pocket as he nodded wait ron shouted as he retrieved his shrunken healing kit that had just clanged against his mirror the memory potion ron breathed engorgio the small metal box enlarged to its original size and ron swiftly removed neville sample vile of potion he then thrust the box at ginny who grabbed it awkwardly hastily removing the cork ron drank the entire vile of potion without a second thought it was a somewhat sour concoction that caused ron nose hairs to burn but he did feel something but what did he feel his stomach seemed to be churning slightly but ron didntknow for sure if that were from the potion or his anxiety harry and ginny were both watching him anxiously harry seemed to be bouncing up and down on his broom in anticipation then it happened he saw it ron saw the path to the cave as clear as if he had walked through the forest with hagrid yesterday follow me ron shouted as he mounted his broom and shot up into the air it would be quicker to fly above the trees then they could swoop down once they were over grawp cave so ron led the way it was impossible to see down below to the forest floor the trees were so dense it was actually impossible to see where the hill was located but ron remembered she down there and she fine she down there and she fine ron continued to repeat to himself the moon was the only light over the forest but ron could have found the hill in complete darkness why wouldnthis broom go faster every second that passed seemed to cause ron breaths to come shorter and faster with fear once they were over the exact location of the hill ron dropped down into the trees and quickly lowered himself between the branches and to the forest floor he heard harry yell in surprise but when ron looked above him harry just whispered thestral finally ron felt his feet touch the earth he immediately removed his wand and uttered lumos harry and ginny followed his lead lighting their wands as well directly in front of them stood the moss covered hill that was the home of hagrid brother i ll check out the cave harry said firmly ron nodded as he hurriedly walked the perimeter of the hill nothing he saw nothing he heard nothing other than trees and water there was nothing for the first time since ron looked into the mirror over the pitch he began to feel true panic up to this point he had felt a numb fear and anger but now he felt as if a horrible poison were coursing through him causing him to feel more and more helpless and hopeless with each shallow breath ron harry at the sound of his sister voice ron turned and ran as fast as he could back around to the front of the cave when he reached her harry was already by her side harry the cave ron asked urgently harry shook his head nothing no grawp no hagrid nothing harry said with his jaw set before looking down at ginny it hermione wand and mirror and and ginny whisper broke off as tears formed in her eyes and she thrust something into ron hands ron took the item hermione robes they were covered in dirt and small pieces of twigs and leaves and there was a tear along the bottom ron gripped the garment tightly and swallowed hard he couldntlose it now he had to stay strong he had to find her it okay ginny we re going to find her harry said firmly taking ginny into his arms the confidence in his voice actually gave ron a small feeling of hope however this small feeling of hope in the midst of ron panic was quickly squelched we re wasting time we have to do something now ron said mounting his broom wait ginny said in a small voice she then turned her face up to harry who had an arm about her waist you have to seek his mind harry he knows where she is you know he does of course ron thought dismounting quickly and crossing to harry without a word he and harry looked at one another briefly before harry closed his eyes he doesntneed to be supported anymore ron realized harry had become strong enough to reach voldemort mind without worrying about collapsing ron glanced at his sister who was biting her nails and shifting her weight from one foot to the other he crossed to her and placed a hand upon her shoulder it was a gesture meant to console both of them but after she looked up at him she threw her arms tightly about him they clung to one another as they turned their eyes upon harry the feeling of his sister in his arms was almost more than ron could bear her frame was so similar to hermione s so small and fragile harry was standing completely still ron couldnteven see his chest moving although he could hear steady breathing coming from his friend i l love you ron ginny whispered i love you too ginny hermione is g going to be fine i know it she strong yes she is very strong i just hope she realizes it lie in tar harry murmured ron and ginny both exchanged confused glances before they approached harry whose eyes were now open i couldntstay long harry began quickly it important that he doesntknow i accessing his mind right now but he was looking off of a balcony of some sort he was looking down it must have been three hundred feet down he was feeling anxious like he was waiting for something for someone harry finished gravely ron throat clamped but ginny asked the question stirring in his mind but what about lying in tar harry furrowed his brows for a moment before his eyes got wide yes there was a liontaur standing beside him it was a massive creature he was wearing a large gold necklace he had tattoos of some sort and shut up a second ron exclaimed his stomach began to churn again it was the memory potion and he was apparently still feeling the effects of it liontaurs ron repeated to himself they practice geomancy which is a form of divination using the soil of the earth instead of tealeaves and crystal balls it really fascinating that these creatures are only found in one area of the entire world they live on an island in the north sea above germany called fohr its largest town is wyk and the muggles dontrealize that it named after the first wemic chief of the middle ages ron took a deep breath after this unexpected spill harry and ginny were both staring at him with their mouths partway open we ve got to get to fohr that where he taking her i know it ron exclaimed wait wait ginny cried how did you know all that i mean what what she sighed heavily looking from ron to harry in utter bewilderment it the memory potion ron replied hastily grabbing his broom from the ground he grabbed harry as well and thrust it into his hands hermione researched wemics or liontaurs last term after she found out that neville new wand had wemic tail hairs we re not taking our brooms harry said quickly ron furrowed his brows at his friend harry we donthave time to go back to the castle we know where she is and we ve got to go i learned map conjuring in geography of the magical world we have everything we need right here ginny you can go for help ron removed his wand from his back pocket and began the incantation for a detailed map from scotland to the island of fohr no ginny exclaimed i going with you ginny no harry said firmly harry ginny when we find hermione there going to be harry began but he faltered when ron looked up at him from his map conjuring harry cleared his throat before looking back down at ginny and continuing we re going to need help from the order i ll send for dumbledore but we need you to stay here and make certain that someone gets the message harry removed his wand from his pocket and held it up into the air a white stag emerged from the tip and galloped into the trees toward hogwarts harry you know dumbledore will get that ginny shouted you just dontwant me to come along but i can help we donthave time for this ron shouted at his sister as he finished his map conjuring ron right ginny now here harry said thrusting his firebolt into ginny hands take that and get to someone fast alright harry ginny began in a pleading voice harry grabbed her and pulled her to him i love you harry whispered ron wanted to scream at them to hurry up but he held his tongue now please hurry harry added before kissing ginny upon her lips let go ron cried mounting his broom i faster harry said simply as he released ginny what ron asked in confusion this wasntthe time to discuss flying skills without answering harry gave one last kiss to ginny who quickly mounted the firebolt harry then turned his neck roughly to one side and stamped his foot ron watched him with wide bewildered eyes yet ginny simply looked anxious ron was on the verge of grabbing harry throwing him over his own broom and taking off but then it started the transformation that ron had only seen once before harry face back arms and legs began to elongate as his clamped fists turned black and hard resting his hooves on the ground his form became covered with course black hair before his eyes ron saw the feral winged creature that was unrecognizably his best mate the unruly black hair glowing green eyes and white lightning bolt blaze were the only characteristics of this beast that ron found to resemble harry as soon as the transformation was complete ron realized what harry had meant when he d said i faster he faster than brooms ron dismounted quickly and allowed his broom to fall to the ground harry flapped one wing causing ron and ginny brooms to levitate and fly into grawp cave good luck ginny said as she hovered to ron side and thrust hermione wand and mirror into his hands she then began to rise above the trees the island of fohr ron called as a reminder she nodded quickly before she disappeared above the branches ron then heard a loud swoosh as she took off toward the castle glancing back down ron saw that harry had lowered his wing and was kneeling slightly without hesitation ron climbed on locking his knees under harry wings as soon as he was settled harry pushed off from the ground and rose into the air his wings moved with grace and ease as he maneuvered them between the branches until they were above the trees ron looked below and caught a glimpse of ginny landing halfway between the castle and hagrid hut hagrid was seemingly on his way home as ginny met him moving her hands about furiously as she spoke hagrid looked into the sky directly at ron before turning and running to the castle ginny just told hagrid ron said to harry who nodded his head twice ron then felt the base of harry wings tighten over his legs a bit before he flew high into the air and increased their momentum ron gasped out loud at the remarkable speed this was definitely faster than their brooms not even harry firebolt could move at this speed which meant they were going faster than one hundred fifty miles an hour opening the conjured map held firmly in his hand ron began calling out directions to harry who would nod twice if they were understood or shake his head back and forth if he needed them repeated by his map ron saw that fohr was approximately four hundred forty miles away harry ron began croakily we re doing the right thing arentwe by not waiting for the order harry nodded twice and ron continued i mean you remember how long it took the order to arrive at the department of mysteries we ve wasted enough time as it is haventwe harry nodded again ron found himself absently patting the soft hair on harry neck it was somehow helping clear ron mind a bit which was good and bad good because he needed a clear mind for what they might find at fohr but bad because he could now think of all the horrible things that they might find at fohr did ron hope that hermione was there or not if voldemort were on the island with these liontaurs then that the last place he wanted her to be but if she werentthere then where was she lumos a bright light shown in hermione eyes as malfoy held the light up to her face he wonthear you out here mudblood malfoy hissed you made sure of that didntyou coward hermione yelled as she struggled to break free of malfoy hold suddenly malfoy pushed hermione roughly to the ground hermione felt a sharp pain in her back and gasped she was sure she had just fallen on a branch of some sort she could feel a trickling of blood falling down her back glancing at the mirror hermione could see something it wasnta reflection but a patch of red hair and a few twinkling stars behind his head ron he was watching malfoy leaned over the mirror slightly and for a terrifying second hermione thought malfoy had seen ron however as she looked into malfoy grey eyes she saw that he was peering down at her first the scar now the eyes the potion was wearing off dontcall me a coward malfoy said through gritted teeth hermione breaths began quickening as she looked up into malfoy face she could almost feel his disgust and hatred toward her she was about to ask him what he planned to do with her when he raised one hand and brought it down sharply across her cheek she screamed at the contact suddenly fearful that he might kill her then and there but malfoy then grabbed her arms and lifted her from the ground once she was on her feet again she felt two arms grab her from behind that was a familiar grip goyle she spotted crabbe approaching as well why are you doing this hermione asked in a hoarse whisper before malfoy waved his wand in front of her face she immediately felt her throat tighten and as she tried to speak she realized that she had just been silenced i following orders and i dontquestion the dark lord orders he spat before motioning to crabbe and goyle they then set off into the trees hermione saw that they were heading behind grawp cave closer to the sound of rushing water although hermione knew that without her wand or her voice there was little else she could do she refused to walk willingly with her captors into the arms of voldemort so with all the strength she could muster she struggled she kicked she tried to bite when she could the only thing she was accomplishing however seemed to be deepening bruises on her arms hermione was actually a bit confused as to why malfoy pace was so slow he wasntwalking quickly at all he was almost taking a leisurely pace it was hard to tell in the dim light but hermione thought his hair was becoming lighter and his body thinner goyle hoisted her up onto his shoulder as she continued to struggle and she saw the top of grawp hill becoming shorter and shorter is it in the stream malfoy crabbe asked suddenly he said it would be lodged in a tree by the stream he said it would be obvious malfoy said distractedly hermione resumed her kicking again and felt herself being removed from goyle shoulder he placed her feet on the ground once more yet kept a firm hold on her arms the stream was now in clear view are you sure we cantkill her goyle growled his grip tightening as hermione continued to struggle i told you the dark lord wants her alive malfoy hissed there he breathed hermione followed his pointing finger she didntsee it at first but then she spotted a strange knot on one of the trees that was directly on the stream banks it was a large knot with a raised carving of a curled serpent upon it was it some sort of button would a secret entrance open when touched hermione felt her heart begin to quiver madly in her chest and ears was she about to face the darkest wizard of all time her legs began to feel numb and her sight began to play tricks on her she had just seen a large boulder in the stream move or wait after gasping which made a small sound as the silencing charm was beginning to fade hermione raised her heel and kicked goyle shin as hard as she could ah shit he yelled malfoy turned two squinted eyes upon goyle who thrust her at malfoy he caught her roughly by the arms and began to shake her granger i swear i am on the verge of using my first cruciatus curse he growled but hermione was only half listening for just behind malfoy and crabbe the boulder she had seen moving in the stream was rising from the water sixteen feet tall malfoy goyle yelled with an obvious note of fear in his voice grawpy hermione called her voice lifted from her chest loud and strong and she watched as malfoy brows furrowed in confusion hermy grawp bellowed tears of hope sprang into hermione eyes as the giant took one step from the stream bringing him to stand one foot from the four humans malfoy eyes became wide with fear as he turned sharply to look up at the giant hermione heard a sort of croak come from him and then she felt his grip on her release completely she immediately ran to grawp crabbe made to grab for her but she dove forward falling onto one of grawp coffee table sized feet you no hurt hagger hermy grawp yelled stamping the foot that hermione was not lying across and causing crabbe to scream and collapse to the ground in fear portus hermione looked to the serpent carving and saw malfoy holding his wand to it a blue flame had just spread over the knot and then disappeared a portkey stupefy goyle yelled suddenly shooting a red light at grawp chest it did in fact impact with the giant but that is all that it did other than making him a bit angrier grawp let out a yell that actually sounded like an echoing roar of some sort that hermione had never heard before he then grasped the tree next to the one with the embedded portkey and with one tug pulled it from the earth dirt began falling around the three boys who were all shielding their heads with their hands you idiot malfoy yelled we canttake on a giant crabbe get her and let go it ready crabbe didntmove as grawp threw the tree to the side the tree made a resounding boom and shook the ground as it landed on the opposite bank of the creek uh oh grawp muttered which sounded more like an earthquake than a mutter hagger likes trees it okay grawpy hermione called up to the giant he tilted his head to one side and looked down at her she tried to smile reassuringly at him but she then felt a hand clamp onto her arm and pull her from grawp foot no no no grawp yelled stamping his foot one time as crabbe drug hermione over the ground toward the portkey where malfoy and goyle were standing with their wands raised grawp was lowering his umbrella sized hand slowly in an attempt to avoid hurting hermione but all hermione could see was a hand casting a black shadow over crabbe who was still dragging her struggling as she was over the hard ground she could feel her skirt getting torn and her legs becoming scraped crabbe reach for it malfoy yelled if hermione could only free her hand from his grip the portkey would take crabbe and not her it was impossible however he was so much stronger than her all she could do was continue to struggle in vain as she kept a hopeful eye on grawp whose thumb and index finger were descending over a panic stricken crabbe crabbe lunged for the portkey and grabbed the knob which malfoy and goyle grabbed as well however grawp fingers clamped down on crabbe torso at the same instant hermione felt an awful tug behind her navel as hermione lay on solid ground watching the world spin around her she began to take deep gulping breaths she was leaving hogwarts she was going to an unknown destination undoubtedly far away never to return again never to see ron again never to see the light of day again hermione was almost sure that her world would be spinning even if she werenttraveling by portkey suddenly crabbe began to scream in pain calling hermione attention back to the horrifying present grawp was pinching him squinting his beady eyes in anger hermione distinctly heard a cracking noise that she was sure was the sound of a breaking rib grawp no hermione cried he was going to kill him if he didntstop when the world suddenly stopped spinning hermione felt her body jerk and she then found herself lying on a wet marshy ground everything was suddenly much colder and a dense fog hung low around them she could even see her breath the sound of rushing water could still be heard but this sound was different from that of the forest stream this water seemed to be echoing there were trees scattered about a large field and there was a wall of jagged mountains surrounding them illuminated a shiny black in the moonlight ah hermione felt her hand being released and as she glanced up she saw grawp lift crabbe from the ground and throw him to the side just as he had the tree in the forest hermione watched in horror as crabbe body flew through the air and landed with a thud in a crumpled pile on the ground she meant to scream as she stared at his motionless form but she instead became sick on the ground you sleep now grawp yelled poking at crabbe body with a large finger hermione was about to call for grawp when she felt her throat clamp once more looking up from the ground she saw malfoy approaching she had again been silenced goyle was kneeling on the ground staring at crabbe with horror in his eyes hermione aching as her body was hoisted herself from the ground she would have to run passed malfoy to get to grawp so hermione made the decision to turn and run in the opposite direction however after turning to run she took two small steps before coming to a complete halt and falling to her knees in terror before her stood two creatures that hermione had only seen in books two magical creatures that had not been properly represented by mere pictures wemics was she on the island of fohr they were standing tall at least eight feet tall their torsos which were described in books as humanoid were actually larger and more muscular than any human man she d ever seen and they were covered with strange colored tattoos that resembled some ancient symbols she had seen in magic history books their lion like bodies which extended nine feet long were covered in a dusky golden fur with white underbellies feline features meshed with human features to cover their faces which were framed with long manes of auburn hair but for hermione the most frightening part of the beasts was their cat like slitted pupils they were each carrying leather covered shields wooden bows and long stone tipped arrows which they had pointed at grawp who was now approaching hermione with a somewhat confused look on his face as he stared at the liontaurs centaurs grawp asked in a deep roar hermione looked from grawp to the wemics shaking her head as the only means of communication she seemed to be capable of at the moment she was almost positive the wemics would take grawp comment as an insult and not surprisingly centaurs the smaller of the two asked in a deep drawling voice hermione was surprised to hear the clarity of his speech giant calls us centaurs does he he glared at grawp with his yellow eyes before he pulled his bowstring back and released an arrow that lodged into grawp shoulder grawp yelled in pain as the larger wemic reached one hand out to the other bow no moritz you anger giant only attack on my order he growled hermione felt the ground begin to vibrate as grawp began taking cautious steps toward the wemics who were now prowling about with their bows and arrows pulled well volker moritz shouted attack the larger wemic named volker shouted back two more arrows were shot at grawp who once more yelled in pain stop hermione shouted despite her better judgment her voice had returned and after she saw the smaller wemic look at her with wide eyes she wished she were still silenced moritz had something very evil about him she could see it in his eyes she also noticed that he had a necklace covered in small bones while volker wore a necklace of arrowheads two hands suddenly pulled her roughly from the ground malfoy hoisted her over his shoulder his strength surprised her a bit but she could tell he was struggling a bit more with her resistant movements than goyle had grawpy hermione yelled in panic as malfoy began carrying her toward the towering black mountains before them she could now see numerous caves along the walls of the mountains that had been hidden by the dense fog over malfoy shoulder she saw grawp turn to look at her as he continued to pull the rain of arrows from his body there were now two more wemics around him keeping him enclosed in a tight circle he was trying to swing at them with his massive hands but the creatures were as fast and stealthy as true lions hermione began beating on malfoy back with her fists as hard as she could and he actually stopped in his tracks he had come to such an abrupt halt that hermione actually ceased her poundings without a word malfoy lowered her feet to the soft ground he then turned her around roughly to face the mountain rising ominously before them then hermione saw something very odd malfoy reached one hand before them and closed his fist as if grabbing an invisible handle he then pulled his arm back and hermione heard the distinct creaking of a large heavy door she gasped as she saw a long large gray stoned hallway lit with torches along the walls appear before her it was a hallway in the middle of air the fidelius charm hermione asked absently malfoy didntanswer and he didnthave to suddenly hermione eyes went wide as she saw a huge black stone castle emerge out of nowhere she was suddenly standing before two large black doors with large silver handles upon them one of them was ajar allowing her to see inside hermione had done in depth research on the fidelius charm and she knew that the only way to see a place put under the charm without obtaining the secret from the secret keeper was to look straight through an open door she tilted her head back in an attempt to see the top of the castle but it was impossible because of the fog though she did see some figures flying about overhead dementors she also saw a large green engraving of a snake above the door and written upon the snake were the words slytherin school of magic as malfoy held his hands firmly upon her shoulders hermione began to shiver it felt as though the bulk of her shivers were in her stomach but she wasntsure if it were from the damp cold of this place or if it were from the sudden appearance of this massive castle this school of dark magic hermione let out a long shaky sigh as

copyright violation is intended no profit is being made off this site it is for entertainment purposes only chapter 43 move hermione heard the command but she didntobey once she stepped over the threshold of this castle and the doors closed behind her she would be entombed she fully understood that she would almost certainly never leave this place alive move malfoy yelled impatiently shoving her and sending a sharp pain through her back the cut she had received after falling in the forbidden forest had only begun to hurt worse taking in a deep breath of the cold night air hermione stepped into the dimly lit entrance hall she was able to catch one last glimpse of grawp still pursued by the wemics running into the thick forest before the heavy black doors shut behind her the echo of the closing doors sent a shiver through hermione before the echo ceased and there was silence the silence wasntcomplete hermione could hear the beating of her heart solid hard a reminder that she was not dreaming the long grey stoned hall before her had two arched doorways on the left and two on the right the first door on the left had a descending staircase the second an ascending staircase the stairways to the right mirrored those to the left green flamed wall torches lit the corridor dimly but with enough light for hermione to see down its length and as hermione eyes adjusted to what lay before her she began to walk slowly down the hallway she didntoffer a second glance to the two doorways on the left or right she knew exactly where malfoy was taking her at the end of the hallway a massive green and black marbled staircase rose to a second floor and on that second floor hermione could see an orange glow coming from a black door opened a mere crack it seemed to take a long while to finally reach the base of the staircase which was unexpectedly immaculate and beautiful but once they had hermione didnthesitate to begin the ascent the banister was smooth under hermione fingers yet she could feel an engraving glancing down hermione saw an engraved snake the entire length of the handrail she jerked her hand away remembering whose hands had undoubtedly traced this marbled stone a bit jumpy arentwe malfoy asked with a snicker as he followed closely behind her hermione didntrespond her eyes were fixed upon the crack of the black door before her as they reached the top of the stairs she heard the crackling of a fire wait here malfoy said tensely before moving around her and quickly disappearing through the crack hermione could scarcely believe her ears wait here her heart rate which had become almost steady began to quicken turning on her heel hermione had every intention of running back down the stairs and out of this tomb she would take her chances with whatever lurked outside but just as hermione stepped off of the marble landing onto the first step she heard a scraping noise that sent a chill down her spine turning around on the step hermione first saw two bluish yellow eyes in the shadows created by the dim light of the opened door on the landing but the beast then stepped into the light his claws scraping along the stone floor it was a wemic but one she had not yet seen you are female youngling who has brought giant hermione was rooted to the spot but she managed to nod the wemic continued to stare at her and she stared back not because she thought it wise to keep eye contact with this massively powerful beast but because she found it impossible to look away from his leonine eyes he my friend she said quietly the wemic tilted his head to one side as if considering her he looked much more youthful than the wemics from outside and he had only one tattoo on his body it was a large red and black sun on his tanned right arm massive as he was he must have been at least a foot shorter than the others of his kind he too wore a necklace but his was not decorated with bones or arrowheads but with strings of glass beads giants do not befriend humans the wemic stated plainly hermione could see his long teeth as he spoke yes they do hermione protested grawp is gentle and kind he was trying to protect me from your people i do not have a people the wemic said sounding a bit perturbed i egon son of basilius have brethren his voice was warm and leathery it would have been a pleasant voice in a different situation a much different situation egon hermione repeated as she stared into the creature eyes his eyes werentreally unkind just untrusting why do you and your brethren support lord voldemort she asked calmly a question that had been burning angrily in her stomach as soon as she had seen the wemics open fire on grawp egon feline like nostrils flared before he whispered deeply wemics support no one but their chieftain then why were there wemics outside guarding this castle why did they attack my friend hermione asked boldly egon curled his upper lip into an unpleasant grimace which showed some very sharp and intimidating teeth hermione took a couple of steps back as human you should know that men often fall prey to temptation wemics are no different in that regard he replied with a note of gravity so voldemort has bribed you hermione murmured as she pondered what the bribe could be to her knowledge wemics were some of the least materialistic creatures on earth but dontyou understand who you re helping voldemort is an evil man and your kind could be fighting against him i always thought wemics were peaceful she finished quietly wemics are obedient to their chieftain egon replied tersely well dontbe hermione spat causing egon eyes to go wide she then added your leader is foolish but those that follow him without question are even more foolish than him she suddenly felt no fear just anger and confusion chief basilius is my chieftain egon growled taking a few prowling steps toward hermione he is my chieftain and my father he added now standing so close to her that she could feel the heat of his body his enormous clawed paws were mere inches from her feet a bit of hermione fear returned as she looked at the heaving torso of this half man half beast his chest was about three times the width of hermione s and she was strongly considering apologizing for insulting not only his chieftain but also his father when she heard the sudden creaking of the door behind her the corridor was flooded with orange light granger malfoy called egon backed away from her slowly and hermione turned toward the snarling face of malfoy the now completely transformed draco malfoy there was not even a slight semblance of ron remaining this fact tore at hermione unexpectedly she would never see ron face again even if it were a copy of his face on another hermione wished she could see it one last time but she had no picture of ron with her she had no magic mirror and it was because of the blond haired rat standing before her hermione glared at him for a moment before her eyes wandered into the room behind him it appeared to be a study of some sort he ready to see you malfoy said both of you he added looking to egon cautiously as hermione took a few steps toward the doorway she began to feel the heat coming from the room crackling fire yet she somehow felt cold egon was standing silent tall and proud obviously waiting for her to go first and malfoy leaned against the black door holding it open for her entrance hermione straightened to her full height and held her chin out she would not scurry into the room like a coward praying that her shaking knees would remain undetected under the hem of her skirt hermione stalked past malfoy into the warm room as hermione looked around the study she was surprisingly reminded of the gryffindor common room only instead of all d cor being red and gold it was green and silver the stone walls were covered in green tapestries all of them plain except for one hung above the stone fireplace on which was woven an elaborate silver snake facing the flames dancing in the stone fireplace was a tall black winged back chair as hermione eyes continued to sweep the room she saw an elaborate desk made of the same marble as the staircase situated in one corner of the study books surrounded the desk in neat piles most of them leather bound and quite worn in appearance even more beautiful than the mounds of books however was the ceiling twenty feet above her there was a mosaic of green silver blue and yellow glass it was a room that if it were at hogwarts hermione would have undoubtedly spent an endless amount of time welcome miss granger hermione throat clamped tightly and she briefly wondered if she had been silenced once more it was not a spell that had rendered her speechless however it was the smooth articulate voice coming from the black chair in front of the fire glow a tall dark haired figure emerged from the chair and slowly turned to face her hermione could feel her chin start to tremble slightly so she clenched her teeth in order to hide it he was holding something in his arms that he gently laid on a small rug before the fire it was a snake hermione was immediately reminded of the many times harry had told her that voldemort looked like a snake but either harry was wrong or voldemort had changed this man before her was tall and handsome with straight and shiny black hair combed neatly about his pale face there were a few strands of gray mixed into his locks he was wearing long black robes with the slytherin crest upon the breast although he was thin and pale he did not look weak his cold smile and shining eyes gave him an air of arrogance and confidence as voldemort looked hermione up and down with a critical eye the snake began slowly slithering along the floor toward her hermione took a sharp intake of breath and stepped a few paces backward she heard a low growl and looked over her shoulder at egon who was baring his teeth at the snake now now miss granger voldemort said smoothly nagini is simply welcoming you to my school hermione swallowed hard trying to keep her voice calm if this is a school then why have i seen no students she asked shakily keeping one eye on nagini who was still slowly inching her way toward her why the summer holidays miss granger he replied matter of factly i was never fond of hogwart spring term schedule my faculty and i thought a more concise term would suffice you mean you and your death eaters hermione said evenly making sure to keep eye contact with the man that had been set on taking her for the last year and set on killing her friend for the last sixteen voldemort raised one eyebrow and took a couple of steps toward hermione who kept her ground despite the growing shakiness of her legs he was still a good ten feet from her but she felt as if his eyes were boring into her thoughts just when hermione was beginning to feel that she would have to look away from his penetrating gaze he turned his eyes upon egon do you have a message for me wemic voldemort asked sounding a bit impatient my father wishes to know what female youngling is for egon stated firmly taking a few steps forward until he was standing beside hermione volker sends word to father of girl appearing out of air with three boys and violent giant he was only violent because one of the wemics shot an arrow at him hermione said through gritted teeth silence miss granger voldemort said in a near whisper it was a quiet command but hermione shut her mouth she had never heard a human voice hiss quite like that your father knows the gift i have promised his nation if he aids me in my mission voldemort said with quiet calm as he turned to egon once more he need not know anything more he need know why giant is brought to our home by your people egon stated squarely voldemort clenched his jaw and looked passed egon to malfoy unfortunately wemic your father and i both know that it is hard to get proper work from younglings he said before turning his eyes back to egon however you can tell basilius that the giant will be taken care of and that the girl the girl is merely a guest egon looked from voldemort to hermione with an unreadable expression before nodding once and turning to leave as soon as he had exited voldemort put one thin pasty long fingered hand to his forehead draco summon your father and your uncle he sighed yes my lord malfoy said promptly before making a hasty exit hermione stomach began to turn with increased anxiety she was now alone with voldemort and when malfoy returned he would be accompanied by two death eaters hermione looked down as she glimpsed something moving to see nagini now coiled at her feet and looking up at her with a flicking tongue she must have a liking for you voldemort jeered hermione looked up to see him smiling slightly after all you two have a bit in common you both have a shall i say a taste for weasley men nagini hissed showing her teeth and hermione was almost certain that she were about to strike when she heard another hissing coming from voldemort parseltongue after a strange series of hisses nagini closed her mouth and turned to slither to voldemort feet hermione didntlike the way voldemort had said weasley it gave her a fear of what he might be planning for ron or his family but at the same time it somehow made some of her fear fade i know you ve brought me here as bait for harry hermione said in disgust releasing the breath she had been holding voldemort lifted his gaze from nagini and hermione saw an unsettling malice in his eyes which she noted were solid black harry had said they were red it wontwork again hermione began she silently cursed her voice inability to keep from shaking yet she continued it worked with that vision of sirius but harry has learned his lesson he wontcome for me hermione felt a chill as voldemort began laughing deep in his throat your intention is touching miss granger but you should know that it is useless for the weak minded to lie to lord voldemort you and i both know harry will come why do you call him harry as if you know him hermione asked before she could stop herself he stared at her deeply after this comment but she broke eye contact with him as she heard footsteps ascending the staircase turning toward the door she saw draco and his father followed by rastaban lestrange and another man that looked vaguely familiar they were all wearing plain black robes ah voldemort said as they entered forming a small circle around her hermione suddenly felt as if she were standing before the wizengamot lucius you see before you proof that kidnapping a young girl is not as difficult as one might think yes my lord lucius said quietly he was standing to the left of voldemort his head ducked slightly hermione noted this moment as the first time she d ever seen lucius without his nose in the air rastaban voldemort continued would you see that our rather large and unwelcome guest is destroyed yes my lord rastaban answered before quickly sweeping from the room hermione felt a sick feeling in her stomach at the thought of grawp lost and scared on the island vincent i do not recall sending for you voldemort said calmly yet with a hint of annoyance vincent hermione thought the man that looked vaguely familiarwas crabbe father there was a definite resemblance no my lord vincent whispered before continuing in a strained voice draco brought word that my son was was killed by the giant but i saw no body on the grounds is it possible that he might have surv no he is dead voldemort said waving his hand impatiently the dementors will have disposed of him by now now please i have business to attend to vincent swallowed hard with a clenched jaw before bowing slightly yes my lord he replied quietly before exiting the room hermione looked after the death eater as an unexpected swell of pity formed in her chest miss granger why dontyou have a seat voldemort asked waving his hand to his side where he conjured a small black chair i prefer to stand hermione replied coldly voldemort lifted one corner of his upper lip in an unpleasant smile i think you prefer to sit he said calmly as soon as the words left voldemort lips lucius rushed to hermione side grabbed her roughly by the arms and thrust her into the seat draco was now regarding her with a smirk voldemort simply nodded before motioning for draco who then approached voldemort and knelt before him draco extended his left arm and raised his sleeve to reveal a pale forearm clasping his thin fingers around malfoy wrist voldemort removed his wand and placed it upon draco arm lucius knelt beside his son while rolling his own sleeve up hermione leaned forward slightly to see lucius dark mark it was positively sickening there was a discolored scar in the infamous design of a skull with a snake for a tongue raised along his skin hermione hadntneeded confirmation that harry vision was real but she had it regardless voldemort had used a cutting charm on lucius arm when lucius had failed to take her a second time lucius took his son left hand in his while voldemort continued to hold draco wrist you see miss granger voldemort began looking up from draco arm before one can join my family they must perform an assigned task for me draco has brought you to me showing a degree of loyalty and competence greater than that of his father voldemort turned his gaze to lucius who remained silent lucius do you agree to be your son witness during this ceremony i do my lord lucius whispered voldemort nodded and focused his eyes upon draco arm as he began chanting it was that awful parseltongue again hermione knew she was watching an initiation of sorts draco would arise a death eater after this creepy chant until death parts servant from master or master from servant draco would be his even if draco converted later in life he would still be bound by voldemort mark hermione gasped aloud as a chilling wind circled the room and extinguished the fire sending the room into pronounced darkness but just as quickly as the wind had come it was gone and voldemort chanting stopped there was a faint red tinted glow on draco arm in the form of the dark mark and he and his father were standing from the floor lucius you may go voldemort began calmly as if he hadntjust added a member to his family of evildoers draco if you would wait outside i need a moment with miss granger father and son both nodded before exiting the room draco was wearing a self satisfied smile as he examined his new marking and then once again hermione was alone with the darkest wizard of all time how long are you going to wait until you kill me hermione asked quietly remaining seated as voldemort reignited the fire voldemort began pacing and turned to her with a smirk well let see that depends doesntit he asked lightly does it hermione asked oh yes voldemort stated i think a week worth of worrying about his dear friend is due young harry then he will surely be willing to bargain for your life dontyou think he asked raising one eyebrow and ceasing his pacing when hermione didntrespond he shrugged and resumed his circling of the study no matter if he is not willing to listen to reason i ll simply have to send for him what do you mean send for him hermione asked do you mean try and kidnap harry hermione added incredulously voldemort squinted his eyes at her as his mocking smirk began to fade he survived the killing curse as a baby and you think your imbecilic androids can kidnap him she spat forcing a mocking snicker despite the nervous churnings of her stomach there was really no logical explanation for hermione taunting other than she was angry and most likely doomed so why not it seems i underestimated hermione granger the loyal friend of harry potter voldemort began his voice cool you are either very brave or very unwise yet i still have a proposal to offer you i sure you have heard that life is full of choices and that it is up to you to make the right ones well miss granger you should know that there is no good or evil there is only power and those too weak to seek it my proposition to you is that you help bring potter to me if you do this i will spare your life and you may even become the first death eater with complete muggle parentage i hear that you have a thirst for knowledge i can quench that thirst more than anyone you ve ever known miss granger the decision is yours but i must warn you that my propositions are few i dontlike it when they are refused and if you refuse me your death will not be quick or painless hermione continued to stare into voldemort black eyes and she felt the churnings in her stomach slow and her knees cease their bobbing i would rather die a slow and painful death than help you get one step closer to the boy that will rid you from this world forever she breathed as a defiant tear rolled down her cheek voldemort slowly lowered his head to peer at her down his white nose and so you shall he whispered menacingly before shouting draco take her to her cell hermione heard the creaking of the door and she quickly stood from her chair before draco had the opportunity to manhandle her she felt one of his hands clamp around her arm and she then felt her wrists being pulled together by some sort of force malfoy was using an invisible rope charm on her wrists she could feel the rope but she could not see it voldemort did not offer her a second glance before stalking past his marbled desk and to a door which hermione had not seen until now it was veiled behind one of the green tapestries hanging on the walls once voldemort was out of sight draco wasted no time in directing her to the marble stairs outside voldemort study walking slowly down the staircase hermione began to wonder what voldemort meant by cell where was draco leading her was it inside the castle would it be a solitary cell would she be in a room with other prisoners as they reached the base of the stairs and continued down the corridor they soon neared the four arched doorways each with a staircase draco grabbed hermione arm and led her to the second staircase on her left these stairs spiraled downward into an even dimmer lit area hermione descended without showing the hesitation that was burning in her stomach although small candles dimly lit the stairwell hermione could tell that the deeper they went the more the atmosphere began to feel like a cave the stone walls were becoming dirtier with vines and roots growing between the cracks the air was becoming damp and cool and there was a smell of moisture laden rocks and earth when they finally reached the bottom of the stairs hermione was surprised to find herself standing not in a cave like basement but in a cave it reminded hermione of a darker and damper version of grawp home in the forbidden forest except this was not just one room she was standing in a large room which had a large opening at the opposite end than the spiraled stairs and through that opening hermione could see two tunnels forking away from one another how far underneath the castle are we hermione asked her voice echoing in the darkness as draco continued to lead her toward the large cave opening we arentunderneath the castle he said simply we re underneath the mountains there are endless tunnels and caves down here most of the tunnels lead to wemic grottos so i wouldnttry to run if i were you those beasts donttake kindly to unwelcome guests hermione cut her eyes in malfoy direction his voice had sounded anxious and his eyes darting from wall to wall showed the same emotion as he halted hermione raised her bound hands and ran two fingers along the left side of the cave opening the wall had a thin layer of damp dirt along the inside they then took the left fork of the two tunnels and malfoy pace quickened are you scared of them hermione prompted rubbing her fingers together and letting the mud dry and fall to the ground what malfoy asked incredulously please they might be big but they ve no brains they all follow their chief as if he were a god you get him and you ve got them all hermione scoffed sounds a bit like your new family doesntit she asked testily malfoy suddenly stopped and hermione was sure he was going to strike her or hex her but instead he turned to face the cave wall where hermione then noticed a solid metal door malfoy used a key to unlock it before thrusting it open and shoving her inside a small square room with eight foot long walls it seemed even colder and damper than the outside tunnel it was completely empty other than a single candle on a stand in one corner you know you dontact very scared malfoy spat as he came inside the cell propping the door open with some sort of charm but you should be he added taking slow steps toward her hermione began backing away from him until she collided with the wall voldemort told me that dontspeak the dark lord name malfoy shouted bringing his face a few inches from her own he was staring into her eyes and she stared right back fine she said fiercely your chief informed me that he has plans to kidnap harry if he doesntcome for me are you part of that mission as well she asked malfoy leaned away from her his eyes squinting maliciously the dark lord does not plan to kidnap him he plans to send for him through a vision and when potter sees your near lifeless form he will be told specifically to come for you alone and unarmed or watch you die at the hand of the dark lord he spat and if harry comes voldemort will simply let me go free and take harry instead hermione asked disbelievingly he doesntplan to let me leave here alive i ve seen too much logical assessment granger you always know the right answer dontyou malfoy said mockingly but he also has plans for you that he hasntexpressed to you yet which are hermione asked furtively straining against malfoy rope charm to no avail if you dontagree to tell us everything you know of potter then we will have to make you tell us wontwe malfoy asked with a wicked smile i not like pettigrew hermione shouted you can torture me until i driven mad like the longbottoms but i wonttell you anything you dontknow what you might do after a cruciatus curse let alone a weeks worth he scoffed oh and you do hermione asked sarcastically continuing to strain against the rope charm yeah i do he shouted back his face now an inch from hers has your master given you a taste of the curse then hermione taunted the dark lord has never harmed me malfoy responded through gritted teeth so stop acting like you ve had to endure being crucio d before hermione shouted sick of this macho fa ade i have malfoy yelled as his face grew increasingly red hermione rolled her eyes oh and who my father hermione mouth was left hanging partway open her ready retort unwilling to be given she stared into malfoy angry grey eyes for a mere second before he turned away from her for the first time since hermione had arrived on this forsaken island she felt as if she were not the only prisoner just then the door creaked open and two figures entered wearing hooded black cloaks the hands visible from the sleeves of these figures were so pale hermione thought them dementors until they lowered their hoods she gasped and her bound hands flew to her mouth professor snape hermione breathed as she looked into his pale face his eyes were dark as he looked her over with disgust the other figure also looking her over was bellatrix lestrange yet she didntlook disgusted she looked elated it true then bellatrix whispered with shining eyes draco you ve done it draco shot hermione an awkward sort of glance before forcing a smile for his aunt he then approached her and raised his sleeve bellatrix mouth fell open slightly and she gently touched the marking lucius told us your task had gone well but we were skeptical snape drawled his eyes boring into hermione s i see she didntcome willingly bellatrix said with a giggle as her eyes raked over hermione unkempt appearance they never do bellatrix snape sneered dumbledore trusts you hermione shouted angrily looking at snape with wide eyes snape just continued to look at her with disgust of course he does you stupid girl bellatrix hissed that old fool thinks anyone can change but no one can not truly can they severus why would i stray from the dark lord path snape asked with a sinister smile it is the path of power is it not yes bellatrix rasped excitedly nearing hermione with one black eyebrow raised are you the headmistress of this place hermione asked the dark lord has no need for such things bellatrix replied this school is his and his alone but it was you that they quoted in the daily prophet wasntit hermione prompted saying that you were the headmistress and that this school was in no way affiliated with voldemort and that hermione gasped and her cheek immediately seared with pain with one long crimson fingernail bellatrix had slashed down hermione face bellatrix made a tittering noise as she looked at her fingernail which now had a few drops of hermione blood on it your lips are not worthy to speak his name bellatrix exclaimed looking at hermione with wide eyes hermione looked to snape who was standing near the door with an indecipherable expression while bellatrix approached draco with her finger extended her long black hair swinging behind her look draco she whispered looking at her finger with wide eyes reveal hermione watched as her blood rose from bellatrix fingernail and turned black as oil before dropping to the ground and returning to its crimson shade dirty blood bellatrix breathed in revulsion before spitting at hermione feet look at me girl she said hermione lifted her gaze to the crazed woman before her you saw him didntyou the dark lord she asked excitedly he no longer looks like a serpent does he he is fully man once more his strength is back and your foul friend will soon be lying in a puddle of his own polluted blood hermione could feel a trickling of blood rolling down her cheek why does he no longer look like a serpent hermione asked quietly remembering harry description of voldemort red eyes bald head and slitted nostrils the dark lord rebirthing was just the beginning of his bodily resurrection bellatrix began excitedly how does it go severus the tongue of seven and heart of ten make the body whole again i believe that is correct snape responded in an almost bored voice so the hearts of ten innocent people were used to bring him strength hermione asked appalled looking at her potions master in disbelief innocent bellatrix asked as she released a shrill cackle only the infantine are innocent she added before rubbing her stomach absently which hermione then noticed was visibly swollen underneath her cloak you re you re hermione stuttered suddenly feeling more and more sick my husband was taken from me but not before he left me with child bellatrix said coldly bellatrix eyes then began to narrow as if she had just remembered something do you know what they ve done with my ring they took it from him lucius saw that mundungus fletcher take my husband ring and you know where it is dontyou hermione began sidling along the wall as this demented woman came closer and closer i dontknow what you re talking about hermione lied she knew exactly where the black family ring was it was at the bottom of harry chest at hogwarts but hermione wasntabout to reveal that to this madwoman you lying dirtied little mudblood bellatrix yelled before raising one skeletally thin hand as if to strike hermione closed her eyes and raised her bound hands to shield her face when nothing happened she reopened her eyes to see snape holding bellatrix back by her arms which were struggling madly no bellatrix snape shouted you know the dark lord would be angered if we injured her without his consent she is his now this statement seemed to calm bellatrix who stopped struggling and began to smile yes she said maliciously she is his she will get the pain she deserves soon enough right snape said releasing his hold on bellatrix and approaching hermione now we should go above and report to the dark lord he will want word that miss granger has been put away yes bellatrix breathed her heavily lidded eyes raking over hermione one last time before she turned to her nephew come draco draco went to the cell door and opened it slowly removing the charm that had thus been keeping it ajar yet snape was still staring at hermione well severus bellatrix prompted from the doorway snape looked over his shoulder at his two fellow death eaters before clasping hermione chin with his cold hand hermione flinched when he placed his thumb over the cut on her cheek i trust that you will remain quiet so as not to disturb the wemics correct snape asked raising one eyebrow hermione was about to nod when she saw his mouth moving silently suddenly hermione felt the burning of the cut on her cheek ease until she could feel no pain at all snape then released his hold on her face lowered his eyebrow and turned on his heel for the door draco and bellatrix exited but before snape followed he looked over his shoulder at hermione and waved a hand in her direction she felt the invisible rope around her wrists depart before snape robes disappeared behind the slamming metal door the sound of the key locking the door seemed to echo in the small dark room hermione rested her weight against the wall as she sunk down to the cold floor and brought a hand to her cheek there was some dried blood but there was no longer a cut snape voldemort thought him to be a death eater dumbledore thought him a converted man which was he if he were a death eater why had he healed her cheek and unbound her hands was it an act if he were converted why hadnthe told the order where this castle was located he had probably been inside numerous times throughout the year but the fidelius charm would have prevented him giving out any information about the school whereabouts or even anything that occurred inside the castle maybe she wasntlost forever as hermione sat in the deadly still and quiet cell she began to come to herself slightly she was achy she had a cut on her back from falling in the forest and numerous scrapes along her arms and legs she was dirty her clothes were muddy and torn her buttoned white shirt was no longer white and her woolen skirt was fraying at many spots why hadntshe changed out of her uniform after classes today hermione felt a nervous laugh bubbling in her stomach but she stifled it with her hand oh i cantlose my mind now hermione whispered into the dark the lone candle offered just enough light to cast eerie shadows about the room it was just a bit humorous that she was sitting in a cavernous cell under a mountain on the island of fohr voldemort headquarters and she was regretting that she didnthave a change of clothes she had heard tale of many captives of azkaban losing their minds during captivity would that happen to her had it started already how much longer did she have to live what type of torture would they use the cruciatus curse or were there worse means of torture used by the death eaters it didntmatter she would never reveal anything to them like she had said she would die before she helped voldemort capture harry but would she have to die she now had a small flicker of hope that had been rekindled by the possibility that snape were truly on her side but even if he werent if she could get free long enough to run to a town she could use a telephone to call home or possibly find a wizarding family that would allow her to floo to the burrow or something she was clever enough to figure something out although maybe she wasntall that clever after all she had fallen for malfoy trap how long had he been planning this she had already realized that the commotion she had seen at the doors of the great hall was a diversion intended to keep hagrid from his hut it had worked she had also realized just when malfoy had gotten a hair from ron head for the polyjuice potion it was surely that strange sunday in february when malfoy crabbe and goyle had approached her and ron on the grounds they had been looking for a fight so that they could obtain the most important ingredient of the potion it had worked everything had gone according to malfoy plan with the exception of crabbe death and the extra sixteen foot passenger on the portkey why had she been so stupid she should have insisted that they tell dumbledore before going to hagrid hut why would they do anything else if harry had screamed and flown to the forest dumbledore should have been the first person alerted but she had followed her captor hand in hand into the forest where she had then lost her wand and mirror she should have been able to hold onto her wand and mirror and she should have been able to make better use of those things while she had them but now she had nothing save the faint flicker of hope that snape was truly a spy for dumbledore then she wasntcompletely alone on this island but if snape were a spy for voldemort she was as good as dead the order would remain un alerted ron and harry would have no idea where she was no one would turn a bit more south harry ron shouted over the increasing winds or was harry just increasing his speed according to ron map they had about fifty miles until they reached the island meaning they had about fifteen minutes remaining of their journey it was surreal for ron to think that a few hours ago he had been worrying about quidditch and now hermione life was on the line ron kept repeating the facts to himself voldemort wanted hermione in order to bring harry to him so draco had been sent to kidnap her and he had succeeded but what now would they try to force information about harry from her would they let her live if she didntreveal anything to them ron checked inside his jacket pocket for hermione wand and mirror as he clasped the mirror in his hand ron felt a feeling of disgust at himself he should have shouted into the mirror when he d had the chance he had seen malfoy and hermione through the glass he had seen him push her to the ground yet he had said nothing but if he had said something he might not have seen grawp cave but the only thing gained from grawp cave were hermione things when all they really needed was the vision of the wemic from harry she had yelled for him and he had not responded she must be terrified beyond all reasoning ron thought releasing his hold on the mirror i am suddenly ron felt a change in harry speed he was slowing looking down ron saw more than an endless sea he saw land it was a small island from their altitude ron could see its entire perimeter although the northeastern corner of the island was unusual it wasntflat and green like the rest of the island it was heavily wooded and immensely foggy it was a fog unlike any ron had ever seen it reached from the ground all the way up to the peaks of some barely visible jagged black mountains ron didnthave to say anything as harry continued to slow his speed and head straight for the northeastern corner their altitude was quickly dropping as they neared the outer edge of the dense forest ron was almost certain he saw a tree fall somewhere in the middle of the forest before harry quickly landed at the base of a large hill it seemed much darker on the ground than it had in the sky under the moon and stars judging from the moon position it was surely ten o clock ron quietly jumped down from harry and removed his wand he then tucked hermione robes into his jacket as harry began transforming it freezing here ron whispered looking into the trees before them it was an unnatural cold yeah harry agreed standing up from all fours his face looked pained you alright ron asked a nervous sensation moving through him are you getting a vision or something can you see her no no i ve just never flown that far before harry replied massaging his right shoulder and then his left but i fine whenwill the order arrive ron asked looking about them uneasily he already felt as if they were being watched soon so into the trees or over the hill harry frowned as he looked at their two choices he too had his wand ready i vote for the hill but we ll have to go by foot it too foggy for me to fly over harry replied ron nodded in agreement looking up at the hill harry ron began this hill is more like a bunch of well jagged rocks harry offered darkly well yeah ron replied he hadntbeen thinking of harry vision of ginny at all until now but that was crazy harry ginny at hogwarts ron said evenly she ll be safe there there was no response but ron didnthave time to wait for one so he started to approach the hill but before he could take one step harry held a hand out to stop him maybe we should wait for the order harry muttered scanning the sky wait ron asked incredulously are you mental we cantjust stand here it already been at least two hours since the bastard took her i know but listen if you would rather wait around to see if ginny decided to tag along with the order fine but i cantjust stand here that not what harry i know you love her harry whispered urgently grabbing ron arm i love hermione too but if we re going to find her we re going to have to work together the only reason i suggested waiting was because i dontknow what we re going to encounter on this island and i want to make sure we do what best for her if we ll have a better chance of getting her out of there when the order arrives then i think we should wait for the order last time i rushed into the unknown someone got killed i sorry ron muttered you re right but can we at least search the island for the castle instead of just standing around the castle could be bigger than hogwarts and we wontsee it harry said rubbing his finger along his scar what do you mean we wontsee it ron asked desperately feeling as if the pulse of his heart were a steady reminder of the seconds ticking by do you really think this slytherin school of magic would still be hidden if it werentunder the fidelius charm harry asked lowering his hand from his forehead the fidelius charm ron breathed a feeling of dread washing over him so how are we going to get in we ll have to get the location from the secret keeper harry replied his eyes then narrowed as he continued and there only one person voldemort would trust as his secret keeper himself ron rubbed his hand down his face in frustration right harry said with a note of finality i going to have to delve into his mind to find the secret of this place location but i still wont be able to see the place not yet harry began but there another way to see a place without getting the information from the secret keeper you ll have to look through the front doors that all ron asked surprised harry simply nodded before looking ron up and down can you turn your clothes black harry asked hastily ron glanced down at his attire blue jeans a bright orange shirt and a red jacket great for quidditch but not for sneaking around an island ron immediately began an incantation for darkening his clothes harry did the same harry then began tapping ron on the shoulder with his wand and murmuring something under his breath ron was about to ask harry what he was doing when he felt the sensation of ice cold water trickling down his back disillusionment charm harry said simply before he then performed the same incantation to himself ron watched as his friend disappeared alright harry began quietly before we start wandering around this place i should at least make sure i have the ability to see the castle so uh hang on a second ron heard harry take a deep breath before going completely silent please find it ron thought desperately ron was preparing himself for a long wait surely extracting information of this importance from voldemort mind was not an easy task come on harry whispered suddenly ron felt his arm being grabbed and he was then ushered to the side of the hill you go first i ll follow your sound wh you ve found it already ron asked with a mixture of awe and relief yeah had to be quick harry responded i dontthink voldemort would like it much if he knew his secret keeper wasntdoing his job properly so why in bloody hell didntyou do that when we first found out about this slytherin school ron asked in exasperation i did harry said simply it only because we re so close to him that i could enter his mind that easily so can you see it now ron asked feeling a bit more hopeful no but i d wager a handful of galleons it over this hill ron nodded even though harry couldntsee him before placing one hand on the wall of the hill it was difficult to tell any detail about the hill other than it was just as dark as the night sky but ron had expected to feel some sort of grass or moss covering the jagged rise he had instead grabbed hold of a very hard smooth surface harry had said he would follow ron sound so ron began awkwardly scaling the stone this wasnta nicely rounded hill at all ron soon discovered it was segment after segment of vertical slabs of rock after scaling each segment there would be a one foot width ledge followed by another wall to clamber up it was such a slow process ron had to find something to hold onto with each hand then find a small crevice for his foot before hoisting himself up a little ways and repeating the process ron soon broke into a sweat his hands and nose were freezing but his clothes were drenched the forest that they had decided not to venture inside seemed to rise alongside the hill ron was sure there was a soft mossy ground in the forest which rose over a nice rounded hill but ron much preferred the jagged rocks to the foggy trees he didnttrust those trees he and harry couldntrisk being captured by liontaurs for an easier route while climbing one particular segment of his preferred rock ron heard a grunt from harry and the sound of a chunk of rock falling down the walls to the ground he then heard a whispered i fine keep going but it was then that ron realized how far up they had gone it had taken that chunk of rock a while before it had ceased its tumbling its noisy tumbling ron hadntheard or seen anyone since they had landed but he felt as if their presence was known after what felt like forever ron saw something on the next ledge a tree no several trees ron quickened his pace up the wall until he reached a ledge that didntcontain a black wall in front of it instead this ledge was actually a vast field with a spattering of trees and a stream running across it they were on a plateau the fog was so dense overhead the night sky was no longer visible but ron could see the entire area of this strange plateau which had a perimeter surrounded by the strange jagged hills like the one he and harry had just climbed at one end of the plateau however there was a wall of mountains that extended up past the fog there harry whispered panting slightly ron was wheezing as well and he hadscrapes on the palms of his hands the castle ron asked you see those mountains yeah well the castle is in front of them or well it sort of built into them anyway i know i said we should wait for the order but we cantjust stand here now that i have it in sight let g what do you mean you ve lost him ron froze mid breath as an angry voice echoed along the plateau turning toward the sound ron saw two black robed hooded figures emerging from the forest that he and harry had bypassed they had come to a halt just outside the perimeter of the trees and one of them seemed to be yelling into the forest answer me how do you lose a sixteen foot tall giant ron was sure his open mouth had just opened wider it was quite possible or even probable that there were thousands of sixteen foot tall giants in the world but ron only knew of one it would be easier to find giant if dark lord dementors would leave island and take cold and white haze with them said a deep voice from someone or something who was now emerging from the trees wemic ron breathed as he stared at the massive creature ron had always seen centaurs as being mildly creepy but they were nothing as compared to this beast with a necklace of stone discs around his tattooed neck i thought you wemics were supposed to be good trackers the angry man shouted you should be able to find a giant blind folded we think he may have entered caves besides there is another presence you should worry about now the wemic said gravely ron then felt harry grab his arm and pull him behind a rather large tree trunk presence the man asked haughtily you stupid superstitious beast the wemic took one step forward which brought him to stand in front of the death eater he then reached one large hand down grasped the death eater by the collar and lifted him from the ground the other hooded figure ran a few steps backward and removed his wand my name is not wemic or beast it is aloysius guarder of the trees and you will do well to remember that rastaban aloysius growled before dropping rastaban who fell hard to the ground but quickly stood and removed his wand you as well vincent you do not want to meet fate like your son before ron could truly take in the phrase fate like your son crabbe let out a yell and shot a purple jet of light toward aloysius who at the same time removed one of the discs from his necklace and threw it to the ground a wall of rock similar to those ron and harry had just been climbing shot up from the ground where the disc had fallen deflecting the curse which crabbe quickly ducked i am true friend of earth and your wizard spells are no match for that aloysius shouted turning for the trees rocks tell me of a presence you have been warned he added before disappearing into the forest crabbe helped lestrange up from the ground and they both put their wands away the rocks tell him of a presence lestrange hissed brushing his robes off the beasts are mad we should tell the dark lord that we ve yet to find the giant crabbe said as he and lestrange began making their way toward the mountains where harry had said the castle was situated ron felt harry grab hold of his arm again and begin leading him after the two death eaters he wontbe happy lestrange muttered he has the girl crabbe began it possible he ll give us a break crabbe and lestrange exchanged a worried look before quickening their pace toward the castle ron and harry quickened their paces as well he has the girl ron repeated to himself she alright he wouldnthave worded it that way if hermione were ron tried to clear his head as they neared the mountains he needed to focus they were about to gain entrance these idiots were leading them right through the front doors and they didnteven realize it that wemic had sensed a presence ron was sure it was him and harry he wasntsure how or why their presence was sensed but ron wanted to make sure and keep a good distance between himself and the liontaurs wand in hand ron began going over some of the spells he d learned this term from whitman that curse crabbe had sent toward aloysius was fairly sloppy in ron opinion and his hope of saving hermione was growing a bit with each step he was beginning to realize that death eaters were simply men the only things they had that ron didntwas experience and ruthlessness suddenly ron self confidence boosting was interrupted by the sudden halt of harry who held ron back the death eaters stopped as well and ron saw lestrange reaching a hand out into thin air lestrange then closed his fist and pulled backward as ron stood completely still trying his hardest to keep his heavy breathing as quiet as possible a long hallway appeared before him a long stone green flame lit hallway in the middle of air then a large black door appeared followed by a colossal castle of black stone above the black doors was an engraving of a green snake and the words slytherin school of magic harry released ron arm as the two death eaters stepped inside the castle as soon as their feet had crossed over the threshold the doors began to close and ron and harry immediately slipped inside the heavy doors slammed shut behind them and ron and harry exchanged a look of relief they had made it undetected and wait ron and harry turned toward one another and harry horrified expression was surely mimicked on ron face ron pressed himself up against the wall to the right of the doors harry did the same on the wall opposite him luckily there were two stone columns shielding them from view neither of them had counted on the possibility of their disillusionment charm not working once inside the castle but they should have of course voldemort would have numerous charms and enchantments on his lair crabbe and lestrange somehow still oblivious to ron and harry presence continued down the long hallway passed two doors on the left and two on the right toward a large marbled staircase at the opposite end ron had a good guess at who resided at the top of those stairs so egon is the name of the wemic that the dark lord is growing weary of asked a horribly familiar voice ron peeked around his column to see lucius malfoy and a shorter balding man descending the stairs at the opposite end of the hall the shorter man was peter pettigrew ron saw something shining at the hem of pettigrew sleeve something silver it was the hand harry had told he and hermione about the sick feeling ron had at the sight of pettigrew was overshadowed by the burning anger in his stomach at malfoy the man who had attempted to take hermione the man who had attacked her home was standing within hexing distance but ron had to stay hidden now was not the time for revenge yeah egon pettigrew murmured tiredly he asksquestion after question i think he smarter than the others lucius and pettigrew steps halted when they met the other two men in the corridor lucius drawling voice echoed the dark lord does not wish to see anyone for the rest of the night so what are we supposed to lestrange began but lucius interrupted sleep sleep rastaban you and vincent will watch her cell after my watch lucius said ron clenched his fists at the term cell well when is your watch crabbe asked now lucius replied i dontknow who on watch with me but we will alert both of you when it is time to trade posts crabbe grunted in response before he and lestrange turned and thefour death eaters began making their way back down the corridor toward ron and harry please dontgo outside ron thought his wand ready at his side please go through one of the doorways ron heart was beating so hard he was afraid one of the death eaters might hear it but their footsteps which had been growing steadily louder suddenly stopped ron leaned forward ever so slightly despite harry shaking head to see pettigrew rastaban and crabbe disappearing up one flight of stairs lucius however had gone through one of the doorways on the opposite wall as soon as all footsteps had faded ron crossed the hall to harry did you see which way lucius went ron whispered urgently no harry murmured i was too busy trying to cast a disillusionment charm it useless there some sort of barrier against them in this castle i figured ron muttered well i know lucius went through one of the doorways on the right wall one of us can go up the other down i agree harry began listen whoever finds her first should get her out of the castle as soon as possible right we can meet at that hill we scaled alright ron offered looking at the two doorways i ll take downstairs harry gave ron a small pat on the back good luck mate you too ron replied and then as an afterthought he added hey if you run into him just just be careful harry nodded his jaw clenched before they each approached their respective paths gave each other a parting nod and entered the stairwells as soon as ron stepped onto the stairs he felt sure that this was the way to hermione he could smell damp earth and the deeper he went the cooler and darker it became cold and scared that exactly how voldemort would want his prisoners it took ron a while to reach the bottom of the stairway he made sure not to make a sound once he had reached the downstairs floor he felt a feeling of foreboding in front of him stood a large cave entrance with a forked tunnel just beyond the opening but which way to get to hermione ron approached the opening and stopped to listen he couldnthear anything but he saw something there was a smudge mark along the inside curve of the opening on the left hand side it looked as if someone had run their fingers along the wall someone with small fingers ron heart rate began to quicken as he began inching his way down the left tunnel of the fork this was the right way he knew it the temptation to break into a run was almost overpowering but ron settled with the longest strides he could manage there were torches on the walls but they were few there was about one lit torch every twenty yards creating shadows that moved with the flicking flames ron was about to round a corner when he noticed a small crevice in the rock it appeared natural but he crossed the floor to examine it nonetheless it was fairly narrow just big enough for ron to squeeze into but it only seemed to be about two feet deep stepping out of the crevice ron turned to resume his walking when he noticed a large black shadow that he hadntseen upon entering the crevice it was a tall figure in black robes that had just rounded the corner and their pale face was staring with wide eyes directly at ron professor snape ron opened his mouth to utter the one word reverberating in his skull traitor but before he could speak severus lucius malfoy called from just around the corner have you seen something ron couldntsee lucius but he could hear his steady footsteps in seconds two death eaters would be staring wide eyed at him ron raised his wand and pointed it at snape who suddenly turned his back on ron no snape said suddenly in a very cool and collected voice ron retreated back into his two foot crevice just as lucius rounded the corner now ron could see both men but neither could see him are you alright lucius asked sounding a bit suspicious and looking down the tunnel of which ron had just come i perfectly alright snape said coolly ron saw one of snape hands move to rest behind his back he was holding tightly to his wand though something has just occurred to me miss granger cell can not simply be opened by a mere alohomora can it of course not severus lucius said turning to snape with furrowed brows only with a key can anyone open that lock lucius added motioning around the corner from which both men had just come good then snape replied simply before flicking his wrist slightly there was then a distant sound down the corridor from where ron had just come it sounded like the falling of pebbles down a wall lucius raised his wand and pointed down the tunnel a curious look on his face it probably one of those damned felines yes but we shouldntassume snape drawled taking a few steps down the tunnel toward ron crevice shall we lucius sighed agitatedly before following behind snape hasty footsteps ron leaned as far back into the crevice as possible as the two men walked straight passed him snape did not even cut his eyes in ron direction as ron let out a long silent breath he made a promise to himself to never complain about his potions essays again if he were to get out of this alive as soon as ron could no longer hear their footsteps he stepped out of his crevice and hurried around the corner and there it was there was one lone metal door against the left wall of the tunnel there was a keyhole but no handle or window and just down the tunnel from the door was another fork ron placed one hand on the cold metal of the door he then pressed his ear against it but heard nothing it didntmatter he knew hermione was just beyond this door but he had no key ron ran one anxious hand through his hair as he glanced nervously one way and then the other maybe lucius was wrong alohomora ron whispered urgently nothing would he have to use a powerful spell to destroy the door that was too dangerous hermione could be injured but he had no key wait ron heart stopped in his chest as he began scanning the cave floor for a small rock of some sort there ron whispered crossing the tunnel and picking up a rock that fit nicely in his palm he then crossed back to the door held the rock up to the keyhole and put his wand to the rock pacefarius he muttered the rock immediately turned into a golden key blimey i love transfiguration ron breathed holding the key up for inspection ron turned his head quickly to one side footsteps but not from the direction of lucius and snape he didnthave time to stick around and find out who was approaching with steady and somewhat odd footsteps ron thrust the key into the door turned it and heard the glorious sound of an unlatching lock without further delay ron removed the key pushed the door open and stepped inside without so much as a glance about the room he returned the key to its rock form and lodged it between the door and its frame he should still be able to open it yet it would appear closed from the outside hopefully hermione ron croaked there she was she was sitting in one corner of the small cell draped in shadows her knees pulled into her chest her clothes were tattered her hair beyond bushy scrapes covered her legs arms and face and her expression she was staring up at him with her mouth partway open and a few silent tears welling in her brown eyes hermione ron repeated again as he took long strides toward her get away she said shakily through gritted teeth as she hoisted herself up off the ground ron stopped in his tracks donteven think about touching me you cruel hateful her angry voice trailed off as she roughly wiped the few fallen tears from her cheeks hermione it me ron said softly using all the willpower he had in him to keep from embracing her harry and i traveled four hundred miles over the ocean to stop it she screamed ron held a hand up to silence her as he looked worriedly at the door but she continued you finished your task haventyou i here arenti why cantyou just leave me alone why cantyou ron took the remaining two steps between them and placed his fingers gently over her lips she placed both hands on his chest and began to push on him but she stopped he stared deeply into her eyes and he felt her quick warm breath on his fingertips becoming quicker as she gazed at him with furrowed brows reaching into his jacket ron removed her wand and placed it in one of her delicate hands her eyes widened as she looked at this unexpected token ron then reached into his jacket again and removed her robes he gently draped them around her shoulders which then began shaking with sobs as she looked up at him and released a hugh sigh hermione flung both arms around ron neck and began softly sobbing into his jacket collar he wrapped his arms around her without hesitation as silent tears began rolling down his own cheeks thank bloody merlin ron said as he breathed in her wonderful scent her wonderfully alive scent she was still sobbing and her robes fell from her shoulders to the floor i ve been thinking of all the things i wanted to tell you if i ever saw you again but now that you re here i cantremember any of them shewhispered as she clung to him how about i love you ron asked using one hand to quickly wipe his eyes before leaning down to take her lips with his this kiss was soft and lingering time was short at the moment too short for adequate words and embraces but it was a kiss that said everything for them i love you she whispered as their kiss ended ron rested his forehead upon hers for a moment before she nestled her head into his chest and wrapped her arms about his waist and it was then that ron noticed the back of hermione shirt oh hell what did they do to you he asked leaning back from their embrace to judge her eyes ron she began wiping her confused eyes with her hands i was kidnapped no hermione i mean the back of your shirt is completely covered in blood ron whispered urgently trying to turn her around by her shoulders she was resisting let me see it hermione you re hurt we donthave time for that though hermione said swiftly picking her robes up off the floor someone could come at any moment ron sighed heavily as he looked from the door to the ceiling unwillingly admitting to himself that she was quite right how did you get here she asked as she hastily pulled on her robes and buttoned them with a little help from the mirrors a little help from neville potion and a lot of help from a pegasus ron replied before leaning down to kiss hermione lips once more so harry he s hermione began worriedly ron glanced up at the solid stone ceiling of the cell he s about he muttered before looking back down at hermione increasingly furrowing brows look right now we just need to worry about getting you out of this place ron no hermione exclaimed i went and got myself kidnapped so it my fault harry here we cantjust leave him hermione harry and i already have a meeting place we ve worked it all out i mean as far as we know great scarred one is already on grounds ron swung around instinctively aiming his wand at the intruder with the intent of disarming however the intruder who had to duck under the doorframe in order to enter had no wand as ron looked from the massive beast paws to his long mane of hair the absence of a wand brought him little solace if the beast were to enter the cell completely he would fill the room look wemic ron began keeping his wand arm steady if you come any closer i will be forced to his name is egon hermione interrupted in a small voice ron breath caught in his throat and he looked down at her with one raised eyebrow you know him he asked incredulously well we ve met hermione replied keeping her head tilted back and her eyes on the wemic there was a strange silent moment in which the three cellmates took turns looking from one to the other but then egon spoke i see small boy wandering from castle i follow him and discover him to be great scarred one of legend he discovers dark secret of dark lord is he talking about harry ron asked hermione with wide eyes his wand still pointed at egon chest hermione simply clung to ron arm and looked at him with worried eyes i must explain from beginning egon said before backing out of the cell but not here will you follow me he asked as ron and hermione stepped out of the small cell cautiously looking from left to right how do we know we can trust you not to lead us straight to voldemort ron asked quietly quickly grasping hermione hand you don t egon replied before turning around to face the wall opposite the now closed cell door but to your left is wemic grotto and to right are black robed men my path is safest ron looked down the tunnel from left to right what did this creature mean by his way there was no other way out egon hermione began and by the way she bit her lip ron knew she was thinking the same as him will you follow egon asked ron looked to hermione and they exchanged anxious glances the wemic then approached the wall directly opposite the cell and stopped ron was contemplating whether he would rather face death eaters or wemics death eaters were not as physically strong but they had enough sense not to stare at cave walls at times such as these deciding that it was time to bid farewell to egon ron approached the beast side and gently cleared his throat um egon i appreciate the offer but in truth we donthave time for for truth is always in plain sight egon replied simply without so much as a glance down at ron who was now beginning to lose his patience entirely egon then removed one solitary glass bead from his necklace the beads on his necklace were transparent with colored mist inside this particular bead contained purple mist without warning egon threw the bead to the ground before the wall where it shattered releasing the purple mist to risefrom the ground and cling to the solid cave wall an opening to another tunnel immediately appeared well ron began squeezing tightly to hermione hand that definitely in plain sight let go hermione said without waiting for egon she pushed passed the wemic dragging ron behind her and entered the new tunnel which was identical to those on the other side minus the torches egon followed behind them and as soon as his lengthy body was through the cave door the opening disappeared this tunnel was identical to those on the other side minus the torches lumos ron and hermione said together the white light from their wands illuminated the path winding in front of them for a solid ten yards with their hands clasped and their lit wands held high ron and hermione let the wemic move around them and begin to lead the way down the tunnel as ron squeezed tightly to hermione hand he felt a surge of empowerment he loved her so much his world was walking beside him bravely after a night of pure terror and ron knew that he would stop at nothing to get them off of this island alive author note hey everyone i hope everyone

moisture onto the stone floor shuffling footsteps and three different rhythmic breathing patterns soft quick breaths shallow breaths and deep purring breaths there was also a distinct smell hanging heavily amid the semi darkness it was the smell of dirt and stone but for ron it was the smell of renewed hope moments ago ron insides had been squirming with the thought of not being able to find her or of finding her without that beautiful pink color of life on her cheeks but here he was hand in hand with her ron glanced down at the bushy haired brunette at his side not only were her cheeks flushed but her hands were warm she was walking steadily her wand lit and held out in front of her as was his she was very much alive hermione lifted her head to him with anxious brown eyes she offered him a small smile before facing forward once more and taking a deep breath egon she prompted ron footsteps faltered for a moment at the sound of hermione voice in the eerie black cave they had been tracking this wemic for a good ten minutes in utter silence and ron had forgotten that this creature had yet to tell them his story of the great scarred one nor had he told them where this cave would lead them exactly hermione seemed to trust this beast but ron wasntso sure the wemic he and harry had seen earlier had been helping rastaban and crabbe death eaters what was the wemic name aloysius he had even warned the two death eaters of a presence to be wary of why would this wemic be any different egon hermione continued when there was only silence from the massive beast before them where does this lead what did you mean by the great scarred one is it harry does this lead to harry i do not know egon replied deeply and with great calm he didntturn around or even slow his pace ron mouth quickly went dry you dont know he asked incredulously what do you mean you dontknow do you not know if this leads to harry or do you not know where this leads i should start from beginning of story egon replied yeah alright ron said and while you re at it why dontyou start the story with why the hell we should trust you ron hermione hissed squeezing his hand tightly the wemic stopped and was momentarily quiet before replying calmly i have told you to left is wemic grotto and to right are black robed men my path is safest ron just let him tell his story hermione said pleadingly ron released a reluctant sigh before nodding at the wemic whose massive torso was turned around just enough to peer down at ron with his bluish yellow eyes i found great scarred one one who goes by name harry on grounds outside egon began resuming his sauntering yet somehow quick pace i assumed he would not have trust for wemic but he told me he had story to tell wemic called egon i tell him i am egon and he tells me dark secret harry told you a secret ron asked his suspicion of this creature growing slightly egon tail swished sweeping the floor of the cave but he ignored ron question as they all continued along the tunnel great scarred one ventures high into castle in search of female youngling and instead overhears dark lord dark secret dark lord did not tempt my father with immortality immortality hermione exclaimed i hadntconsidered that but then why else would your father consent to the wemics helping voldemort ron wasntexactly sure what this exclamation meant but he decided to remain silent in hopes that egon story would begin making sense of some sort my father never consented he was never given chance voldemort killed my father after capturing his voice in enchanted orb egon continued i sorry did you say he captured your father voice ron asked his hopes of this story or cave leading them anywhere dwindling spirit orbs hermione said softly i ve heard of enchanted orbs that capture certain aspects of a person their scent their memories their voice but they can only be enchanted by capturing the dying breath of the one you wish to imitate so wait ron interrupted egon harry told you that voldemort killed your father in order to steal his voice why would voldemort want your father voice dontyou see hermione continued with that airy voice that meant she had somehow figured out everything voldemort or anyone for that matter would simply have to place their hand upon the spirit orb in order to speak with the voice of basilius with the voice of the wemic chieftain voldemort has the entire clan at his fingertips hermione finished with a fascinated look that soon turned to confusion but how could you not have known you wouldnthave seen your father since his death dark lord tells me and my kind that chief basilius was to live in castle egon stated then he makes me messenger to fool me i was only allowed to speak with my father through closed door dark lord says it is because chieftain is ill and must stay away he has me deliver false messages to and from my father voice since my cub years i have been taught to always follow path of chieftain so i did i was foolish you were just trying to be loyal to your father hermione said softly i had to tell story to you first female youngling egon said still walking down the tunnel the great scarred one did great service to me and brethren by telling me of dark secret but now i must tell my nation that i am their new chieftain and we will no longer follow dark lord they must follow me but what about harry ron blurted out he didntwant to seem insensitive to this beast family problems but ron really needed to know where harry was i told great scarred one that because he showed me kindness i would help him save his friend egon began he wanted to come with me but i told him it would be best if he waited on grounds he consented so is that where you re taking us hermione asked this tunnel leads to grounds but i do not know where great scarred one will be waiting egon replied is that an opening up ahead ron asked squinting his eyes enough to barely make out the outline of a breach in the seemingly never ending stone walls yes egon replied nox ron whispered hermione you too he added as their steps quickened hermione looked up at him and nodded nox she whispered submerging them into semi darkness a chilling breeze had begun streaming through the tunnel along with a now visible pool of dim moonlight still hand in hand with hermione ron picked up his pace as egon lowered his body and began quickly prowling toward the exit once they reached the opening however ron couldntsee a thing due to the massive beast filling up the entire gap egon can you ron began but a low growl rumbled deeply sending a chill through him the growl seemed to have filled the entire space egon then took several quick steps back forcing ron and hermione to run backward a few yards what are you growling for ron asked as hermione gripped both hands around his arm there was no reply but ron was sure he saw a pair of yellow greenish eyes staring into the cave from the opening moritz get back to your post egon commanded powerfully there was another growl and ron realized that it was not coming from egon but the body that belonged to the eerie pair of eyes still piercing the darkness of the cave ron instinctively positioned himself in front of hermione helping prisoner why egon you ve never disobeyed basilius orders moritz deep voice growled it is chief basilius to you egon growled back before continuing a bit sadly or it was but he is dead i am chieftain now we are no longer helping dark lord we are helping younglings there was a pause of silence in which ron thought perhaps moritz simply wasntgoing to respond but then there was a low rippling growl as moritz entered the cave fully egon had to take a few more steps back to allow his massive form entrance at the sight of moritz ron reached behind him to grab hermione hand the cave was so dark even with the bit of moonlight shining in ron could only see moritz eyes and his teeth which seemed to be shining of course he and hermione were now a good twenty feet away from the exit because of the amount of space needed to accommodate the two beasts you would choose a human youngling over your nation immortality moritz asked with his cold and mocking voice which made ron trust egon with his deep soothing voice a bit more voldemort was lying to your nation hermione shouted suddenly causing ron to jump ron turned his back on the two wemics to face hermione he couldntsee her very well and was tempted to relight his wand but he preferred feeling less exposed to this new wemic guest hermione please ron pleaded under his breath but he was ignored voldemort canteven make himself immortal though he tried hermione continued he is manipulating you using you silence youngling moritz growled ron turned to face him with his wand ready pressing himself against hermione who was shaking a bit ron was sure it was more from anger and frustration than fear egon do you hear words of youngling she says wemics can be used and manipulated by humans she is like most of her kind who see themselves as superior to all creatures no doubt she lies in order to get immortality for herself you are wrong moritz egon stated calmly and it is because your own heart is black that you can not see the pureness of hers what profound words you speak cousin moritz uttered low in his throat ron supposed this was meant to be a whisper but it seemed to rumble throughout the cave but my heart is not black it is red with lifeblood and i want lifeblood to course through me and our brethren forever and that is why i let nothing stand in my way what do you mean by this egon asked sternly his tail now still and arched slightly i mean moritz began i claim bishvajit at this ron saw moritz throw a small object to the ground which made a sound like a small pebble bouncing along the stone floor a low and powerful growl was egon response to this strange statement from moritz ron turned slightly keeping one eye on the two wemics and whispered over his shoulder what does bishy whats it mean how should i know hermione whispered back you re you re you ron whispered tensely younglings egon began in a steady voice as moritz growl began to grow run he stated evenly run hermione squeaked but wh just then a great roar erupted from moritz as he leaped forward claws ready before ron knew exactly what was happening there was an awful sound of hermione screaming two massive bodies colliding teeth gnashing and claws scraping the stone floor and ripping taut flesh hermione felt herself being dragged toward the breach in the cave her back was still aching from the injury she had gotten in the forbidden forest after being knocked to the ground by malfoy but she was forced to press her back against the cave wall to keep from being bombarded by one of the two beasts now biting and clawing at each other without mercy hermione truly didntknow what bishvajit meant but judging from egon response it wasntgood the two wemics were so fiercely fighting with one another hermione hoped that she and ron would be able to reach the cave opening without being killed it seemed to be taking them forever inch by inch as the beasts continued to make the most awful sounds almost there ron whispered over his shoulder he was right the opening was just a couple of yards away hermione could see the trees damp grass and fog although the sight evoked a fear in her from the memories of her journey through the portkey it looked like a haven as compared to this she heard one last booming roar from egon before she and ron finally exited the cave the air was humid and cold and it seemed to slap them in the face as soon as their feet touched the marshy ground and the fog it seemed denser than when she had first arrived through the portkey there was ten feet of visibility in front of them at best however upon looking up hermione could just make out the form of the castle to the left jagged mountains loomed high to her right and a mass of trees was just ahead we need to find harry hermione whispered fiercely taking the lead and tugging on ron hand we ll be seen on the grounds let take cover in the trees she pulled ron toward the trees as they neared them hermione noticed that the branches and trunks were even thicker than those of the forbidden forest they ducked into the forest low hanging branches to find something quite amazing no fog along the perimeter of the forest the field was not visible whatsoever there was simply a thick white mass surrounding the trees it was as if the forest was enchanted to repel the fog the forest itself was beautiful there was no fog overhead so the bright moonlight of the full moon shone through the tops of the trees freely the ground was covered with bright green leaves and there were beautiful purple flowers budding around the tree trunks wow hermione breathed before looking up at ron he wasntlooking down at her however instead he was looking about them nervously with a furrowed brow ron hermione asked tentatively prompting him to look down at her with his piercing blue eyes we cantstay in here hermione he blurted out pulling her to him with one strong hand and raising his wand with the other why not hermione asked her heart beginning to pound faster and faster mostly from fear but there was also the small thing of being pressed warmly up against ron whom she had so recently thought gone from her life forever she couldntkeep herself from wrapping her arms around his waist and clinging to him harry and i we saw wemics earlier ron began these trees belong to them there even a tree guarder or something his name is aloysius i think anyway the trees are probably full of them but well hermione murmured looking from the enchanting beauty of the forest to the eerie white wall surrounding it it just that there are probably dementors running wild out there along with death eaters and well wemics arent bad creatures they re really very peaceful peaceful ron asked pulling away long enough to look down at her with a sort of nervous smile twitching at the corner of his mouth hermione that moritz cat is trying to kill your dear friend egon as we speak and he probably would have chewed us to bits if egon hadntbeen with us yes but and that not to mention the rest of the beasts that are following voldemort ron added tensely still holding her to his chest with one arm but ron hermione began but before she could finish she felt ron hold tighten upon her back as he somehow lost his balance and they both began falling backward a gasp and a thud later hermione found herself lying haphazardly across ron knees in the middle of two trees and amid a bunch of bushy yet startlingly soft undergrowth she was also looking into two dark and twinkling eyes and a heart shaped face topped with a short cropping of silver and red hair tonks hermione and ron blurted simultaneously as they quickly re situated themselves to a kneeling position shh tonks whispered holding one finger to her brightly painted lips she was dressed in a black suit hermione had never seen anything like it the pants which looked as if they were made from dragon hide were skin tight tapered at the ankles and tucked into thick leather boots with thick straps the coat had long tight leather sleeves that covered half of tonks hands and buttons that went all the way up the torso ending in the middle of her neck her wand was held tightly in her hand and she had that stony serious look hermione remembered from that day at grimmauld place when harry had burst a hole through the ceiling yes it me tonks began in a low voice that wasnta whisper but that hermione had to strain to hear nonetheless merlin beard hermione it great to see you are you okay are you hurt i fine really hermione said taking hold of ron hand thanks to ron well and harry hermione gazed up at ron for a mere second before her mouth went dry oh harry tonks we ve got to forget about harry for a second tonks said sharply her eyes squinted at ron whose mouth was hanging open at tonks remark mr weasley i can not believe that you took this mission upon yourself are you mad do you know that your mother is in the hogwarts infirmary do you know that mum in the hospital ron croaked she fainted flat out in the floor of dumbledore office dumbledore office hermione asked in confusion as ron face went a bit pale he called us to his office as soon as ginny and hagrid brought the news tonks said the search and rescue team then set out immediately when did you arrive ron asked with a strange look in his eyes as his hand tightened around hermione s the order arrived no more than an hour ago what kind of search and rescue is that ron whispered harshly hermione saw something flash in tonks eyes at ron response do you know how long it took harry and i to get to this merlin forsaken island and no one was here hermione could ve been ron took a sudden deep breath and blew it out shakily looking to the ground listen here i will tell you what kind of search and rescue party that is tonks spat it the party that took 3 7 seconds to group at dumbledore office after the call was sent it the party that then immediately flooed to a coastal wizarding station in germany so that we could fly our brooms over the ocean to this fog bath you flew brooms ron asked incredulously what in hell d you do that for a wizard cannot apparate to places he never been tonks began no one from the order d ever been to wyk this island not hardly big enough to piss on so of course it not connected to the floo network it one hundred percent muggles or so thought so it not connected to the portkey network either i arrived by portkey hermione began softly almost frightened to cut in but tonks soon interrupted the one malfoy used was specially made you have to know exactly what location you re preprogramming before you just up and alright fine ron blurted out suddenly hermione saw that his brows were fiercely furrowed thank you for coming really but we cantsit here harry out there somewhere and who knows wha ol wings is with dumbledore tonks interjected dumbledore came hermione asked a feeling of renewed hope spreading through her yes tonks said shortly along with arthur kingsley hestia emmeline mad eye lupin and whitman so where is everyone hermione asked quickly an awkward look formed on tonks face before she responded well there was a sort of problem the party had to split up a bit what sort of a problem ron asked apprehensively a big problem uh i would say it more of a giant problem tonks responded oh no hermione groaned a feeling of dread washed over her is he hurt well no tonks began he just sort of made a trip into town what ron asked looking completely lost who in town grawp hermione stated a look of comprehension came over ron face i heard a wemic talking about a giant earlier ron began harry and i wondered if it were grawp but how he followed me hermione said he was trying to save me but he connected with the portkey in the process the wemics didntreceive him very well yeah i dontthink the muggles received him very well either tonks said with a sigh arthur hestia and emmeline have gone to apprehend him and hopefully send him back to hogwarts now that we know the exact location of this island we can hopefully send him by portkey and the muggles ron asked the operation will involve some memory charms on the muggles one of hestia specialties tonks answered and what are the other order members doing hermione asked everyone with harry cept kingsley and whitman tonks began at the onset kingsley whitman and i split up to scout the place as awful as your kidnapping was hermione it has brought us to the place the order and many other wizarding agencies worldwide have been searching for so can the order members see the castle ron asked yes tonks nodded harry was able to share the secret of the location with dumbledore by using occlumency dumbledore then cast a spell on all of us to pass the information that when i saw the castle i cantbelieve voldemort went twelfth century i mean with the embattled parapets and the as hermione listened to tonks criticisms of voldemort castle she could ve sworn she saw a swiftly moving shadow in her peripheral vision it was to the right of tonks head but as soon as she saw it it was gone i think we should get to harry and dumbledore hermione stated evenly interrupting tonks now we need to go now hermione ron asked worriedly hermione did you see something tonks asked peering around their foliage refuge into the dense forest no yes i mean hermione stammered where do we go to get to harry tonks raised one curious eyebrow at hermione well our best bet is to follow the tree line that way we wontbe getting too far into the forest and neither will we be walking out in that blimey you should not be here hermione felt as if an ice cold bucket of water had just been poured over her at the sound of the low bristly voice coming from above her head she tonks and ron all stood up with their wands outstretched and pointing at a large muscular chest it was a chest decorated with a necklace of stone discs and a bright red tattoo as hermione eyes traveled up the chest she saw two glowing eyes holy shit tonks exclaimed in a half croak hermione turned a warning stare upon her before addressing the wemic um sir we know that we probably shouldnt be here but we really need to you should not be here the wemic repeated evenly i aloysius guarder of the trees will see you back to your imprisonment youngling oh i dont think so tonks shot back suddenly regaining her composure we were just about to leave and for your and your trees benefits i suggest you allow us to do just that hermione mouth dropped open at tonks boldness and she swore she heard ron make a muffled swear under his breath dark lord wants youngling in castle and by order of chief basilius i follow dark lord orders aloysius replied as his feline nostrils began to flare tonks puffed and shrugged well you can tell chief basilius to just uh what she means is hermione interrupted before aloysius eyes could get anymore squinted she then took one deep breath before continuing very quickly voldemort killed basilius which made egon chief but now egon is fighting moritz so he hasntbeen able to tell the nation that he chief and i dontknow why moritz wanted to fight but it has something to do with the word bishvajit and i think bishvajit aloysius breathed before a deep growl began to rumble in his throat bless you tonks said with a raised eyebrow surprisingly the beast didntseem to hear this remark youngling aloysius began as he peered down at hermione with stoic eyes where do you hear these words egon helped me escape hermione replied the wemic narrowed his eyes mr aloysius ron began could you possibly explain that bashjavit word to us the wemic looked down at ron his eyes narrowed and began slowly bishvajit is claimed by member of my nation when he wishes to dual chieftain to death stone of war is thrown duel is fought and survivor takes throne it is meant to be used against unlawful or cruel chieftains but moritz only wants to be chieftain so that he can follow voldemort hermione said quickly he thinks that will lead him to an immortal life but he wrong egon he will win wonthe she asked worriedly aloysius simply stared down at hermione after these words it wasntan intimidating stare if anything the beast looked horribly sad suddenly the wemic turned his head sharply to the side just before a booming roar pierced the brief silence and another wemic burst through the fog and entered the trees a few yards away hermione ron and tonks who had all lowered their wands from aloysius were now aiming at the unidentified wemic now standing tall in the shadows ron had grabbed hermione free arm while tonks was attempting to shield both ron and hermione with her small body however this was probably unnecessary of tonks because at the same time aloysius had made to stand in front of all of them facing the unexpected guest moritz aloysius asked in a strong steady voice the wemic began to take slow prowling steps forward and as the dim moonlight hit the beast hermione took a sharp intake of breath his chest was covered in blood oozing from a large clawed mark and it appeared as though he was missing part of an ear chief moritz aloysius moritz sneered it is chief moritz the wemic then held up a necklace covered with bloodstained glass beads aloysius expression was unreadable as he responded chief basilius is dead moritz stated harshly now beginning to take slow prowling steps toward them and you then claimed bishvajit over egon aloysius said in a near growl you did not consult counsel duel had no viewers duel is void no moritz growled back aloysius duel is not void counsel and viewers are not binding to bishvajit but it is wemic tradition of respect for one brethren aloysius cried taking a step closer to moritz it matters not now moritz countered angrily hurling egon beaded necklace over their heads where hermione watched it soar through the wall of fog into white oblivion she distantly heard it hit the ground i am new chieftain and your first order is to inform nation while i deal with younglings aloysius remained silent for a moment as he and moritz stared at one another standing a mere two feet apart i will take order aloysius finally said stoically but younglings have done naught younglings are not your concern moritz stated with a sneer that plainly showed he was enjoying ordering the larger wemic around now take order and go aloysius gave the tiniest of nods before turning and dashing into the trees without a glance back now hermione really understood what egon had meant when he informed her that wemics always follow their chieftain moritz had not been chieftain for an hour yet aloysius followed his order as a stream follows its course moritz however stood his ground turning his massive head full of course auburn hair to stare at the three of them ron you and hermione follow the tree line until you find some wings alright tonks said in a surprisingly calm voice keeping her eyes and wand on moritz who was now glaring at tonks with a curious expression but hermione began but tonks simply held up her free hand in their direction and shook her head no one leaves moritz growled i give orders here yes you do tonks said belittlingly and if i had fur and a tail i would probably follow them but alas instantly moritz began to growl deeply and his tail arched stiffly as egon had in the cave ron now tonks yelled suddenly and then without warning she lunged toward the massive beast in front of them moritz looked stunned for a mere second before he quickly dodged tonks lunge and bright red magic burst moritz then made to throw a seed from his seed covered necklace but tonks was able to obliterate it with a quick spell before moritz could even fully remove it the two then began circling each other moritz was removing short sticks from a leather satchel around the base of his torso he then began putting the sticks together end to end and hermione realized it was actually a spear as the wemic added a stone tip to the end hermione was watching the two circle each other so intently she was completely startled when she suddenly felt herself being tugged in the opposite direction she gasped so hard it made her throat soar but she was more worried about catching her brain up to her feet which were running alongside ron without her full consent ron we cantleave her hermione wheezed having completely lost the tug of war battle with ron looking over her shoulder as she jogged to keep up with him hermione saw tonks do an amazing roll to dodge a grab from moritz hermione she an auror ron said beginning to pant a bit as tonks and moritz became no longer visible through the thick brush she can handle herself besides i getting you to safety if we stayed back to help how long do you think it would take the new chief to call for back up hermione only considered resisting for a second or two before she decided to trust in tonks ability and concentrate on finding harry and the others but hermione also began to realize just how fatigued her body was from the events of the day the cut on her back hurt no question but at the moment hermione felt the most pain in her legs and chest it had to have been adrenaline that kept one foot going after the other because she had so little energy left she was truly baffled at how she was continuing to run and she was suddenly reminded of running through similar trees as these with who she thought had been ron how much longer hermione breathed after she was sure they d been running for at least ten minutes not long hermione ron said squeezing her hand tightly tonks said we could just follow this tree line and suddenly ron came to a complete halt hermione slammed into his back and nearly fell over but she didnthave to ask what ron sudden halt was for just ahead of them about twenty yards a hooded figure in black robes stood was it a man hermione couldntbe sure it was facing them though its actual face was not visible two arms were hanging loosely at its sides but were not visible either it seemed to be hunched over slightly and breathing heavily for the upper body was rising and falling quite noticeably ron hermione thank heavens the figure said it was a man voice but not just any man hermione recognized the voice and as she looked up at ron shocked expression she knew he did as well professor lupin ron prompted uneasily yes the figure spoke again ron and hermione exchanged a disbelieving look before they each raised their wands and pointed at the figure who continued to stand perfectly still except for the rising and falling of his upper body i know my voice sounds a bit different the figure said but i assure you it is i look up the both of you hermione didntlook up as ron did she didnthave to she had seen the full moon earlier that was the reasoning behind the eerie voice coming from beneath the hood it was lupin voice but at the same time there was almost another voice speaking the second voice was deeper than lupin s and sounded as if there was hardly enough air for it to speak at all you ve been taking your wolfsbane potion professor hermione began taking a few steps forward despite ron attempts to stop her you can lower your hood if you d like hermione and ron both watched as lupin raised both hands to grab his hood when the hands became exposed hermione heard ron mumble blimey for which she pinched him hard on the arm although hermione was thinking something similar lupin hands were long and clawed and not the color of a human at all they were almost blue as he lowered his hood hermione saw for the second time in her life a werewolf lupin face was that of a man wolf with yellow eyes and a long nose so ron began you can still talk and everything as long as you take that potion yes lupin said it was more than a bit odd watching a werewolf talk especially when it was lupin while wolfsbane wontcure lycanthropy it prevents the dementia that would otherwise accompany this form but enough about that thank heavens you are alright now both of you need to follow me harry and hermione had been about to take a step toward lupin but he stopped speaking so abruptly she actually stumbled a bit lupin was suddenly standing very tall with his arms bent oddly at his sides and his snout lifted into the air as if he were sniffing nymphadora lupin said suddenly he then began approaching ron and hermione quickly and just when hermione thought he might run into the both of them he leapt into the air and over their heads landing behind them so gracefully she barely heard his feet touch ground he then took a few steps in the direction ron and hermione had come before stopping and lowering his head to sniff the ground ron and hermione exchanged a worried look just as tonks burst through a bush a mere foot from lupin nose tonks hermione gasped as lupin lunged for her he grabbed her around the waist with one long scarred arm while she wrapped one arm around his bony fur covered neck remus you know i hate that name tonks rasped a long gash oozing blood running along the left side of her face lupin said nothing but looked tonks up and down quickly before lifting her into his arms and turning to walk in the direction away from whence tonks had just come bloody hell ron breathed hermione was right we shouldnthave left you tonks hermione was biting her bottom lip to keep her mouth from drooping open into a horrified gape as she and ron hurried to keep up with lupin unusually long strides from behind lupin hermione had a perfect view of tonks legs which were hanging limply over lupin arm just above her left knee a rip had been made through her dragon hide armor it was surely ripped by teeth because tonks exposed leg had a semi circle row of puncture wounds bleeding heavily remus it was a wemic tonks said in a voice hermione had never heard her utter it was weak and raspy and it gave hermione a chill of worry i know lupin said calmly i can smell it i failed you look victorious to me no remus he got away he ll go straight to him it will be my fault if we dontget these kids out of here you did all you could besides the portkey is ready tonks said nothing to this but hermione saw her hand grip the back of lupin neck her fingernails were painted silver which nearly matched lupin hair this made a lump form in hermione throat for some reason but she didntcry she actually didntthink she could cry if she wanted to it was as if the lump of tears was stuck in her throat behind a wall she was immensely grateful for this wall because she was sure if it broke the tears would flood her mind and senses until she went as limp as tonks hermione shook her head to clear her mind of these thoughts she looked to ron walking steadily by her side he looked completely alert with his wand ready and his blue eyes wide open it was then that hermione realized her hands were shaking and her feet were numb it was quite cold on this island but hermione didntthink that was it she was sure it was the lack of food mixed with the running fighting jumping and fear she d endured this seemingly never ending day the question how much further was resting on hermione tongue but she swallowed it how could she complain or seem impatient when tonks had nearly gotten herself killed in order to give her and ron a chance to get to safety the tree line ending ron whispered urgently hermione head shot up from staring at lupin hunched back ron was right she could see a thick wall of white ahead of them just beyond the trees yes lupin said quietly keep following me and be alert ron and hermione obeyed they came to a halt with lupin at the edge of the forest and hermione watched in confusion as lupin looked all along the wall of fog left and right right and left he can see through that ron whispered low after bending to hermione ear yes heightened senses lupin said suddenly including hearing now come ron grabbed hold of hermione hand as they followed lupin out of the beauty of the forest and into the fog wall as soon as they exited hermione felt as if she had been draped in a drenched cloth of cold silk whether the shock of the damp cold caused her to slow or exiting the forest prompted lupin to quicken hermione wasntsure all she knew was she was suddenly being dragged by ron over the marshy ground if lupin had not been leading them hermione wouldnthave known which way was up because of the fog she couldnteven see the moon any longer although she knew it was there because she was chasing a werewolf they had not been out of the forest for more than five minutes when a large wall of rock loomed large before them lupin made his way around it into what looked like a small cove of jagged black hills and within the cove stood dumbledore whitman kingsley mad eye and harry dumbledore mad eye and harry stood with their black cloaks whipping around their ankles while hermione was surprised to see whitman and kingsley in similar garb as tonks dragon hide uniforms as soon as they d laid eyes upon them ron released his hold on hermione hand she knew he understood what she had to do hermione ran straight passed lupin and tonks and into harry arms hermione i so sorry harry whispered as he hugged her tighter than he ever had before the soar place on her back was throbbing with pain but she paid it no mind there nothing for you to be sorry for hermione said evenly if anyone should be sorry it me nonsense miss granger dumbledore said softly placing one hand on her shoulder harry released her and she saw him wipe one eye before she turned to look up at her headmaster she briefly noticed a small silver goblet of sorts in dumbledore other hand before he added no one among us has any fault for the events of tonight dumbledore right mad eye growled as he hobbled over to stand beside ron although there re two young men here that might have shown a bit more vigilance alastor come now kingsley began with both arms crossed over his chest these men are heroes bah mad eye grumbled heroes are made when careless fools take chances and get lucky oh i dunno moody whitman piped up suddenly give em a bit of credit eh bluey and hazza have shown they ve got the steel bullocks it takes to be aurors mad eye made a huffing noise at this whitman i think you confuse bullocks of steel with brains of lead alastor edgar please dumbledore began hermione saw that he had turned from her to peer down at tonks form still limp in lupin arms remus i do hope this injury isnta product of negligence in taking your potion as severus instructed no sir tonks replied as lupin kneeled to set her on the ground this is the work of one of those cats ah dumbledore stated with a raise of his eyebrows well poppy will have you fit in no time now if everybody professor ron burst out suddenly severus is i mean snape is here he was in the castle yes i saw him too hermione added she had almost completely forgotten but he helped me yeah me too ron added as if it almost pained him to say it harry was looking at them both with wide eyes of course severus is here dumbledore said calmly but please tell me he was able to help you in a most subtle way if in the presence of others yes sir ron and hermione said together good dumbledore said with a nod now will everyone please gather around the goblet we ve no more time to waste here right kingsley said briskly stepping up to dumbledore who was now holding the goblet out in front of him a bit i concur mad eye growled aye whitman replied everyone gathered as quickly as possible hermione squeezed in between ron and lupin who had once again lifted tonks in his arms ron took hold of hermione hand and squeezed tightly a sudden rumbling of excitement began to spin in hermione stomach as everyone reached out their hands for the goblet she was going home they would all be home in a matter of seconds once everyone had at least one finger upon the goblet dumbledore raised his wand he then placed its tip upon the portkey but before he could utter a word a sudden whooshing sound was heard from overhead it startled hermione so the very hand she had placed upon the portkey flew to her mouth as she gasped and looked to the sky through the fog she had made out a rider upon a winged horse flying in the direction of the castle before hermione eyes had even left the sky she heard another whooshing sound harry had transformed into his pegasus form in seconds and taken off in pursuit of the other horse what in bloody hell is he doing ron exclaimed as his heart began beating heavily in his throat no one answered him as quiet chaos erupted among the small group ron could have sworn he had looked into the sky to see someone fly by as if on a broom but he had seen no broom then harry had taken off like a madman or mad horse and now now ron felt as if he had been cursed with a body bind as he watched everyone around him dumbledore who had picked up a jagged stone from the ground had the most steely and unreadable expression ron had ever seen him wear portus dumbledore breathed holding his wand to the rock he then quickly handed the rock to tonks who had once again been placed on the ground by lupin who was standing tall and peering into the sky you take this nymphadora no buts there no time it will take you straight to poppy go now dumbledore ordered at these words lupin looked down at tonks who was able to give him a fleeting glance before she disappeared with the stone portkey professor ron shouted suddenly able to move again what about hermione this is for yourself and miss granger dumbledore said quickly thrusting the silver goblet into ron hands i sending you both directly to the safest place in hogwarts right now my office go now as soon as dumbledore had given his order he turned to lupin and grabbed hold of his arm ron was standing with hermione but neither of them made to obey their headmaster as they continued to watch in silent trepidation was it miss weasley remus did you see dumbledore asked ron felt a pain shoot from his heart to his brain at these words miss weasley ginny yes lupin replied quickly in that strange double voice her scent was strong she must be bleeding i believe she might have wounded herself in order to attract that thestral foolish girl mad eye growled she must have asked the creature to track harry it would have been an easy task for one of those beasts to track the scent of a pegasus kingsley added dumbledore closed his eyes for a mere second before turning to mad eye whitman and kingsley who were all three standing to his side listening intently with their wands in hand you three come with me dumbledore began miss weasley wontbe able to see the castle harry might stop her from running into it but there will be death eaters about they all nodded as dumbledore turned to exit the cove as he turned however he laid his eyes upon ron and hermione who were now staring at him in horrified silence i told you two to go he said evenly before turning back to lupin accompany these two to my office of course lupin replied quickly but ron wasntsure if dumbledore heard for they were gone from sight already leaving ron hermione and lupin alone in the cove i not leaving harry and my sister ron demanded removing his wand yes you are lupin said harshly holding out the goblet with his long clawed hand was it her arm hermione asked suddenly in a small voice what lupin asked sounding a bit agitated as he continued to keep the goblet held out for them to take harry vision ron said a horrible sick feeling overtaking him he saw ginny amid jagged rocks with a bloody arm lupin yellow eyes seemed to stare through ron for a moment as if he were thinking before he shook his wolfish head and nearly growled take hold of the portkey reducto ron and hermione both fell hard onto the marshy ground as a silver dust burst into the air from lupin hand lupin made a sort of sneezing sound and squeezed his eyes shut as apparently bits of what remained of their portkey had blown into his eyes and snout ron had nearly forgotten the utterance of the spell as he stared transfixed at the falling silver dust but he soon looked up when he heard a gruff and scratchy voice look rat tail dolohov rasped it one of your dear old friends through the fog ron could just make out the faces of pettigrew dolohov and mr goyle he stood from the ground quickly raising his wand as he helped hermione up as well i believe it was wormtail dolohov but rat tail may actually be more fitting lupin said in a growl pettigrew didntrespond and ron thought he looked a bit jumpy as he stood behind dolohov look who else we have here antonin goyle said with a snicker little miss survivor ron blood immediately began to boil but he said nothing as he took a step in front of hermione lupin hadntmoved yet ron could hear a steady growl coming from him you mean little miss lucky dolohov sneered though i dontthink your cards are quite as high tonight only a poor apprentice wizard and a domesticated wolf to protect you ron was so angry he could feel heat in his cheeks so warm he felt his face must have been lighting up the foggy cove but still he made no comment or move they were trying to provoke them but it wouldntwork he wasntgoing to make an angry mindless move putting himself hermione and lupin in a greater state of vulnerability they were already about twenty feet below the death eaters completely exposed in their small cove with only the fog for cover you know goyle dolohov began bella is quite good at exterminating hairy mongrels perhaps we should call her over to before dolohov could finish his insult lupin had amazingly jumped ten feet into the air grabbing hold of the jagged rock hill the death eaters were atop the three looked temporarily stunned which gave lupin the advantage he needed to jump the rest of the way up the hill and onto the landing with the three men ron and hermione could not see what was happening but they could see lights and hear shouts and growls without fully knowing what he planned to do ron grabbed hold of hermione hand and darted out of the cove in the direction of the forest they had been spotted lupin had left their side and their portkey had been obliterated and for whatever reason the forest seemed the safest place for them at the moment a flash of tonks mangled leg settled itself in ron mind as he continued to drag hermione uphill toward the trees and away from the flashing lights and growls of the brawl his gut was telling him to go back to the fight and help lupin but his heart was screaming for him to keep hermione in his sight and safe it seemed like another lifetime ago that he had been on the hogwart quidditch field and heard hermione scream his name through the mirror but it wasnta lifetime ago it was that morning he wouldntlose her again not twice in a lifetime and certainly not twice in one day suddenly green trees began to take shape in the distance in seconds they were upon them and stepping out of the fog into the enchanted woods as soon as their feet hit the leafy ground of the forest the sounds of spells shouting and wind ceased so that ron could fully hear the beating of his heart in his ears he wasntabout to stop once they entered the forest but when he tried to continue their quick pace into the trees hermione stopped him by holding her ground ron stopped and turned to see her doubled over a bit ron it my robe she panted it caught ron peered down at a section of hermione robe which was indeed snagged on a small knob of a tree hold on to me ron said as he bent to try and free the fabric just as she began to wrap her arms about his neck however she made a gasping sound and disappeared back into the wall of fog hermione ron shouted hurdling over a bush and fallen limb back onto the marshy ground he held his breath and felt the blood drain from his face and settle into his feet at the sight in front of him dolohov was smirking at him one hand holding hermione against him the other thrusting a wand at her throat not just any wand either it was hermione wand dolohov had his own wand held tightly in his other hand a bit surprisingly there was no sign of pettigrew goyle or lupin let her go ron stated as steadily and strongly as he could just let her go and duel me man to man any why would i do that dolohov asked gruffly yet with a hint of a smile that showed how much he was enjoying this for one it would be more honorable ron began but i know honor means nothing to you so instead you should let her go to save your hide if you don t i ll kill you right here and now dolohov made a sort of coughing noise that ron realized was a laugh boy if you could see mere pictures of the things i ve done to wizards much more powerful than the likes of you your knees would buckle ron opened his mouth to retort when he noticed hermione doing something odd with her eyes she was opening them wide and looking down at the ground and then up again she started to mouth something when dolohov tightened his grip around her neck causing her to make a choking sound what are you playing at little girl dolohov growled without warning hermione raised her foot from the ground and brought her heel down hard into dolohov shin he grunted and swore loudly while at the same time loosening his grip enough for hermione to drop to the ground giving ron a clear shot at dolohov chest ron quickly focused his anger into his wand shooting a magic burst of blue light at dolohov who stumbled backward hermione stood from the ground and ran to ron side dolohov still had both his wand and hermione s so hermione crouched behind ron who knew in an instant what his next move would be lumen contego ron shouted pointing his wand forward while reaching down for hermione hand a bright white transparent globe of light encircled ron and hermione just as dolohov yelled crucio a black light shot out of his wand but when it contacted with ron shield it turned a faint purple and ricocheted back toward dolohov who dodged it by quickly rolling to his left ron guessed that his protective charm had caught the death eater so off guard that he forgot how near they were to a small cliff the cliff dropped into a similar cove as the one ron and hermione had recently retreated from but the drop off was a good thirty feet to a jagged stone floor dolohov missed rolling off of the cliff by a few inches but as he stood quickly from his vulnerable position just enough rock gave way under his feet to cause him to lose his footing in seconds dolohov was grasping onto the plateau by his bony wrinkled hands one of which was still holding hermione wand ron lowered his shield and with hermione by his side approached the death eater who playing with high cards now ron asked between clenched teeth as he bent to retrieve hermione wand after prying it from dolohov fingers ron handed it over to hermione who looked quite relieved to have it back hand over your wand ron ordered harshly it it fell dolohov panted as his fingers began to slip a bit and more rocks began to crumble and fall down the sides of the cliff hand it over ron shouted lifting one foot and holding it threateningly above dolohov right hand which was beginning to bleed from hanging on to the jagged rocks i swear it fell below dolohov shouted before panting please help me why should i ron asked i ll die if you don t he growled ron hermione began we cantlet him die hermione he was a second away from killing you ron stated let go before ron could turn dolohov shouted little girl you wontbe able to live with the guilt my blood will be on your hands dontlisten to him hermione ron said grabbing hold of hermione elbow to try and lead her away ron she pleaded once more by the look in her eyes ron knew he was going to have to save the bastard even if he could live with dolohov blood on his hands hermione really would be eaten by the guilt grudgingly ron turned to dolohov and held one hand out for him the man took it quickly and ron was able to pull him up from the rocks ron let go of him as soon as possible and was about to back away when dolohov snatched something from within his robes his wand ron knew what spell the death eater was about to cast and he knew he was too late to stop it as he brought his own wand up in defense everything seemed to be moving in slow motion as he heard the words avada ke no before ron could blink or even take a breath he saw a bright blue light shoot passed him and hit dolohov square in the chest the man eyes went wide as he was blasted backward ron glanced down at dolohov feet which were sliding off the edge of the cliff he had time to reach out and grab for him but he kept his wand pointed at the man and his other arm down at his side as he watched him fall into the fog a gruff yell began but was cut short as a horrible thud echoed up the cove ron lit his wand and peered downward but as soon as he felt hermione arms about his waist he put out his light he had seen below but he wasntabout to let hermione who was already shaking from head to toe ron pulled them back farther from the cliff edge before sinking to the damp ground with her wrapped in his arms you saved me hermione ron said softly he was going to kill you hermione whispered in a shaky voice right in front of me you pulled him up but he was going to i didntknow what else to do he was hermione these men have no hearts ron began rubbing a hand along hermione arm you saved my life just now alright i love you she whispered kissing him lightly on the corner of his mouth ron sighed before holding her a bit tighter hermione i just then a whooshing sound filled the air above them and a black horse began descending upon them they each stared upward as harry landed beside them with ginny on his back ginny nearly jumped off of him and ran toward ron and hermione embracing them both ron barely got a glimpse of a long cut down ginny right upper arm before he was patting her soothingly and watching harry transform into a human ginny what were you thinking ron demanded suddenly remembering what his sister had done to get there harry told you to stay at hogwarts ron i ve already half chewed her head off harry said suddenly kneeling beside his three embraced mates now where dumbledore what hermione asked in a slightly higher voice than normal as she quickly broke the embrace you mean you didn t you mean you haven t ah hell ron swore you must ve crossed each other paths whose path ginny asked confusedly they went looking for you both hermione exclaimed standing from the ground dumbledore whitman mad eye and kingsley they re headed for the castle lupin out there somewhere too ron added as a cramp began to twist in his stomach well where the portkey harry asked his brows furrowed we can at least send the girls back no ginny shouted there is no portkey anyway hermione offered dolohov blew it to bits dolohov harry asked raising his wand where is he i blasted him over that cliff hermione said absently motioning behind her with her thumb harry and ginny both looked at her as if she d just spoken a completely foreign language but she was oblivious so they turned to ron as if to ask is she mad i think he died instantly ron said but that neither here nor there right now well i guess it is there ron corrected himself glancing toward the cliff but no matter we ve got to find dumbledore and the others and get everyone out of here right harry agreed listen i think the girls should stay in the forest hidden you and i can fly over the area quickly it wonttake long to spot them i not staying here ginny protested well fine because i not leaving you and hermione in that forest anyway ron stated evenly what harry asked there a long story of wemic politics thatwe donthave time for right now but believe me when i say the forest isntany safer than the grounds so you propose we set out in this fog by foot why foot the three of you cantfit safely on my back ron sighed heavily before giving a small shrug then yes i propose we set out by foot me too hermione said quickly me three ginny added harry looked a bit annoyed for a fleeting moment before he nodded sharply and turned toward the castle then follow me he ordered taking hold of ginny hand wait hermione said suddenly grabbing ginny free hand what hermione ginny asked without warning hermione pulled ginny torn shirt sleeve away from the wound and cast some sort of spell that immediately closed off the cut wow hermione ginny breathed turning her arm this way and that as hermione dropped ginny hand now that only temporary so try not to use that arm very much alright hermione asked ginny simply nodded as ron took hold of hermione hand shall we harry asked the three obediently fell in step behind him we re at least following the tree line harry began as they turned a bit east until the trees were visible that way we wontend up going in circles through this fog we could always just use the four point spell hermione offered well i also sort of like the idea of being able to run into the trees if necessary harry said calmly they walked a bit more until they began to hear bursts and shouts it was immediately clear to the four that there were many battles taking place across the grounds there were so many however and such an echo among the mountain surrounded plateau there was no way of knowing which direction the noises were coming from one second it would sound as if the commotion were merely a few yards away in this direction or that but then seconds later it would sound distant barely audible at one point they came along a stream flowing from the trees out into the middle of the grounds and they decided that it was time to leave the security of the tree line they would run straight into the castle before they caught sight of dumbledore if they continued along this way much further so harry suggested that they follow the stream into the middle of the plateau this way if trouble arose they could run back along the stream knowing it would lead them straight to the forest they had merely walked thirty yards or so along the stream bank when a bright green light streaked through the air in front of them each of them ducked instinctively among some tall grass which was growing along the banks you missed him again you fool ron and hermione exchanged a brief glance before they each looked to harry whose face had gone completely stony harry had not seen sirius murderer since that day at the department of mysteries ron and hermione then squinted their eyes to better see the two cloaked figures standing a few yards away hermione had one hand squeezing tightly to ron upper arm but at the sound of the second voice her hold loosened a bit well what do you expect bellatrix with that damn eye he can dodge anything oh forget it bellatrix seethed the dark lord is only concerned with two here tonight anyway dumbledore has surely sent potter back to hogwarts by now i say we regroup with lucius and rastaban severus you almost sound as if you hope potter has escaped dontbe so utterly ridiculous i just think our services would be better spent handling those blasted aurors what has happened to your faith in the dark lord he said he could still feel potter presence the boy is here my faith in the dark lord is as strong as ever i just snape faltered a bit and although ron couldntmake out any details of the man face he was fairly sure he was quickly thinking of a convincing response if i to be honest my true concern lies with you what on earth are you talking about bella should you really be fighting while carrying an unborn child if potter dies tonight nothing that happens to me or my child will have been in vain snape remained silent after this comment but even if he were about to respond he would have been interrupted by a quick rustling of footsteps severus bella called a voice much too familiar for ron lucius bellatrix called sounding a bit relieved to have the company of someone other than snape look what we ve found lucius said with his pompous tone ron squinted his eyes more to try and see who the we and what the what was that lucius was referring to the who was almost immediately made apparent rastaban what is that you have bellatrix asked with a bit of a maniacal sound to her voice which told ron that she already knew what it was a man no let me see a dog no ah it a filthy mangy half blood half blood yes lucius sneered in more ways than one ron had his suspicions as to who rastaban and lucius had captured and they were confirmed when snape lit his wand and shone it in lupin face they had stripped him of his robe and cast some sort of binding spell on his body which kept his arms crossed tightly over his chest ron saw that it was lucius that had his wand jabbed into lupin side keeping him bound and suspended a bit in the air there was a trickling of blood running out of lupin mouth and down the hair of his chin his yellow eyes looked weak and dazed as well we need to kill him quickly so that we can join the others rastaban said there an aussie and that shacklebolt bloke fighting with crabbe goyle draco and gregory and what of dumbledore and the boy bellatrix asked almost hungrily nothing lucius stated evenly i sure they re hiding like the cowards they are which is why we must keep searching right so hurry up and kill the mongrel severus rastaban said what snape asked sounding as if he really hadntheard the other man you heard him severus bellatrix screeched what the matter with you tonight rastaban has brought you the last of your worst enemies now kill him it only right for the honor to be yours lucius said do it lupin said suddenly he still had that strange double voice but this time it was more hoarse than normal ron couldntbelieve his ears what could they have possibly done to lupin that would make him give up on life so easily but then ron realized something if snape refused to kill lupin the others would almost certainly realize snape loyalties lupin was giving snape permission to kill him in order for him to remain a spy for the order ron could see that everyone was staring at snape who hadnteven raised his wand yet ron then realized that hermione was squeezing his arm like crazy and he knew that she was thinking the same as him they had to do something just as ron was getting ready to stand harry shot up out of the grass wand ready and shouted praeliumurus as soon as the word left harry mouth a circular beam of light shot out of harry wand and in the blink of an eye spread wide to form a lucid silvery wall inches in front of him ten feet high and wide ron hermione and ginny were on their feet almost instantly wands ready ron had never heard this spell before and by the looks on hermione and ginny faces neither had they of course the death eaters on the other side of the wall looked more shocked than the girls but ron was fairly sure it had little to do with the actual spell and more to do with four teenagers suddenly jumping out of the grass let him go harry said suddenly ron noticed that harry wand aimed steadily before him had a thin wisp of light connecting the tip to the shield lupin still magically bound and suspended by rastaban looked even more miserable at the sight of harry his eyes held a sadness ron was sure he d never seen before the death eaters had their wands pointed at the four teenagers and each of them wore an expression of shock and hatred although ron noticed bellatrix expression was more akin to amusement well well well how lovely to see you tonight potter bellatrix rasped licking her lips a bit as she took a step in front of her brother in law i see you were hiding in the grass this whole time we should ve known to search as low as possible when looking for a dirtied half blood let him go harry repeated ignoring her insult ron was surprised at how calm harry sounded and how still his hand was around his wand ron gripped his wand tighter willing his hand to be as steady as harry s last summer at the department of mysteries a full fledged brawl broke out before the talking was over although ron could see everyone warm breath lifting from their mouths in the chilling air a layer of sweat covered his entire body glancing at hermione and ginny ron thought hermione looked more calm and steady than his sister of course she had been through more than any of them in the last twenty four hours oh come now potter bellatrix taunted you donttruly believe hiding behind your shiny little wall can possibly protect you from the dark lord best servants do you harry has faced that bastard five times and look who standing before you ginny shouted suddenly her voice shaking with anger ginny hermione warned in a slight groan ron could ve sworn he saw a tiny quiver pulling at the corner of harry mouth as for the death eaters they were now staring at ginny with disgust including snape how can you call yourself a pureblood rastaban asked disgustedly i dontcall myself a pureblood ginny retorted holding her head high i call myself a witch i call myself a witch bellatrix mimicked in a high pitched voice that sounded nothing at all like ginny your little defensive spells will only get you so far but dark magic has more power than any of you have ever known is it possible harry began darkly that if your dear husband had better learned his defensive magic he would still be alive how dare you bellatrix hissed her eyes glossing over as she began to approach the wall lucius grabbed her with one arm to hold her back she wrenched herself free yet stood her ground visibly shaking with rage yes she shrieked and then more calmly yes your precious order did take my husband but once we spill your blood this dog she then turned and jabbed her wand into lupin chest will be the next victim lucius put a steadying hand on bellatrix wand and guided it down from lupin now bella lucius began in his cold drawl you mustntget overexcited we dontwant you to kill off anyone just yet and we all know how you so enjoy killing dogs at this lucius turned his sneering face to look harry in the eye ron saw harry swallow hard as his wand hand began to shake slightly ginny put her free hand on harry shoulder oh too right you are lucius bellatrix began her own shaking slowly being replaced by a mad glimmer in her black eyes i d almost forgotten it was after all such an easy task harry was gripping his wand so tightly his knuckles appeared as white pebbles against his hands reddened from the cold ron knew the only thing between the four of them and a string of killing curses was the translucent wall shining before them held by harry wand the death eaters were aware of this too and ron knew harry was itching to take a shot at one of them or all of them but that shot could cost the protection of hermione of his sister oi there ron yelled suddenly to his satisfaction all attention was drawn to him i was thinking i pureblooded and all and that seems to be worth gold to you lot so why is it that you blindly follow a mere half blood i mean how ironic a weasley blood is worth more than voldemort these words flew off of ron tongue like a hot knife slicing butter he was a bit surprised with himself but he dared not show it although everyone on both sides of the wall wore expressions of shock lucius was the first to respond he quickly took several steps forward and pointing his wand at ron he spat with great loathing you revolting blood traitoring fool crucio ron barely had enough time to brace himself before a black light impacted with harry shield after impact a tiny black ball of light seemed caught in the shield directly in front of ron who felt himself slowly exhaling a breath however he almost immediately snatched the breath back as the light sped to the center of the wall and harry wand as soon as it touched harry wand harry let out a low growl of pain grabbing his wrist with his free hand but also dropping his wand to the marshy ground the shield disappeared immediately seemingly fading into the fog the realization at their sudden vulnerability seemed to settle over ron in slow motion before dropping into ron stomach like a stone then everything seemed to happen at once hermione and bellatrix were the first to act petrificus totalus hermione shouted the spell hit snape square in the chest who toppled over backward as stiff as a board ron cursed under his breath sure hermione meant to hit one of the others but when he looked at her she only gave a short nod as if pleased with her work accio potter wand bellatrix shrieked pointing her own wand at harry s idle on the ground the wand began to glide across the grass but harry rose from the ground and leapt forward grasping it with his fingertips bellatrix with wide eyes and an unearthly grin thrust her wand down at harry form as did lucius protego ron shouted aiming for harry he uttered his spell less than a mere second before the death eaters curses a faint blue light domed over harry as two red lights from bellatrix and lucius collided with the dome and miraculously exploded backward knocking the two off of their feet harry scrambled up and retreated to stand in front of ginny ron snapped out of his bit of shock and reached a hand out for hermione she came to him grabbing his hand as they both ducked the fog and tall grass shielded them temporarily as ron tried to form some sort of plan ginny and harry suddenly ran forward together and were dueling with rastaban and bellatrix lucius was subdued by lupin who was no longer bound hermione we ve got to unbind snape ron stated preparing to make his way toward him ron could just make out a dark form amidst the grass and fog a few yards away what no hermione whispered harshly grabbing ron hand hermione wha i meant to hit snape she began if he unbound and doesnthelp the death eaters they ll know of course ron thought feeling a bit dim but impressed with hermione quick logic we must help harry and ginny hermione said ron wanted to protest so badly he wanted to tell her to stay hidden while he helped but he wouldntleave her plus he had to show that he had faith in her how could he look into her anxious brown eyes and refuse her to use the talents he knew she had as a witch right ron responded before raptly stealing a kiss from her unsuspecting lips gripping her hand tightly ron stood from the grass and started toward the fight the first thing to meet their eyes through the dense fog was lupin wolf like body sprawled on the ground his tongue hanging out of his mouth his eyes closed professor hermione breathed rushing to his side and grabbing one limp paw in her hand professor can you hear me as ron looked down upon the unconscious face of lupin and then up through the fog at the dueling bodies of bellatrix rastaban harry and ginny he realized something that made his skin prickle ron we ve got to get him out of here hermione said her eyes shining with unshed tears where lucius ron asked what lucius and lupin were fighting earlier now where s the f forest lupin mumbled professor ron breathed leaning a bit closer to lupin mouth so he could better hear his weakened voice track him lupin began his yellow eyes staring into ron s i heard him telling rastaban he said if trouble arose one of them should get reinforcements feline reinforcements ah bugger ron muttered what about harry and ginny they need our help and imagine the help you four will need if you try and take on a herd of wemics and death eaters lupin said sitting up slowly his voice growing a bit stronger he right ron hermione said i know ron admitted will you come with us then i i dontthink i can walk lupin said for the first time ron looked at lupin legs they were covered in gray hair yet there were large mats of hair and dried blood around his knees and shins dontworry about me lupin said find lucius stop him hermione was still gripping tightly to lupin paw and looked as if letting go was the last thing she wanted to do but ron knew lupin was right if they were to have any chance of catching up with lucius they would have to leave lupin behind ron pried hermione hand away from lupin and pulled her up with him as he rose from the ground ron glanced around briefly before nodding once at lupin and turning to retrace their earlier steps along the stream it would lead them straight back to the forest and was no doubt the same path lucius had taken ron wasntsure why but all of his senses seemed to be heightened as he and hermione walked toward the forest hand in hand along the stream the fog seemed denser than ever yet ron felt as though he could see about fifteen feet in front of him instead of ten the sound of the rippling stream which had earlier seemed to glide downstream with casualness now sounded like a thousand hurried footsteps taking residence beside ron eardrums their own footsteps were taken as quickly as they could without making too much noise every once in a while ron would see a red blue or green light reflected in the stream it was coming from the duel he and hermione had left harry and ginny to deal with what must they be thinking they surely had no idea where he and hermione had gone to and if they reckoned they had retreated gutlessly the thought of harry dieing in a duel with the taste of his friend betrayal on his lips was enough to make ron hurry their steps a bit more ron hermione whispered suddenly her tiny voice sent a chill over ron and made him stop in his tracks to gaze down at her worried face what is it are you alright you re sort of squeezing the life out of my hand hermione responded ron briefly glanced down at his white knuckles and long fingers clutching to hermione poor thin hand before he loosened his grip he then pulled her hand to his lips and kissed its back lightly i sorry hermione ron said winning a small smile from her impedimenta the curse came from the banks on the opposite side of the stream hitting ron in the middle of his abdomen and knocking him five feet from hermione who let out a stifled scream ron felt as if every bit of oxygen in his lungs had been knocked out of them as he gasped for breath on the ground but this was the last thing on his mind as a searing pain ran up and down his right arm where a jagged rock the size of his hand had broken his fall ron eyes were having a bit of trouble focusing but he managed to push himself up from the ground with his left arm as he glanced about him for hermione he realized she was nowhere to be seen although there was a figure approaching crossing smoothly over the stream flying a dementor it had to be thought ron long black cloak floating almost gracefully he had to conjure a patronus my wand ron whispered looking around the ground frantically he realized his wand had fallen from his hand with his fall accio wand ron rasped holding his right arm with his left hand he could feel blood oozing between his fingers his wand didntcome but he was answered by a low chuckle coming from the figure now standing where he and hermione had been moments before dementors dontchuckle and neither do they cast spells ron thought i see by your eyes weasley that dark magic amazes you lucius sneered his long face and slick blonde hair coming into view as he took a step closer you fly ha no fool lucius began it is an ancient self levitation charm known by dark wizards what have you done with your wand lucius interrupted ron was going to say hermione but he then realized something that eased the pain in his arm a bit lucius must ve only seen ron from the opposite side of the stream hermione had caught some of the blast and was hiding amidst the grass please stay hidden ron willed silently yes my wand ron lied you must mean this although i thought it a mere twig lucius said holding up two thin short pieces of wood ron felt a horrible sinking feeling wash over him as lucius added i afraid these second hand items just donthold up as well as well the very best as another mocking chuckle erupted from lucius ron hastily knelt to the ground and snatched up the jagged rock that had broken his arm and fall and threw it as hard as he could toward lucius it missed as lucius moved swiftly to his left chuckling all the while look at how utterly useless you are without your wand weasley lucius laughed if only your muggle loving father were here to see you fight like a muggle how proud he would be clenching one fist tight at his side the other hanging limp and painful ron closed his eyes and used his anger to silently cast a powerful bludgeoning curse as ron opened his eyes he felt as if a water tap had been turned on for a brief second to let a bit of his anger ooze out as the curse hit lucius in his left shoulder lucius was sent sprawling unceremoniously into the cold water of the stream ron took this opportunity to look around for hermione she was still nowhere to be seen ron was preparing to dart for the trees in hopes to find hermione had made a run for it but his heart stopped beating as he saw lucius emerge soaking wet from the stream with a limp form in his arms thank you weasley lucius began you made the task of finding this mudblood much easier for me tell me though whose fool idea was it for her to hide in the below freezing temperatures of the water it will be such a pity if she dead i sure she had a slew of vital information we could have extracted from her possibly with one simple word crucio ron was blinded with the white hot pain coursing through him as he fell to the ground the only thing he could see was the blue tinted lips of hermione motionless form and the bloody wound on her forehead she must have fallen into the stream after the impediment curse burst them apart but she couldntbe dead how long was she in those frigid waters suddenly ron realized through the fiery pain in his nerves that someone was screaming was it hermione he was being stabbed by thousands of knives his internal organs felt like they were collapsing and someone was screaming himself ron couldnthear the screaming anymore and it was probably because his lungs did not have sufficient air he wanted to say let me die just kill me anything but this pain but he couldntform the words and then suddenly the pain ceased ron was panting gasping for breath as he stared up into the fog he couldntmove a figure was suddenly peering over him it was lucius and he was still holding hermione she was still unconscious is she dead ron asked breathlessly pushing himself up from the cold ground with his left arm his right was of no use to him at all unfortunately for her no lucius said with deathly calm ron felt a huge relief pour over him as he stood to face the death eater who aimed his wand at ron chest but you and she will both wish for death before the dark lord is through with you ron felt a sinking sensation in his stomach as he recalled that he had wished for death during the cruciatus curse he would not let hermione feel that pain ron thought of many adequate silent curses to throw at lucius but with hermione in lucius arms it was too risky suddenly however the death eater thrust hermione at him ron stumbled backward a bit and was forced to support her weight with one arm by leaning her against his chest before he could properly regain his balance he felt his knees buckle against his will as he fell to them in the mud ron still had his arm wrapped tightly around hermione waist but he wasntprepared to feel a thick rope wrap itself around the both of them like a snake squeezing the life out of its prey ron looked up at lucius who was smiling cruelly and lowering his wand apparently satisfied with the painful ropes he d conjured ron felt as if the ropes were cutting ridges into his skin but that pain was nothing compared to the burning of his right arm ron ron looked down at hermione pale face lying against his shoulder her eyelids were fluttering open to reveal the reddened whites of her eyes the look on her face as she gazed up at him told ron that she was also feeling the pain of the ropes tightening with their every move what is this ron asked through gasps and gritted teeth lucius looked as if he were fighting the urge to laugh the ropes will continue to tighten as long as you move so why dontyou just sit perfectly still the dark lord surely wants the privilege of killing both of you himself hermione dontstruggle alright ron whispered lowering his lips to her ear he felt her nod slightly against his cheek ron hoped his limbs shaking from anger wouldntcause the ropes to tighten more ron looked up at lucius with the intent of threatening the bastard only to find the death eater looking about himself nervously it was then that ron felt it the ground was quaking and ron could hear something thum thum thum thum there was an odd moment when ron and lucius locked gazes of confusion it was a brief moment however interrupted by a silhouette of a giant creature approaching through the fog from upstream finally lucius rasped approaching the wemic now standing tall and proud a few yards away i thought you dumb beasts would never come out of those damned trees the wemic didntrespond but approached ron and hermione huddled on the ground still bound by the painful ropes do younglings follow dark one the wemic asked what lucius asked his brows furrowed do they does it look like it although i suppose they re as good as his property after these words lucius began smoothing his robes and casting a drying spell upon them younglings do not follow dark one the wemic asked again apparently wanting a more direct answer lucius stopped his drying spell to look up at the creature with annoyance did i not just answer you fool these two foolishly oppose the dark lord therefore must be dealt with that is your job take them to the castle without being seen and lock them up then have another one of your beasts guard them the warrior nodded his head slowly in response but instead of grabbing ron he grabbed lucius wand with his saucer like hand and wrenched it free before tossing it to the ground lucius looked completely shocked and angry but before he could really react the wemic grabbed lucius by the collar of his robes he then pulled him off of his feet to eye level i follow chief egon and chief egon says followers of dark one are no longer welcomed in our home he gave order to protect non followers especially younglings the wemic then threw lucius to the ground like a toy lucius lay completely still his mouth open with the pain of having the air knocked from him the wemic reached up to his necklace pulling a small coiled shell from the rope ron watched as he tossed the shell at lucius form and a brown and black cage of stone and wood suddenly appeared around the man the ground then split apart under lucius consumed him and his cage and re closed leaving no trace that the earth had just swallowed a caged human hermione shaking from the cold and her shock at what she d just witnessed cleared her throat w what just happened earth will take him to wemic prison beneath trees the wemic said calmly a and your name the wemic peered down at her with one arched brow i am oryin son of marius and follower of egon he said calmly before taking one long claw of his front paw and slicing through the thick ropes surrounding her and ron hermione settled on the ground beside ron whose arm was still held tightly around her she would ve stood but wasntsure that she could if she tried her clothes were freezing and wet and the wound to her head was throbbing so badly it impaired her vision but egon is dead isnthe hermione asked holding one hand to her forehead he was thought to be dead by moritz oryin stated but egon defeated moritz after arising from cave oh that wonderful news hermione said with sincerity we need all the help we can get yes oryin began but i warn you wemics are gentle creatures by nature and only fight when we deem it completely necessary i know hermione admitted how could she push the beasts when they had done so much for her already hermione ron said suddenly rubbing one hand up and down her arm give me your wand we need to dry your clothes my wand but why do you need my wand hermione gasped one hand flying to her mouth as she stood up from the ground before she could reveal the frantic feelings boiling in her stomach at the loss of her wand she noticed something that made her stomach boil harder ron your arm dontworry ron stated firmly pushing himself up from the ground awkwardly with one hand dontworry hermione asked frantically approaching him and leaning down to inspect the oozing wound i can see the bone yes but we donthave time ron stated we need to find harry and i would like to have at least one wand between us while we search for him lucius broke mine so where your wand i i must have lost it in the stream when i fell unconscious hermione said feeling completely useless hadntshe caused enough trouble already ask stream to bring it back oryin said suddenly with a look of slight confusion on his face what ron asked ask stream to bring wand back oryin stated more slowly as if talking to someone with little or no sense when hermione and ron just looked at each other with blank expressions the wemic shook his head in apparent disappointment of two such ignorant people the wemic then walked slowly to the water edge and knelt on his two front legs he then removed a shell from his necklace of twine and with his tanned hands held it beneath the rippling waves of the stream while he did this he closed his feline eyes and hermione could ve sworn she heard something music it was a faint whispering sound like hundreds of tiny mermaids as hermione watched this strangely beautiful ritual she gasped as her wand began floating upstream against the current straight into the wemic hand oryin then rose from his kneeling position and approached hermione holding the wand out to her in the palm of his massive hand it truly looked like a tiny twig until hermione took her wand from the beast to hold it in her own small hand thank you oryin hermione said smiling up at the creature he merely nodded once in response hermione immediately began drying her damp robes as ron cleared his throat awkwardly shuffling one foot and my wand i dontsuppose my apologies oryin said i can not fix broken wand but i can tell you great scarred one and youngling of ginger hair are there oryin then pointed one finger across the stream and toward the castle wha how do you know that hermione asked your eyes do not see what mine see youngling oryin said as he turned toward the direction of the forest take care you must go now and with that he took off into the fog disappearing from sight almost instantly his massive steps falling silent on the marshy ground hermione stared after him for a moment before turning to ron and flinging her arms around his neck she knew she was giving mrs weasley a run for her money with this embrace but she was so tired cold and frightened ron put one arm around her but she felt him flinch and then tense up oh i sorry she whispered pulling away however she was pulled back into ron chest by his left arm while the other hung loosely by his side tears threatened to spill from hermione eyes at the sight of his wound she opened her mouth to insist that he let her tend to it as best she could before they continued but ron stilled her speech with his lips hermione had been so chilled for the last few hours the soft warmth of ron mouth on hers nearly burned when ron pulled away he kissed her once on the nose let go find harry and the rest so we can get out of here ron your arm it will only take a few minutes that may be a few more minutes than we have he replied with firmness hermione wanted to protest but at the eerie silence of the night she knew he was right so biting her lip hermione reached down for the hem of her robes found a tear by her right ankle and ripped a five inch wide strand of fabric off the entire base of her garment she then straightened looking up at ron with an apologetic frown by the semblance of a smile in his stressed blue eyes hermione knew he was following her thinking she then quickly crafted a temporary sling for his arm with a few creative ties and twists she had learned from professor sinistra she tried to be gentle although ron still flinched a few times from pain she then grabbed his hand and let him lead her a good ways downstream finally they approached the site of the duel that had taken place between harry ginny and the death eaters there was no one about but there were plenty of signs to give horrible hints at what took place the ground was singed in numerous places there were small craters and debris of stone wood and earth littering the ground in broad circles hermione felt too scared to move but ron hand tightened around hers as he took them a bit further downstream where they found a small bridge of about ten feet leading to the opposite bank or at least what used to be a bridge apparently some powerful spells had made it into a pile of firewood but with a quick reparo some of the holes were mended well enough for them to cross they crossed quickly hand in hand the fight had obviously continued over the bridge more singed earth and debris met them hermione felt as if she were walking in someone else nightmare a nightmare that continued to get worse a stifled gasp caught in hermione throat bringing ron to halt beside her on the ground a few yards ahead was a completely motionless robed figure it rastaban ron whispered he looks to be unconscious how can we be sure hermione asked her voice coming out in a squeak ron gave a brief shrug before releasing hermione hand approaching the body and giving it a quick kick in the side ronald hermione reprimanded yeah he out ron stated as if he hadntheard her he then took her wand from her fingers as she stared at him aghast conjuring some quick ropes ron made them to encircle the death eater just in case hermione asked smartly with a hint of a smile ron gave her a small wink staring down at rastaban form his cold pale face hermione shook her head at the fact that she and ron could joke a bit in front of such a site and in such a place why didntthey bind him you think ron asked as he grabbed hermione hand once more she noticed he didntoffer her her wand back but instead held onto it tightly in the hand of his broken arm they might not have had time hermione stated a scared feeling welling up inside of her again these feelings of fear seemed to come and go in this place sort of like the visible surroundings one minute she would see something or think she saw something the next minute it would be gone just as ron took a step in the direction of the castle pulling her along a bright red arch of light shot into the sky about thirty yards away before either of them could respond there was a similar arch of blue then a spark of black another arch this time green ron hermione gasped come on ron breathed pulling hermione through the fog he wasntgoing directly toward the fighting but he was swiftly leading them in an indirect path to the castle there were some trees coming into view it looked as though there were a few scattered to the right of the castle along with the jagged black rocks and some sparse brush ron pulled hermione quickly toward a particularly bushy circle of brush where they quickly ducked the castle loomed large in the distance at least forty yards away it took hermione a second to realize that the fog wasntnearly as dense around the castle as it was on the rest of the plateau of course the density of the fog was the last thing on hermione mind for there was a scene before them the likes of which she had never seen dumbledore his black robes billowing around his ankles was dueling and winning against seven death eaters bellatrix jugson mulciber rookwood goyle sr gregory goyle and draco crabbe sr and pettigrew were not present among them the shocking white of dumbledore beard made the surrounding fog gray before him he moved with speed and agility making every move seem effortless deadly curses were blocked like disarming curses thrown by third years massively powerful counter attacks were executed with one or two fluid motions of his wand or with no wand at all he levitated nearby rocks to use as projectiles while slinging stunning spells or conjuring shields seeing such power and grace flow from his every move brought tears of shock and amazement to hermione eyes he s beautiful hermione said more to herself than ron she then looked up at ron who was looking on the scene with furrowed brows where are the others ron asked with a graveness to his voice that sent a chill of worry over hermione everywhere bloody hell ron rasped as hermione grabbed at her heart and fell from her kneeling position to her bum on the wet ground harry hermione whispered her hand moving from her heart to her mouth ginny she squealed under her breath hermione wrapped her arms around her two friends that had suddenly appeared kneeling behind her and ron what if we had been death eaters you two are in a trance ginny scolded moving from hermione to give her brother a swift hug she then sat down in the grass with hermione before muttering protegotudo which cast an invisible shield around the four of them to deflect any stray spells from the continuing duel before them we re sorry it just that oh never mind ginny said quickly where have ya ll been lupin sort of sent us on a mission to stop lucius from recruiting help from the wemics hermione offered well harry asked his brow furrowed hermione saw that there was a bright green glint to his eyes the wemics are on our side and lucius is locked in their dungeons hermione assured placing one hand on harry shoulder before turning to ginny but it was so awful ron arm has been ginny your arm hermione put a hand to her mouth again at the sight of ginny cut ginny quickly covered it with one hand but not before hermione had seen the blood dontfuss hermione she said with a slight eye roll ginny you shouldntbe in the middle of all this hermione said harshly you should be hiding well what exactly do you call this hermione ginny asked motioning to the surrounding bushes before knocking lightly on the invisible shield she d conjured which made a soft bom bom noise hermione simply shook her head i knew that stitching wouldntlast she mumbled oh really you sound like mum ginny replied bloody hell you two ron said suddenly gaining a look of understanding and agreement from harry we re sitting in front of voldemort castle watching dumbledore row with half a dozen ninnies do we have some sort of plan i tried to help him but he knocked me out of the way with a stunner harry grumbled staring after dumbledore haventyou had enough fighting for one day ginny asked smoothing the hair off harry forehead she then looked at hermione and ron bellatrix and harry immediately began dueling back over the stream it was amazing he used curses i never knew existed i think he almost forgot about her having a baby i didntforget harry said firmly i would never harm an innocent child rastaban was there too of course ginny continued i kept him at bay while harry and bellatrix fight started getting out of hand with me there the idea of me being hurt gave him a bit more motivation if you know what i mean bellatrix actually retreated but we couldnttrack her immediately because there was rastaban to deal with which honestly wasntthat difficult the idiot called me something foul and before i took a breath harry had hit him with a curse so powerful rastaban fell to the ground like a stone bellatrix was barely visible at that point so we hiked up our robes and ran after her and what of lupin have you seen him hermione asked quickly hermione noticed a short glance pass between ginny and harry before ginny continued someone hit him with a curse that was eating the muscles and tendons in his legs hermione it was horrible he was pulling himself along the ground to get to someone for help mad eye kingsley and whitman took him to hogwarts and were supposed to come right back with reinforcements at that the thing is that was nearly half an hour ago and no one seen sight of them harry thinks voldemort has put a charm on the island which wontlet anyone in luckily harry said it not in his power to keep us from leaving oh no hermione breathed a sick feeling coming over her she glanced up to see how dumbledore was holding out he was still slinging curses left and right but unless it was hermione imagination he didntseem to be moving as swiftly as before if he d only harry began but he shook his head angrily running his hands through his unruly black hair if he d only what ginny asked rubbing a hand over his back he cantkeep going like this if he d just let me help harry began it bad enough that the lot of them think i over here hiding on my own accord but actually being forced to hide while i watch him grow weaker so he wontlet you near him ron asked didnti say he stunned me harry shot back angrily before looking down at his hands sorry mate i just going spare sitting here like this dumbledore knows what he doing hermione assured i sure he hermione ron prompted at her sudden silence hermione couldntspeak however the words she d been about to utter were stuck in her throat along with the scream that wanted to escape emerging from the side of the castle around a few scattered trees that outlined the jagged mountains in the distance hermione saw seven black scaled snakes slithering along the ground toward the duel it is time bellatrix voice rang out loud and shrill in the midst of all the fighting as if stealing the glory from hermione suppressed scream hermione stomach tightened around a small central core of fear as the creatures began to rear back their slick black heads the tops of which shone green two red slitted eyes were alight on each face they continued to rise on their bellies until they reached a height of seven or eight feet at which time hermione saw that the base of each snake was joined at the center of the hideous creature there were seven heads not seven snakes it was a hydra it seemed as if time stopped as everyone stared at the creature nothing moved save the rolling of the fog along the ground and the seven bright red tongues of the hydra darting in and out of its mouths in a grotesque rhythm even dumbledore had stopped to stare at the creature suddenly however the hydra dropped to its belly and began slithering along the ground toward dumbledore the wizard stood to his full height and with a rapid sweep of his arm cast a spherical mushroom spell that blasted out from his wand in a wave of blue and green quickly sending all the death eaters to the ground dumbledore then turned around on his heel and faced the approaching hydra but to hermione horror he turned too late or so she thought four of the seven heads struck out viciously toward dumbledore and they should have come in contact with the wizard in fact hermione found herself blinking her eyes furiously in hopes of focusing her failing eyesight but her eyesight wasntfailing dumbledore had disappeared in a cluster of red flames leaving the hydra recovering from its sprawled position on the ground where he had been standing seconds earlier no ginny screamed shooting up from the ground and voicing the fear in hermione chest harry grabbed ginny and pulled her back down beside him covering her mouth with one of his hands the hydra had heard them however its heads had shot up for a split second after ginny scream and they were now inches from the ground as it began slithering straight for them before hermione had time to stand and run or even catch her breath ron clutched her hand tightly and motioned for her to look above them she then noticed that ginny and harry were looking up with their mouths hanging slightly open glancing upward she saw it a phoenix a beautiful phoenix circling them overhead with feathers as bright as fawkes but a wingspan nearly twice the size the phoenix circled them one graceful time singing its beautiful song before it flapped its red and golden wings sending a rain of red sparks down upon them hermione immediate reaction was to cover her face with her hands but when she felt nothing fall upon her she looked up to see that the invisible dome of protection that ginny had conjured was now glowing faintly red with added strength the hydra had now stopped its charge upon them and was positioned about ten feet from them its fangs showing in many of its heads as it stretched to its seven foot height the phoenix however was simply hovering above the dome its tail feathers seemingly shining in the moonlight it him harry whispered two fingers pinching the bridge of his nose beneath his glasses dumbledore hermione nodded amazed that any wizard could have the animagus of a phoenix she then looked up to harry and noticed something that caused a knot to form in her stomach he was still pinching his nose with his fingers yet his eyes were peering out from underneath his brow and staring at the hydra not the phoenix there were three wizards in the entire world that had magical animagi that what dumbledore had said harry was a pegasus dumbledore was a phoenix and now as hermione looked at the hydra slithering around on the ground with its many red eyes she knew without warning the snake let out a hiss before lunging for the phoenix dumbledore was quick however he dived to the right of the snake missing being bitten by a few inches the snake continued to take lunging bites for dumbledore who continued to dodge clawing and biting with his sharp talons and beak when possible everything was happening so fast each creature was so graceful in its own way that they barely made any noise at all as they fought but then a beautiful but heartrending note filled the air as the phoenix fell to the ground one of the heads had managed to sink its fangs into the base of dumbledore left wing as soon as the bird touched ground a cluster of flames enveloped it and it immediately transformed into the unconscious form of dumbledore hermione stood with wide eyes staring at dumbledore crumpled form on the ground it wasntuntil she felt ron strong arm around her that she realized she had nearly fainted hermione what do you know of hydra bites harry asked fiercely grabbing her arm she looked up at his watery green eyes before shaking her head he s he dead harry hermione whispered as the hydra began turning to its true form she knew from her studies that nothing could save a person bitten by the venomous fangs of a hydra harry continued to stare at her in horror and disbelief but hermione eyes were now glued to the creature slowly writhing on the ground black scales morphed into a black cloak the thick body split into two human legs while the heads began molding into a torso and arms in seconds voldemort was lying beside the dead body of dumbledore hermione was still slumped against ron good arm but as she regained her footing she realized that she wasntthe only one recovering the death eaters across the grounds were standing up brushing themselves off and looking around as if they didntknow where they were it was then that hermione realized the powerful stunning spell dumbledore had cast earlier was not in effect now that he was dead and neither was the dome of protection the four teenagers had been hiding beneath in the bushes as hermione stared at voldemort who was just losing the last of his scales she heard a high pitched scraping sound turning to the source of the sound she saw that harry had just raised his pant leg and removed a dagger from a small sheath secured about his calf hermione recognized the weapon at once it was the dagger from grimmauld place harry is that ron began but harry didntbother answering in fact he had started running toward voldemort form before the broken words had left ron mouth harry no ginny screamed running after him hermione and ron emerged from the brush as well they ran a few steps forward and ron reaching out his good arm grabbed ginny around the waist let me go ron she screamed but her brother stayed his ground as harry cast a red stunning spell on voldemort before the dark wizard had even stood from the ground beside dumbledore voldemort let out a low grunt and faltered for a mere second but this was the only second harry needed to lunge for him plunging the dagger into voldemort chest voldemort black eyes went huge as gasps erupted from his nearby followers no bellatrix shrieked sending a curse flying from her wand toward harry to hermione amazement however voldemort waved his wand in front of harry who was still clutching the dagger that remained in voldemort chest and deflected the curse no one touches this boy voldemort hissed toward his followers take care of the others but leave him to me with this he grabbed the handle of the dagger from harry pulling it from his own chest as he pushed a startled harry to the ground where he landed half on top of dumbledore body as voldemort stared down at the confounded harry a hideous laughter began to erupt from him a laugh that conveyed the fact that he was feeling no pain the knife had left no mark there was no blood none on the knife none on his chest lumen contego ron suddenly shouted using hermione wand and shoving hermione and ginny behind him slightly as a slew of spells belted the shimmering shield surrounding the three of them the death eaters were shouting spell after spell all the while taking steps toward them hermione knew that they would have loved to attack harry but at their master command they were instead taking care of the others ginny was helping to reinforce the shield with a similar shield charm but hermione took notice of the dimming of the shield with each curse contacting it hermione could still see voldemort standing over harry with the dagger in one hand and his wand in the other it looked as if he were holding harry to the ground with some sort of spell hermione i ve got to go to him ginny shouted suddenly her wand hand shaking and her cut bleeding red blood down her arm and torn sleeve no ginny ron said firmly hermione you ll have to cast a wandless shield charm alright ginny asked shakily ignoring her brother ginny no hermione said you ll never reach him before you attract the fire of the death eaters wait suddenly all fire stopped voldemort harsh command cut through the air and fog ron hermione and ginny were hunched under what remained of the shield charm while the death eaters stood staring in confusion at their leader harry was lying completely still on the ground beside dumbledore as voldemort held one pale long fingered hand above him his wand and dagger were clutched in his other hand i ve changed my mind voldemort said with great calm a slight smile at the corners of his thin mouth he slowly wetted his lips with his bright red tongue his black eyes twinkling yes my lord mulciber asked i can see by the look on their faces that our guests are uncomfortable voldemort replied i think they would much rather enjoy watching me kill their friend and if not i believe i ll entertain the idea of an audience after all i ve waited so long for this moment ron arm went slightly limp to his side as the shield dissipated and he stood gasping for breath hermione threw her arm around his waist as he continued to catch his breath he had held a shield strong enough to deflect a rain of death eaters curses for a period of time much longer than hermione could have managed so what should we do my lord jugson asked a wrinkle between his bushy eyebrows what should you do voldemort asked the semblance of a smile leaving his mouth you you my followers who could not manage to defeat one man with all of your powers united as he shouted this into the cold night he kicked his foot out to impact with dumbledore unmoving form the old wizard body shuffled with the blow before going sickeningly limp once more voldemort blew out a puff of angry air before pointing his wand at ron hermione and ginny and shouting funis morsus three lengths of ropes shot forth from his wand and encircled each of them hermione gasped as she and ron were somehow forced apart and made to stand shoulder to shoulder along with ginny hermione instinctively tried to jerk free but soon discovered these ropes to be similar to those lucius had encircled her and ron with earlier with every movement they tightened she could hear ron grunting in pain as the ropes surely tightened around his fractured bone now voldemort shouted lifting his hand to the air apparently releasing harry from his hold harry began gasping for air and clutching at his chest as voldemort laughed the three of you will watch as your friend dies here tonight voldemort said before turning his eyes upon his death eaters and you lower your wands stand back you will watch as i begin a new era for the wizarding world hermione could only think one thought as she looked from dumbledore crumpled body on the ground to the by standing death eaters to herself ron and ginny wrapped tightly in thick brown ropes the prophecy hermione saw the events of the evening flash through her mind as if thumbing through a picture book and each picture each event suddenly seemed to hermione to be an inevitable page in the fore destined book of harry life how was it that a horde of death eaters and a crew of order members could gather in a duel and in an hour be reduced to the two people the wizarding world feared and loved more than any others so you admit my life is worth something do you harry asked between pants suddenly pushing himself up from the ground and raising his wand to point at voldemort voldemort maddened smile left his face as quickly as the feeling of dread went from hermione stomach to her throat voldemort and harry took a couple of steps away from each other each holding their wand on the other slowly voldemort smile began to return what is it harry voldemort asked one thin black eyebrow raised you have some parting words for us you seem to think if you kill me tonight a new era will begin harry said standing up a bit taller with each word that putting a fairly big price on my head wouldntyou say harry everything in this world has a price a worth voldemort said now beginning to circle harry slowly and every person in this world puts a different amount of worth on each thing for example voldemort stopped to peer down at dumbledore form this wizard was of some worth to you for whatever reason probably because he made you believe you yourself had true worth but nonetheless the fact remains that to me he is or shall i say was worthless then why did you fear him harry asked i never feared albus dumbledore voldemort shouted causing hermione to jerk slightly which made the ropes tighten a bit more he was a stupid fool living his life by ideals that could never be you live by those same ideals as do many others which is why your death will start a new era with you alive the people that see worth in your blood the people that hold their hopes in you will have no more hopes harry actually scoffed at this and shook his head slightly you know you told me once that you valued bravery so why are you so scared of dying voldemort continued to stare at harry but he said nothing death is the end of life but it not the worst of life harry went on and you know it what are you talking about potter voldemort asked through gritted teeth is this your way of stalling me i ve felt sadness so great that i ve almost wished for death harry said slowly so have you you dontwant to kill me to crush other people hopes you want to kill me to crush your own fear you honestly think i lord voldemort fear you voldemort asked with squinted black eyes no and yes harry said you re a stronger wizard than me but from the very first time we met sixteen years ago you ve had a fear of me you didntfear an infant and you may not fear what you see before you now but you fear what i will become hermione was almost sure she could hear the very breath of everyone on the grounds staring at the two men facing one another in the midst of them all she caught a glimpse of draco with a strange pensive stare on his pale face the silence was so great and the power of voldemort black eyes boring into the green irises of harry sent a shiver down hermione spine so great she thought she felt the ropes tighten once more you think you know much about this world when in truth you know so little voldemort said beginning to pace once more keeping his wand on harry he lifted the dagger in his hands and peered at it thoughtfully just as you thought you had found some worth in this dagger did you go searching the black family heirlooms or was it given to you hmm by sirius was it a token left to you before or after he died does it hold fond memories for you stop your grieving harry it no different than fear what are you talking about harry asked swallowing hard dontyou wonder why it drew no blood from me voldemort asked harry said nothing but hermione knew he was at least as curious as her about the weapon i afraid this dagger was a token to regulus voldemort began a gift from me it holds no power against dark wizards however a cold sweat had begun to bead on hermione forehead and it just so happened that one tiny bead had rolled down from her hairline to rest on an eyelash before hermione could blink the droplet away voldemort disappeared teleporting himself to stand inches in front of harry with one quick sweep of his arm voldemort slashed across harry chest with the dagger sending a spray of blood into the air to fall in small drops on the wet ground hermione gasped as harry let out a low yell falling to the ground on his back a thirteen inch gash on his chest visible through the torn front of harry robes harry ron shouted over ginny wailing with another slash of his wand voldemort released ginny from her ropes she fell to the ground in a heap of sobs but quickly pushed herself up and ran to harry side ron was now grunting in slight pain as his relentless jerking to free himself had only caused him to be restricted more by the magical ropes tears of fear hopelessness and helplessness were running down hermione cheeks as ginny lay over harry sobbing uncontrollably harry was gasping for each quick and shallow breath he drew and a faint line of blood was running down his chin from the corner of his mouth hermione glanced to ron for some sign that everything would be okay only to see tears streaming down ron face as well a slow laugh began to spill from voldemort lips as he stared down at harry and ginny lying only feet from dumbledore lifeless form oh the irony it too much harry voldemort said between laughs the poor population of witches will rest easier after tonight young ginny will be the last of them to die protecting you too bad she hasntthe blood of you harry you wontbe so lucky this time no harry shouted suddenly hermione blinked away her stubborn tears to try and see clearly she couldntwipe them away with her hands which were pressed to her sides under the ropes she would simply have to look on blurrily as harry stood from the ground shoving ginny behind him although hermione was watching the scene through blurred vision she could see the bright green light glowing brighter and brighter emanating from harry eyes no not just his eyes his entire form a bright green blazing light of raw power was erupting around harry voldemort was taking steps backward his wand still raised and pointed at harry the death eaters were more or less running backward and ginny was refusing to stand behind harry she was instead standing to the side of him screaming his name over and over her hair blowing around her face like long red flames the green light seemed to be piercing through the fog now hermione could clearly see the castle the trees and the surrounding mountains then she saw it harry vision ginny was standing there outlined by the jagged black mountains in the background her arms out to her sides one bloody tears streaming down her face as she screamed harry name hermione briefly wondered why voldemort wasntdoing anything at all only to realize that he was he was shooting curse after curse at harry as were the death eaters but the lights from their wands simply dispelled at the first contact with harry radiating green light suddenly the ropes that were encircling hermione and ron keeping them standing upright disappeared and sent them sprawling to the ground it was then without the support of the ropes that hermione felt the gusts of power pouring from harry like heat she crawled to ron who was waiting on the ground with one arm outstretched for her the other arm still held by the torn piece of hermione robes which were now soaked with blood he immediately wrapped his arm about her as they remained crouched to the ground as the light from harry grew hermione could no longer see ginny or the death eaters or voldemort she had to turn her gaze away from them away from the castle she buried her cheek into ron shoulder and peered out to the east coast of the island the fog seemed to be completely gone from the place and a warmth was settling upon her just before the flames shot across the peninsula in a wide circle of power hermione caught a glimpse of something shining on the horizon something beautiful gold and red it was the sun the night had passed and the sun was rising hermione felt a surge of peace fall over her as the green light blocked her view of the sun and plunged her into complete and utter darkness author note please remember to review on this last chapter dontfret about the ending the epilogue will leave you fully informed i

young wizard who has been dubbed such names as the boy who lived and the chosen one discovered the location of and fought in a duel with you know who on may 28 harry potter traveled by broom to a small island in the north sea he claims to have had a dream in which the voice of his dead mother lily potter murdered by you know who told him the location of his arch nemesis the island of fohr of the northern frisian islands to the north of germany is a small island of approximately thirty two square miles the muggle population is a mere 4500 while the wizarding population was recorded at 0 fohr is the only known inhabitation of wemics magical liontaurs with astounding earth magic abilities wemics inhabit the northeastern forests of the island and the muggles actually avoid these forests for fear of legendary hauntings overall muggles could not ask for a more quiet and peaceful town primarily made up of fishermen and sailors yet these muggles along with the majority of the wizarding world are oblivious to the fact that this island is the location of the mysterious slytherin school of magic he who must not be named locality yes after nearly a year of wizarding authorities searching for you know who and his followers harry potter found them in one heroic night many in the wizarding world have had their suspicions about the so called slytherin school of magic minister of magic amelia bones once suggested bellatrix lestrange known death eater and escapee of azkaban to be the headmistress many students of hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry did not return for this school year and were instead enrolled in the new and unanticipated school yet until now no one knew its whereabouts or any relevant information of the establishment the four hundred forty miles separating hogwarts from fohr was not enough to deter potter from secretly leaving school to confront you know who he flew the long course by broomstick arriving to the island tired but not daunted where he was immediately confronted by death eater antonin dolohov and hogwart student vincent crabbe potter was left with no choice but to defend his life until the death of the two men dolohov had a history of dark magic use and illegal acts against wizards and witches crabbe however was simply a hogwarts student in the house of slytherin it is believed that crabbe along with students draco malfoy and gregory goyle left hogwarts and followed potter to the island these three hogwarts students are now known to have been spies for you know who after dueling with dolohov and crabbe potter reportedly located a large castle which he discovered to be the slytherin school of magic the slytherin school was conceptualized and founded by you know who himself the school was created not only as a hideout for he who must not be named and his death eaters but also as a school of the dark arts for students supporting the man they call their dark lord potter presence outside the castle was soon detected astonishingly potter headmaster albus dumbledore had followed him to the island fortunately for the duo the slytherin school students had already left for their homes on holiday nonetheless the two were soon surrounded by you know who followers a massive duel reportedly ensued in which dumbledore was severely injured at that moment you know who himself confronted potter for a one on one battle little details are known of the actual duel yet somehow potter was able to intimidate you know who and his death eaters into fleeing the scene potter and his injured headmaster were able to return to hogwarts after their adventure they immediately contacted five wand auror alastor moody who then contacted the london and scotland auror departments moody and hogwarts faculty member severus snape accompanied the lad and sad to the island for a post incident inspection when asked for details of the search moody replied we enlisted a few wemics to help us search the grounds castle and caves after potter attack you know who and his death eaters apparated inside the castle some had already escaped but many were captured by the lad and sad and sent to the uk ministry of magic there they will be registered profiled and sent to azkaban severus snape gave the names of those captured gregory goyle sr gregory goyle jr deimos jugson vulcan mulciber rastaban lestrange and lucius malfoy some however were unaccounted for bellatrix lestrange draco malfoy peter pettigrew augustus rookwood and you know who after the inspection of the lad and sad the german chancellor of magic ludwig von bremen was notified of the activity on the island of fohr bremen was fully cooperative with the united kingdom ministry of magic by decree of the uk and german ministries the castle concealed by the fidelius charm will undergo a routine demolition after being properly searched by ministry officials from the department of magical law enforcement the school crest or blazon as discovered on a collection of school robes found inside the castle is a silver serpent on a green field this crest is identical to that of the slytherin blazon at hogwarts throughout the castle there can also be found various sculptures and engravings of snakes dark wizards of the past and the dark mark gentleman wizards and lady witches hold onto your hopes of brighter days and an end to this war in the coming days remember that the darkest wizard of all time fled from a duel with sixteen year old harry potter story by natalie pry dumbledore laid the paper down atop his large wooden desk and smoothed out the creases to look at the picture once more in front of a jagged outcropping of rocks alastor and severus were standing amid ten uniformed aurors none of them were waving or even smiling but there was a young auror in the back row looking all about the picture with wide and awestruck eyes perhaps miss pry had received her slightly slanted version of the truth from that young man perhaps not perhaps it best that the wizarding world did not know that harry had left hogwarts not because of a dream but because of a kidnapped friend a student how did this happen fawkes dumbledore asked with a sigh looking up from the photograph and peering at his pet perched quietly on its stand the bird twisted its head from one side to the other its round and glossy black eyes staring dumbledore reached up to stroke the neck of his feathered friend but jerked his arm away when he felt the stinging pain in his shoulder he flexed his fingers and laid his hand in his lap if he hadntbeen in his animagus form he wouldntbe sitting in his warm office the fire roaring how would things have turned out if he hadntbeen injured would voldemort have still escaped dumbledore stood from his leather armchair circled his desk and began pacing the floor alastor had informed him of the details once he had regained consciousness from the hydra bite dumbledore paced his way over to his black cabinet and opened it to reveal a rune covered shallow stone basin removing his wand dumbledore lightly touched the tip of it to the silvery swirls lighting the contents of the pensieve within seconds a miniature alastor arose and began to speak excitedly albus whitman thinks it was fate shacklebolt says luck i dontknow what the hell it was but i know that just before voldemort and those death eaters apparated we got the portkey to working it took us to a spot on the other side of that river there was no fog we saw the end of the battle if you can call it a battle i dontknow what you call a bunch of advanced dark wizards shooting curses at a young boy and not leaving one mark harry had a green aura about him and he d managed to form a shield around granger and the weasley kids but just before this massive radial blast erupted from the boy every one of those damned cods apparated i sent shacklebolt and whitman to gathering you and the kids and getting you out of there they took you straight to pomfrey i on the other hand stayed with the lad and sad and severus of course severus and i agreed that he should just stay back and watch so the death eaters would think he was still playing a role and spying on us but the rest of us hah well albus i must admit i enjoyed ransacking that bloody place dumbledore stood back from the pensieve and tapped the edge of his basin sending the tiny alastor back into the silvery mist though he had reviewed alastor words numerous times he couldntstay seated behind his desk long before he found himself walking over to his black cabinet amid his bookshelves there was little else to do while he waited for harry to regain consciousness from the blast except reread the daily prophet article but the half truth of the story only mildly bothered dumbledore making him antsier for harry arrival it had been over twenty four hours now and poppy had sent word just moments earlier that harry had awoken dumbledore had sent a copy of the prophet article to the infirmary for harry to read along with an order to send harry straight to his office when he was able just as dumbledore was about to review some of his memories of the night at fohr there was a soft knocking at his office door come in harry he called closing the black cabinet doors and making his way to his desk as he rounded his desk and took his seat the door creaked open and harry emerged he was wearing school robes his hair was clean and his few scratches and scrapes appeared to be healing although he was a bit pale he looked well dumbledore offered him a small smile and nodded toward one of the chairs opposite him take a seat please harry dumbledore said i believe we have much to discuss harry nodded a bit solemnly and mumbled yes sir did you read the article i sent you yes sir i sorry about the fabrication dumbledore said sincerely alastor nor severus gave any false information to the reporter i believe one of the young aurors from the lad or sad must have given an interview it alright harry said with a shrug hermione ron and ginny read it with me in the infirmary i think hermione was glad that she wasntincluded in the story i understand dumbledore replied with a nod and i was just glad to see that you weren t harry paused with a worried look on his face well dead dumbledore couldnthelp a small chuckle well harry i appreciate your concern luckily i had the healing powers of a phoenix in my blood at the time of the bite yeah that what hermione reckoned allowed you to survive harry replied with a nod before his face suddenly fell i just yes harry i just wish they hadntmade me out to be this big hero harry said looking to the floor i no braver than ron or hermione or ginny i may be a bit stronger but i ve had more training and and the magic burst on the island that wasntheroics no dumbledore prompted no harry said with a shake of his head voldemort was going to kill her kill ginny i saw the fear in her eyes and and i felt as if i werentonly seeing ginny but my mum too that must have been the look voldemort saw in my mother eyes before he killed her once i realized that i i almost lost control almost dumbledore found himself resisting the urge to lean forward like a schoolboy to listen to the tale this of course was new to his ears well i could feel the power welling up inside of me but i was afraid if i just started blasting voldemort he would somehow get to ginny so i created a shield from my powers and covered her ron hermione and myself then voldemort and the death eaters started shooting curses at me once i saw that i had control of my power i decided to use the shield energy to form a radial blast i could see voldemort taking steps back from me i knew i had to act fast so i did but then that all i remember harry i dontknow what you consider a hero to be dumbledore began i myself think a hero is different for everyone but regardless you left the security of hogwarts to help one of your friends you showed true courage and bravery and i thank you harry looked up with a slightly surprised expression sir i i actually expected you would be furious at me for leaving oh i was dumbledore replied in honesty at first i was quite angry but i realized you had done what your heart told you and well i canthold that against you dumbledore saw a semblance of a smile on harry lips for a brief moment before a darkness fell over his countenance like a storm cloud harry dumbledore began but harry stopped him with a desperate look in his eyes i didntkill him voldemort is still alive harry exclaimed his voice growing slightly with each word i have the ability i know that now yet the bastard is still out there somewhere harry fretfully ran his hand through his hair as he ended harry what is ability without opportunity dumbledore asked softly harry eyes went wide but i had the opportunity he was right there harry exclaimed gesturing before him with his hand if i d just acted sooner or harry he chose to run dumbledore began something i ve only known him to do when faced with one other wizard but he was face to face with you and he chose to run good choice in my opinion headmaster everard exclaimed unexpectedly from his frame on the wall dumbledore looked up to the sallow faced wizard with the short black whiskers on his chin a few other portraits murmured their accord perchance dumbledore said thoughtfully before returning his gaze to harry who was looking at everard with a raised eyebrow but then again he saved himself by running and what sort of life does that leave him to lead harry looked at dumbledore with furrowed brows what do you mean he asked what sort of life is it dumbledore inclined his head to one side harry features were not childlike anymore yet his eyes somehow held some boyhood innocence as he looked into the boy eyes dumbledore gave a deliberately shrewd smile there was really no doubt in his mind what the outcome of the prophecy would be one day what i mean harry dumbledore began is that voldemort is now simply living to die another day ron looked around the vast chamber of the great hall with a completely surreal feeling moving about in his stomach from the two huge wooden doors allowing the entrance of student after student to the high table full of faculty to the starry ceiling and floating candles over each table ron felt as though he would soon wake up from a dream had it already been three days since ron and harry had left hogwarts for the island of fohr was hermione really sitting beside him on the wooden benches of the gryffindor house table her hand in his after the blast from harry all four teenagers had been sent into mild comas oddly enough they awoke within minutes of each other two days after the incident ron hermione and ginny were allowed to rest in the quiet of the infirmary along with tonks and lupin still healing from their injuries but harry was immediately summoned to dumbledore office not surprisingly after harry returned to the infirmary from his talk with dumbledore he informed everyone of their talk ron wasntsurprised that dumbledore had decided to end the school year early this term word traveled fast as it always did in the wizarding world and the daily prophet article had already provoked mixed feelings of fear and hope throughout the students and apparently their parents dumbledore was receiving owl after owl from parent after parent some wanted their children to be sent home for fear that voldemort and his death eaters would be on their way to wherever harry potter was others wanted their children home for fear that there were more voldemort spies within the walls of hogwarts and still others wanted their children home due to anger at dumbledore for allowing multiple students to sneak out of hogwarts undetected from what harry had said dumbledore didntseem too upset about sending the students home early harry said their headmaster actually seemed eager to be done with it so that he and the order could begin future plans canceled exams spread a layer of relief over ron as canceled quidditch finals spread a layer of disappointment although to ron delight word had been sent to the house elves to fix the end of terms feast early they were of course only too happy to oblige the tables however werentfull of mouth watering morsels yet and the small meal of vegetable soup madam pomfrey had supplied them with upon waking had not even begun to cease the growling of ron stomach but dumbledore first had to give his term closing speech ron suddenly heard a rumbling of a stomach but it wasnthis own he turned to hermione who had grabbed her stomach with one hand she looked up at him and smiled shyly clad in a light pink sweater jeans and a new gryffindor robe with little more than a few scratches on her beautifully clean face her hair was washed and falling around her shoulders in thick brown curls when ron had first awoken in the hospital bed he had felt as heavy and unbalanced as a sack of potatoes he had jumped out of bed nearly falling over lupin in the bed next to his he had been on the verge of screaming where is she but then hermione had emerged from the green privacy curtains around her own bed it was at that moment that ron realized it was truly over they were back at hogwarts everyone was safe even after he hermione ginny and harry had read the paper to see that voldemort had not been killed and that bellatrix draco pettigrew and rookwood were still free ron couldntsuppress the light feeling in his heart he knew however that this wasntthe case with harry the fact that he had almost had voldemort but failed was eating away at him like a sickness ron looked up at his friend across from him he was staring at the top of the table with a dazed look in his eyes ginny was staring at him and biting her fingernails worriedly she wasntthe only one staring at him either in fact it would be easier to point out the students in the great hall that werentstaring at harry and as ron looked about at all of their faces he was pleased to see that nearly all were wearing expressions of awe and appreciation they were looking at harry as if looking into the future and seeing an end to the war come on harry ginny coaxed laying her head on his shoulder with a sigh look on the bright side of things at least dumbledore has agreed to let you ditch the dursleys this summer you ron and i can play quidditch until until our ears bleed what ron asked looking at his sister with one eyebrow raised she rolled her eyes at him and ron thought he saw a small smirk cross harry face but it quickly disappeared hermione must have seen it too because she decided to jump in on the topic to keep it going i so jealous hermione began with a slight frown you three will be having loads of fun without me hermione you ll just be one fireplace away from us dontforget harry said matter of factly i guess that true hermione nodded it is true ron exclaimed how much snogging between those two do you think i can stomach before i go mad believe me i ll be flooing over quite frequently did you hear that hermione ginny asked with mock alarm ronald will only visit you when he tired of us that not what i meant ron retorted with an eye roll of his own dontworry hermione said shooting ron a teasing look i know he cantlive without me honestly am i that see through ron asked hermione chuckled a bit yes you are ginny answered with a smile almost as see through as neville harry said suddenly a surprised smile lighting his face ron hermione and ginny all glanced down the table to see neville sitting beside a girl whose face was hidden behind a copy of a newspaper his eyes were alight as he talked to the girl with what was astonishingly but unmistakably confidence just as ron was about to ask who the girl was ginny and hermione both gasped as luna protuberant eyes peeked up at neville from over the top of her newspaper which ron now recognized as the quibbler okay now i ve really seen everything ginny said as luna stood to go to her own table waving dreamily at neville as she left all four of them had to refrain from looking at one another for fear of bursting out laughing as neville smiled into space a look that much resembled the expression luna wore most of the time ron was pleased to see that harry remembered how to smile for one it obviously meant that harry had some happiness in him still but it also gave ron hope that although the four of them were growing up quickly no war no dark wizards no evil could take away their spirit suddenly a wave of quiet began to wash over the room table by table after a poke on the arm by hermione ron looked up to the front of the room to see dumbledore standing to speak there was a brief rustling of students turning on their benches to better see the headmaster but then a stony silence fell over the hall good evening everyone young students of gryffindor hufflepuff ravenclaw and slytherin our term is coming to an end we began this year with fewer students than ever before and we end with fewer still now after a recent turn of events we know why our numbers are fewer in the years before many of you were born and before any of you can remember voldemort sought to rule over the hearts of wizards and witches through fear unfortunately in this second war he has managed to win a throng of new young followers some of which were living right under our noses all year now i ask that everyone look around you look at your neighbor look at your friends look at your fellow students of hogwarts that choose not to follow voldemort and know that now more than ever the things that matter most in life are the people you love if you know that than you already know much more than the students that chose to leave this school there are those who walk with open eyes and those who walk with their eyes closed it is behind closed eyes where neither good nor evil can be seen so i tell you all open your eyes but open them wide enough to see both good and bad if you learn to see the world with open eyes i warn you that you will see evil so hideous that you will have to look away but you will also see good so beautiful that you cannot look away and when you see that goodness when you truly see it you will also see that no magic has true power over the heart at this there was a slow progression of applause dumbledore simply bowed his head before clapping his hands together lightly and taking his seat immediately warm plates of food appeared on every table mountains of bread and pudding cakes and candies meats and cheeses ron heard another stomach growl and this time it was definately his neither he nor anyone else for that matter hesitated in filling their plates and enjoying their last meal of the term as they ate several people from all houses approached harry and either congratulated him or thanked him for his heroic actions on the island of fohr harry gave ron multiple apologetic smiles as he modestly accepted their praise ron had told harry earlier that day that it would be best for everyone if they all pretended that the article was completely accurate with everyone believing harry had left the safety of hogwarts to track downvoldemort there was definately an overall feeling of hope in the air and ron honestly didntmind that no one knew of his own heroics hermione was safe and that was all that mattered to him ron glanced over at hermione to see her biting into a roll smiling he leaned over and kissed her on the cheek i love you hermione he whispered in her ear she turned to him with a smile and after swallowing her bite of food mouthed the words i love you too they then began to gaze at one another but were rudely interrupted by four letters falling from the sky ron looked up to see a brown school owl flying away from their around the room he saw that several owls were delivering last minute packages to students returning his gaze to the four letters on the table ron saw that one of them bore his name while the others each held a name of harry ginny and hermione ron exchanged shrugs with harry as they each reached for theirs the girls followed all four of them ripped into their letters oh my word hermione breathed i know ginny squealed i wasntexpecting the wedding to be so soon ron read through the wedding invitation from fred and angelina shaking his head um does everyone else invitation have the burrow written beside place of ceremony that what mine says harry said with a smile this ll be great yeah ron agreed as long as the burrow is not also the place of the honeymoon oh good grief ginny sighed surely not oh wow hermione exclaimed suddenly did you guys see the picture on the back of the invitations ron shook his head before snatching his invitation back off the table and turning it over at first glance it appeared to be a charming picture of his brother and angelina waving and smiling fred had even been fitted for a prosthetic arm ron was about to ask hermione why she had wow d but then fred prosthetic arm extended to about four feet in length picked a rose off of a nearby rose bush and held it out to a smiling angelina ron covered his mouth with one hand as a laugh bubbled up in his throat this summer holiday is looking to be very interesting indeed he said wrapping his arm around hermione waist after taking a sip of his chilled pumpkin juice i just hope it a little less interesting than this school year hermione said a bit tiredly resting her head on ron shoulder dontcount on it ginny said matter of factly why not ron asked with apprehension as harry eyed her curiously she simply shrugged has anything in life been un interesting since we met harry ron chuckled a bit before shrugging as well i guess she has a point mate he admitted a guilty smile spread across harry face as ginny grabbed his chin and turned his face toward hers she planted a kiss on his lips turning his guilty smile a bit brighter hermione giggled covering her mouth with one hand ron smiled down at her and somehow he knew in that moment that the four of them were brought together by destiny fate magic something and that something had bound their friendship and love so tightly nothing could pull it apart author final note just wanted to say one more time thanks

without permission no copyright violation is intended no profit is being made off this site it is for entertainment purposes only chapter 5 as ron made his way down to the second floor after healing class he discovered that there were two distinctly different types of nervous butterflies there were the pleasant ones that came from smiling at hermione or playing quidditch but there were also the unpleasant ones that came from going to your first n e w t class what had he been thinking he had signed up to be an auror and with the logistics branch at that how was he going to plan important missions for the field agents if he couldnteven plan out his own homework schedule there was no way he could pull this off what would it feel like to be the first hogwart student to drop out for not being smart enough to pass the n e w t classes somehow he had just managed to scrape by on the little brains that he had with the help of harry and hermione what would he do without their help especially hermione of course hermione would still be able to help since she already knew everything but asking her for help on his own n e w t classes would make her realize just how dumb he really was and then his chances with her would be ruined for sure wait chances with her what was he thinking what chances when ron finally reached the geography of the magical world classroom he decided that if he were going to get anywhere in these upper division classes he would have to stop thinking about hermione long enough to really concentrate okay no more thoughts on hermione he could worry about his chances with her later what chances he was really losing it at least he was fond of the teacher for this particular class ron had been surprised over the summer when he d received his n e w t schedule confirmation letter informing him that madam hooch was the teacher of geography of the magical world he thought she only taught flying and referreed quidditch games but it was indeed madam hooch hawklike yellow eyes that greeted him as he entered and to ron surprise neville longbottom was seated in the back at a small wooden table hey neville ron said approaching the empty seat beside neville s neville looked up at ron and smiled shyly hello ron he then looked down nervously at the chair beside him you can sit here if you like neville said as if he doubted ron would want to sit with him ron felt a swell of pity for neville thanks ron said taking the seat he noticed that there was a book in neville lap titled herbal remedies across the globe so what career path are you taking herbological research neville replied happily you auror logistics ron said quietly saying it aloud made ron stomach turn sickly why hadnthe just chosen muggle studdies or the st mungo sanitation committee or anything he might actually be able to do neville eyes got wide wow i guess you and harry will be a team then neville began in awe that sounds like great fun ron nodded with a weak smile an awkward silence followed it was rare that ron couldntthink of anything to say but this was one of those rare moments he liked neville but they d never really talked much ron was raking his mind for something interesting to talk about when neville turned to him i was in the corridor when you slugged malfoy it was really great neville exclaimed with a wide toothy grin ron smiled brightly yeah it felt great ron said remembering neville shifted nervously in his seat yeah well hermione probably the nicest witch at hogwarts i glad you stood up for her ron simply nodded his head he d wondered in the past if neville fancied hermione and he felt a twinge of uneasiness at neville words but ron told himself that neville was only being polite it not like he had to worry about neville being competition hermione wasntthe least bit attracted to him what am i thinking competition it not a competition if i donthave a chance so much for no more thoughts on hermione ron quickly changed the subject to herbology which got neville rambling until madam hooch began class she began with a brief history on herself she informed the class that she had learned to fly on one of the old silver arrows which were no longer made ron was impressed the silver arrow was considered the true forerunner of the racing broom apparently she had fallen in love with flying after her first flight and had thenceforth traveled the globe she claimed to have visited each country of the world at least once ron hoped he could travel the world someday with hermione the class period went by extremely fast but it wasntuntil ron began making his way to the third floor that he realized madam hooch had talked about herself the entire time he had enjoyed it however she spoke like an animated storyteller hermione would definitely not approve if it were her class ron on the other hand thought madam hooch would be one of his favorite hogwart teachers if she continued to talk about flying and quidditch throughout the term as for his magical law teacher ron was completely in the dark his n e w t schedule confirmation letter had specified the teacher of this course as to be announced who would teach law probably professor binns but ron hoped not without hermione there to take notes he would be doomed binns was the complete opposite of an animated storyteller ron ron spun around to see hermione waving at him from across the hall he smiled now those were the pleasant stomach butterflies what are you doing here hermione he asked as he met her halfway ancient runes with mcgonagall is on the third floor i guess magical law is as well she asked excitedly ron nodded smiling down at her he got a sudden excited feeling about the fact that he would see hermione every tuesday and thursday before magical law she looked marvelous today there was a muggle writing tool stuck behind one ear and her hair was falling out of its ponytail she was a bit flushed too i bet you ran all the way here how did you know she asked with a curious smile ron just shrugged suddenly hermione took a firm hold on his arm what he asked watching hermione eyes go wide as she stood on her tiptoes to look over his shoulder is she your magical law teacher hermione asked in awe ron turned around to see a square jawed witch with short grey hair ron gulped good butterflies gone it was amelia bones the head of the department of magical law she was adjusting her monocle while talking to her niece susan bones who apparently had the class as well ron didnthave a very good feeling about having a teacher that had the power to throw wizards into azkaban amelia bones was on the wizengamot of course she had been helpful to harry case last year wow ron you should really suck up to her hermione said earnestly he looked down at her in surprise and why exactly should i do that because ronald dontyou know what an important position she has in the ministry she could quite possibly become the next minister of magic you definitely want to get on her good side if you re to be an auror hermione said releasing ron arm a scared look quickly came over her as she turned in the direction of her class oh i ve got to run see you at lunch ron watched her run down the hall and disappear into a classroom before he turned around a bit more nervous than before his encounter with hermione to do the same professor snape oh harry i so sorry at least it only twice a week hermione said sincerely to her friend she ron and harry had met for lunch to eat and exchange stories of their n e w t classes she had gone first telling them that arithmancy and ancient runes were still fascinating as the material got a bit more difficult ron had then gone on and on about how madam hooch and madam bones were both great at making the class period fly by harry however had just informed her and ron that his history of the dark arts teacher was none other than his least favorite teacher at hogwarts yeah you would think that would be the worst part wouldntyou harry said glumly actually i hate to admit it but snape managed to hold my attention throughout the lecture the worst part of the class is that i share it with malfoy crabbe goyle and pansy parkinson dean thomas is the only person in the class that not slytherin dean thomas hermione asked curiously she could definitely see why slytherin students would want to take the class history courses were needed for many of the career paths of course slytherin would pick history of the dark arts but why dean was he studying to be an auror hermione had thought harry and ron would be the only two boys in their year to be that daring ron turned to her with a disbelieving stare who cares about dean did you hear what harry just said hermione malfoy crabbe goyle and parkinson ron exclaimed incredulously before turning a sympathetic frown to harry so did they try anything hermione scowled at ron before turning to listen to harry answer well before snape arrived they each took turns insulting my chosen career path pansy ratted off some statistic of auror deaths from the first war and malfoy had the nerve to ask me if i were preparing to face my murderer harry spat angrily hermione stomach clenched in pain and ron mouth fell open they sat there in silence for a moment as there was nothing to say that would describe the horribleness of malfoy comment hermione wondered if malfoy knew about the so called prophecy or if he were just being his usual foul self harry and ron both looked miserable and worried they probably wouldntfeel so bad if they didntbelieve in that stupid prediction hermione thought angrily ginny suddenly approached the table with an armful of schoolbooks she sat down beside harry looking at him with a raised eyebrow what do you three look so miserable about she asked setting her books down heavily on the table harry continued to look down at his plate ron shook his head with a look of pure disgust malfoy made a foul comment about harry prophecy ron said finally ron hermione exclaimed turning to glare at him she couldntbelieve him and he had the nerve to look positively clueless what ginny already knows harry told her ron said defensively hermione shook her head frustrated at his naivety i not talking about that of course ginny knows i talking about about you know i dontbelieve in that fortuneteller i swear ron if you bring that up in front of me again so we re not allowed to even mention it in front of you hermione dontyou think your being a little rash i mean harry and i believe that no hermione exclaimed she wouldntlet him finish that sentence how could he be so utterly juvenile did he care nothing for her feelings if you cantresist the temptation to talk about such nonsense in my presence then then i wonteat with you two anymore okay okay i ll never mention it again ron said frustrated he rested his head in one hand and began violently rubbing his forehead in aggravation hermione blew her hair out of her face and turned to look at harry and ginny harry had his head about three inches from his plate eating silently ginny on the other hand gave hermione a displeased look before standing up retrieving her books and going to sit with neville what was the matter with ginny great hermione thought sullenly now i have three people angry with me well it was their fault for believing in such nonsense sybil trelawney hermione had the sudden urge to go to the library and research something anything she just needed to get away from ron and harry and apparently ginny hermione stood up from the table and slung her satchel over her shoulder hermione ron said pleadingly grabbing hold of her wrist hermione looked down at him curse his striking blue eyes hermione i sorry okay hermione suddenly felt the urge to cry as she looked down at ron beseeching look i just need to go to the library she said softly ron looked at her sadly and released her wrist i ll see you two later hermione quickly turned to leave the great hall without looking back she was afraid if she saw ron again she might return to the table but she really just needed to be alone for a while maybe she would look into those wemic tail hairs library yeah right ron thought for the first time that he could remember hermione had left to go to the library without really wanting to he didntwant to believe in harry prophecy either but he wasntgoing to ignore the truth to suit his feelings hermione was really being very selfish which wasntlike her harry had obviously closed up when hermione had begun her rant at the lunch table and as soon as she left the great hall harry said he was tired and wanted to go to the dormitories well ron wasntgoing to the dormitories he was going to track down hermione and force her to talk to him it made his skin crawl thinking about the danger he would be putting himself in if he told her what he truly thought of her behavior he would just have to sugarcoat it a bit but this denial she was going through needed to be addressed when ron reached the fourth floor he stepped into the quiet dimly lit library madam pince was sitting behind the circulation desk reading quietly yet looking up frequently to peer around the room keeping an eye out for misbehaving students ron quickly spotted hermione sitting alone at a small table she was bent low over a large leather bound book her hair tucked messily behind her ears her expression was one of intense interest she was adorable ron slowly made his way toward her she didntnotice him until he sat down beside her and leaned in close to see what she was reading wemics hmm ron whispered before leaning back and turning in his chair to face her her mouth was fixed in a sullen pout that made ron want to kiss her they re liontaurs she whispered they practice geomancy which is a form of divination using the soil of the earth instead of tealeaves and crystal balls ron nodded he wasntreally paying attention to what she was saying but he didntwant her to know that that would only make her angry angry yes also the emotion that would arise if he told her why he d come looking for her she looked so sad and alone reading this oversized book that ron realized he wasntgoing to be able to bring up the prophecy again not now it really fascinating that these creatures are only found in one area of the entire world she continued softly looking down at the book they live on an island in the north sea above germany called fohr it largest town is wyk and the muggles dontrealize that it named after the first wemic chief of the middle ages wyk ron said smiling slightly not a very strong name for a wemic is it hermione shrugged and closed the book quietly what could he do to cheer her up suddenly cheering her up seemed like a very important thing to do want to go to hagrid s ron thought he saw a hint of a smile at the corner of her mouth where harry she muttered quietly ron smiled inwardly score let go fetch him hermione was beginning to feel a bit better as she ron and harry made their way to hagrid hut across the grounds it was really very sweet of ron to come after her in the library maybe she should have been angry with him for not allowing her a little privacy but he had a way of making her forget her troubles well he actually had a way of making her forget anything and everything after ron had successfully coaxed her out of the library he had successfully coaxed harry out of the dormitory with the mention of a visit to their tall friend harry seemed to have forgotten about their uncomfortable lunch in the great hall and was talking excitedly with ron about their quidditch tryouts tomorrow hermione was relieved that harry wasntstill angry with her but she hadntreally been able to stop thinking about his and ron belief in trelawney prophecy it was unnerving how they could put so much faith in dennis creevey hermione stopped in her tracks as she saw a small boy sitting in the branches of an old oak tree she would have probably never noticed him but she had seen some sort of flash while admiring the blue sky he had his broomstick lodged in between two branches explaining to hermione how he had gotten up that far hermione hermione jumped and looked down to see ron and harry looking at her as if afraid that she d gone mad she pointed to the tree and watched their faces as they looked up changing from confused to bewildered what in the bl ron no swearing hermione said absently looking back up in the tree didntluna say this morning that dennis had fallen from a tree harry asked curiously what the idiot doing he didntfall hard enough yesterday ron exclaimed with a perplexed expression hermione bit her lip well as prefects do you think we should make him come down ron shrugged and twisted his lip indecisively harry began shaking his head sometimes people just need a place to hide leave him hermione noticed a flicker of sadness in harry eye just before she heard a loud creaking and banging of a wooden door harry hermione ron alrigh hagrid had opened his door and was staring out at them with a pleasantly surprised smile on his big black bearded face the three of them followed hagrid inside his hut and sat down in the oversized seats around the table hagrid went directly to his stove and poured three mugs of freshly brewed tea fang the boarhound was lying in one corner of the hut looking up at hermione lazily mighty glad you dropped by today hagrid said as he gave each of them a mug jus in time fer tha late afternoon snack hagrid glanced up at a large black clock on his wall and went back to the stove to drop something large and hairy into a boiling pot he then came to stand by the table and peer down at them so hermione i s pose yer getting ready to take yer apparation test fairly soon hagrid said smiling i plan to take it over the christmas holiday hermione replied she felt a small flutter of excitement apparation was such an amazing act of magic she was actually very excited about getting her permit but she had decided to wait until midterm since apparating wouldntdo her any good inside hogwarts anyway and ron yer mum says yew uv decided to be an auror hagrid said looking down at a blushing ron ron was so cute when he blushed thought hermione when did you speak to my mum ron asked curiously hagrid smile faded a little oh a tha last order meetin hagrid turned to stir the contents of the boiling pot at the stove but continued we discussed this slytherin school of magic wuz o waste o bloody time seein as how nobody knows nowt about it hagrid frowned for a moment before his black eyes glistened and he turned to harry with a grin molly also tol me about a certain someone gett n private lessons from a one albus dumbledore harry smiled and nodded although hermione noticed his smile didntreach his eyes monday wednesday and thursday nights beginning next week harry said politely but without even a hint of excitement hermione felt a twinge of worry she had thought harry was ready for these lessons the year before harry hadntcommitted himself to the art of occlumency but he simply had to now he might be physically secure at hogwarts but if voldemort could reach his mind awful things would happen hermione had already made up her mind that if harry started slacking in his study to be an occlumens she would personally speak with dumbledore it would be for his own good well hagrid said turning to remove the steaming pot from the stove and pour the contents into a large metal bucket you ll learn a lot harry i sure o that great man dumbledore harry simply smiled weakly hermione glanced at ron to see if he had noticed harry lack of enthusiasm but ron was looking at the steaming metal bucket hagrid now held in his huge hand um hagrid what exactly is in that bucket ron asked apprehensively oh jus a few hares and veggies hagrid said before turning toward the backdoor of the hut ready hermione ron and harry exchanged puzzled looks ready hermione repeated cautiously hoping her suspicion of whose late afternoon snack hagrid held was wrong late afternoon snack ole grawpy been ach n ter see you three hagrid said cheerfully and then turning to a horror stricken hermione he added especially you hermione author note thanks again for those of you continuing to send in reviews i really love seeing what you have to say sorry if this chapter seems a bit dull it sort of a filler chapter to introduce the newt classes hope you enjoyed it anyway the characters and

profit is being made off this site it is for entertainment purposes only chapter 6 why why was she wandering into the eerily quiet shadowed grounds of the forbidden forest she could have said no hagrid thank you but i not keen on visiting your sixteen foot tall brother today maybe another time but no she had consented hagrid had said grawp especially wanted to see her why that should have been the incentive she needed to be able to refuse hagrid request but instead it had made her feel obligated to agree to the visit hagrid had already become emotionally attached to his brother she couldntbring herself to deny him this small favor but small favors for hagrid usually ended up being life threatening harry and ron didntlook quite as nervous as she but they didntlook overly enthused either ron kept swatting at flies and other forest insects that seemed to be attracted to his arms and red hair of course ron didntlook worried he d never met grawp before harry had however but he was just quietly walking beside hagrid harry did look a bit confused though hagrid harry began this isntthe way we went last year to see grawp is it hermione realized that harry was right she actually felt like they had walked a bit farther into the forest than before now that she thought about it no dumbledore has foun em a nice lil cave hagrid said happily carrying the big metal bucket of stew as he stepped over a fallen branch that hermione ron and harry had to help each other over a little cave hermione thought dumbledore ron said surprised he knows you re hiding a hermione thumped ron hard on the arm he quickly cleared his throat i mean he knows about your brother oh dumbledore bin a great help ter my refin n grawpy social skills he says as long as i can keep em away from the centaurs an other creatures he can stay as long as e likes hermione stomach gave a sickening lurch she d forgotten all about the centaurs the last time she d come in contact with them they d wanted to kill her and harry she glanced around nervously at the stillness of the trees and what was dumbledore thinking how was hagrid going to make sure that grawp never bothered any of the forest creatures he couldnteven keep him from hurting him not to mention ripping trees out of the ground but hermione noted hagrid didnthave any bruises or new cuts just a few scars across his face as if reading her mind ron asked so hagrid if you ve been seeing grawp regularly how did you manage to keep your face intact oh it the bes thin dumbledore thought of it o course fore i d venture into tha forest ter see ole grawpy dumbledore would come by tha hut an put this invis ble shield round me it would last for bout three hours ya know giv n me time ter talk ter im an visit a bit hermione stopped in her tracks but then hagrid do you have a shield on now i mean shouldntwe all have one oh no hermione i stoptusin tha shield bout two weeks ago s not necessary no more hagrid said matter of factly hermione brief feeling of hope was flattened why would it not be necessary to have a little extra protection from a wild and dim giant hermione resumed her walking her shoulders now slumped slightly when hagrid suddenly stopped he turned around to smile down at them hermione ron and harry each looked around at their surroundings there was no cave in sight just trees and a big hillside that they d just walked up on was the cave on the other side of the hill grawpy hom sweet hom hagrid announced slapping one hand on the hard rock of the hill behind him hermione had opened her mouth to inquire about the entrance when hagrid suddenly turned to face the solid hill hagrid then took a deep breath and walked straight through the side of the hill with his brother snack in tow just like platform 9 hermione took a few steps back from the entrance to better see the hill tripping over a fallen limb in the process and falling into ron who was behind her he caught her by the shoulders and righted her hermione didnthave time to enjoy the flutter of her stomach at ron touch however as a booming deep voice echoed out of the cave hagger hermione suddenly felt as if her knees might buckle ron hands tightened on her shoulders turning around and sneaking out of the forest was beginning to sound like a good idea to hermione but harry began walking toward the entrance ron hands left her shoulders and he passed in front of her to follow harry with a groan hermione followed she watched harry and ron disappear into the stone wall before crossing the threshold behind them as soon as hermione entered the warmth of the summer air left her to be replaced with a damp cold it temporarily took her breath away but her breath returned as her heart began beating rapidly the inside of the cave reminded hermione a bit of the hogwart dungeons the walls were dark grey stone the rounded ceiling was at least thirty feet up and there were torches lit along the walls the furnishings were similar to those of hagrid hut a large wooden table with two wooden chairs one of the chairs was hagrid size the other was much larger instead of a stove however there was a pile of wood for a fire and instead of a bed there was a huge pile of straw on which sat a large round headed bracken haired grawp hagrid was pouring the contents of his bucket into a larger bucket with a huge handle hermione guessed the larger bucket was a grawp sized mug grawp was watching hagrid intently and patiently hermione realized that she had never really paid much attention to grawp face since she d never seen him when he wasntdoing something that made her fear for her and her friend lives he had small greenish brown eyes and a stubby shapeless nose and he was wearing a brown rather dirty sheet in toga fashion ron was staring at him with his mouth open he looked a bit more worried now hermione thought she heard a slurping sound and turned to see grawp drinking his stew from the handled bucket bits of food and broth were dripping onto his toga she ron and harry were all just watching in silent trepidation for grawp to finish his snack hagrid had taken a seat in the smaller of the two chairs at the table the table was actually much too large for hagrid chair suddenly grawp sat his mug down on the stone floor with a loud clank he wiped his mouth roughly with the back of his entire arm and then his boulder like head turned slowly in the trio direction hermione stomach cramped up and she began shivering slightly as grawp widened eyes came to rest on her hermy he roared causing ron to grab hold of her wrist and a wad of the back of harry shirt grawp face twisted into an unsightly lopsided grin revealing his yellow uneven teeth yes grawpy i n tha nice of em to stop by hagrid said jovially as if talking to a small child now member how i taught ya ter greet visitors hermione grabbed hold of ron arm with her free hand and dug her fingernails into his skin as her breath caught in her throat grawp smiled dumbly at hagrid and nodded his head which was odd looking since he didnthave much of a neck grawp set both of his hands on the stone floor and hoisted himself up from the ground with such force that some bits of dust and rock fell from the walls ron made some sort of a whining noise as he saw the full height of grawp for the first time hermione had either forgotten just how gigantic grawp was or being in a thirty foot tall cave that he was half the size of really put him into perspective then to hermione horror the giant took two steps forward bringing him just six feet from them he then squatted down so that his face was almost level with ron whose grip on hermione wrist was becoming slightly painful grawp took one umbrella sized hand and pointed his foot long finger right at her ron and harry hermione had a cold sweat dripping down her nose and her heart felt as if it were skipping every other beat jus grab a hol of his finger ther yew three hagrid said from behind grawp enormous kneeling form he sayin hello why couldnthe just say hello from his bed of straw hermione thought harry was the first to obey he pried ron fingers from the back of his shirt and walked slowly up to grawp outstretched finger um how do you do harry asked timidly grabbing a hold of the end of grawp finger his hand couldntfit around the circumference of it but grawp smiled broadly and gave a deep chuckle that actually sounded like hub hub harry turned to ron and hermione with his hand still clutching grawp finger and jerked his head slightly toward grawp hermione felt ron grip on her wrist loosen a bit so she did him the same courtesy by releasing her hold on his arm ron looked at hermione with an apprehensive frown before dragging her forward and placing his free hand next to harry s hermione slowly reached up to place her shaking hand gently on the giant finger as well which felt like rough leather as soon as hermione touched him the giant turned his humongous head to look at her with his biggest lopsided grin yet hermy grawp muttered softly in a deep rumble ron grip on her wrist tightened again hermione coughed a bit as grawp rank breath filled her nostrils but then she managed to swallow and whisper h h hello harry ron and hermione removed their hands from the giant hermione let out a long breath as grawp straightened and took two weighty steps back to his straw where he plopped down causing the ground to shudder he not all that bad really ron whispered shakily harry scoffed at him and hermione for some reason laughed a soft shaky laugh that she had no control over no she guessed he wasnt all that bad today but ron hadntseen grawp last term tearing down trees bloodying hagrid nose and dumping bird nests over their heads had hagrid actually managed to tame this giant grawp had almost seemed gentle as he d said her name well not her name but hermy which actually had a fairly nice ring to it hagrid motioned for them to come sit with him and grawp so hermione ron and harry made their way over to hagrid chair and sat down around it on the cold stone floor hermione noticed that ron sat unusually close to her hagrid was beaming at grawp apparently proud of his brother for being so well behaved grawp on the other hand had begun staring at ron with awe fire grawp asked suddenly he then reached up to his own head yanked out one of his curly greenish hairs and put it up close to his eyes squinting at the coarse strand no grawpy not fire hair hagrid said in a serious tone pronouncing each word slowly ron hair hermione put a hand to her mouth to stifle her giggle as ron face and ears turned pink grawp laid his strand of hair back on top of his head before looking at hagrid and then back at ron fire hair he said slowly yeh well ginger hair hagrid began an grawpy hair is green grawp looked at hagrid for a moment before grinning and chuckling a few more of his hub hubs hagrid harry asked suddenly does grawp have to stay inside this cave all the time hermione sadlywondered if harry were remembering what it felt like to be in the dursley cupboard under the stairs oh he llowed ter go outside tha entrance an no more n fifty feet from tha hill dumbledore put up a barrier charm at firs but now grawpy knows is boundaries there a small pond down a ways where e can get water hagrid replied fish grawp roared proudly yeh an fish hagrid added casually so harry began slowly you said something last term about finding him a lady friend hagrid opened his mouth to respond but was interrupted by grawp hermy grawp said in that same low rumble as he turned to look at her with a silly grin ron scooted a bit closer to hermione yeh well ever time i mention it e jus says tha hagrid replied with a small grin at hermione ron began coughing harry chuckled and hermione smiled despite the uneasy feeling she got from being fancied by a giant by the time ron hermione and harry had returned from their visit with grawp it was time for dinner over the meal hermione and harry had emphasized to ron that grawp had changed tremendously since last term he must have because ron didntthink the giant appeared to have any inclination of hurting any of them in fact after the shock of the mere size of grawp had worn off the time in the enchanted cave had been almost enjoyable almost grawp showed them a basket that he had been weaving hagrid thought it would be good for grawp to learn how to be gentler with things that were more fragile than he like the pliable willow branches he was using to make the basket ron could definitely see how the beach umbrella sized bundle of intercrossed branches resembled a basket although there were many jagged ends sticking out from the weaves where grawp had apparently broken some of the branches off accidentally and ron could have sworn that one of the willow branches tucked in the weave looked a bit like a deer hind leg nonetheless hagrid brother appeared to be harmless ron had become a little nervous as they were saying their goodbyes however they had all grabbed a hold of the giant finger as they had when greeting him but this time grawp had gotten the urge to pat hermione on the head with the index finger of his other humongous hand hermione had looked ready to faint but grawp somehow managed to be gentle hermione head had only bobbed slightly apparently the basket weaving was working however ron wanted to make sure hermione never visited the giant without him with her just in case that night ron slept much better than he had the previous two nights at hogwarts his idea of visiting hagrid to cheer up his two best friends had also managed to clear ron mind of the worries that had piled up over the last few days instead he thought about the next day quidditch tryouts ron felt that he and harry needed quidditch especially harry quidditch practices would give them something to look forward to every week amidst the n e w t classes the prophecy the mysterious new school harry dream and anything else they might worry about they would still have the best sport in the world author note okay first i want to thank everyone for the awesome reviews they really are helpful and inspiring second i want to apologize for the brevity of this chapter i really prefer each chapter to be at least 3000 words but i didntquite hit the mark thirdly in regards to the comment on whether or not we would see more dumbledore and fred george yes they do have some fairly important roles not too long after the snow begins to fall i love these characters as well unfortunately dumbledore wontbe in my story as much as he would be if it were told from harry point of view since harry deals much more with the headmaster than ron and hermione and lastly please continue to read and review seventh chapter coming up the characters and situations of harry potter depicted in this story are the legal property of j k rowling bloomsbury and aol time warner and have been used without permission no copyright violation is intended no profit is being made off this site it is for entertainment purposes only author note this chapter contains a segment in which i show hermione view and then go back a small amount of time to show ron view i have marked that section withthe word rewind chapter 7 by seven thirty on thursday morning the gryffindor team tryouts were over and this term team was formed ron felt that the gryffindors had a very good chance at the quidditch cup harry was of course chosen for seeker ron remained on keeper position and ginny had become a chaser fortunately andrew kirke and jack sloper were replaced by the creevey brothers who were actually really good and a fourth year jessica bullet along with seventh year katie bell would be ginny fellow chasers the only thing that had pleased ron more than the talented people who had shown up was mcgonagall announcement of ron being made team captain it had been fun revealing this detail over breakfast to hermione who had squealed in excitement and hugged him around the neck she hadnteven seemed surprised that harry hadntgotten it she had just seemed very happy that ron had ron had just taken it for granted that harry would be made team captain he had been after all the youngest seeker in a century but mcgonagall had chosen him she had said that his skills at strategy were the perfect trait for a good strong captain it had made ron stop and think well if i can pull this off maybe i can be a fair auror both require careful planning strategy and patience ron was sure he had at least two of those this thought managed to give him a boost of confidence for that thursday n e w t classes ron had managed to take half a page of notes on madam hooch lecture on brazil wizarding towns and creature colonies among the rainforest who knew mount pico de neblina was heavily populated with pixies heck who even knew there was a mount pico de neblina of course hermione probably knew and she probably would have somehow managed to get three rolls of parchment out of the lesson but ron was proud of his small bit of progress and when he d shown hermione his half page when they met in the hallway before their last class of the day down on the third floor she had smiled brightly at him it was this smile in particular that gave ron the confidence he needed for his magical law class he wouldntlet the head of the department of magical law intimidate him madam bones had seemed nice enough on tuesday anyway although they hadntreally begun studying anything she had just done some sort of icebreaking game where everybody stood up to say his or her name and favorite flavor of ice cream even so as he walked into the classroom for his second magical law class ron decided that maybe he would do a little sucking up like hermione had said it couldnthurt he needed to make some powerful connections if he wanted to be really involved in auror missions and seeing as how ron could never stoop low enough to grovel at fudge feet like percy madam bones was the next best thing she was sitting at the front of the class shuffling through some papers on her desk taking a deep breath ron approached her madam bones ron began uncertainly she looked up at him and smiled kindly adjusting her monocle um i just wanted to say that i think this class should be brilliant and uh thank you for taking time out at the ministry to teach us ron knew his face was turning a bright shade of red man he sounded like an idiot however madam bones looked pleasantly surprised well thank you dear i sure it will be a joy she replied before removing her monocle and smiling at him sincerely i am truly glad that i get to teach one of arthur and molly children truly wonderful people they are ron nodded his face flaming before he turned around to head for his seat in the back of the room mr weasley ron turned back around to madam bones she was looking at him strangely with squinted eyes and a slight frown uh oh ron thought a panicky throbbing beginning in his head she knows i was just brownnosing her of course she knows she the head of the department of magical law not some pushover could you do me a favor she asked quietly leaning forward a bit ron swallowed nervously and nodded my poor niece susan do you know her ron nodded slowly the panicky throbbing in his head subsiding slowly to be replaced with confusion well mr weasley she just not very popular you know she a lovely girl but i think some people are just a bit weary of being friends with someone that has been a victim of a major tragedy i think you can understand what i mean she paused giving ron a moment to digest what she was saying he knew that a death eater had killed susan uncle and his family when the death eater escaped azkaban last year she had been badgered with questions and apparently had lost some friends ron did understand what madam bones meant because harry was also badgered with questions and avoided by many of the students madam bones let out a small sigh anyway mr weasley would you mind sitting with susan maybe talking with her a little it would really mean a lot ron glanced over his shoulder to see susan seated at the front of the class at a table by herself feeling a sudden surge of pity for the girl and also remembering hermione advice ron decided to sacrifice his comfortable seat in the back of the room from yesterday ron smiled at madam bones and nodded his head she gave him a big grin that made the wrinkles around her eyes deepen turning around ron walked up to the edge of susan table anyone sitting here ron asked susan timidly checking out of the corner of his eye to see if madam bones were watching he couldnttell she had put her monocle back on and there was a light reflecting off of the lens um no go ahead susan said politely with a hint of surprise in her voice she then began adjusting the long braid of her hair ron took the seat but stared straight in front of him he had an uneasy feeling in his stomach it was wrong to use madam bone unpopular niece as a way to win his teacher partiality but that wasnt what he was doing not really he wouldnthave been able to refuse madam bone request even if he didntcare what she thought of him it wasntlike she d asked a lot of him either just to sit with susan and talk to her suddenly susan turned in her seat to look at ron so do you and hermione granger go out she asked casually ron breath caught in his throat and he coughed a few times what no ron said plainly were his feelings obvious to everyone was he kidding himself believing that no one knew he could feel a light sweat beading on his forehead susan simply nodded and turned to face the front of the room as madam bones rose from her desk to begin her lecture ron missed the first few minutes of the homily because he was thinking about hermione he had never been asked that question before what would it feel like to be able to answer yes it would be brilliant yes i ron weasley am dating the smartest most beautiful and most talented witch at hogwarts ron realized that he had been smiling dumbly at this thought but he quickly wiped his face of this grin and forced himself to start paying attention once he started listening madam bones strong voice was exceptional at holding his attention he even managed to take a full page of notes after the class period ended ron quickly began shoving his things into his satchel the lesson had been interesting a brief overview of the process of ratifying a new law in the ministry but as soon as it was over ron realized how ready he was to see harry and hermione in the great hall for lunch madam bone request at the beginning of class had reminded him how lucky he was to have two amazing friends as ron stood up from his seat however he felt a light tap on his shoulder he turned to see an uncomfortable looking susan nervously playing with her braid uh hey um is there a hogsmeade visit this weekend uh i think so ron said a bit taken aback susan released her braid and began nervously picking at her fingernail oh well i was just wondering if you would like to um meet me at the three broomsticks or something she asked shyly ron heart had just come to a shuddering halt was susan asking him on a date now what did he do oh crap ron looked around nervously and briefly made eye contact with madam bones before she looked down at her desk and began shuffling through papers oh crap had she heard her niece proposition just say no just say no just say no sure ron said in a somewhat high voice before his brain had time to stop his mouth susan looked up at him with a surprised smile before nodding and quickly leaving the room something was badly wrong with ron hermione thought late saturday afternoon as she dressed for the trek to hogsmeade since thursday at lunch he just hadntbeen acting normal he barely spoke to her or harry and when he did it was with one or two syllable words but for the life of her hermione couldntfigure out what it was just before his magical law class he had proudly shown off his half page of notes his face had lit up when she praised him for it he was being his normal completely adorable and charming self then lunch came around and he was like some sort of android she and harry had asked him numerous times if there was something up but he would just say no and go back to sulking hermione was beginning to wonder if it had something to do with him becoming quidditch captain he had been so proud when he d first found out about it but maybe he was starting to doubt himself why was he so insecure hermione thought it had a lot to do with his family financial situation and his plethora of successful siblings well she would just have to tell him again what a great captain he would make which she honestly believed anyway hermione met harry ginny and android ron in the common room where they then set off for the trail to hogsmeade once outside the castle hermione noticed ginny glancing nervously at her brother she must have noticed his odd behavior as well of course it wasnthard to spot seeing as how he looked absolutely miserable harry on the other hand was glancing nervously at ginny was he afraid that something was wrong with ginny too or hermione thought glancing at ginny long shining red hair and big brown eyes was he observing that there was nothing wrong with ginny hermione inward smile quickly faded as she heard ron breathe a heavy sigh she looked over at him to see him frowning his brows furrowed well ginny hermione began nonchalantly what do you think of your new quidditch captain ginny smiled at hermione and nodded knowingly oh i knew it would be ron ginny said casually i mean mcgonagall would be mad not to choose the best strategist in gryffindor tower hermione smiled thankfully at ginny but when she looked at ron he was just staring blindly in front of him his hands shoved into his pockets she wasnteven sure if he d heard them yeah harry chimed in looking worriedly at ron he never misses a move in wizard chess why should quidditch be any different i proud to be a pawn of ron s eh ginny ginny didnteven bother responding to harry corny remark as ron expression didntchange in the least hermione was really starting to get worried now if he wasntupset over being made captain what else could it be were his classes going badly was he ill oh this beating around the bush was so childish ron hermione said marching over to stand in front of his path with her hands on her hips he stopped and looked at her pitifully harry and ginny had stopped as well and were watching from behind what is the matter with you you re really starting to freak us out you know ron looked away from hermione and mumbled i have a date hermione shook her head he wasntmaking sense what are you talking about ronald hermione asked edgily she was ready for this nonsense to stop i have ron sighed heavily and looked down at hermione i have a headache hermione rolled her eyes oh yes one of those forty eight hour headaches you poor thing hermione spat sarcastically before turning around and continuing the trek toward hogsmeade she could see the three broomsticks coming into view around the bend ron was being stupid he knew that he could tell her and harry anything and ginny too for that matter he was just being rude and selfish making them all worry about him like this hermione had been excited about this weekend it was the first time ginny had tagged along with them to hogsmeade harry and ginny should be talking and laughing getting to know one another a bit better but instead they were worried about this big shit ron exclaimed all of a sudden hermione felt the back of her shirt being tugged on and looked over her shoulder to see a panic stricken ron crouching behind her with wads of the back of her shirt in his hands ron harry said worriedly hermione was speechless what in the world was going on ginny had grabbed a hold of ron arms and was trying to pull her brother away from hermione ron ginny cried tugging hard on her brother as good as ginny intentions were she was only succeeding in pulling hermione back along with them since ron hadntlet go of her shirt suddenly however hermione felt her shirt being released and ron and ginny thudded hard to the ground hermione stumbled forward sorry sorry ron breathed standing up and brushing himself off ignoring his sister outstretched hand and letting harry help hoist ginny up false alarm he said breathlessly hermione was just staring at him with her mouth partway open he d gone mad and somehow she d never seen it coming it was just her luck to fall hopelessly in love with a madman false alarm ginny said exasperatedly dusting off the backs of her jeans what in the ron have you gotten hold of some firewhiskey or something has something happened to mum or dad i mean wha ginny threw her hands up in the air as ron ignored her questions and started hurriedly toward hogsmeade his hands shoved deep into his pockets again as hermione harry and ginny resumed their trail in the wake of this madman hermione realized the only time she d ever seen ron this depressed and spastic was that day before his first quidditch match he had almost been too nervous to breathe she had felt so badly for him all she wanted to do was kiss his adorably freckled face so she had kissed him on the cheek for good luck which hadnthad much of an effect on him they were finally approaching the three broomsticks and hermione thought ron looked as if he might be sick let get some butterbeers k ron ginny asked without waiting for a reply she waltzed right into the pub hermione and harry were waiting for ron to follow them but he was just standing there looking around nervously hermione thought they might be forced to drag him in but he finally moped inside there were hogwart students mingling about the pub chatting happily with one another ginny was seated at a back corner booth already sipping on a butterbeer harry went to the bar to order three more while ron and hermione went to sit across from ginny hey look ginny said surprised looking toward the opposite end of the room there loony luna aw she sitting by herself ginny said sadly she looked up at hermione and bit her lower lip hermione would it bother you if i invited her to sit with us hermione felt a strong pang of guilt no of course not hermione exclaimed it s it not that i dontlike her she just well grates on my nerves a bit if i trying to prepare for a class or study or you know ginny didntlook like she knew but she nodded and stood up to go get luna as harry came to the table with three bottles of butterbeer where she headed harry asked curiously scooting into his bench after handing hermione and ron their bottles before hermione could respond the door of the bar creaked open and ron jumped turning around to peer over the back of their bench harry gave hermione a questioning look as ginny returned with luna close behind hello luna said wistfully pulling up a chair to the end of their table as ginny sat down next to harry harry and hermione said hello while ron continued to jump and peer over the back of their bench every time the door opened it was really starting to grate on hermione nerves much more than luna ever had ron are you expecting someone hermione asked crossly yeah ginny added do you owe someone money or something ron didntanswer but just slumped low in his seat and stared at the table luna was studying ron with her protuberant gray eyes she tilted her head to one side and then the other you could have said no luna said suddenly catching everyone attention and to hermione surprise even ron s he turned to look at luna with a fearful look what you werentthere he said cautiously hermione was very confused as was harry and ginny by the looks on their faces what was she talking about and why had her comment suddenly woken ron out of his trance hermione heard the creaking of the door again and ron jumped and peered over his shoulder but this time he suddenly slid out of his seat and ducked under the table what in the world hermione exclaimed looking behind her to see who had entered she couldntsee properly over the heads of some tall seventh year boys that had stood up to leave hermione turned back around ginny and harry looked a little frightened at ron behavior but luna was simply looking toward the door with a blank stare on her face hermione looked down to see ron squatting under the table with his head resting on the seat ron if you donttell us right now what s hermione he whined looking up at her i didntknow what to do i mean you said that i should suck up and then i tried and it really wasntas hard as you might think and then then it worked too well and then well she was sitting alone and her aunt was all oh mr weasley her uncle died could you talk to her i couldntsay no plus i thought it would look good to be nice to her since she her niece and all and then and then hermione head was buzzing as ron urgent speech trailed off wait ron who did i tell you to suck up to who was sitting alone she asked confused looking down at ron bright red and clammy face susan bones luna replied casually hermione turned to look at her luna was now looking at the spot where ron head would ve been if he were sitting in the booth like a normal person he could have just said no that what i would have done something suddenly clicked into place in hermione brain she turned a furious stare at ron cowering form ronald what did you do she asked dangerously quiet he looked up at her with fearful eyes hermione what was i supposed to do he asked in a harsh whisper madam bones was looking right at me when susan asked me to meet her here i couldntsay no hermione ears suddenly began to ring with anger i can not believe you hermione said angrily before kicking hard under the table ow ron cried before quickly covering his mouth he glared at her lowered his hand and in an urgent whisper said you kicked me in my thigh hermione glared back at him sorry i missed she hissed ron looked at her in astonishment as harry began coughing and hitting himself on the chest with his fist ginny leaned forward slightly what did he do hermione ginny asked confused luna answered first he said yes to susan bones he should have said no ginny just looked at luna curiously hermione glanced behind her and saw susan sitting alone at a small table near where luna had been sitting ginny your brother thought he could win some points with madam bones if he agreed to take susan on a date which is apparently scheduled for today hermione said plainly something flashed in ginny eyes that reminded hermione of mrs weasley ow ron exclaimed from under the table hermione he groaned ginny peered under the table at her brother it was me you idiot how could you be so cruel ginny spat angrily before raising her head back up from under the table her face flushed hermione knew her face was at least the color of ginny by now it wasntlike that i felt sorry for her ron said miserably she looked back down at his anxious face she was about to feel a twinge of pity for him but then he continued in a hesitant voice um do you think you could just um walk over there with me you know then she might think that well hermione mouth fell open she could not believe what she was hearing if he thought for one minute she was going to pretend to be his girl merely to fend off susan bones he really was a madman somewhere underneath hermione anger she felt a miserable ache in her heart and the urge to cry taking a deep breath hermione leaned closer to ron face so that only he could hear her harsh whisper i absolutely will not i will not be your girl for the day because you re too chicken to follow through with this mess you got yourself into you are going to go over there to susan and i dontknow buy her a butterbeer or something ron began shaking his head quickly and he put a clammy hand on her shin under the table hermione jerked at his touch no hermione that not what i meant i just thought that if susan saw us together than she would understand that i was just meeting her as a friend she knows i dontlike you like that she asked hermione felt like all of the air had been sucked from the pub and she was suffocating she knows i dontlike you like that hermione swallowed the lump in her throat she had to get out of here away from him hermione slapped his hand off of her shin he had a hurt look in his eye that only made her want to slap him in the face instead hermione stood up quickly followed by ginny ginny grabbed a hold of harry arm with one hand and luna with the other she then all but dragged them from the pub quickly followed by hermione who shot ron one last hateful look once outside hermione had the strongest urge to scream but she didn t of course she just looked off in the direction of the castle longing to be in her dormitory the pain in her heart was so intense she still felt like she was suffocating hermione harry began cautiously i know what ron did was really daft but i guess at least one of us should wait for him well it can be you then hermione replied shortly i going back to the castle she was about to turn toward hogsmeade station when ginny grabbed her arm hermione wait ginny began i dontthink you should walk back alone she right hermione harry said sternly hermione rolled her eyes what did they want her to do hermione if you can wait five minutes ginny began quickly i just need to run to dervish and banges to grab some broomtail clippers practice starts next week and i wonthave another chance to get them until the next hogsmeade visit oh alright hermione sighed she supposed she would feel better walking back with company anyway it wasntas if she d forgotten about harry dream it was always at the back of her mind apparently satisfied with hermione and ginny plan harry told them that he was going to walk up to the railroad tracks to wait for ron she and ginny then walked to the back edge of town to dervish and banges as they entered hermione saw that the shop was full of students as usual normally she would have wanted to browse the store newest magical equipment but she had absolutely no interest to at the moment she couldntbelieve that she had let reality slip so far from her if she were grounded she wouldnthave been surprised at all to hear ron admit that he didntlike her as more than a friend but she had let herself slip away into hopes and dreams that he did she always read too much into everything his touches that seemed to be more frequent the awkward glances that passed between them when she noticed him looking at her his comforting hugs and handholding ron weasley was her friend she needed to repeat it to herself like some sort of mantra until it really settled in because she couldntafford tofall in more love with him and is it even possible to fall in more love with someone or was it that once you fell that was it suddenly hermione heard the tinkling of the bell over the door and felt ginny grab her by the arm she was then dragged behind a large bookshelf ginny then squatted down quickly on the floor pulling hermione down with her ginny what are you hermione began anxiously but ginny put her hand over hermione mouth silencing her then hermione heard them so you want me to just pick out something that i like came the sound of a girl voice from the other side of the bookshelf yeah you know anything hermione heart caught in her throat at the sound of ron voice she looked up and realized that she could see the legs of his and susan jeans through the shelving well this looks interesting said susan hermione heard something being removed from the shelf and the thumbing through of pages so you like that one hmm i not sure let me look some more oh sure take your time hermione legs were going numb along with her mind so he only agreed to come with susan out of pity hermione felt sick to her stomach she glanced at ginny who looked completely baffled well hermione wasntbaffled she was just hurt now this one looks amazing said susan excitedly the tone of her voice made hermione whole body start shaking but it sort of expensive price doesntmatter ron said quickly before hermione heard more thumbing through of pages price didntmatter he must really like this girl but when had that happened he was always with her and harry when had he had time to develop a crush on susan bones did it happen from just two days in a class with her this thought really made hermione feel sick he been around me for six years are you sure asked a surprised susan and you arentdating hermione hermione heart rate accelerated tremendously as she and ginny exchanged completely astounded expressions no ron said chuckling a bit before clearing his throat and saying more seriously no i not without warning silent burning tears sprang into hermione eyes ginny embraced her in a second hermione laid her head on ginny shoulder and wept as she heard ron and susan walking away toward the register she was completely mortified how could ron just laugh like that at the idea of dating he r and with a girl that he barely even knew if he doesntlove her fine but he was still supposed to be her friend and friends didntlaugh behind the other back rewind so you want me to just pick out something that i like susan asked yeah ron said matter of factly you know anything he felt as if he were in some sort of a warp zone here he was in dervish and banges with susan bones susan bones just two days ago she had asked him on a date and now he was shopping with her in hogsmeade she really was a nice girl ron thought he had expected her to cry or yell or something when he d fessed up to her at the three broomsticks but she had completely understood when he d told her that he only wanted to be friends it wasntdifficult at all well this looks interesting said susan breaking into ron thoughts she was removing a large green book from the shelf and was now thumbing through it ron looked over her shoulder at the pictures of the merpeople he remembered their fourth year when hermione had been used as bait for viktor krum at the bottom of the lake ron stomach twisted as he remembered the anger he had felt when he had found out that hermione was what krum would miss most so you like that one ron asked trying to sound casual please say no i ll think about that stupid task every time i see hermione with that book hmm i not sure let me look some more she said closing the book and replacing it oh sure take your time ron said thankfully this was going to have to be an exceptionally good birthday present since it was doubling as a please have mercy on me present as well not to mention it was hermione seventeenth birthday he couldntbelieve she was going to be legal age to use magic outside of hogwarts he could still see the adorable wide eyed child she had been when they d first met of course he hadntthought she was adorable then no that had come a year or two later now this one looks amazing said susan excitedly ron almost jumped at susan exclamation he looked over her shoulder again now this is perfect ron thought smiling he was really glad he had asked her help on this he would ve just dug himself into a deeperhole by buyingsomething stupid like perfume but it sort of expensive susan added hesitantly price doesntmatter ron said absently as he took the book from susan hands and began thumbing through the pages are you sure susan asked surprised and you arentdating hermione no ron said chuckling a bit before clearing his throat and admitting gravely no i not man did he wish he could say yes to that question which he had now been asked twice feeling a bit silly for putting much thought into a clich ron wished the third time could be the charm author note wow ron has officially inserted the hypothetical foot in his mouth hasnthe well maybe he can rectify his mistake in chapter 8 coming up and thanks so much for the awesomely awesome reviews the characters and situations of harry potter depicted in this story are the legal property of j k rowling bloomsbury and aol time warner and have been used without permission no copyright violation is intended no profit is being made off this site it is for entertainment purposes only chapter 8 hermione awoke with a pounding headache what time was it hermione sat up and opened the curtains of her bed eight o clock she d slept for over fourteen hours and she hadnteaten since yesterday at lunch well she d had that butterbeer at the pub the pub tears threatened to spill over by burning her eyes but hermione wouldntlet them fall she had cried in dervish and banges all the way to the castle up to her bed in gryffindor tower and until she finally fell asleep in the early evening all the while ginny had been there comforting her without knowing the real problem hermione had told her that she was only upset because ron had laughed behind her back with susan which had been the last straw for her will to keep from crying but it wasnt the only reason she was hurt ron obviously had a liking for this susan bones he d been more nervous than she d ever seen him at the mere thought of drinking a butterbeer with the girl he d bought susan an expensive present and he had laughed along with her at the thought of dating his best friend hermione stomach gave a sickening lurch and she truly thought she might be sick she stood up slowly and went over to the mirror good grief her hair was sticking up everywhere her eyes were puffy and bloodshot and she was extremely pale her stomach growled angrily well she couldntsatisfy its hunger there was no way she could face ron right now in the great hall not because of her horrid appearance she could make herself presentable for the breakfast table but because she knew when she saw him it would be awful how was she going to endure it if he started dating susan regularly what if they held hands in the corridors between classes what if susan gave ron his first kiss hermione squeezed her eyes tight to rid her mind of that horrible image grabbing a rubber band and brush hermione pulled her hair back into a tight ponytail a shower yes that what she needed maybe she could wash some of the sadness off of her she certainly felt like it was layered on so let me get this straight you went to dervish and banges with your date to buy hermione a birthday present ron merely nodded absentlyat harry where was hermione she never missed sunday breakfast in the great hall but the early rising students were now finishing their food and heading out onto the grounds or up to their common rooms surely she couldntbe that upset with him for his slip up he d tried to explain to her that his intentions were mostly good when he d agreed to meet susan hermione could be so righteous sometimes ginny hadntspoken to him either which was odd because she usually recovered fairly quickly from his stupid mistakes but she had eaten a long ways down the table with some of her fellow fifth year classmates and then left without so much as a glance in ron direction so harry ron began he d suddenly had a twinge of fear should i wait then i mean i thought it would be good to give hermione an early birthday gift but she might i dontknow chuck it at me well you know hermione harry began matter of factly her bark is worse than her bite i think you should go ahead and give it to her i dontthink i can handle two weeks of angst from you two ron smiled half heartedly and stood from his seat yeah thanks harry guess i ll go track her down see you later harry replied with a brief wave as ron made his way to gryffindor tower he hoped that there wouldntbe anyone in the common room dean and seamus were still asleep in the dormitory and boys werentallowed in the girl stairwell ron briefly wondered what it would be like to use the room of requirement for a confrontation with hermione there would probably be water and throat lozenges for the loud scolding heavy air conditioning maybe a strait jacket ron shivered slightly maybe he could get hermione to take a walk with him chocolate pineapple ron stated to the fat lady portrait as he reached the tower the painting swung open and ron entered a bit apprehensively there were a few people lounging around the room reading and chatting but there was no hermione ginny was however sitting in a large lounge chair writing something in one of her class notebooks ron made his way over to her and sat down in a plush chair beside her she didntlook up although ron knew that she d seen him ginny ron began but suddenly ginny sighed heavily her quill stalling before she looked up to glare at him you have no idea what you ve put hermione through she must ve cried for i dontknow ron two hours she said angrily she she cried ron asked quietly his heart clenched into a tight knot ron she your best friend how could you ginny said sadness replacing her angry tone is this over me asking her to help me out of the date i mean when i asked her to walk over with me to greet susan i didntmean to seem like i was using hermione to get myself out of that mess i just ron voice trailed off ginny was shaking her head at him ron just apologize to her a simple sorry wontreally cut it but what else can you do ginny said looking over ron shoulder before looking back down at her notebook and mumbling there she is ron turned around to see hermione coming down the steps of the girl staircase he was extraordinarily nervous now this was going to be harder than he d thought why had hermione gotten so upset hadnthe done something at least this dumb in the past but ginny seemed to understand why hermione was feeling this way was it something that only girl understood if that were the case he d never be able to apologize properly he stood up and began making his way slowly toward her she had just looked up to peer around the room and when her eyes fell on him a startled look came over her and she quickly turned and started to retreat back into the staircase ron took five long strides and grabbed her by the wrist just as she d stepped onto the first stone step she turned around swiftly with a horribly sad look in her eyes hermione ron began softly please take a walk with me i canttalk to you right now she muttered sadly avoiding his eye yes you can he said pleadingly please she looked at him with her beautiful yet teary brown eyes and ron thought his heart would implode from the weight of emotions he felt for her to his relief she stepped down from the first step hermione will you promise not to go anywhere if i run to my dormitory real quick ron said hurriedly as soon as ron saw the slightest inclination of her head he released her wrist and jetted up the boy staircase and into his dormitory to retrieve the sack with hermione present in it he was afraid if he didnthurry she might change her mind and flee back to her room he grabbed the sack out from under his bed and ran back down the stairs to the common room thankfully hermione was still in the same spot as he d left her he walked up to her the sack held loosely in one hand ready he asked breathlessly she merely turned away from him and began making her way toward the portrait hole door this walk is either going to be really long or really short ron thought apprehensively as he followed in hermione wake hermione wished ron would stop staring at her they were just now exiting the hogwart main entrance and neither of them had spoken the whole way down from gryffindor tower he had just beenwalking along beside her glancing at her nervously every five or ten seconds why was he doing this what was in the sack where was susan why wasnthe with her it was a beautiful day there were absolutely no clouds in sight and the sky was the most radiant sapphire blue hermione eyes began playing tricks on her the sky looked so close yet so far away hermione glanced over at ron who was staring at his feet as they continued to walk down toward the lake so close yet so far away hermione rolled her eyes at the irony ron suddenly turned slightly right toward the shore of the lake and a cluster of weeping willows their leaves and branches were hanging all the way to the ground in a beautiful mass of green it made hermione want to cry more irony ron was leading her under the willow trees why a sudden surge of anger went through her was he trying to go somewhere in whichsusan wouldnthave the chance of stumbling upon them hermione stopped in her tracks ron stopped as well and turned around to cast her a confused expression i dontwant to go under there hermione stated glumly ron looked at her curiously for a moment and then simply shrugged walking back toward her no hermione thought she didntwant him to comply that easily she wanted him to refuse or physically drag her under the trees anything that would give her cause to scream at him he went down to the very edge of the lake and sat down he then squinted up at her the sun in his bright blue eyes as he gave her a small smile why did he have to look at her like that are you going to sit with me he asked plainly hermione walked up to the water edge but remained standing he looked up at her for a while awaiting her response when he didntreceive one he hoistedhimself up to stand beside her we ll stand then he said calmly hermione really wanted to scream at him now how could he be so perfectly perfect she was trying to be difficult and it wasntfazing him at all ron let out a long sigh okay hermione will you please tell me why you re so angry with me he asked sincerely hermione shrugged looking out over the glittering water what in the bag she asked blandly ron sighed again it something for you but i not giving it to you unless you tell me what wrong hermione looked up at him in disbelief sorry ron but i not selling forgiveness today she spat angrily turning to walk back toward the castle he caught her by her wrist causing her to jerk backward i wish you would stop doing that she cried trying to wring her hand free it didntwork hermione listen i sorry but i just dontunderstand why you re acting this way he said earnestly hermione opened her mouth to retort but he tightened his grip on her wrist and continued madam bones asked me to befriend susan susan asked me out i panicked what else do you want me to say he sounded completely desperate and his eyes looked so sincere hermione heart rate quickened with anger as she realized that he was actually managing to pull her in with that horrid stare it was only for a second but she had felt it that stupid urge to kiss him now he d given her a real reason to scream what do i want you to say she shouted at him he flinched slightly his brows becoming more furrowed she felt the tears spilling over and she didntcare let see possibly that you dontthink i absolutely revolting that would be a good start and then then maybe you could follow up with an apology for betraying my trust donti mean anything to you i ve known you six years ron six how could you just his hold on her wrist had become so loose hermione was able to wrench her hand free he was staring at her in frightened astonishment completely speechless good hermione thought there nothing he can say anyway she wanted to be in her bedroom but not in hogwarts for the first time since she d begun attending this school she wanted her mother and since her home was not a choice for whatever reason she wanted to hide beneath the willow trees hermione ran past ron to the shade underneath the tallest of the willows where she sank down beside its heavy trunk once she d sat down on the soft mossy ground she just collapsed the rest of the way to sob curling her knees up to her chest and resting her face in her hands on the ground she heard the snap of a twig and the slow approach of footsteps just go away she wanted to shout but she didnthave the strength she opened her eyes to peer out from between her fingers her vision blurred by her tears ron was slowly kneeling down in front of her he started reaching a tentative hand toward her face and hermione suddenly found the strength she needed to shout once more she pushed herself up to sit before him and look him in the face i was there she shouted a little less loudly this time ron was just staring at her with intense worry and suddenly hermione could only whisper i was there when you were buying her that gift at dervish and banges ron asked quickly sounding surprised hermione nodded suddenly feeling numb she asked you if we were dating and you laughed you just laughed i heard you she finished lamely a look of comprehension spread over ron face bloody hell hermione i wasntlaughing at you he said softly susan helped me pick out this birthday gift he reached into the sack lying by his knees and handed her a large blue book with silver writing for you and she she couldntreally believe that i would spend so much on a friend hermione rubbed her hand across the engraved lettering unicorns myth vs reality by monica fascaux unicorns was all she could say ron took the book from her gently and opened it to the first page see if you read here he said pointing to the first line of the first chapter it says that unicorns are fierce yet good selfless yet solitary and always mysteriously beautiful he said quietly handing her the book she read the words once more before looking up at him he turned a bright pink i just it reminded me of you hermione felt air rush into her lungs until she was lightheaded she needed to apologize she d been so terribly wrong but all hermione could do was set the book down gently on the ground beside her and lean forward to rest her head on ron shoulder he immediately embraced her sitting withhis legs to one side andhers to the other their chests flush against one another wrapped warmly in his arms after that night in the common room six nights ago she thought it might never happen again had it only been six nights ago hermione didntrealize until she felt ron hand glide up her back to rest on the nape of her neck that she was sobbing uncontrollably into the cotton collar of his shirt soaking it through slowly she took some deep steadying breaths until she was able to stop the tears from falling once she had ron just continued to hold her rocking back and forth slightly hermione opened her eyes to their shady haven there was a green tinted glow around them the branches of the willows were so thick hermione could barely see anything outside of them what if they could just stay under here forever they could pretend like there was no ensuing war that their lives werentin danger they could eat birds and tree frogs and only leave to go to the water edge and drink hermione couldntcontain a small breathy laugh at this thought ron arms loosened and slowly left her as he pushed himself back from their hug to look down at her was that a laugh he asked with a small smile she nodded slowly rubbing her damp eyes and cheeks her face felt raw from the salt of her tears and she was suddenly very thirsty she coughed into the back of her hand before returning his small smile it really gorgeous under here isntit i was just thinking about what it would be like to live under here like a dryad she said before looking down at the mossy ground to pick at a blade of grass she plucked it from the ground for some reason and just started rolling the cold bit of flora between her fingers ron chuckled low in his throat and she glanced up at him her heart expanded just slightly as she looked at his face she felt as if she now had another small piece of him in her heart wouldnta tree nymph refrain from pulling up the grass he asked smartly hermione pursed her lips to keep from laughing if she started she might not be able to stop actually hermione said plucking a fresh blade of grass and discarding the other dryads are only found in oak trees the prefix drys in greek signifies oak from its indo european root derew so we would actually have to be some other type of tree creature maybe hamadryads when ron didntrespond hermione glanced up to see him staring at her with his mouth partway open he began shaking his head before looking down and plucking his own blade of grass you know hermione sometimes i wonder if there only a certain amount of knowledge that any one person can hold because if there is i think you may be close to your limit he said with part admiration and part humor hermione smiled for a moment before shaking her head and frowning at her earlier stupidity misunderstandings are so horrible i feel absolutely ridiculous she said glumly ron patted her on the knee a couple of times before saying with a sly smile maybe your brain is so close to its limit that your perception cantfunction properly hermione laughed a little yeah maybe she had to look away from his sly smile because it only gave her that urge to kiss him again she knows i dontlike you like that hermione sighed that statement wasnt quite as hard to digest knowing that ron didntlike susan either maybe she and harry were such great friends that ron didntfeel the need for a girlfriend what if she could continue to keep him emotionally satisfied could she kid herself into believing that she might at least prevent him from falling in love with someone that was a horrible thought very selfish ron deserved to fall in love i think i reached my limit a long time ago ron said suddenly leaning back on his elbows to look up toward the top of the tree chills spread over hermione face and calves two very odd places to receive chills but for a moment she had thought he was somehow responding to her thoughts on him falling in love with someone she quickly realized that he was speaking of his intelligence that not true ron hermione said firmly he tilted his head down to look over at her her stomach fluttered madly she wished he would sit up from that attractive position you dontunderstand how smart you are she said he scoffed at her and looked back up toward the shielded sky really ron hermione continued it actually quite frustrating to me that you can pass all your classes without cracking a book i mean i study for hours and my marks really arentthat much higher than yours hermione that mental talk your marks are almost always perfect he said plainly yes but do you know what grades i would receive if i didnt study hermione shook her head in disgust oh i d fail every class hermione ron said looking at her with a you ve got to be joking stare my point is that you dontrealize how intelligent you are she said matter of factly to her surprise he laughed at her well maybe we should start a club then misjudged understanding of genuinely generous learning expanse he said jokingly ron that spells out muggle she said between giggles ron eyes got wide for a moment before he fell back onto the ground clutching his stomach as he laughed hermione couldnthelp but to do the same once their laughter had subsided they both remained on their backs a mere two feet apart looking up to the top of the willow she turned her head to the side and saw that ron was actually looking at her with a silly grin hermione forgot to breathe for a second but took a deep breath when her chest started hurting suddenly remembering her book which was lying on the moss between them hermione sat up so quickly that her head felt funny for a second oh ron i didntthank you for the book she exclaimed apologetically he grinned a bit bigger before rising back up on his elbows his smile fading yes you did he said simply hermione blushed slightly and reached down to pick up her book avoiding his eye was he referring to their hug she looked up at him briefly well thanks again then she said before looking back down at her book suddenly hermione felt awkward so she began thumbing through the pages without really paying attention or even seeing the words or pictures she could only see that silly grin and the look ron had had in his eyes before she could stop her memory it had burned that image into her heart hermione breathed a deep sigh ron had such a talent at distorting her reality an unexpected thought suddenly occurred to hermione maybe she could take a small page from luna lovegood view of reality maybe just with ron she should see whatever she wanted until the time came when he found his true love and maybe she would allow herself to dream every once in a while that when ron found that someone it would be her just maybe author note thanks to everyone still sending in reviews i hope you enjoy this new chapter i really had a blast writing it i ve got a good headstart on chapter 9 already so i may get to post it later tonight thanks again the characters and situations of harry potter depicted in this story are the legal property of j k rowling bloomsbury and aol time warner and have been used without permission no copyright violation is intended no profit is being made off this site it is for entertainment purposes only chapter 9 ron found it interesting how each school term seemed to start out a little shaky before finding its own rhythm but once the rhythm was found time seemed to get carried away with itself this term had found its rhythm by the second week of school and ron had never felt so busy in his entire life being quidditch captain meant that he was in charge of scheduling the practices so ron tried to schedule two to three practices each week harry of course had occlumency lessons with dumbledore on monday wednesday and thursday nights therefore ron usually chose early evenings for practice time in potions snape gave them a new essay to work on each week although ron never complained about these if he did harry would remind him that he had two classes with snape thus two essays each week transfiguration and charms remained about the same as previous years however sinistra healing class was becoming more advanced each week hermione was absolutely fantastic at healing much better than him or harry ron actually suggested to her that she might want to consider being a healer but she had said that for her healing was only a necessity for emergencies then in addition to their regular class work they also had the biweekly defense classes and their n e w t classes which all seemed to be getting increasingly more difficult madam hooch was really a great teacher until someone asked her about quidditch the students in geography of the magical world soon discovered that if they werentin the mood to hear one of her lectures all they had to do was say madam hooch does this area of the world have quidditch as well and whether or not the area had quidditch madam hooch would immediately become sidetracked onto one of her exciting stories of her favorite sport it was incredible to be able to hear the stories but she would still assign homework over what she should have taught each day even if she didntget around to teaching it so ron was oftentimes forced to read through his geography textbook extensively to be able to do his work madam bones on the other hand never became sidetracked which ron couldntdecide if he liked better or worse she stuck to her lesson plans perfectly and assigned at least a small bit of homework after every class she was a very good teacher and managed to hold ron attention but there was only so much a person could hear about magical law before they wanted to kick something ron continued to sit with susan bones he hadnttold susan that hermione had overheard and misinterpreted their conversation in dervish and banges he felt that it would be betraying hermione trust because he knew that she had been a bit embarrassed about it instead he just told susan how much hermione had liked the book on unicorns something about the expression on susan face after he d told her this made ron wonder if she still didntreally believe him when he said that he and hermione were only friends ron and harry soon learned to look forward to each of their biweekly defense classes hermione knew that they were necessary and helpful but she always seemed so nervous before these classes ron didntreally understand why either he knew she was a powerful witch she should be able to do all of the spells that he could but ron and harry both performed better than hermione in defense against the dark arts professor flitwick taught them basic dueling techniques such as stupefy since he had been a dueling champion in his younger days ron wished he would teach them some advanced practices but harry didntseemed to be bothered with learning the basic spells whenever ron would complain harry would just say something like basics are a good foundation or everything has to start with basics it was kind of annoying but hermione agreed with harry so ron never made retorts to these comments snape was exceptionally arrogant now that he finally got to teach a bit of defense against the dark arts luckily however he seemed to be ignoring harry this year instead of using every opportunity to insult or degrade him snape also allowed the students to choose their own partners so harry and ron were always together hermione however partnered with neville ron admitted to himself that it did make him a bit jealous but neville was never anything but friendly to hermione the only thing about the partners in snape class was that they werentnecessary the only thing snape ever taught was different methods of blocking the three unforgivable curses obviously the students couldntpractice any of the blocking spells on each other seeing as they couldntcast the unforgivable curses in the middle of class also ron had thought that avada kedavra couldntbe blocked to begin with that what the fake mad eye had said but snape would rant on and on about how no one could know that for sure because it wasntsomething that could be tested safely hermione had pointed out that she knew of someone that had survived the spell ron had been surprised at her tenacity but luckily snape had simply ignored the comment mcgonagall however was by far ron harry and hermione favorite biweekly defense teacher she seemed to strive to give them challenging spells and charms and she hadntused transfiguration in any of the classes yet which had thrilled ron and harry although hermione had been a bit disappointed on top of the stress of classes and quidditch practices ron had also begun worrying about harry he seemed to be avoiding him and hermione when the three of them werentin classes or in the great hall eating they hardly saw him of course he did have occlumency but when he wasntdoing that he would leave the common room to go walking or flying was he worried about the prophecy ron thought about the damn thing at least once every day surely harry did too ron wished that he and hermione could talk about the prophecy and their feelings on it but since hermione feelings were say the word prophecy and you shall feel my wrath there was absolutely no use in even mentioning it maybe ron was just worrying too much but he also felt as though something should have happened by now he would never vocalize this feeling to harry or hermione but ron truly didntunderstand what voldemort was waiting for everyone in the wizarding world knew that voldemort was back voldemort should have made his next move since the department of mysteries shouldnthe but to ron knowledge not even a death eater had been spotted since what did that mean exactly was it a good thing or did it mean that voldemort was planning something big whatever voldemort might be up to ron needed to forget about it for today it was already mid october and ron needed to prepare himself for mcgonagall third biweekly defense class of the term they had learned how to cast the disillusionment charm which harry said mad eye moody had used on him last year it made you appear to be invisible by allowing you to blend in to your surroundings for the next lesson mcgonagall taught them how to expel large bits of black smoke from their wand tips which would aid them in an escape what might she teach them today hopefully some advanced dueling if flitwick wasntgoing to share his knowledge maybe mcgonagall would inside the transfiguration classroom all the students were milling about mingling all the desks had been removed as they had been the previous times the transfiguration classroom was much bigger than ron had realized ron harry and hermione had chosen a back corner to stand in while they awaited professor mcgonagall as always at the beginning of one of the biweekly defense classes there seemed to be a definite excited feeling emanating throughout the classroom of course there is ron thought i not the only one worried about voldemort these days so what do you think old mcgonagall has in store for us ron asked apprehensively to his two friends he was always slightly anxious abouther lessons mcgonagall had told the class two weeks ago that they should come to class prepared for today mentally and physically apparently they would be learning a fairly difficult bit of magic today what if he screwed it up do you think we ll duel harry oh i not sure i d like that i do hope we learn something useful though hermione said excitedly ron tried to hold back a smile she was so adorable when she was excited about learning mental but adorable hermione your role model is teaching the class haventyou approved of her last two lessons ron asked jokingly harry chuckled but hermione ignored him professor mcgonagall had just walked into the room and everyone had fallen silent good afternoon today we are going to learn a shield charm mcgonagall said promptly okay everyone pair off mr potter to the front please without so much as a glance at ron or hermione harry walked straight to the front of the classroom and stood beside mcgonagall ron looked over at hermione who looked as confused as he felt harry hadnteven seemed a bit surprised that mcgonagall had called him to the front hermione took a few steps closer to ron partner with me please idontknow if i canhandle another class with neville hermione whispered urgently he couldntsuppress a grin as he nodded earlier that day in potions neville had almost added twice the amount of valerian root to their sleeping drought if hermione hadntcaught him it would have been the first time hermione wouldnthave had a passing potion to turn in at the front of the room mcgonagall was saying something very low to harry harry nodded and took a few steps back from mcgonagall taking his wand out alright then mr potter and i will illustrate what a proper shield should look like she said to the class before turning to harry ready she asked harry nodded taking a defensive stance mcgonagall then raised her own wand and uttered expelliarmus at the same time that harry whispered something everything happened in a matter of seconds but ron had seen it a bright white transparent globe of light encircled harry entire form as a blue light shot out of mcgonagall wand when her spell came in contact with harry shield it turned purple and retreated back to mcgonagall whose wand was then knocked from her hand the contact of mcgonagall spell to harry shield had made a loud crackling noise which had caused many students throughout the room to jump or gasp or in hermione case both ron hermione whispered how did harry do that on the first try shield charms are really hard to master ron just shrugged oh great ron thought if hermione thinks they re really hard to master i may never get one right harry lowered his wand and the white globe disappeared in a mist like vapor harry then just stood there at the front of the classroom breathing slightly heavily but not looking at ron or hermione after retrieving her wand mcgonagall stepped forward to address the class now before you begin casting expelliarmus on one another i want you and your partner to practice making your own individual shields the incantation is lumen contego this shield can be used against any offensive spell and will always lessen the blast but it is not impenetrable it is only impenetrable against a spell of lesser strength one of equal or greater strength can still harm you only when you ve accomplished some semblance of a shield may you try to disarm one another and dontworry if yours doesntlook quite like mr potters his shield was quite strong mr potter and i will be walking around and answering any questions you may have throughout the class period remember lumen contego begin ron hermione said urgently ron looked down to see hermione using her finger to motion for him to lean down when he did she whispered fretfully ron it almost as if mcgonagall knew harry could make that shield i dontknow hermione harry can do everything why wouldnthe be able to make one ron hadntmeant to sound so snippy he hated being jealous of harry skill but sometimes he was ron wanted to be able to fend for himself fight the enemy and protect others when in a dangerous spot he didntwant to have to lean on anyone else abilities hermione leaned away from him with a hurt expression before quickly scowling at him just forget it she turned her back to him and retrieved her wand from the inside of her robes she began uttering the incantation but nothing was happening ron reluctantly pulled his wand from his robes feeling both jealousy toward harry and guilt for snapping at hermione with a sigh he took a semi defensive stance lumen contego he said blandly nothing lumen contego nothing lumen contego nothing ron glanced over at hermione and saw that a tiny wisp of white light was coming out of the end of her wand the same wisp was emitting from some of the other students wands as well now ron was beginning to get angry with himself lumen contego nothing you re not concentrating ron turned around to see harry standing behind him he had an apologetic look on his face but his tone was serious you re not thinking about making a shield you re thinking about something else ron was about to defend himself when he heard a crackling noise from one corner of the room followed by a giddy squeal he turned to see lavender brown halfway surrounded by a faint misty light her partner parvati jumping up and down hermione still had a tiny wisp coming from her wand and she rolled her eyes in lavender direction i trying harry ron grumbled he wished harry would just go away hermione not really concentrating either harry said ignoring ron comment and then in a very serious tone it really important to me that you two learn this charm it the strongest blocking charm we ve been taught all term harry glanced over at hermione who was still trying fruitlessly to form a proper shield and then he whispered to ron when i make mine i i picture you and hermione in trouble ron looked up at his best friend harry eyes looked serious yet sad something pulled on ron heart as he looked at harry he felt intense guilt for his jealousy he should be glad that harry was such a skilled wizard because in the end he had to be with new incentive ron nodded and turned to where he could see hermione then closing his eyes and taking a deep breath he pictured her in trouble it wasntdifficult because he had thought about it a lot since the department of mysteries there she was sitting at home or outside on the hogwart grounds when suddenly a death eater appears dolohov ron opened his eyes and looked at hermione raising his wand lumen contego ron immediately felt a rush of cold air sweep through him and a small white light came out of his wand lumen contego he said more loudly the cold came again but this time it remained and a white light encircled him it wasntas bright as harry s but it was much stronger than lavender s a smile spread across his lips as hermione turned to look at him with surprise he lowered his wand and he immediately felt the cold leave him he now felt tingly and warm brilliant harry said smiling he patted him hard on the back and resumed his walking about the students ron saw mcgonagall cast him a thin mouthed smile from across the room hermione came over to stand beside him wow ron that was fantastic she said brightly though she looked a bit envious i haventbeen able to do it yet suddenly ron proud feeling began to ebb away as the image of hermione in trouble flashed across his mind again hermione try again she shook her head later let test out your shield first she stepped away from him and pointed her wand in his direction ron would rather her try to make the shield but he consented looking into her eyes ron held up his wand lumen contego the shield appeared again this time ron thought it might ve even been a little brighter expelliarmus he heard hermione exclaim then he saw a blue light flash in front of his shield followed by a purple light a brief feeling of warmth to interrupt the cold and a crackling noise ron lowered his wand to see hermione smiling and nodding approvingly maybe he wasnta complete screw up hermione left transfiguration feeling like a complete idiot when it came to defense against the dark arts she never felt competent or confident at the department of mysteries every spell she cast was cast out of desperation there were probably tons of other spells that would have been immensely useful to her but she hadntknown any of them and now that she was being taught wonderful defense techniques she could not seem to perform them what was the matter with her she knew that she was strong enough to conjure mcgonagall light shield why couldntshe focus maybe she should speak to professor mcgonagall about it the class that hermione did seem to have a true knack for was healing and hermione thought she knew why every time sinistra taught them something knew hermione would force herself to accept the fact that these spells may be necessary to use on ron or harry in the near future there was no way she was going to find herself in a situation like that at the department of mysteries without knowing how to help her two friends if they became injured so the following day hermione went to healing class determined to master whatever new technique sinistra had in store for them by now hermione knew how to heal minor bruises cuts and burns how to set broken bones and how to reset dislocated joints today however they were going to be learning how to remove pieces of foreign debris from wounds so what debris do you think we ll have to extract from the baccaberry hares hermione asked excitedly before sinistra arrived to the classroom harry had his head down on the sterile white table and ron was leaning back on the back legs of his chair hmm ron looked over at her with a mock serious expression i dontknow probably something really dangerous like an incomplete homework or a failing grade harry raised his head from the table to smirk at hermione while ron continued to hold his serious demeanor hermione simply smiled back sweetly you do know that you are in a very vulnerable position dontyou ron leaned forward to put all four chair legs safely on the ground he looked as if he might have a smart retort for her comment but he didntget the opportunity to say it professor sinistra walked into the room in her black robes her heels clicking quickly on the floor as she went to the front of the room she had on dark blue lipstick and fingernail polish today on anyone else hermione would have thought it silly but sinistra somehow looked natural with it good morning everyone she said in her soft soothing voice something about her voice sent chills down hermione spine it wasntreally bad just eerie i announced last class that we would be removing foreign debris from minor to severe wounds the foreign matter might be bits of wood metal or anything that is not supposed to be lodged in one skin the incantation we will be learning removes the foreign object completely when done correctly some healers not focusing on the task have been known to only remove half of the matter and not realize until they ve already sealed the wound so this requires full concentration i have given the baccaberry hares a tablet to dye their bodily secretions from clear to red in order to increase the authenticity of the situation excuse me hermione turned around in her seat to see marietta edgecombe sitting primly in her seat with her hand raised professor sinistra had a blank look on her face yes she said blandly marietta shifted uncomfortably in her seat and wrinkled her nose well i was just wondering if you knew of a spell that could dye blood a different color you know like blue or i dontknow just something prettier because well i just dontknow if i can stomach red blood hermione saw ron raise his fist to his nose to stifle a snort that he couldntcontain harry had a completely blank look on his face a muscle in sinistra jaw twitched slightly as she gazed at marietta with an expressionless stare hermione could not believe that anyone would ask such a trivial question of course hermione was thankful for the baccaberry hare clear secretions but in a true emergency the color of blood would be the last thing on her mind especially if the blood were ron or harry s miss edgecombe sinistra began calmly let me ask you if someone was in need of medical attention and you were the only one available to help would you honestly dye their blood blue before consenting to operate on them marietta scoffed well yeah or purple a few people in the room began chuckling at this remark harry slapped his forehead with one hand before lying his head down on the tabletop ron actually spun around in his seat so fast to gape at the girl that hermione heard his neck and back pop a few times sinistra didntappear to be shocked or amused however she looked closer to disgusted in answer to your question miss edgecombe yes i do know of a spell that can dye blood blue along with orange magenta periwinkle and mauve sinistra then levitated the box of hares from the back of the classroom to the front without another glance in marietta direction each hare already has a small twig lodged into its leg now come retrieve your hares and i will then continue to walk you through the process of extracting the debris after every table had one hare for each student sinistra went into a thorough explanation of the proper way to extract the debris and clean and dress the wound she said that the mending charm resarcio would not work on a major wound and that most wounds caused by debris were major the red dye seemed to work very well at making the exercise seem more realistic a couple of people had to be excused from the classroom neither of which were marietta however she did say ew about twenty seven times hermione wished she could have used the silencing charm on her by the end of the class period hermione ron and harry had each managed to extract twigs from their hares they had done a very nice job too and as they were packing up their satchels to leave hermione complimented both of her friends for their achievements silently hoping that none of them would ever have to use this healing spell yet all the same glad that they could author note i very sorry that it has taken me longer to submit this not very romantic chapter from the
