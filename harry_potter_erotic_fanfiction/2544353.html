 disclaimer so i own my own characters but the harry potter world is as far from mine as the sun summary what if the harry potter world wasntfantasy but a reality and what if after the seven books were finished the battle still wasnt finished a n i wanted to write a story that made harry potter a reality instead of just a fantasy world i wanted to do this properly so this first chapter is quite long and there are no harry potter characters in it but i assure you the next chapter will start to introduce them and really i am trying quite hard to keep this from being too much of a marysue story it shall be a long story and nothing is ever as you expect if you like it review thank you chapter 1 another day another class over and done with sometimes i wonder why i work as a teacher sometimes i wonder why i teach at a college even a school as prestigious as new york university it not that i dont like teaching in fact i have to say i love it the question always arises though when i think about what i teach my classes are history classes the history of modern japan the history of ancient rome the history of the dark ages in britain should i be surprised that these are the classes i teach i would hope not since i spent 8 years in school getting history degrees so why then the questioning attitude to my life course well it likely stemmed from the fact that while i had a few degrees in history and while i taught the subject my real passion and one could say my hobby was the occult i am a renowned expert in the world of the occult more specifically in objects and rituals used in it all of my students know this how they could not i dontknow after all i ve written a few books and i am always taking time off to attend conferences and do lectures around the world some of my students have even told me i let my hobby seep into my day job a bit too often they re right but then it is my firm belief that any history needs to deal with religion and as it happens most history is overflowing with the occult it usually assumed as well that i am into dark magick into the occult that i passionately research but the truth be known i donthave a religion i interested in my work that is all so finally my last class on friday is over with and with it my last class of this school year much to my students enjoyment and some disapproval i dontgive final exams all my grades are based on how they do throughout the year and on a final paper i ve never considered final exams that telling toward a student intelligence after all too many choke up during these stressful times and fail through no fault of their brains now it time for me to enjoy my summer holidays starting earlier then most teachers due to my lack of exams to grade of course it not really a holiday in any other way then that i donthave classes to teach this is the main time i spend with my hobby during the summer months i travel round the world meeting with other people who share my passion learning things and if i have a book planned this is the main time for me to write it i walked up the stairs of the history building passing students of old on the way there most of them waved or said hello as i passed a few who i had grown to know a bit better paused to speak to me for a moment most of them had been boys and who i was vividly aware had crushes on me or at least had while they were in my class one year i think about when i first started working here three years ago i caught one of my male students writing something in class that was decidedly not notes about feudal japan his face was bright red as i lifted the paper from his desk and found rather to my surprise a ballot for the sexiest nyu teacher he had already ticked off the box next to my name not needing to embarrass him anymore i said thank you and handed it back to him this had caused an uproar from the male students who knew what i had seen laughing at him i was awarded a plaque some weeks later from who i thought were some very confident boys it takes great pride in oneself to actually go up to a teacher and without the sight of a blush hand her a piece of wood stating that she was the sexiest teacher on campus i had smiled at them all gave them all hugs and said thank you since while some people might have been shocked at the entire event i had merely found it to be what it was intended a compliment i now had three of such plaques in my office leaving all the students behind i entered the hallway which held all of the history professors offices i was stopped once more before my office this time by my fellow teacher an extremely attractive man who i knew had received the same plaque from the female student body he was thirty years old and like me taught history classes his blonde hair curled attractively to frame his face his bright blue eyes peered out of a face made up of attractive angles clean cut and boyishly intriguing i can fully see why all of the student population loves him at least the females of course for me personally there is one slight problem with this adonis of the nyu campus ann now that school is over why dontwe just put aside pretenses and finally go on that date his arm is propped on the entrance to my office keeping me from entering and i swear that if the girls could see his expression now they wouldntfind him that attractive you see matthew caulder is the sexiest male teacher and i am the sexiest female so in his mind this makes us perfect for each other i on the other hand find the complete opposite true while he may give the charming boy next door teacher facade to the students and other teachers i know better he a wolf in sheep clothing one i am not about to unwrap for him it not about whether he likes me or not it about how well i would look on his arm at a school fundraiser of course he is also the head of the history department why my luck is this bad i do not know this little fact though makes my refusal of his offers much harder it aine i mutter not able to control that one outburst three years and he still calls me ann even after i tell him every single time how my name is pronounced aine awn ya is it really that hard but ann suits you so much better he grin and i am sure he thinks i should be turning to jelly at the mere sight but instead i just feel more impatient to get into the safety of my office but remembering he controls my tenure at this university i have to smile at him even if my words arentas kind well i ll be sure to tell that to my mother next time i see her i gently push his arm out of my way now mat i ve explained this already but i cantstart to date anyone i too busy during the school year and you know i spend my summer traveling working on my books he had looked annoyed when i moved his arm a spark of anger flitting around his eyes but it disappeared in a moment back to the charming smiles those things no one reads he laughed and my stomach did turns not in a i in love way more like i might be sick way studying the occult most be a fun hobby but it certainly a waste of your time the idea that my hobby was a waste of my time is certainly something i not unused to hearing screw the fact that i happen to be an expert in the field a person that is referenced in hundreds of books asked to give lectures for interviews to consult on rituals and objects all that matters is a pretty young history teacher is messing around with a little hobby of hers but as i said i used to this but every time mat says it i get angry why because from him i know it a way to try and get in my pants where he learned about women i shall never know matt i paused realizing there was ice in my voice i shook my head trying to warm myself up to him if even for an instant my hobby is my hobby i am not stopping for anyone now i have some final work to do i will see you in the fall i smile at him hoping that it doesntlook like a grimace instead and push past him trying to avoid even the lightest touch and open the door to my office i stop in shock staring at the rather strange man sitting behind my desk playing with the rubik cube i have on my desk remembering who is behind me though i quickly shut my office door alerting the man to my presence in my own office the cube is dropped quickly enough as if he realized he was somewhere he shouldntbe and looking at him i canthelp knowing that he shouldntbe here his face is rather squirrelly his eyes darting around looking for something an exit perhaps on top of his head is a rather tilted looking baseball cap covering what looks like a mop of stringy black hair i canttell his age but then i canttell most people ages but from him i would guess perhaps in his early forties though when he jumped up i could tell he wouldnteven reach my shoulders but at the jumping i had to smile slightly at what this man was wearing his clothes were best described as mismatched he wore a brown trench coat that in no way hid the hideously pink flowered shirt he was wearing and the jean overalls he moved from behind my desk nervous at my entrance and i noticed his ensemble was completed by a pair of furry bunny slippers on his feet how he had managed to get this far without being stopped i wasntsure i would have thought he would have stood out to security i dontknow if you re a student or not my tone indicated that was unlikely i wouldnthave missed this one on campus even for his age but my office hours are over for the day and more so for the year i stood away from the door allowing him to get past me and leave but he instead was shaking his head very enthusiastically not a student i not a student no he kept shaking his head and once again i wondered how sane this man was even if he looked harmless enough i dropped my bag near the door and moved around him to sit at my desk deciding for whatever reason that it would be best to just sit down at the point strange man or not okay then you re not a student i said this calmly trying to make him stop looking so nervous it was like dealing with a skittish colt how can i help you then suddenly this man blinked and looked up at me in surprise almost like he was just seeing me but he had already acknowledged my existence aine mackinnion he looked a little more lucid at that point and was eyeing me with a clear dark gaze from his eyes at my nod he smiled and the expression almost made his face look normal not attractive barely good looking but it was certainly a pleasing face one that i found made me smile in return of course it was also because he had pronounced my name properly but then with his slight scottish accent the pronunciation of my celtic name wouldnthave been a problem yes that is my name now really what can i do for you i was still smiling at him since he had calmed down a bit and wasntso fidgety he had now sat down in the chair across from me you re more attractive then i thought he looked to be judging me and i had to blush at the clinical look i was receiving he shook his head though and regarded me again my name is cairn cairn murkhart he looked around him once again fidgeting again at the mention of his own name i had never seen anyone look so panicked at just the use of their own name have you ever read the harry potter books this was an interesting question to ask someone you had just met no how are you what do you do for a living even a what your sign would have been more acceptable no one had ever asked me if i had read a children book before the answer of course was yes it would be a miracle i think in this day and age to find someone who hadntread the best selling book series of all time my parents had read the series my cousins my best friend my students had all in all likelihood read them i especially had found myself reading them since with my history with the occult i always read books on magic it had been with a skeptical air that i had taken up the first book but by the end i had found myself a solid fan of the series and even more surprisingly i had found that it had quite a lot of fact behind it jk rowling hadntjust created creatures or places or people a lot of them had been historically correct i had always been rather disappointed that the american version of the first book had it name changed i had enjoyed the use of the philosopher stone in that one and to change it to a sorcerer stone had felt like missing the original intention of the object but my love of a kid book aside this was an odd question interesting lead in i tapped my fingers on my desk watching the interesting little man in front of me his face was expectant apparently a lot was riding on my answer to that question yes i have read them in fact i own them all and rather enjoy them this answer seemed to relieve a lot of his pressure and he slumped in his chair as if a weight had been lifted i leaned forward now in curiousity i couldnthelp but wonder why reading a book could cause such relief to one person it was like his life had depended on that answer and i wanted to know why what if he started to speak and i found myself listening to his every word with expectation he licked his cracked lips though pausing looking to think hard at what to say what if i told you that harry potter actually existed i found myself laughing feeling the strange anticipation i had been feeling draining away at that ridiculous question now i was sure that this man was something less than sane or perhaps a joke from one of my students what you mean the book or the person i smiled at him the type of smile you give a child who tells you with dead certainty that they had just seen a fairy in the backyard both he said no look of amusement on his narrow features i blinked and my smile slipped not knowing why but i knew he was serious he at least thought he was serious well if that true then you ll be happy to prove it to me bring our your wand and show me something a alohamora or wingardium leviosa i tapped my fingers again on my desk piercing him with a firm look i had to say it was amazing that i could still remember those silly words from the books at my suggestion though cairn started fidgeting worse then before his hands twisting the fabric of his coat i should have been a proper hostess and offered to take it from him he must have been hot in the city may weather i i cantdo that i instantly felt bad for him he looked like he just wanted to jump out the window and indeed his eyes kept flitting to it in hope i a squib you see while my whole family could do magic i well i couldn t a convenient escape from any proof my fingers were now loud in the room tapping with force over the pine wood of my teacher desk there were no papers on it to clutter it only some relics i had brought back from some of my travels i knew what most of them were for and they were uses i told no one since with many such things in my possession the uses were frightening all right then proof aside why are you here i sat back in my chair stilling the nervous movement of my fingers i also decided to save cairn from the obvious pain of talking about being able to use magic or in his case not i here to hire you he said with confidence making me wonder if this man had a split personality he seemed to switch from a confident if strange man instantly to a nervous wreck but my interest in his mental state was pushed aside by his strange answer hire me i not a plumber to call up and hire i a teacher i teach history what do you want me to do tutor your child no i need to hire you for your other work your real work i was sent here to hire you for that i mean he sighed and was still twisting his coat in his hand ha he sent me to come get you he i shook my head and found my fingers now tapping on the arm of my chair all in all this day was looking to end in a very strange way but i had to admit i had felt a flow of warmth through my body hearing my hobby be called my real work it was something i had long thought but people around me always assumed what earned your money was what you called work that was my job not my work okay what did you want to hire me for i decided to hear him out if for no other reason then the warmth i now felt we have an object that we need to have identified and a ritual we need performed i research things but i do not perform rituals i said this clearly even though this was not in all ways true i had indeed performed plenty of rituals in the past while researching them nothing dark of course but i had done enough it was something that no one knew about that aside from my expertise in knowing about relics and rituals i also knew how to use and perform them it was something that i didntexactly want to be common knowledge i knew how my superiors at the school would feel about that we re offering you ten thousand pounds he said this as if it sounded strange to his ears and i couldntreally blame him ten thousand dollars was a lot of money to hire someone to do a little ritual let alone pounds which was almost double that my throat went dry hearing that all that passed through my brain was the fact that i didntearn much as a teacher and that money could really help with a book i had planned to do on the funeral rituals of ancient china to make matters worse cairn took my expression to be denial and continued to raise the price fifteen twenty stop i exclaimed my head down and my hand held up i had a horrible feeling if i hadntstopped him he would have kept on going do you realize how much that is i croaked out looking up at him actually not really he said making me look at him strangely once again his voice set him clearly as a scot so how could he not know how much that was price aside what do you want me to do i cantexplain it he looked more then slightly confused only he can explain it to you if you just come with me to england he ll explain it and you ll be happy to help he smiled explaining that to me to fly to england with no real explanation was so silly that i couldnt control my uncontrollable laughter but it was stilled at the worried look on cairn face we ve asked other people none of them knew what it was how to do it they all said to go to you if you wonthelp us his voice cracked and i was instantly worried that this strange nervous looking man sitting in my office in mismatched clothes was going to cry and no matter how strange someone may be the sight of them near tears is enough to make me feel bad about whatever i may or may not have done i ll help okay i sighed the acquiescence past my lips before i had any time to think and i certainly couldnttake it back at the sight of his overjoyed expression i had found myself employed to do something i knew not what in a country an ocean away we ll have to leave right away he jumped up and looked around sighting on the fireplace in the wall of my office my office was the oldest room in the building it too drafty for the rest of the staff but i liked the fireplace it good in the winter but i didntknow why cairn was looking at it so thoughtfully he pulled out an envelope from his pocket and peered inside it good i have enough left for both of us he stopped talking to himself and looked back at me where i was regarding him like he was going insane you ve read the books so you know about floo powder right this was going too far now he was a veritable nutcase and now was expecting me to believe that we were going to go to london by traveling through my rather dusty fireplace he walked over behind the desk and grabbed my wrist pulling me up and to the fireplace he placed some of the powder into my hand and i clutched at it still trying to find the right words to tell him that he needed help he seemed so nice too now we re going to go to the leaky cauldron it in london since we re overseas you ll need to specify that so leaky cauldron london england should suffice cairn was back to his confident demeanor and he stepped into the fireplace which fit him rather well just throw it down and say that very clearly i ll see you on the other side i had to stop him then shaking my head you just said you were a squib how can you use the magic powder how could i it the powder that has the magic not me or you it will do all the work you donthave to have any to work it he smiled rather pleasantly at me after explaining that and threw the powder down saying the location very clearly a blast of smoke occurred and when it cleared i was staring at the stone wall of the inside of my fireplace no cairn insight the thought that i was delusional flitted over me but my hand still clenched the powder he had given me and realizing that we were on the top floor of the building and that there was no way out of my fireplace i had only one possible connection to make that he had been telling me the truth accepting this as the truth flooded my brain with endless thoughts if this was true then harry potter was a reality the world that had existed in those seven books had not been a fantasy was in fact a reality which meant that even as i went about my daily life somewhere around me had been another world a world that i would kill to study it was this last thought that made me step into my own fireplace stooping low since i was over a foot taller then cairn this was the truth and being a teacher i was dedicated to finding out the truth i was a researcher of the occult how in hell could i pass up the opportunity to see magic with my own eyes in as clear and certain a voice as i could muster i called out the location i wanted as i threw down the powder and found myself dizzy in a place i had never been welcome to the leaky cauldron aine mackinnion i found myself being pulled up and staring at a young man with short cut messy black hair glasses and a rather noticeable lightning mark on his forehead a small smile on his face as he pulled me up from the fireplace floor a n well well well another new chapter so i can see why people would think this is a mary sue fanfic i suppose it is in some ways but i shall try hard so that it wontbe that bad heh but what can i say if you re doing a story about harry potter being real you have to have a muggle non canon character cm aeris queen of insanity i still love this penname well i sorry you dontlike the story anymore but i adore sirius so it not gonna change inu angelz oohh i want a m m and choc chip cookie now leelo77 love connection well perhaps not necessarily though glad you liked the chapter though rheniel i thrilled that the story is better then most muggle into harry potter fics i try my hardest whether it always works or not i hope you continue to read any more ideas like me know i love new ideas and as always to everyone please review maybe i ll try the cookie thing as inuangel suggested m m and choc chip sounds good doesntit mmm chapter 10 it wasntlike i was a school girl with a crush i was a grown woman twenty nine years of age and i was completely capable of being in a room with a man i thought was attractive and being able to keep all my faculties that being said i was aware that i had been staring at the man for far too long a smirk was now on sirius mouth reminiscent of his cousins own smirk which i could feel coming from the blonde without even seeing it harry even looked amused i was surrounded by men overly amused men my usual feelings of control came back into play and i quite successfully pushed down my own raging hormones and stopped the blush from spreading over my body again i turned a cold eye on sirius who was still standing there smirking i was growing to hate that expression on any man lips mr black i presume i narrowed my eyes at him my voice annoyed because of his amusement and because of my own rebellious thoughts thank you for the use of your room but i would like to have my clothes back then i would like to leave now the smirk was gone from his face instead he looked mildly annoyed likely from the polite use of his last name i remembered back to harry telling me at the leaky cauldron that his godfather wouldnt appreciate the formal use of his name and it looked like he had been right he was likely far more used to women falling over themselves for him of course i could easily understand that and with my knees already weak it was a distinct possibility for me his eyes though traveled over my form once again causing the same shiver but his eyes were distinctly colder this time i sorry what was your name i perfectly used to naked women standing in my room but usually i know their names my glare didntseem to affect him because the smirk was back in place my attraction for this man was starting to rub me the wrong way he was certainly not worth the feeling reminding me of matt caulder more then was healthy they both had the idea that they were god gift to women fine so i might agree on one more then the other but that didntmean i enjoyed the smug attitude in the men i had acquaintance with sirius harry looked with disapproval and a small amount of surprise at his godfather you know her name you should be more polite if it wasntfor her you wouldntbe here there was stern reprimand in harry voice and i smiled at him in thanks for his championship of me ignore him aine he was actually quite worried about you only because she was sleeping in my bedroom he said shortly his arms now crossed over his chest i blinked a bit in surprise wondering if he had always been this childish or if it had been a side effect from the veil are you actually pouting about a comatose woman having slept in your room i asked amazed is your brain addled with age the look i received was nothing if not annoyed there was a moment of pride that i had caused the annoyance a ripple of laughter erupted through the room coming from my side on the bed i turned to eye the blonde malfoy sitting on the edge of the bed with a mixture of amusement and irritation i suppose i should be happy that someone was taking pleasure out of the circumstances of course i wasntcompletely sure what those circumstances were or even what draco found so absolutely hilarious my foot started to tap in response to his continued laughter no end in sight draco harry looked at his lover a considerably vexed expression firmly in place whatever the blonde man found funny harry wasntsharing the joke but at least he knew what the joke was i sorry but they re getting along so well already the following few weeks are just going to be tremendous fun a chuckle slipped past his lips his comments earning him a hard look from harry but he just laughed the look off completely unconcerned i didntshare his unconcern though if harry had been glaring at me like that then i certainly wouldntbe laughing at anything at the moment cousin you re starting to get on everyone nerves here maybe you should just shut up now sirius said drily apparently he too knew what was funny though like harry he didntfind it as hilarious he was trying considerably hard though to keep the reason from escaping draco lips i was the only one who was being left in the dark and it just made my foot tap faster surprisingly enough though it was draco who ended my torment standing up for me even if he didntrealize he was doing it honestly you two she going to find out soon enough i am just getting a little amusement from the fact that black and the little muggle there are already at each other throats he nodded in both sirius and my direction i cast a quick look at the older man still standing in the doorway he looked quite put out by his younger cousin he turned to look at harry a look of complete sympathy on his face i dontunderstand why you re involved with him at all i can say without a doubt you could easily do better hey i was slightly surprised to see a quick flash of hurt cross over draco face at that statement make fun of his family his clothing his profession but never pick on his relationship with harry you dontneed to understand old man the hurt was replaced by a sneer directed to sirius the older man just shrugged the look off ignoring him he has his good moments a reassuring smile was directed toward draco calming him down though right now isntone of them the smile was replaced by a disapproving look the smile though had settled draco down and he just let the disapproval slide off his back i regarded the men surrounding me there was something they werent telling me and instead of filling me in about it when it so obviously affected me they were bickering like little boys here i was standing in the middle of what i now knew as sirius black bedroom covered only in a sheet being harassed by a perfectly delectable man who was getting on my nerves as quickly as he was attracting me and the center of amusement for another one of the men they were keeping something from me i was not in the best of moods children i said firmly authority ringing through my voice causing the two younger men to look at me immediately years of teaching will certainly give you control over people i want to know what is going on from mr black appearance there i nodded in the older man direction i shall assume that my ritual worked perfectly so i am certainly not needed here anymore but i do have a job to do at home so would you stop acting like little children and please tell me what it is you re hiding from me mr black here hasntactually been awake much longer then you sirius huffed softly at the formal use of his last name i just woke up a couple of days ago i suppose being dead will really take it out of you really i guess he was handling his death rather well but i was in no mood at the moment for his bad sense of humour i started to tap my foot which looked a little foolish with my mussed hair and white sheet clutched around me yes sirius here has been out like a log too long as well i just think he was catching up on his beauty sleep lot of good it did him though the blonde haired man said shaking his head unlike you i dontneed beauty sleep to make me this attractive i just always look good the two cousins stared each other down the two of them were starting to annoy me harry stepped up now and decided to finish filling me in since it was obvious that i was going to find out a good thing too since neither draco or sirius seemed to be able to keep their sarky little mouths shut i could easily see how the two of them were related now well after sirius woke up he tried to leave and well he couldn t it was almost like harry floundered with what to say that was an explanation i couldntsee how this related to me and why i couldntgo home how was it my responsibility that this man had problems leaving the area the tapping of my foot didntstop getting me annoyed looks from sirius who was staring at the offending foot his eye twitching i wondered if he was considering the pros and cons of grabbing my leg to stop the motion then again that would probably be a little awkward my fantasies were starting to kick in again at even the idea of sirius black hands on my leg what my dear harry is trying to say and being far too cautious about is that sirius couldntleave the area because you were still in the area it looks like that little ritual of yours had some unforeseen side effects draco finished up the explanation for harry i stared at him for a moment his smirk annoying me since i didntfind this at all funny the raven haired boy next to him looked apologetic and sirius looked quite furious really who could blame him after all he was stuck here because i was he was attached to a muggle i was attached to him what the farthest we can go i asked calmly panicking was certainly not going to help me in this situation i wasntgoing to be able to go back to new york since it was highly unlikely that sirius would travel there as well so i was going to have to make do here and figure out a way to detach myself from the dark haired man well the farthest he was able to get was about 300 yards harry smiled slightly no doubt pleased that i wasnttaking this little bit of information any harder whatever he had imagined it likely included some yelling some crying and a bit of a temper tantrum obviously he really didntknow me that well over the years i have gotten used to quite a few setbacks i d say being magically and possibly physically linked to a man like sirius black was easily a setback harry had taken up the task of describing to me what was going on i was perfectly happy that it was him the other two were too busy being angry or amused you could probably guess which one was which well 300 yards wasntthat bad that was almost a quarter of a mile really things could have been much worse when they had first dropped this bomb on me i was worried it was going to be something ridiculous all i had been able to think of was that i was going to be attached at the hip with this man it would have made things like showering very interesting my brain had certainly gone into overtime thinking about that little idea but 300 yards gave distance enough the real question was why this had happened at all i had performed the ritual perfectly there was no question about that perhaps the clag a bh is had been faulty somehow but i doubted it would have resulted in this if it had been cracked or fake the ritual simply would not have worked the only plausible explanation was that i hadntbeen informed completely about the results of bringing someone back to life using that particular means it was likely to do with the use of blood with the clag a bh is i knew well enough that in other rituals that the use of blood between people tied them together but that was usually a mutual exchange of the substance in this case it had been my blood used to bring him back from the grave i suppose that was a bigger connection then i had realized hindsight is 20 20 they say i suppose i should have realized before that giving my blood in the ritual would tie me undeniably to this tall raven haired man everything being said and done though it obviously was an amazing ritual judging by the appearance of sirius black there was no corpse like appearance to his body no jerky movements he had every memory in tact so that had been all right there was just this little side effect in comparison to the miracle that had been performed this really wasntthat big of a deal the question though was if any other problems had occurred well i had wanted to find out what was under the clothes i tied the sheet around me tightly and moved over to where sirius stood and with no warning to him started to run my hands down his chest what his eyes widened in shock a surprised pale blush suffusing his cheeks i ignored this though as well as the immediate thought that his chest was indeed very very nice i rose up on tip toes peering at him closely my hands now moving over his shoulders and down his arms i looked over every inch of him aine harry exclaimed looking away from us embarrassed a definite blush on his cheeks draco was laughing quietly bent over slightly still on the bed looks like there were other side effects as well not that my dear cousin would mind though a beautiful woman in only a sheet caressing him he smirked at the pointed look he got from sirius which just proved his point i lowered myself back onto the balls of my feet taking a step back you re all rather perverted i shook my head i was checking to make sure there was nothing wrong with him that might have to do with the ritual at least physically i need to know that everything else at least worked properly before i try and figure out what did go wrong have you noticed anything else wrong n no sirius stuttered before regaining his footing if you want you can check the rest sirius drawled his eyes suggesting certain things that appealed to me this time i didnt blush but let my eyes travel down his long frame before settling on his face keeping my eyes on him no thank you recently resurrected corpses dontturn me on okay that was a rather large fib but despite the fact that i was now invariably tied to the man i certainly didntwant to get tied to him in any other ways as pleasurable as they might be at the hard look that entered his eyes i knew that he hadnttaken too kindly to that comment harry do you think i could have some clothes i think you ve all seen me nearly naked long enough i asked quietly not taking my eyes off the man in front of me some of us saw you completely naked draco said innocently it didnt really work for him innocent devils are rare and few between sirius snorted i ll bring them right up harry said quickly trying to diffuse the situation the bomb squad had a happier job in my opinion i was unhappy to still be there sirius was unhappy not being able to leave and draco was taking too much enjoyment out of our displeasure poor harry the silence in the room was definitely uncomfortable with harry gone especially for me standing here with no clothes on in only a sheet i was feeling mildly panicked about the messed up ritual and it side effect and i was trying very hard to hide it from everyone else just what i didntneed draco having more ammunition on me achoo and i think i was starting to get a cold as well i could only hope harry would get back quickly with my clothes a n this story keeps going and going so long i hope people dontmind how long it taking to get places but oh well next week i have vacation so i likely going to be writing most of the time so i ll probably be uploading a chapter a day that week that ll get it further along chapter 11 a rather uncomfortable silence fell over the room the minute harry left well it was silent except for draco rather non discreet laughing he really was taking too much pleasure out of our situation actually it was rather a pleasant sound one i didnt think i would hear i certainly hadntexpected to hear much laughter in this house it certainly wasntbuilt to hold much joy and draco certainly wasntbuilt to either but apparently other people annoyance and pain could make him quite happy unless it was harry of course draco dear if you dontstop laughing i will be forced to make your life with harry rather hard i gave him a hard look hoping the threat would stop his laughter instead he just smirked at me oblivious to the menace i was suggesting didnt you know living with harry i always hard he had to twist the statement didnthe it was a joke i might have found funny directed to anyone other then me i ignored the obvious sexual reference though not surprising really he is rather attractive i appeared thoughtful certainly not the young boy from the books he grown up rather nicely though too bad he fond of boys i eyed draco coldly perhaps he just needs the right woman i smiled at draco trying to annoy him true to form though draco just smiled and responded in kind please do you really think after having me he d be able to settle for anything else especially an older woman would you both please stop talking about my godson like this it making me slightly nauseous especially you draco over by the door sirius was clutching the doorway and true to his word looking slightly sick my apologies mr black i wontmake any more sexual references to harry he certainly doesntdeserve it i chuckled a rather evil side of me taking a bit of pleasure at seeing the man looking discomforted now draco darling do you think you could keep your amusement to a minimum no was the simple reply i got from the still smirking draco i sighed realizing that it was probably completely futile to try and dissuade a slytherin from taking pleasure from someone else discomfort not that i wouldntfind this situation amusing myself after all it was almost comical except i really would have preferred being attached to anyone other then the man who i knew was watching me from across the room it was disconcerting to have his eyes on me especially when i was lacking clothing luckily harry came back into the room handing me my clothes but he didnt look too happy at the moment in fact there was a distinct worried expression set on his features what the matter draco asked immediately his concern for the gryffindor popping up the second he walked into the room nothing wrong really it just that hermione here with the kids at everyone confused looks he shook his head no that great i love to see them i love to see my godchildren but they cant see you two he looked at both sirius and i if they saw sirius they would know i had done something they d want to get involved and i will not allow it there was that note of steel in his voice again he was really adamant about his protection of his old school friends easy enough we go down and make nice with granger and the little adorable weasels these two will just have to stay in this room together draco said this logically enough but the tilt of his lips stated that he was enjoying the discomfort he was going to cause he pushed harry out the door now you two be nice and dontleave here he nodded his aristocratic face at us and closed the door now it was just the two of us in a room if i thought my mind was having improper thoughts before now it was certainly working over time of course i was ignoring them though you re all red are you all right sirius asked pushing away from the wall a small note of concern in his voice as he approached me i jumped back from him immediately not wanting to be too close to him not after where my brain had taken me seconds ago i perfectly all right my voice didntbreak much to my credit but i sounded a little too prudish even to my own ears now will you please turn around so i can get changed i needed clothing to cover me if i had any chance of escaping this room without a permanent colour change the tall man in front of me stood there for a minute before shaking his head a grin settling on his face the broken look in his eyes that i had seen before was instead replaced by a distinctive mischievous gleam of course he wasntgoing to turn around the arrogant bastard perhaps i shouldnthave been so mean to him before though i doubted playing nice with the man would have prevented this little incident not one to be outdone though i just smiled rather innocently at him before shrugging my shoulders i certainly wasntgoing to drop the sheet in front of him but that didntmean i couldntget dressed i took my black baby doll shirt and slipped it slowly over my head settling it over the sheet then while still keeping eye contact with sirius i took my pair of underwear rather nondescript cotton ones and shuffled into them under my sheet only then did i drop the sheet standing in front of a man wearing only a shirt and a pair of underwear i didntthink watching a girl get into clothes would be that much of a turn on there was a note of wonder to sirius voice as he said that shifting a bit uncomfortably i smirked slightly pulling on my jeans it all depends on who you re watching mr black i turned away from him then taking the sheet and placing it carefully back onto the bed pulling the comforter over it after all my mother always taught me to make my bed i think i ll take much more pleasure out of sleeping in this bed now now that there a good memory of a beautiful naked woman lying between the sheets all sweaty sirius had gone over to the bed sitting on it i am not sweating i huffed turning to look at him sitting on the bed my hands on my hips i watched his hand was sliding slowly over the material of the comforter it was far more sensual looking then it ought to have been not right now of course but you were certainly sweating when you were sick before and naked as well i narrowed my eyes at him there was the fact that i had been unconscious naked and sweating in this man bed and he had been awake and in my presence to find this out my sexual fantasies aside i wasntoverly fond of the idea that he had seen me naked i didntcheck to see what was under the sheets miss mackinnion the look on my face must have said it all because he laughed at my relief forgetting my like or dislike of the man i sat down next to him on the bed did harry tell you that a squib woman wrote books about his life i asked out of the blue after all sirius had been dead for quite awhile and therefore unaware of what had happened in the meantime despite the fact that he rubbed me the wrong way already and we had only really just met that didntmean i envied his position it is a wondrous thing being alive especially when you ve been dead for over ten years he mentioned it sirius leaned back on his arms looking comfortable and at ease if i had been around i would have made sure she hadntwritten a single word there was a clear threat in his words one i was sure he would have backed up lucky for jk rowling he hadntbeen around well yes that all i knew about harry potter and your world before cairn contacted me i grew quiet when cairn name passed my lips immediately seeing the pointed face the sad eyes and the childish expression a warm hand covered mine and i was surprised to see sirius looking at me sympathy in his eyes harry told me about cairn he was a very brave person i sure he died well i roughly pulled my hand out of sirius grip and turned angry eyes on him you cantdie well he certainly didn t not unless you call having your body ripped to shreds as good i shook my head no tears in my eyes i was too angry to cry of course sirius black would be all gung ho for dying after all the way he had died had certainly been reckless and stupid had i brought a man back to life who wasnt going to even appreciate what i had given him that not what i meant he said gruffly looking uncomfortable with my anger but still certain of what he meant i sure he died to protect you or harry that what i mean when i said he died well forget it this was not a subject i wanted to linger on for too long jk rowling certainly got your character down pat you re egotistical arrogant reckless a lady man charming too handsome for your own good proud the perfect black he smirked without those pesky ties to the dark side i jumped as he leaned in closer to me a roguish grin settled on his features too handsome you are attracted to me ideally i would have kept my cool in this situation and had a suitably harsh come back to berate sirius black with instead my body conducted a mutiny against my head it likely had to do with the close proximity with a man i was fully willing to say i would easily go to jelly being near either way my face grew hot and all i could manage was to look like a fish my mouth gaping wide open this just gave sirius a knowing look as he pulled back glad to know i ve still got it that pulled me out of whatever trance like state i might have been in i jumped off the bed not wanting to sit next to him any longer you re an arrogant ass only an idiot would find a reckless wizard like you attractive you got yourself killed because you thought too highly of yourself you left harry alone and with no family why because you thought you were invincible you didnteven die that dramatically you died thinking you were the hottest thing on earth when instead you were just a sad old fool i panted too angry to think about what i was saying this was what i had thought all those years ago when i had first read book five when sirius had died i never had liked his death scene i had liked his character i had wanted more from his death then just being too cocky to avoid a spell but seeing the man now alive he was still too damned cocky and i was angry at him for it i had performed a ritual to bring him back to life a ritual which left me in a coma for almost a month and then it had connected me to him for who knows how long and to make it even worse i had to find the bastard attractive he had the gall to act like that same cocky prick who got himself killed from the livid expression on his face he hadnttaken too kindly to my angry lecture he was now standing his grey eyes dark and spitting daggers at me what the hell would a stupid muggle like you know anyway you think you have any insight into what happened just because you read what was likely a very faulty book do you honestly think i wanted to die and leave harry alone you re not even important here so you brought me back to life what of it i sure plenty of other people could have cut their arm and chanted a few strange words if it wasnt for the stupid connection we now have which you didnteven know about then i would have you back home in seconds you re more of an inconvenience then a help we both stood there chests heaving over our angry words to each other narrowed eyes on each other the tension in the air was thick enough to cut but neither of us moved from where we stood it would have been the moment in a bad movie where the two characters started to make out but this wasnta bad movie we just stood there glaring at each other until the door finally opened and harry walked in he must have sensed the mood though since he shuffled uneasily into the room draco behind him though started to laugh well it was either going to be you guys going at it like rabbits or fighting like dogs he crossed his arms over his chest i d be more amused if you told me you did the first and are now doing the second shut up cousin sirius gave draco a withering look a look that was so completely filled with menace that it even wiped the grin off of draco pointed features since you re up here i ll assume the weasley entourage is gone at harry surprised nod sirius swept past them and out of the room i gave a deep sigh of relief what happened in here harry sounded concerned we shared our opinions they just didntmatch very well i tried to smile at harry but it faltered and fell off my face for some reason the argument wasntsitting well with me but damned if i was going to go apologize to a man who called me stupid and an inconvenience i need to call my work i turned to harry and then i need to spend a hell of a lot of time in the library i am damn well going to break this god awful connection to that man i ll talk to sirius harry sighed he ll have to go with you to the library after all just keep him the 500 yards away and we ll be fine a n well well well the story of three wells another chapter this being my vacation off of work and everything else i shall be writing pretty much all the time so i ll have a chapter up every day or every other day this chapter brings up more about aine past and family i know alot of people consider this story to be a mary sue story with the main character being an oc but since the story is about hp being a reality it made sense to have the main character be an outsider i shall try quite hard to keep away from the usual mary sue qualities chapter 12 the call to my work was certainly an odd one what explanation could i give to why i wouldntbe going back to work for at least the first semester that wouldntloose me my job it was also made harder by the fact that it was matt that i had to call in the end i went with the good old standby of being sick though i made it a little more extreme by saying that i had gotten sick while i was researching in china a doctor note would likely be necessary but i didnt doubt that harry could easily pull off charming me up a suitably believable one disappointment rang clear in matt voice as he accepted the excuse i didnt doubt though that he would quickly enough forget about me the second he saw another attractive woman he was fickle when the object he lusted after wasntaround i had only sustained his interest for the past few years simply because i said no to him there is something about men and getting what they canthave especially when that a woman it ten times worse in an attractive man they always seem to think they deserve everything they want purely based on their looks if i thought the call to work was bad the call home was even worse there were no excuses that could be given none that would be believed at any rate my family knows me well enough to know there would be no chance of me getting sick in china and not contacting them straight away not to mention it would have been quite a feat to get sick in asia when i had told them i was in england my parents were two upstanding citizens not a single parking ticket between the two of them each understood the laws of their adopted country after all they had made a concerted effort after moving to the united states from scotland appearances were quite important to them as was responsibility both things they had taught me people donttake you seriously if you dontlook serious responsibility is hard but worth the effort they were perfectly respectable except of course for one other thing they had also instilled in me their passion for history and things of an unusual nature my mother had been a professor at glasgow university before having me and moving to the united states on the other hand my father had been just an ordinary police officer even if he had a strange interest in strange things it had been that which had introduced my parents to each other growing up around crystal balls ritual daggers skeletons geodes it all made an interesting childhood showing that the environment we grow up in indelibly marks us when we are older i would say they were proud of me when i grew up even as i had always been proud of them but i knew they would be downright furious to find out what i had done even worse they would be disappointed while i had shared my parents enjoyment of things occult i had always gone one step further i tried to find out how things were done instead of just reading about them instead of just knowing i wanted to see and to try being older and now i could say they were certainly wiser they knew that the things they enjoyed learning about werent necessarily safe i though couldntbe stopped and that was what had landed me in the situation i was in now i dreaded this phone call disappointment anger condescension were likely even so i also couldntlie to them it was just not in me i guess they had raised their daughter right enough the phone rang until the answering machine picked up this had been expected after all my parents never answered the phone it was likely it would be a telemarketer or even worse one of my father extended family wanting a loan or a place to stay in all likelihood one of my parents was home they would just wait until i announced who i was mom dad it highly likely that you re home so would you i was cut off by the abrupt termination of the answering machine my mother voice blaring over the phone her soft accent hard to hear since she was yelling it was always rare to hear my mother yell where have you been you call us and tell us that you re going to england for a few days that right and fine three weeks later you haventspoken to us once none of us can even get in contact with you even calling your office got us nothing i well aware you re a grown woman but even so you have to think of other people you have responsibilities to those around you after all we were worried thought maybe the sidhe had taken you you certainly have trouble enough following you around all the time i let my mother rant over the phone knowing well enough that it was best to let her go she did deserve it as well but i had to smile at the idea that the sidhe might have kidnapped me they were fairy folk elves and they certainly didntexist though a small voice in the back of my head questioned that logic hadnti just resurrected a dead man for the sake of a wizard who was to say the sidhe werent real as well i thought my mother might be pleased if she found out they were real she still had enough of her old superstitions from home are you done i asked during a pause are you all right she finally asked me all the anger at my disappearance gone with the one question worry and concern heavy in her voice i considered how things were going for me at the moment i had performed a black ritual brought a man back to life fallen unconscious for three weeks had a wound that hadnthealed yet and was now linked to the once dead man really the truth was i wasntall right i fine well lies like that were in a parent best interest at a time like this and i know you re lying she said sternly i could easily imagine her tugging on a lock of dark red hair glaring at the phone as if it was me it quite annoying that no matter how old you get how mature how grown up you act your parents can still see through you fine i not all right i did something you and dad are going to kill me for i performed a ritual i grimaced at the hiss i heard over the line it was an involved one too it included blood i didnt need to wait for the explosion that was going to cause aine siobhan mackinnion the full name always precedes the worst talking to you will ever get at any age i wonder if perhaps the hospital dropped you on your head when you were born that would be the only way to explain this to be stupid enough to get involved in a blood ritual i donteven want to ask what it was for i snorted softly that was certainly a lie she expected me to tell her what it was for knew i would do it it was a resurrection i had a clag a bhais the quiet on the other end of the line was ominous to say the least it actually exists then there was a note of wonder in my mother voice betraying her interest in the knowledge if not the actual practice of the ritual and the relic she certainly didntwant anything to do with the ritual but the relic well it was something that had been considered just a legend so hearing one existed i shouldnthave been surprised at her immediate interest of course i also shouldnthave been surprised at her quick change of direction a resurrection ritual are you daft i had thought you knew better after what you saw in china i thought you had gotten rid of those stupid ideas to answer the first question yes it did exist but it was destroyed in the performance of the ritual that wasntgoing to go down too well the idea of destroying a relic was not something mom would have liked and as for the second i think perhaps i am daft yes what went wrong she asked this with a note of certainty knowing that of course a ritual of this kind could not have come off without a single hitch actually the ritual went off without a problem i ended up unconscious though for three weeks hence why you haventheard from me not to mention the wound that was burning on my arm even as i spoke but perhaps i d just leave that little bit of information out of the way for the moment i was just calling to tell you i was all right in case you had called out the police to look for my body i joked this but the silence that met the comment suggested heavily that this had been a viable option not surprising really since dad was a police officer he easily could have called out his old friends anyway i going to be staying in england for a bit longer i ll call you though so you know i all right this time and you re keeping something from me again if this little resurrection of yours went smoothly at this my mother sounded skeptical not that i blamed her the idea of bringing someone back to life was a bit of a fantasy if it went well why do you need to stay over there you have work to do damn that incomparable pinpoint accuracy of a mother intuition well there was a little side effect i appear to be somehow linked to the man i brought back to life we cantbe more then 300 yards apart aine apparently i didntteach you well enough haventi told you time and time again when blood is involved bad things happen you should have easily remembered that using blood binds people together the criticism isntreally helpful at the moment mother i had since dropped into a chair in the hallway the phone painfully clutched in my hand my left arm was starting to burn a little uncomfortably i considered hanging up and finding draco but i wasntin the mood for another sarcastic session with the good doctor mom had a right after all to criticize me as well i need to come up with a way to break the connection any helpful comments mother was one of the best people to ask this question to after all after me she knew the most about the occult though unlike me she didnt publish books and papers go on lecture tours or hire herself out to people for advice she preferred low profiles for her this really was more of a hobby and i knew she would be able to help me which she did quickly listing off a few books that i should look into it was a bit closer then i had been at the start of the day i said goodbye then finally managing to end the call with a promise of calling to keep her up to date and of course dad as well since she would tell him everything the moment he got home i was just lucky he didnthave the number here since that call would be loud enough for everyone to hear things okay at home harry had left the kitchen and was looking at me strangely as i sat on the chair looking rather pale again he probably thought it was because of the call but it was just my body still not up to snuff if i had known their address before i would have told them you were all right that would have just made things worse i chuckled softly thinking of the image of harry potter telling my parents their little girl was in a coma after bringing someone back to life not everyday a fictional book character shows up at your door my parents might have ended up unconscious as well they re fine my mother is just a little displeased with what i did and concerned over the tie i have with mr black i really wish you d call him sirius he not a bad man and he hates the formal name too bad my life isntto make that man happy the mere mention of the man was making me annoyed after all the fight yesterday hadnt really endeared us to each other and today things had stayed just as bad i had managed to not see him too often but when i did snide comments abounded usually in regards to my previous lack of clothing you two are connected for the time being a short period if i have any say in the matter now can i go to the library or is he sulking somewhere refusing to let me go displeasure was obvious on harry face but he didnttry to argue with me anymore about his godfather of course he wasntpleased with the way things were but there was nothing i could really do about it at the moment the argument hadntsat well with me this was true but i was stubborn and since there was no movement to apologize from his side i wasntgoing to make the first move no he ll go as well harry gave me directions to guildhall library a local library that had a large collection of historical books and manuscripts it was probably going to be a better bet then a normal library with mostly fiction books i dontknow what harry had said to sirius but considering the fact that i traveled out of the house and made it all the way to the library which was over 500 yards away then obviously sirius was following somewhere behind me i didntreally care where he was the inconvenience comment still smarted i settled myself in at a table at the library and with the help of some of the librarians surrounded myself with a batch of books which may or may not hold the answer to mine and sirius problem i dont know how long i stayed there staring at book after book of what was turning out to be useless information about things that bared no importance to anything i needed to know the light had started to dim outside the windows and i wasntsure when the library itself closed but i was sure that i would be told by someone so i bared it no mind and continued to read until my eyes started to hurt i felt a tingle go down my back followed by a surprised jump as sirius rather unceremoniously dropped into the chair in front of me he looked rather put out his brows knit together even annoyed he still looked good enough to eat his hair was coming loose from it hold at his neck free pieces curling around his ears not to mention the muggle clothes harry had apparently provided for him looked wonderful who would have thought just an old blue shirt and a pair of normal jeans would have looked so tremendous how long are you going to stay here i would love to go home and eat his eyes looked over the table and the large pile of books covering the entire surface his voice was edged either annoyance or hunger likely both i had completely forgotten that he couldntmove more then 300 yards from me so he couldntgo home until i did i started out of my daze and realized that he was sitting there across from me and i was worried he shouldntbe out in public should he what are you doing out here i looked around waiting to see a policeman an auror or worse pop up i was just happy to know that the dementors had been disposed of in that seventh book you re a fugitive arentyou sirius laughed at this a deep sound that echoed through me and caused a rose colour to cross my cheeks harry didntmention that i suppose after voldemort was killed and peter was proven to have been alive all along i was cleared posthumously of course but the thought was nice so no scary aurors are going to pop up and drag me away i know how depressed you d be if i wasntaround wouldnthave my face to stare at all day i frowned at him now angry with myself for wasting even a minute to be worried about the insufferable man maybe if i was lucky a rogue wizard would arrive and deal with the man for me mr black you do realize what i trying to do here i know you dont want to be attached to me for the rest of your life i sighed rubbing my eyes tiredly they ached from hours of reading it was about time for me to go home but now that he suggested it i was determined to stay here for the rest of the night so occasionally i a bit stubborn i dontsuppose it would be that bad actually sirius mused softly but a smirk fell on his features at my confused look as long as you kept your mouth shut he had been quite close there to getting back on my good side but of course he had to go and ruin it i opened my mouth to show him exactly what my open mouth would do when he interrupted me it was a rather surprising question so i closed my mouth immediately and looked at him considering how did remus die a n well a chapter a day is my goal for this week we ll see though i just want to get it along further since it not even to a half way mark and i think i just heard you all collectively gasp yes this story is that long i shall try and keep it entertaining though this chapter is more of the book seven backstory in other words what i think shall happen so in this story it has happened dontyou just love the power of writers heh inu angelz thanks for the reassurance about the mary sue issue i too dontthink this is one granted the main character is oc and has some amazing abilities but she certainly not perfect and everyone wontfall in love with her maybe a bit of in lust though that just fun rheniel dontfeel bad about not remembering i just threw remus death at the end of the second chapter that was quite a while back chapter 12 how did remus die an question like that out of the blue he must have been thinking about this for a while not that it was surprising remus had been one of his best friends and the last one left alive at least that had been how it was right before he had died now suddenly sirius found himself alive again and remus was dead it was like a switching of fates i considered my response carefully dont you think you should ask harry that after all he actually knew him that exactly why i won t to him it personal to you it just something that happened in a book after all not to mention i think draco might curse me if i asked harry a painful question he was leaning back in his chair watching me normally his eyes were sort of playful but occasionally they looked pained and broken this was one of those moments i had winced at the statement of it being just a book it reminded me of the argument we had earlier as he had said everything i knew had just been out of a book including what i knew of him but he had a point about why he was asking me there would be no emotional dodging of the question i would just tell him what i had read but i did think carefully what i should say the look in sirius eyes was actually heartbreaking remus had been his last friend left alive so to come back and find out that the last reminder of your happy school days was dead well i know that must have been hard well as you would say he died well i kept my opinion on the matter to myself i still didntthink that any sort of dying could be called good in the final battle it ended up with him fighting against peter it seemed almost like divine intervention old friend against old friend my fingers were tapping across the hard wood of the table the expression on sirius face was still broken but there was a fire that burned in his eyes at even just the mere mention of peter pettigrew name glad to see that hatred had survived the grave from the books i could certainly understand the feeling i dont think anyone could read those books and not hate wormtail he had sold his friends out causing two of their deaths and one imprisonment in the worst wizard prison leaving the last of their friends alone peter had been given a silver hand by lord voldemort and i sure you know what silver is to werewolves my voice dropped slightly at the anguished expression on his face looking like he was to blame for it all i dontknow how he exactly came to that conclusion just that he believed if he had been around it would have been different i continued on trying quite hard to ignore the bright eyes in front of me peter killed him but remus cursed him with his last breath taking him with him if any death could be considered good i suppose that would be it without even realizing that i was doing it i had reached out to grasp sirius hand squeezing it gently the tears that were in his eyes threatened to spill but they didn t they stayed where they were making his eyes a bright and shining silver even as his eyes dropped to my hand over his i quickly pulled it away a pale blush colouring my cheeks so maybe he wasnta complete arrogant bastard i was learning well enough that i couldntlet the book make my judgements for me after all the man in front of me had to be different then the one i had read about thank you for telling me maybe i should go check out these harry potter books myself and see what happened he grinned the sad look gone from his eyes for the moment see how this woman described me i snorted softly closing the book that was open in front of me you might not be overly happy with the descriptions you didntexactly come out of it smelling like roses look i sorry for what i said earlier i paused in the process of standing up to stare at the apologetic looking man sitting across from me and he was penitent if the nervous wringing of his hands and the look in his eyes was any indication you just told me what you thought from what you had read there was no reason to call you stupid or tell you that you were an inconvenience or that any one could have done your job harry told me enough to know you were the only one they could find who could do it who even knew how so thank you i really wouldntbe here if you hadntdone it second only to an apology from draco malfoy was the surprise this was causing me but since he had been mature enough to apologize it was only right and fair of me to follow suit of course there was also the fact that i hadntfelt right since that argument i had wanted to apologize i had known better but being stubborn has it difficulties i sat back down sighing softly look you only got angry after i did granted though i dontexactly think everything i said was wrong but it was all based off a book someone else wrote someone who didntknow you just like i didnt actual observe you during that time i cantmake any judgement calls off it i can though say you ve acted like a cocky bastard since i ve met you i smiled at him and he just laughed softly in return a deep rumbling sound that echoed through me that fair enough everyone tells me i too cocky but here some real info for you instead of the money making stuff that woman wrote about you said i died thinking i was the hottest thing on earth believe me that not true i hated myself in the end i was miserable the only bright spot in my life was harry so i went out to save him at the ministry everything i did was for him it just happens to be in my nature to be a bit cocky it a black family thing i honestly didntthink bellatrix had what it took to kill me but as it was proven she did and i was a fool to have let her i ve regretted it every damn day since i woke up a week ago his voice was haunted he had the aura of a man who had spent thirteen years in azkaban who had been a fugitive who had seen everyone he cared about be killed who had died himself the broken look was back in his eyes and it was all i could do not to start crying myself the feelings coming from his were practically overpowering it was hard not to try and comfort him in whatever way i could think of in the end though i stayed quiet during this little speech from sirius black it was one thing for me to say that he had been an idiot but it was simply wrong to hear it from his own lips that broken look was breaking my own heart you werenta fool horrible things happen look what happened to dumbledore and remus i said softly looking him in the eye as he smiled slightly at me i needed the cocky sirius back he was easier to deal with now i really want to know how voldemort managed to kill dumbledore sirius asked a slightly surprised note in his voice harry mentioned it briefly but i couldntbelieve it the old man was supposed to live forever draco was going to kill him he couldntdo it so snape did it for him he had made a promise to your cousin narcissa i shrugged gently saying it all as simply as i could manage even though the subject matter itself was anything but simple sirius eyes had widened at draco mentioned role and my godson forgave draco i ll assume he had since they re he swallowed around what he was trying to say since they re shagging each other senseless i said innocently he glared at me but nodded looking like he found the entire idea distasteful they re rather cute together actually as long as you ignore draco exasperating personality but that aside draco was forgiven because he proved he wasntbad in the end he went against his entire families ideals to help harry find where voldemort was in the end after that you ll have to ask one of the two of them how they ended up together once you do please let me know i dying to find out how that happened i grinned he wrinkled his nose and shook his head his black hair falling into his face i think i shall leave that a mystery unanswered i not overly keen to hear the answer i shall live in the dark about that he tilted his head to look at me what about snivellus he sneered out the name a fire burning in his eyes like that when he had heard peter name ah well dontkill the messenger i put up my hands in protest since i knew well enough that he wasntgoing to like what i was going to say now he gone back to teaching potions at hogwarts i winced at the expected outburst this statement caused sirius had stood up suddenly banging his hands on the table only the sudden appearance of a librarian caused him to sit down again looking anything but apologetic the fire still burning hotly in his eyes the slimy grease ball killed dumbledore and he gets his job back did he get an award too he sneered as he asked the question well when put like that it did sound a bit surprising he did it to protect draco and he did it with the full agreement of dumbledore himself the old man as you called him did what he could to protect one of his students he knew draco was planning his death but he also knew that the boy could be saved dumbledore also realized his death was a necessary evil snape had made an unbreakable vow with your cousin it was either make draco kill or let snape do it the slimy git made good in the end he helped save harry and almost died because of that yes he has his old job back sirius sat there arms crossed muttering about what i had told him despite the redeemed factors it was impossible of him to think of snape in a good light apparently that feud had survived the grave as well i doubted the man muttering across from me would have thought good of the old potions master even if he had been the saviour reborn but you want more details or even definite facts you need to ask harry i shrugged and stood up collecting my books up after all my information is from that book which you have already pointed out has it faults though harry told me the major events were pretty much correct at my movement sirius had also stood helping me get all the books together there were certainly plenty of them not that any of them had helped too much even with my mother suggestions i was still finding it slow going the books around here just didnthold the information that would be relevant to mine and sirius problem any luck i knew from his pointed look at the old books lying out in front of me that he was referring to the side effect from the ritual just what had been on my own mind i shook my head sighing sadly he though just nodded at me not seeming to care at all then again why should he i after all was the one who couldntgo home he was fine for the moment i always find out what i set out to know i said confidently a n so another chapter another day i keeping up with my chapter a day promise and i quite gratified by the good reviews i ve been getting thank you all very much nesley ythefrown2day justbecauseisaidso i glad you all like the story hopefully people continue to like it if anyone has any random ideas let me know i always interested to hear what other people think chapter 14 so what do you think of the relationship between harry and draco sirius and i were walking back to 12 grimmauld place the sky dark the mood was even rather comfortable neither of us had started to argue with the other one since we had left the library frankly since the apologies back at the library we hadnthad any problems in fact we were getting along rather well i didntreally want that though i didntreally want a comfortable silence with the man hence the explosive question he didntanswer immediately and i glanced at him to see if he had even heard me from the frown on his face and the contemplative look in his eyes he had heard it was just taking him a little while to formulate a response to the question well i think that they re cute together and well suited i said into the silence not waiting to hear what he thought all right so i was trying to goad him a little i wasntreally that comfortable with a quiet and well behaved sirius black i have no right to have an opinion it happened while i was dead i dontknow this draco at all i dontknow what he did the answer he gave was far too deep and logical for my liking i sighed deeply getting me an amused look from sirius but what you really wanted to hear was that i disgusted my godson would associate at all with a malfoy i dontcare at all that he gay it just his choice of partner he stopped and looked at me his eyes piercing grey in the darkness that somewhat true but i also have seen enough to know that he makes harry happy so what else is really important he started to walk the answer had shocked me enough to pause my own movement and i had to run to catch up with sirius long strides do you want to know what i think not especially but i am confident that you re going to tell me either way his lips tilted up slightly his strides had slowed down though to match my own i wasntsure he was even aware that he was doing it i considered just keeping quiet then instead but he was right i did want to air my own opinions i a teacher i used to people listening to what i think i think harry saw a bit of you in draco i paused there almost for dramatic effect since it did cause the tall man walking next to me to stop and give me a searching look i knew he had no idea what i was talking about at all the connection was missing from his mind well you both ended up going against the morals and ideals of your whole family you were both destined to be on the dark lord side but you were against it and stood up for what you both believed in not to mention you re both vain egotistical little bastards i added in the last part to distract sirius from the compliments i had been giving him even if i hadntintended to the perfect blacks he smirked at me this time though you forgot too handsome for our own good i ignored that little jibe and continued to walk on see if i tried to be nice to the man again you have a point i suppose the smirk was wider now are you suggesting my godson had a thing for me you re impossible i groaned deciding that the man was trying to annoy me now draco had it harder you gave up your family but you didnteven really like them draco worshiped his father and loved his mother there was no response given to this so we continued to walk down the street people surrounding us going about their normal business muggles going to the store returning home from work out on the town it amazed me even after only being involved in the wizarding world for a couple months how people could live their lives in such ignorance ignorance is bliss i suppose i didntcompletely dislike my entire family sirius said into the quiet i stopped walking to turn and look at him again my eyes searching his face there was no indication though what he was thinking his face closed off from any ready interpretations feel free to tell me to shut up but what do you mean you didntdislike them they were all evil voldemort supporters there was a slight twisting to his lips bitter and unhappy they were still my family it hard to forget that not that i didnt try believe me his head tilted back eyes perusing the sky i couldnthelp but stare at him once again struck by how beautiful he was especially with moonlight shadowing his face i felt responsible for my brother i cared about him he just was lost to the rest of the family maybe it was my fault that he died i should have stopped him his voice trailed off the air had gone decidedly chilly in the late august month and certainly not from any natural weather patterns i shivered wrapping my arms around myself i ve seen your mother painting anyone growing up with that would have issues i tried to joke but my teeth were chattering from the sudden cold next to me sirius body had stilled instantly coiled ready to spring his eyes had left the sky and were now instead looking around us noticing the muggles in the streets the houses lining the street we were walking on the dark alleys sirius i whispered his posture was starting to worry me a quick hand motion from him though quieted me his nose sniffed on the air much like the canine he could be there something familiar nearby his brows knit together so closely they were almost one frustration plain across his face damn it my memory i cantremember what this is his wariness his frustration the cold in the air it all started to worry me even scare me slightly i didntwant to be out here anymore so i quietly slipped my hand into sirius the sudden warmth of skin on his dropped his hackles instead he looked down at me in surprise before apparently noticing the fear on my faces because his lips smiled slightly it nothing dontworry my mind has always been a bit forgetful he squeezed his hand over mind giving comfort with the small gesture before walking on with me beside him the air had lost the sudden chill reverting back instead to the last warmth of the summer night i wanted to improve the atmosphere since it was now charged with a dark feeling foreboding of things to come so for the rest of the trip back to the house i chattered on aimlessly talking about my job at the school my parents my friends even bringing up the annoying matt caulder and his repeated attempts to get me in the sack i didntthink sirius was really paying attention though every so often i noticed his eyes flitting around the street looking for something but the air stayed warm so i wasntworried so i remind you of this matt guy i blinked at him my mouth open about to say something about something that now i couldntremember apparently he had been listening to me you can i said simply having already decided that he didntreally remind me of the slimy pretentious blonde haired professor it one thing i wontmiss not going back to school right away his repeated attempts to trick me into a date and other things always following me around we had finally arrived back at the grim faced 12 grimmauld place the house certainly looked worse for wear it could really do with a fresh coat of paint maybe some flowers as well but i wondered if the house would even let anyone do that the paint would probably instantly crack the flowers wilt and die strange as it sounded the house probably liked it foreboding appearance houses can take on the mindset of their owners sometimes it definitely a good thing you cantgo back sirius muttered giving me a quick smile i blinked a few times at him trying to figure that little statement out when the front door opened suddenly draco standing looking strangely imposing in the doorway grey eyes moved down a blonde brow rose in amusement it either dogs or rabbits for you two isntit my brain didntget that joke immediately but suddenly i noticed where his eyes had gone straight to my hand which was still firmly in sirius larger one then i remembered his comments yesterday about us fighting like dogs or going at it like rabbits instantly i pulled my hand away scarlet suffusing my cheeks the grey eyes in front of me though lost their amusement in a matter of mere seconds looking at us seriously get in here we all need to talk now he turned quickly and strode back into the hall his robes flaring out around him it was all quite theatrical i might have laughed if he hadntbeen tremendously serious at that moment now quiet the air serious both of us entered the old house following draco in he led us into the kitchen really it was the only place comfortable enough sitting at the worn table in the center of the room sat harry he was staring down at a paper in front of him i could see where i sat the movements on the paper is that a wizarding paper i asked amazement in my voice imagine moving photographs now that would easily earn a muggle billions of dollars if they could come up with something like it the boy who lived looked up at me causing a hiss from sirius at my side harry eyes were a dark green fractured worry and despair flowing out of them his golden protector stood at his side sheltering the boy beside him it the daily prophet come have a look he waved us over pushing the paper over to us across from him i stared down at the picture on the front people were running looking frightened a strange emblem in the sky over them i didntquite understand what the picture showed but the headline was easy enough to get dark mark appears again terror returns i mused the headline out loud beside me sirius had gone still at the sight of the mark above the terrified people i suppose it was worse for the people who really understood what all this meant for my part i was merely scared because of their reactions this never happened before dark locks shook as he shook his head with each movement the scar appeared briefly on his forehead reminding me once again who had caused that i was amazed once more it was really not the pleasant looking mark that the pictures on the book covers showed or the makeup in the movies had presented it was an angry livid red mark it marred his otherwise perfect face no wonder he hid it with his bangs i knew he had returned my scar never had stopped hurting after i left school lucius confirmation of a last horcrux merely proved my own nightmares but no one else had known everyone had lived quite a happy last ten years this he thrust his hand out angrily at the moving picture this is worse then before worse but he done the dark mark before how is this time worse have people died draco took a newspaper off the kitchen counter and threw it down on top of the daily prophet this one didnthave any moving papers i recognized it as the daily mirror a muggle paper on the front a similar picture of the dark mark appeared the headline read strange fireworks released fire burns he did this in front of muggles there was an edge to sirius voice one that matched the looks of the two younger men in front of me five people died in the fires all muggles he skipped right over doing anything to the wizarding community and has gone straight to the muggles not that they have any idea what going on they re too oblivious to think the fire was more than just that too stupid to know what those fireworks were draco sneered at me but there was definite worry in his tone it almost smart actually he doesnthave to do anything to our community since the attacks on the muggles work on both sides the muggles will be scared and the wizards will be scared without him even toughing them well this was certainly worse wizards knew what this meant they knew how to prepare even how to try and fight it muggles well we on the other hand as draco put it are oblivious to this not that it exactly our fault the wizards do a good job of hiding so i cant help but feel worried for my fellow muggles well that that then i said firmly we need to destroy that last horcrux we draco sounded amused as if i could blame him there really wasnt anything i could do to help the look i gave him though was so completely unamused that for once he even kept quiet but the grey eyes sparkled with the unreleased mockery so you all know where this last horcrux is that ll be easy then sirius had sat down now and was listening to us all calmly we all turned to look at sirius as he said this my eyes certainly showed disbelief he had been awake for a week longer then i and apparently no one had even mentioned to him the reason for his resurrection i whirled on harry my eyes burning a n another chapter up and running isntit just swell one a day though it ll certainly slow down after the weekend when i go back to work need to think where to go and how to end this story as well hmm not that i donthave plenty of chapters between now and the end heh right well enjoy and as always please read and review and any ideas throw them my way chapter 15 harry leave him alone muggle there was certainly menace in draco voice as he protected harry but i went blindly on shut up draco even you realize that this has to be dealt with now i slammed my hand down on the table making harry jump slightly i brought him back to life for a reason i expected you to actually do what you said you were going to do voldemort is killing muggles they have no chance against him and you re what sitting on your hands good thing we have a the smooth skills of the muggle teacher here otherwise who knows what we would have done i dontknow maybe have been a bit more tactful the smirk on draco face was really itching to be wiped off what are you all talking about sirius was looking wary and confused at the three of us though his lips were smirking slightly after draco comments to me it was an interesting thing to explain to the older man why we had brought him back to life he likely hadntthought about it after all it had been his godson who loved him that would have been the entire reason for him i could see now why harry had a problem bringing it up to him sirius we brought you back to life because we need you to possibly remember something from the past that will help us defeat voldemort for good this time not that we dontlike you of course but if it wasntfor that we might not have brought you back at all that seemed a little harsh to say outloud i sat down now quiet like everyone else they all were likely trying to come up with something appropriate to say while sirius started to fidget in annoyance at us all even draco was staying quiet well i told you already that lord voldemort is still around well it because we didntknow about one last horcrux and well harry was fidgeting himself looking at draco for help lucius told me it had been stolen by someone who had been a death eater but who had left and been killed the only one who matched the bill was your brother so harry here thinks you might have an idea where it was hidden not that we didntwant to bring you back for other reasons i mean we all care about you it not just the horcrux i waved my hands up trying to not make things worse for sirius he looked at us all calmly before putting his face into his hands his shoulders shaking the idea of sirius crying was so foreign to us all that harry and i immediately jumped up to console him when a soft sound started to come from behind his hands at first it seemed to confirm our suspicions but it soon turned into a definite chuckle i smacked him hard on the shoulder going back to sit down muttering about stupid men sorry but was that it you were all so serious and that was all sirius took a deep breath and gave harry a pat on the arm before the younger boy sat down still looking worried i know harry loves me he glanced at me and smirked glad to know other people care as well i huffed audibly and looked away but i not going to cry that there might have been another reason i proud that harry used the opportunity to bring down voldemort instead of just using it for personal means i wouldnthave been to happy otherwise he grew thoughtful for a moment though i suppose i wouldnthave been alive otherwise to have been unhappy or not once again i had to say i was sort of surprised at how well sirius was dealing with this entire situation he had been dead for over ten years well i had to assume he had been dead the veil was a bit ambiguous and i wasntgoing to ask him particulars then he had been brought back to life to a completely changed world though watching draco so coldly making fun of sirius being dead at the moment perhaps not everything was different and then he was told the reason he came back was to help find something his brother stole maybe he wasntjust a charming reckless arrogant bastard so sirius had pushed his chair closer to mine ducking his head closer so he could whisper to me you care about me do you no definitely an arrogant bastard so sirius do you know anything about where your brother might have hidden something harry asked suddenly not nervous now that he knew his godfather was okay with it all i was just happy to have sirius attention diverted from me since i was trying hard to not get into anymore arguments with him but sometimes it was a bit difficult well reg and i werentexactly the model for brotherly love i wondered if anyone else heard the catch in his voice but it appeared that it passed everyone attention i ll have to assume he didnthide it here you would have found it by now i tapped my chin thoughtfully would they have found it after all they didnteven know what it was what it looked like was it possible that it was under their noses all this time and hadnteven noticed it i made this comment and just got looks from everyone do you think we re stupid draco said rolling his eyes we did a sensing spell on everything in this house even all the furniture if there had been something like a horcrux we would have found it he sounded like he was explaining this to a two year old which i suppose i basically was at least when it came to anything of a magical nature leave her alone draco i was surprised to hear sirius standing up for me she just a muggle how would she have known it was actually a perfectly sensible question to ask i was about to myself if harry wasntinvolved i would have been worried about your ability to even do a sensing spell hey old man i ll have you know i just as good as harry at spells you cantreally call me an old man anymore i only nine years older then you sirius smirked at draco crossing his arms over his chest a soft sound passed my lips a soft laugh that caused the two bickering men to look at me questioningly sorry it just funny only nine years older see if i stand up for you again sirius muttered looking at me darkly no it just i have a cousin who only four years younger then me and she calls me an old hag every stared at me hard before sirius eyebrow twitched up jealous definitely harry said agreeing with his godfather old hag draco snorted shaking his head my eyes were wide and i must have looked more then slightly confused did they think i was jealous of my younger cousin i was only 29 i hadnthit the jealous middle ages yet your cousin is obviously jealous of you you re too attractive to ever be called an old hag draco explained and i flushed slightly draco complimenting me was almost cause for a heart attack it ridiculous she obviously angry that her older cousin is absolutely perfect so she tried to ridicule you to make up for the envy sirius said seriously his words more so then draco s caused me to blush a bright red smitten draco said with a sigh definitely harry was agreeing again this time with draco who was looking back and forth between sirius and i surprisingly enough there was a light blush on the older man cheeks i meant that her cousin thinks she perfect he muttered of course cousin dear draco wasnthiding his snigger at all leave him alone draco he got a right to have a crush harry was smirking now as well i wondered if he had learned that from the young malfoy well i would have wondered that if it wasntfor the fact that i was more worried about the blazing heat emanating from my face from the conversation surrounding me i didntdare risk entering this conversation can we can we get back on topic now i stuttered out trying to get everyone off this subject the mood had improved though because of the digression and while we were all still worried about voldemort and what he was doing and planning darkness wasntsurrounding us at the moment i suppose making fun of me cheered everyone up glad i could help in some way you know my memory is still a little fuzzy perhaps that was another little side effect of the ritual but more likely it just had to do with the fact that he had been dead for over ten years that would make anyone memory less then perfect actually i was surprised that he even knew his own name we could all forgive a sluggish recall period my fingers were starting to tap across the wood on the table not that i was annoyed with sirius or impatient i was just nervous three sets of eyes settled on the movement of my fingers moving rhythmically across the grain you have a bit of a nervous habit there dontyou sirius sounded amused but his eyes stayed on my fingers i need to keep my hands busy most of the time draco smirked across the table and i opened my mouth to tell him to get rid of it when i noticed that sirius was trying very hard to not smirk and even harry looked ready to laugh all of you i huffed shaking my head men are all perverts there was something sirius said suddenly his posture changed from amusement to wary remembrance immediately the jovial atmosphere was gone and we all leaned forward expectant for what the older man was going to tell us the night he died i came here to see him i was worried about him he had just quit the death eaters and i wanted to give him my support after all the parents werentdoing that not surprising really the black family at least the mother being the only one i had any contact with didntseem very understanding in a normal family it would have problems about school liking girls whether or not you might be gay what college to go to no in this one it was the fact that the sons didntwant to be homicidal maniacs following an evil dark lord who wanted to take over the world next time i saw my parents i was going to tell them the easy time they actually had with me growing up sirius proceeded to tell us what had happened that night his vivid account making us all see what exactly had occurred that night reg are you here sirius bounded up the stairs looking round wildly for his brother finally he entered his brother bedroom to find his younger brother pacing wildly back and forth in the room the younger black had the look of his brother though at this moment his face was set in an expression of panic and his hair was long and unruly the back and forth movement of his body across the room was filled with confusion worry and absolute fright regulus sirius voice was soft in the room trying to calm his brother like one would do with a frightened colt do you realize what i ve done high pitched and nasally regulus voice broke as he spoke he ll come after me what i did he going to come he looked wildly about at each mention of the he a step was taken by sirius toward his brother before he seemed to realize that a comforting hug wasntwhat was needed you did the right thing though he evil he would have used you and then destroyed you bitter laughter floated across the room regulus digging his hands into his hair violently you really are stupid brother he is going to destroy me come with me then i can protect you and if not me someone else in the order dumbledore regulus eyes widened sudden realization crossing over his features at the mention of the old hogwart headmaster dumbledore yes maybe he could take it it possible he d know where to his ramblings broke off as the younger black seemed to realize he wasntalone in the room sirius a step was taken but he stopped looking around suddenly reg come with me it ll all be okay all right of course mother and father wontlet you back in here but i ll protect you a small smile appeared on regulus face small but still genuine you re the perfect gryffindor arentyou big brother i have to talk to dumbledore he stepped back again when i get back when i get back his confused face contorted up into a frightened face and before sirius could do anything he had disapparated out of the room i assumed he went to see dumbledore but he must not have because he died that night he was killed by a death eater sirius voice was quiet and everyone else at the table looked thoughtful harry eyes were filled with concern for his godfather and i could guess my own held the same expression i didntdo a very good job protecting my brother his laugh had a bitter ring to it well if you read into that conversation you had with him it possible he was talking about a horcrux i said sensibly getting back on topic and taking everyone attention away from sirius guilt over his brother isntit possible he went to hogwart to talk to dumbledore and then died on the way back draco fingers were now tapping across the wood on the table perhaps my own nervous habits were rubbing off does that mean we brought back the wrong person harry narrowed his eyes at draco looking like he was going to his the blonde man for saying that right in front of the wrong person draco harry voice was icy that not true we wouldnthave known about the conversation without sirius and it doesntmake sense anyway if regulus had given the horcrux to dumbledore he would have destroyed it or he would have told me before he died there no way he wouldnthave known what it was a line appeared between harry brows his mind working hard to figure out what had happened all right then so he didntgive it to dumbledore but we re pretty sure he went to see him draco sighed tired already of all of this and we can also be pretty sure he didnthave it on him when he was killed since father told me it was stolen so somewhere in between it got lost my eyes widened things clicking into place even as i saw harry face mirror my own a n i still stick that i uploaded a chapter a day even though i missed the 22nd but it only an hour after the day ended and i ll upload another chapter later tonight really i promise rheniel and inu angel z thanks for the reviews and continued excitement i sure people have been wondering where the story had been going well i finally go to an important point i like to pop them in every few chapters oh and as for the witching hour convention in salem i might be attending that all dependent on money though i wontbe going all week i want to meet charles de lint and tamora pierce and the idea of seeing mundane quidditch is intriguing anyway enjoy the new chapter chapter 16 he hid it at hogwarts harry exclaimed excited with the answer are you sure draco asked well he didntleave it with dumbledore and he didnthave it when he was killed and it pretty sure he went to hogwarts that night he might have changed his mind about seeing dumbledore but where better to hide something from the dark lord then hide it at the school i said aloud everything that was going through my head in the first book it mentioned with the philosopher stone that there was no place safer right draco nodded a little hesitant to be agreeing with me about anything next to me sirius was still quiet right then we just need to know where he hid it not hard at all draco huffed it just a bloody castle with god knows how many rooms sirius harry called out his godfather name quietly bringing the older man out of his thoughts you donthave any idea where your brother might have hid something a wry smile appeared on his lips you re lucky i could remember that one little memory things are still fuzzy up here he tapped his forehead looking worried though at his faulty mind there were some places i know he went to a lot but i cantbe certain where exactly it been too long since i ve been in the old school across from me i noticed harry eyes go wide and a sudden smile cross his lips he jumped up from the table suddenly making us all start what is it draco looked up one blonde brow raised in question i need to go see someone i ll be back soon without another word the young potter disapparated out of the room leaving us all staring at the spot he had just occupied in confusion beside me sirius was still quieter then i had grown used to it was actually rather annoying to me quiet sirius was against type and moody sirius was certainly something best left undiscovered so i bet your brother was better looking then you i said suddenly trying to raise his hackles on the other side of the table draco looked amused at me a small flicker of understanding knowing that i was making the comment to bring the older man out of his sulk no one is better looking then i am sirius huffed exactly as i would have expected except for me draco smiled examining his perfectly manicured nails with an expression of complete disregard oh he has a point there i nodded wisely draco better looking then you harry is too a pair of silver eyes turned to look at me closely and it was hard to control the shiver that threatened but i managed to look back at the older man calmly you just have a soft spot for the boys he wasntbeing moody anymore crossing his arms and looking put out by the entire conversation yes i do have a soft spot for the two of them i smiled slightly at him what about me sirius leaned in closer to me a veiled expression in his eyes his arms having fallen to his sides in the soft light from the kitchen lights he looked at once vulnerable and mysterious my eyes dropped to his lips for a moment before raising back to look him in the eyes determined to hold the look you re a sore spot i was surprised to hear the deep laughter ringing out over the room expecting to hear it coming from draco but instead it was sirius being so amused by my comment well at least he wasntsulking anymore after a few minutes it became apparent that harry wasntgoing to come straight back so the only logical thing was to have some dinner or at least it became the logical thing to do when both sirius and my stomachs started to growl we had spent pretty much the entire day at the library well i had spent the day there sirius had been dragged along literally i chose to make dinner for the two of us since draco sitting at the table his fingers tapping nervously on the wood had pointed out that he and harry had eaten earlier there really wasntmuch to work with in this kitchen but i managed to find some chicken lettuce and tomatoes i placed the dinner in front of sirius and sat down to eat my own portion aine sirius had the fork positioned near his mouth apparently right after having taken a bite this is quite possibly the worst thing i have ever eaten in my life he grabbed a napkin and coughed out the offending food into it i wasntsurprised by the silken laughter that came from draco it not that bad i ate a bite and didntsee what the problem was at all a pale hand clutching a fork sneaked over my plate and speared a piece of the chicken i looked over to see draco in the process of eating the piece the look on his face was one i would have normally been amused to see his eyes bugged out and if it was possible his face got even paler he followed sirius example and quickly coughed out the piece of meat what the hell he dropped the fork and quickly conjured up a glass of water downing it in a matter of seconds glancing to my side sirius had done the same thing that was toxic are all muggles taught to cook like this i was still quietly eating my own meal completely clueless as to what they were all saying sure it lacked some taste but then i didnthave much to work with here that wasntmy fault and granted the chicken maybe wasntcooked completely and that sauce i had made up from ketchup and vinegar was a bit acidic but it was what i ate most of the time and i didntnotice anything seriously wrong if you dontlike it donteat it of course both men said simultaneously a sandwich was quickly made by sirius and he happily ate that though i heard him grumbling about the outside of the package not matching the inside i ignored that if you get married do your husband a favour and never cook draco said drily a small twist to his lips indicating he hadnt forgotten the taste yet he was on his sixth glass of water we could always send her to voldemort as his chef that would put him out of commission in no time my eye was starting to twitch no one else had ever complained about my cooking though after meals at my house my parents and friends always had to go to the bathroom straight after eating you know i going to put you out of com my retort to sirius was cut off as harry apparated without warning back into the kitchen next time you plan on leaving tell me draco reprimanded harry but the green eyed man just shrugged the comment off instead looking at sirius i ve got you a job a n another chapter thanks for reading and enjoying finally i getting them where i want them to go chapter 17 i ve got you a job silence echoed through the kitchen most likely derived from absolute confusion meeting harry statement after discussing the killings of muggles the last horcrux and defeating voldemort harry had ran out to go find sirius a job i think the slytherin is starting to infect you with his idiocy sirius said the look from draco wasntamused harry waved his hand and took a seat at the table again it not stupid we figured out that the likely place for regulus to have hid the horcrux was at hogwarts correct at our silent nods he continued so i got sirius a job there what in the kitchens draco snorted no as the new defense against the dark arts teacher i just cleared it with headmistress mcgonagall s i heard a combined sound of fingers tapping on the table and looked down to realize they were my own and draco as well i really think i had infected him with my own nervous habit harry school season starts in like five days how did you pull off having her give him a job like that on short notice a satisfied smile settled onto harry face she actually been looking for awhile no one wants the job with the dark mark having just appeared it a cursed position so i suggested sirius here he leaned back in his chair toying with the fabric on his shirt i didnttell her the truth exactly which explains why you needed to get me a job otherwise you could have just asked to let us look for the horcrux there was a definite reprimand in sirius voice that harry would go about all this without asking anyone else or including others he was acting like a lone hero once again well the less people who know the less chance that voldemort finds out what we re doing i snorted rather loudly at this little statement it earned me looks from everyone at the table sorry but honestly harry sirius is alive which is a large sign pointing to what you re doing voldemort of course knows regulus stole the horcrux and i sure he also figured out the likely place it hidden you re going to have competition looking for it a gloom set over the room once again realizing that what i had said was correct i hate it when the muggle right draco muttered but she is though i happen to think it a good idea to send sirius in as a teacher he needs a reason to be there since it likely to take him longer then one day to find where his brother hid the thing a smirk had reappeared on draco perfect lips though everyone is forgetting something he pointed at me she cantcut herself from sirius he goes she has to and how are you going to explain a muggle at hogwarts a twin for draco smirk appeared on harry his eyes glittering dangerously i was suddenly quite worried she going to work there as well silence was once again the norm as everyone digested that little piece of information until suddenly draco and sirius started to laugh at the absurdity of it i quickly joined in with them thinking that harry perhaps had lost part of his brain in the apparating process headmistress has been looking for a muggles studies teacher since the last one left to travel around america discovering the truth behind rodgers and hammerstein films truth behind old american musicals well that teacher was going to have a problem if she expected to find a whole community in oklahoma that broke into song about how beautiful the morning was or about their surreys you mean she going to be the muggle studies teacher sirius sounded flabbergasted well who better to teach the subject then a muggle that what i explained to mcgonagall she wasntreally pleased with the idea but i vouched for aine and explained that i would have of course but a charm on her that would wipe her memory if she tried to tell anyone anything about the wizarding community i narrowed my eyes on the dark haired man sitting across from me looking rather smug with himself my brown eyes glittered rather dangerously as i asked my next question did you of course not green eyes had widened in surprise apparently shocked that i would even think any such thing but i had to reassure mcgonagall this is ridiculous next to me sirius had his arms crossed over his chest i going to go work at hogwarts in the hopes that i will remember or perhaps accidentally fall over the hiding place for the last horcrux she he jerked his thumb in my direction has to work there as well since she cantget away from me dontyou think it might be a better idea if you went instead or maybe just explained to mcgonagall what you need and then she gets involved steel echoed in harry voice i glanced at draco and saw him shrugging his shoulder indicating that when harry was like this there was no winning the fight so donteven try you three are the only ones who know who are ever going to know if it wasntfor the damned side effect i d have aine back home safely now my nails had dug into the wood of the table my hands clenching without my even knowing it just at the mention of being safe at home would i really have been safe at home after all death eaters had invaded my flat and killed cairn there so they knew who i was they knew likely as well what i was doing and what i had done so there was no definite guarantee that when i went home i would be safe either strange as it was i was probably safer in the eye of the storm rather then on the outskirts and hell if i couldntgo home at least i could do something with myself and teaching after all was what i normally did fine sirius sighed resigned now to go along with whatever harry thought was best by the way if you didnttell the truth how did you explain my sudden liveliness corpses are generally not the best teachers i dontknow i had quite a few lifeless teachers in school usually gave me time to do my own studying my comments were ignored by everyone well fine if they didntwant good humour then that was their problem unexplainable the veil just kicked you out harry shrugged it is in the department of mysteries you found yourself out of the veil and came home like you normally would do and i found you that was far too simple to be believed though i guess those are the best lies the ones that are just kept free from too many complications so when do we leave tomorrow you ll get settled before the students arrive a sudden thought came to me that gave me pause and made me think quite hard it was something that had certainly occupied my mind while i was reading the books so long ago and now it was a distinct possibility do i get to be sorted a n i do love this whole updating every day thing it gets the story so far along though i do apologize for the smaller then normal chapter sizes but i wouldntwant to use up what i have written too quickly and not be able to update not to mention the chapters break nicely i super happy that people like the way this story is going i needed to get them to hogwarts after all harry potter is basically about the school characters are almost incidental sometimes every book centers there hence my refusal to accept that harry wontgo back in book seven and as for the whole sorting thing well this chapter sort of explains my feelings on that but for rheniel there is no reason to be sorted that the fun this chapter introduces my second favourite character i just hope i can write them well enough well we ll see i ve been excited writing waiting to be able to get them in here so much fun so i noticed a few too many mistakes so i fixed this chapter chapter 18 you know there was no reason for you all to laugh i muttered as sirius and i walked up the path to hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry i had already had my moment of awe back when the castle first came into view castles were nothing new to me i had gone all over the world and seen plenty of them but this particular one was different aside from the odd shaped turrets and twisting architecture that seemed ponderous it was hogwarts it was just amazing for it to be standing in front of me it was amazing to look around me and see what the book had been based on reading about it is one thing but seeing the real thing made things completely different being able to see the large lake that had merpeople and giant squids living in it to see the forbidden forest home of centaurs giants spiders and a large giant to see the road leading down into hogsmeade village where honeyduke s zonko and the shrieking shack was as i looked at the overpowering castle i half expected to see a trio of teenagers flying out of the grounds i half imagined seeing three youths of varying hair colour causing mischief wherever they want but that was in a book the real things were far away living their new lives as adults it was a little disappointing to realize sirius had laughed at me seeing the gamut of emotions that had run over my face but i could see the look in his eyes seeing his old school once again no doubt there were plenty of memories flowing through his head about his time with the other marauders here it was a sobering thought though since all three other members were long since dead maybe having sirius come to hogwarts again wasnt particularly a kind thing to do to him well the idea of a muggle being sorted is just preposterous sirius replied back to my first statement and shifted the bag he was carrying over his shoulder taking such strides with his long legs that i had to take two to just keep up well i will be a teacher it not that ridiculous a muggle teacher sulking wasntsomething i did but there was a distinct sulk to my posture as i heaved my own bag up the path i dontsee why we couldntapparate you cantapparate within the grounds sirius sighed expecting me to know that granted maybe i should have it had been mentioned in the books enough times the rest of the trip up the stone path was quiet sirius was deep in thought about something and i was still focusing on why i couldnt get sorted i just wanted to know what house i would have been in was it so hard for him to realize i had read the books and like i sure so many other people i had wondered what kind of person i was was i brave loyal smart cunning or was i just a hopeless case who had none of the qualities needed to go to hogwarts a sudden back in front of me broke me out of my thoughts even as i collided with sirius strong back i couldntstop the immediate flare of my senses at even the accidental touch snivellus there was enough cold dripping off that one word that i found myself almost frozen to the spot but my curiousity got the better of me and i moved to the side to see around sirius and stared at the object of his hatred so this was severus snape the hated potions master head of slytherin double agent in the battle murderer of dumbledore and redeemed hero all the descriptions of the man in the books had been rather unkind if i was any judge apparently the author wasnt overly fond of the man and like she had dealt with draco had painted a rather unkind portrait of him his skin was pale his nose slightly pointed and his black hair which fell to his shoulders was completely straight he resembled a dark feathered hawk well with that skin maybe a penguin but he really wasnt as greasy as i had expected from my previous knowledge from that book the hair wasntexactly shining like in a shampoo commercial nor was he going to be a spokesman for skin care products and there was certainly a earthy smell which floated in the air around him but if he was mixing potions all the time that was to be expected all in all he wasntbad looking though i couldnthelp but think that he would be more attractive if he wasntlooking down his nose at the two of us his eyes glittering black orbs in the pale skin tremendously unlucky that the veil had to spit you back out black apparently it had good taste for you to have left it disgusted enough to disgorge you the silken voice was cold hatred blatant for the new defense against the dark arts teacher well we all canthave your cleaning habits to smell like roses sirius snapped his fingers wait you dont have cleaning habits a full few minutes of glaring accompanied this little back and forth which wasnthelping me at all since i wanted to go sit down and put my bag away i sure everyone has heard of the unicorn and the lion this was sort of like that just substitute a tired grumpy dog and a cold superior penguin and well you have an idea of the scene i was looking at if the testosterone can stop flying for five seconds can we go inside two sets of angry eyes focused on me causing me to shiver whether from having the two men eyes on me or from the fact that either of them could hex me into the ground i should have been worried that the former was the more likely a graceful brow rose at me suddenly aware of my presence who are you sirius could never have accomplished that offhand tone so completely demanding of an answer but not caring of the response aine mackinnion i the new muggles studies teacher pleasure to meet you i smiled at him and held my hand out to be shaken as i would assume was common courtesy there was a narrowing of his eyes on me which flickered from my smile to the hand held out to him a muggle snape sneered once he realized who i was or more importantly who i wasn t i wasnta witch so therefore who cares hogwarts has certainly gone down the drain to let your kind in here like you should talk you are a half blood i muttered taking back my hand and the offer of any sort of friendship with the man seemed to be unlikely to take root so the books had exaggerated his disgusting appearance since he was at least moderately attractive but how a person acts is important and perhaps that had ben portrayed rather well personality is well look at sirius he was gorgeous but i wasntgoing to get involved with him since he acted like a womanizer all the time just my luck that the men i met were all either gay womanizers or slimy bastards reading books are we he took a step toward me which only made me react by stepping closer to sirius it was an involuntary action my feet just moved before i could think i wasntexactly thrilled with my body reaction it was doing this a lot there was no reason to appear afraid of snape and there was every reason to make sure he didntthink i was afraid frowning slightly i stepped away from sirius and brought my eyes up to look at snape directly i dontknow if it surprised him or not his expression never changed leave her alone snape or it will be snipped his eyes flickered down snape body explaining the point of his threat i was just going to take her up on the handshake from before without any preamble my hand was taken and a rather light dry kiss was placed on the topside of it his eyes never leaving mine for no reason whatsoever i found myself blushing maybe it was those usual shivers that were back again hopefully sirius hadntnotice that little slip though judging by the hard look i was receiving he had muggles should be careful at this school especially of some people women especially should be careful snape stood up straight no trace of any smile on his lips at his words seriousness was the only thing i could be certain about him his warning was to be taken seriously i grabbed back my hand annoyed at having let him touch me at all the flickering of the slytherin potions master eyes to sirius standing next to me suggested that his warning was related to sirius in some way though i have a feeling it was the women comment that was meant to be directed his way tormenting muggles so much like your master arentyou the sneer in sirius voice indicated his feelings on the warning i not a dog like you black i donthave a master suddenly sirius had gripped snape shoulder tightly and had moved in close to him whispering in his ear it was such an intimate gesture one that didntmatch the venom laced words that flowed out of sirius mouth and into snape ear you must know about the dark mark appearing your master is back for you a n well this shall be the last of the daily updates i start back at work tomorrow so new chapters will go back to being every few days or so so this chapter is longer then the others rheenan ah the dynamics of him kissing her hand it made sense when i wrote it and the threat well snape doesntlike sirius and other things come into play later on but anyway thank you for the review and thank you even more for the comments on snape i suffer from a certain problem when it comes to fanfiction that is quite normal among writers i tend to find some characters hard to portray correctly and snape is one of them for me i adore him but his character can sometimes elude me so please feel free to tell me all your ideas on him that goes for everyone i can always use all the help i can get chapter 19 sirius voice was cold smooth and threatening even to my ears and it wasnt even intended to me a look of panic quickly crossed snape face not to be seen by sirius but i noticed it fear wasntjust a muggle commodity there was certainly a flash of fear in snape eyes and i couldntlet this continue draco had made me promise aine i turned from the door about to go out it and meet sirius who was waiting outside to leave for hogwarts i just rose an eyebrow at the slytherin and looked at the door i need you to do me a favor draco voice sounded displeased even saying the word much less asking me to do it oh i need to go mark my calendar sarcasm dripped from my voice just shut up and listen i muttered that this wasntgoing to get me ready to accept doing him a favor generally people had to be nice for them to concede severus is at hogwarts and you probably know enough by now that sirius hates him really really hates him my look was unconcerned while i didntexactly hold any grudges against severus snape after reading the books i could easily see why sirius did the man had after all been responsible at least partly for the deaths of the potters he had made harry school life miserable and he had killed dumbledore it wasntexactly like sirius was out of the blue angry with the potions master and this was even without him knowing that snape had been the one to tell voldemort about the prophecy that got his friends killed i suggested all this to draco who just shrugged he paid for his mistakes he protected me and now i asking that you do me a favor and look out for him i worried that sirius is going to try and do something to him in payback you re the only one there that might be able to control him i had to laugh at this idea there was no way i was going to be able to control a man who was a foot taller then me and a wizard to boot i believe your old head of house is perfectly capable of taking care of himself this was completely true if the books were even remotely true then professor snape was as capable of destroying anyone who threatened him my help was not needed and even more likely it would be sneered upon that right but i dontput it past that dog to do something underhanded i just asking you to keep an eye on him so i was the spy and apparently the protector neither were roles i had ever expected to play or thought i was suited for i pointed this out to draco who just sighed softly just try the sincerity in draco voice stopped my laughter after all him asking a favor was a serious issue it wouldntsurprise me if this was the first time so the least i could do was agree fine i ll try and keep the dogs from ripping each other throats out oh i dontcare what happens to sirius draco smirked feeling completely okay with whatever his former head of house would do to sirius i ignored the comment though knowing full well that if anything happened to sirius harry would be unconsolable and then draco would suffer he didntreally mean it you re going to owe me one large favor though i reached out and grabbed the back of sirius robes and forcibly pulled him off of snape who still had the look of a deer caught in the headlights leave him alone black i pushed sirius ahead of me making him continue on into the castle despite his complaints about my behaviour i tired and your little fights are delaying me getting something to eat and a place to sit down i paused next to snape who had regained his icy calm the dark mark doesntnecessarily mean he back for you for some reason i found myself trying to reassure the man even though he had been anything except nice to me but i found myself quite easily sympathizing with him after all his former master was alive and there was no doubt that there were certain people he was going to want revenge against and former followers who betrayed him and helped destroy his plans would be high on the list but this didnt mean he had to think that i dontneed your ideas on the matter with a quick turn and flip of the robes snape moved past me and sirius into the castle i was quite positive that draco had learned that dramatic exit from his old head of house well kindness wasntalways going to be repaid i surrounded by enigmatic men i enigmatic sirius asked sounding amused already having forgotten about the run in with his childhood nemesis no you re just stupid i rolled my eyes at even the thought of sirius black being enigmatic he was easier to read then a dick and jane book and just as uncomplicated shouldnt speak to teachers like that ignoring him completely i walked into the castle but realized the second i was through the front doors that i had no idea where i was supposed to go suddenly a pop sounded in front of me and i stared in shock at a strange creature it looked strangely like a smaller more wrinkled version of my grandmother had her fashion sense too since it was wearing a tea cozie on its head though it smelled much better then old nana she had smelled like cabbage at least this creature smelt like patchouli interesting dobby is to take you up to headmistress oh you re dobby i smiled brightly at the smaller creature now recognizing it as a house elf though this one had its freedom i aine the new muggle studies teacher i a friend of harry s apparently people didntnormally introduce themselves to house elves because there was a supremely surprised look on dobby face until i mentioned harry i figured that might smooth things over a bit at my back sirius had appeared and was eyeing the house elf you know the great harry potter welcome welcome he bounced around excitedly in front of us yes yes that sirius black i pointed back at the man standing there a brow raised he a teacher now as well and he harry godfather an awed expression came over the little house elves features no doubt he knew enough about harry godfather and his death there was every right to be awed to meet a dead man to be near so many people who know the great harry potter dobby is not worthy enough without any warning dobby dropped to the floor and began bashing his head into the stones i was horrified and grabbed him pulling him to his feet even though he struggled a bit apparently the house elf attitude still hadntleft him completely he was too quick to punish himself for the smallest things dobby a commanding voice came from the top of the stairs and dobby cringed slightly i knew the voice well enough by now to know snape had appeared again the headmistress would like to see them before the students arrive he sighed like he was having to do a horrible chore i ll take them up i know the way well enough sirius voice was biting once again true to form though snape let sirius attitude roll off his back you d probably get lost see something shiny and get distracted i coughed trying to not let the laugh that was threatening to get past my lips but sirius turned his glare on me noticing the smile on my lips that i couldntwipe off completely well it was funny i huffed defending myself grabbing my bag i shouldered it and started up the stairs to meet snape at the top who was looking at me suspiciously apparently if i had come here with sirius then i was expected to take his side in everything men are you coming sirius or do you think it a good idea to piss off your boss before you even start though it might be best to let her know what she getting into i stood at the top of the stairs tapping my foot at the glowering raven haired man staring up at me he stood silently there looking torn between letting me win the fight and getting in trouble you wouldntwant to screw things up would you he and i both knew what i was referring to some things were more important though he took a little reminding a few moments passed and he grudgingly started to stomp up the stairs reminding me of a little child have him potty trained as well there was an underlying thread of amusement in snape voice looking sideways at him i noticed a small note of appreciation for me anyone who could make sirius do what they wanted immediately garnered snape approval well that would make my job much easier i didntwant the potions master on my back the entire time i was here though there were certain other things that popped in my head but those were quickly locked away at the slytherin statement sirius stopped short on the stairs only a few steps from reaching the top well their rivalry was a tad childish now sirius was going to dig his heels in just because snape had insinuated that i had him controlled professor snape unlike you he had his full shots and knows how to use the facilities i tapped my foot faster practically choking on all the testosterone that was flying about so i had annoyed snape but got sirius to move again there was just not going to be a win win solution to this problem it was going to be a back and forth between the two of them make snape happy make black happy or i could just go for the third option dobby at my use of his name a small pop indicated that the small house elf was in front of me again i crouched down in front of him smiling reassuringly at him hoping not to cause another outburst can you show me the way i think we ll leave the boys to roll around in the mud or whatever it is they do nodding eagerly dobby started to move on and i followed fully aware that the men were left standing at the top of the stairs but they both knew how to get to the office so i wasntconcerned i rather liked the third option full on unconcern for either of them is she normally like that i heard snape icy voice from behind me and before i turned the corner and was out of range i heard sirius reply worse well he was certainly going to pay for that one later headmistress mcgonagall was certainly a person i wouldntwant to cross she was the epitome of strict with her hair back in it severe bun square glasses covering dark beady eyes and the pursing of her lips as she looked me over i was a teacher here and at this exact moment i instead felt like a child who d been caught out after dark it a pleasure to meet you headmistress i aine mackinnion i wasntcertain if i should be curtseying or if i should just stick my hand out to be shook i opted to do neither she didntseem the type to want a formal curtsey nor the type to just shake my hand you re quite pretty thank you ma am that not a good thing she sighed heavily and walked back around the desk sitting in the chair behind it she was now watching me a judging look in her eyes her hands steepled in front of her the students are going to have a fun time with you and as a muggle you re not going to be able to stop them she leaned back in the chair looking tired i dontthink this was a good idea but since my last teacher left abruptly i had no choice mr potter vouches for you so that good enough now werentyou supposed to have my other new teacher with you an eyebrow was raised sirius black is having a spitting contest with professor snape i smiled at her knowing that another woman would understand my point i didntthink you wanted to wait so i came ahead the sigh that came from her lips then was a knowing one fully aware of the relationship that the two men had with each other at that moment a knock came on the door and after her terse reply to it snape and sirius both walked into the office neither of them looked damaged so they had apparently controlled their urges to kill and maim one another you re late mr black mcgonagall voice was cold but she looked amazed to even see him standing there but i suppose after being dead i can let you be late once just dontmake it a habit flourishing a mock bow sirius winked at the headmistress a roguish grin set on his features behind him severus stood by the door apparently unamused by both his superior s and sirius antics you both then know severus now i certainly didntimagine the strained way in which she had said his name apparently sirius wasnt the only one to hold grudges against the potions master he the deputy headmaster that was certainly surprising she didnt like him but he held that much power sirius snorted sirius please shut up i cut him off before he could say anything else that would get him in deeper with professor snape headmistress i was wondering something the glass covered eyes focused on me questioning my eyes though had lighted upon the old tattered hat sitting rather innocuously on the edge of her desk i knew that sirius had found the idea of me being sorted rather amusing but it was something i just had to know it had driven me crazy while reading the books and now here was the chance to actually find out what house i would be in yes miss mackinnion i know i not a student or even a witch but i was wondering if i could try that hat on i d love to know which house it would sort me in to i expected sirius amused laughter mcgonagall looked curious and i didnteven bother looking behind me at severus snape i could guess he would think it a ridiculous idea i dontsee why not i smiled brightly at my new boss and reached out to grab the disreputable looking old hat placing it firmly on my head i knew what the hat did but it was still a surprise when i heard a man voice in my head a muggle there was a pause there a first time for everything i suppose just curious are you i opened my mouth to respond before remembering that the voice was inside my head so all i had to do was think my agreement with him well then where to place a muggle who isntactually going to be placed amused men surrounded me all the time even a hat was amused with me this was getting ridiculous you re not smart enough to be in ravenclaw i didntagree with that and let the hat know that after all i was the foremost expert in my field and i was a teacher at nyu of course i was smart you re smart enough in what you like but no one would call you smart not with grades like those he was referring to my school grades which it true were less then brilliant most classes i scrapped by with a c only in subjects i liked and thought worth my time did i do any better history was good math and science well suffice it to say i was never going to become a scientist and though you re certainly brave at times you re not courageous enough to really be placed in gryffindor and you re certainly not patient enough for hufflepuff even though you re hardworking at certain things i was beginning to not like this hat he hadntreally said anything nice about me i was sort of this and sort of that but nothing really one way or the other i d say slytherin you re certainly adept at getting what you want arentyou quite devious for a muggle that incident in elementary school with the puppy was certainly genius but too bad about that you could never be in that house you re not pureblood and that a requirement i hope i satiated your curiousity little muggle unsortable the hat said into the silence as i took the hat off and placed it back on mcgonagall desk everyone in the room seemed rather surprised by that end result apparently the hat had never failed to sort anyone before though he also hadnt had a muggle to deal with well nothing to worry about it not like you had to be placed in a house sirius patted me on the shoulder apparently trying to comfort me we had a nice little chat in my head i smirked slightly apparently i would have gone perfectly in slytherin it just the little problem of my blood i shrugged perfectly okay with that result when i had read the books so long ago any of the houses other then hufflepuff would have been okay i never could get past the idea that all the rest went into hufflepuff and the idea of having my emblem being a badger well it was rather silly yellow was not my colour either glancing at sirius i could see that he was practically sickened by the idea of me being perfect for slytherin behind him though snape looked enigmatic about the idea if you re through the headmistress looked was eager to just finish up this meeting i could say i agreed with her since at that moment my stomach growled quite loudly i hadnteaten since breakfast so long ago the students arrive in a week by then i expect you to get to know the castle well enough that you dontget lost it certainly wonthelp you with the students if you cant find your class this mainly refers to you miss mackinnion since mr black went to school here i shall also expect a copy of your lesson plan on my desk in a couple days well i was certainly happy that my job as a muggle teacher at a school for witchcraft and wizardry was going to go along at least to start like i was used to though the main question was what was i going to teach these students what a car was how to use a blender how to make coffee do you have the lesson plans from the former teacher i d like to know what previous years have learnt she seemed pleased by my serious question expecting me to have a less then stellar work ethic apparently well i had shown up with sirius black in tow i knew without a doubt that he was just going to do his classes off the cuff i ll send them along to you tomorrow now professor snape shall show you to your quarters well that brought up an interesting dilemma after all sirius and i couldntbe more then 300 yards apart i didntwant to really ask the question but it was best to get it out in the open instead of trying to explain why i couldntmake it all the way to my room um how close are sirius rooms and mine i blushed slightly at the judging looks i was receiving from the headmistress and i felt a little ashamed at the dark look i was getting from snape behind me i could feel his eyes burning holes into the back of my head the two of you arentinvolved are you she was definitely not pleased with the idea not wanting her teachers to get into a relationship yes no sirius and i spoke simultaneously when i heard his response i elbowed him sharply in the side completely unamused by his joking statement we are not involved at all i glared at him just daring him to say something else it just that well there was a little misfire on one of his spells and now i kind of not allowed to get more then 300 yards from him a little fuzzy with spell work after being dead are we black snape voice dripped sarcasm the situation wasntfunny but i had to admit it was always amusing to tease mr black even if when i did it it was for fun professor snape had completely different reasons well you should probably work on getting that reversed mcgonagall though sounded rather amused at the situation there shouldnt be a problem though miss mackinnion your quarters i believe are down in the dungeons and mr black are on the first floor that should be within this required distance of yours severus shall show you down and dobby will show you down mr black i noticed sirius about to jump down someone throat at the mention of being shown my rooms by severus or where they were located so i jumped in before he could say anything really the man had no care when it came to a job thank you professor mcgonagall that sounds fine my foot found sirius shin rather sharply causing a hiss from the man i ve had a small dinner sent to each of your rooms since i assumed you were hungry and tired she hadntmissed the episode between my foot and sirius shin but apparently she was keeping quiet on the matter though behind her glasses her eyes sparkled with amusement that last statement seemed to be our signal to leave so i said good night and left the room sirius and severus doing the same behind me a yawn sneaked its way past my lips and i realized that really aside from being hungry i was also quite tired i couldntwait to see my rooms and more importantly my bed turning around i started to ask severus to show me to my rooms when i noticed that once again him and sirius were glaring at each other well truth be told sirius was glaring professor snape was looking bored apparently trying to prove that wandless magic could turn the other into a toad what was the old saying boys will be boys would the two of you like to perhaps whip them out and i could measure them for you i asked drily this got their attention and as i would have expected sirius looked rather pleased with the idea you could measure mine in private that disgusting black both severus and i said at the same time i shrugged at the potions master grinning slightly he always like that but he can be rather endearing when he wants to be i patted sirius arm warmly now why dontyou go to your rooms dobby i am sure is waiting i happen to be exhausted so if you can stop having a macho man contest with severus he can show me to my rooms there seemed to be a moment hesitation before sirius sighed deeply and nodded just be careful around him it was rather endearing that he thought he needed to protect me and i suppose he had every right to be worried after all professor snape had killed dumbledore no matter for what reasons a murder was a murder and sirius at least was doubtful about his ties to voldemort and he just plain didntlike the man of course that last one was completely mutual snape had enough reason to dislike sirius for making fun of him during school and almost getting him killed by lupin as a werewolf but the feeling of protection was still rather sweet of course rather impulsively i went onto tiptoe and gave him a quick kiss on the cheek good night professor black i walked out of the room rather sure that professor snape would follow after me he did and i quickly let him take the lead showing me down to the dungeons no one said anything for quite a while and the silence at least was comfortable when we finally reached my rooms he paused at the door looking ready to say something i sure you re not happy to be down in the dungeons of course i am i ve already decided to adopt slytherin as my house i beamed a smile at him i wasnttechnically allowed to be in the house since i was a muggle but i didntreally care about the rules he looked surprised by the answer likely he expected me to want to be in gryffindor most people i knew wanted to be in that house they were the heroes of the story after all and dungeons normally werent the idea living space the hat said i would be perfect in slytherin and i dontdoubt it green was always one of my favourite colours as well this shall be fine i stopped looking thoughtful i more worried that the slytherin students wont like me being here after all i am a muggle most of them dontlike muggles right the question seemed to give the hawk nosed in front of me pause a lot arentfond but certainly not all of them hate muggles he seemed to realize that he was being quite pleasant and his scowl reappeared as long as you dontget in their way or mine it ll be fine and keep that black away from here at his rather weak threat i couldnthelp the chuckle that went past my lips of course severus you can dislike me because of who i am no changing that i just hope you donthold sirius against me i sure we ll be great friends i shifted my bag from my right hand to my left though the movement made my arm hurt i promised draco the mention of the former slytherin student seemed to surprise the professor what does draco have to do with this well he was worried about sirius perhaps trying out a little revenge on you i shrugged nonchalantly not really worried about anything happening at all so he wanted me to keep an eye on the puppy i not affected by him i paused well not too much anyway i dontneed your protection like i was offering it i rolled my eyes i just wanted to let you know that draco cares about you he was worried and to say that about draco it means something and taking advantage of the ponderous state the potions master was in and just as impulsively as before and to throw him off a little i moved closer and gave him a quick kiss on the cheek thank you for showing me my rooms have a nice night i opened my door and entered the place i would be spending quite a lot of time closing the door on a rather annoyed looking teacher a n i got a review hahaha so i ll keep writing this for now not that i could stop at the moment anyway i have a place to go with this and i really want to get there but i still like getting reviews so please read and review rabailey you were my first reviewer thank you i understand your feelings for some slash but do you like any of it and as for the names well aine is an actual celtic name it gaelic for joy and an old girls name as for cairn well i pretty sure it a word but not a name heh i glad you like the story though chapter 2 i stared at what could only be described as the most perfect look a like for harry potter ever if perhaps an older version screw the movie version he had been similar i ll grant but standing in front of me was exactly as the books described from the hair that wouldntstay down to the vivid green eyes and of course that jagged scar on his forehead it was all a bit too much for me and i felt my knees give way slightly a small sag was all that alerted this myth become reality to my state but he noticed and gripped my arm firmly in his cairn go get some butterbeer from the bar please it was only then that i was aware that cairn had actually arrived there before me and he was now jumping like a servant to do what this man was telling him i was led rather carefully over to a table near the fireplace where i sat heavily my head in my hands trying to do something about the beating behind my skull the first travel by floo powder is always a bit disconcerting the bespectacled young man smiled consolingly at me headaches are quite normal something to drink should help almost if on cue cairn popped up at my elbow and handed me a bottle of something labeled as butterbeer i would be lying if i said i hadnt wondered exactly what this strange drink would taste like after reading the books so many times and taking a tentative sip of the drink i nearly spit it out it was alcoholic if just barely the taste though swirled along my tongue it wasnta bad taste instead it was almost golden and i had to assume that was where it got it name it had always been my first thought that the drink would taste like butter but that isntvery appetizing now is it thank you cairn i whispered sipping the drink now my shock at it taste gone it was certainly help drive the beating out of my head not to mention moisten my dried tongue at my thanks the little man beamed a smile at me making my lips twitch slightly now that you re feeling a bit better i suppose i should introduce myself whether you re aware or not my name is harry potter pleased to meet you he stuck out his hand and i found myself rather dumbly shaking it my mind was having a little trouble working i had already reached the conclusion that he would be harry potter but hearing it for certain was a completely differed kettle of fish after a few moments of trying to get my mouth working my teacher side took control how is this happening did i say my teacher side i meant my child side i couldnt help but look around me at the strangely empty pub looking like a child who had just gotten to meet santa clause and all his reindeer this situation was just as unlikely but if this was real maybe santa was as well childish fantasies were quick to pop into my head but i shook them away taking a deep breath i tried to clear my head and think properly meanwhile cairn and harry just sat there quietly it was nice of them to give me this moment to think before starting in on things i might not understand grasping at the side of my personality that did research i did what i did best and calmly surveyed my predicament aside from the now perfectly sane cairn there was now sitting in front of me harry potter come to life this new being though wasntfrom the movies or even the books the man sitting in front of me was the harry of the future a future not covered in any of the books he sat there looking to be about 27 years old if it hadntbeen the eyes hair and scar would i have even recognized the man it was unlikely he had filled out lost any of what remaining childish might have marked him a boy and his face was instead all hard angles he was as attractive as mat except there was far more emotion behind those eyes his hair was as black as would be expected tidier though then i would have expected except for a patch at the back that stuck up a bit but with his bangs grown so long that it easily covered the scar at most times a precaution i was sure had to do with the fact he couldnt walk around in the normal world the muggle world without someone commenting on him looking like harry potter funny that miss mackinnion harry started to say making me jump out of my thoughts immediately i couldnthelp the slow smile that crossed my features since i was older then him and here he was calling me miss i sure you want to know why i hired you of course he had been the he that cairn had been speaking of cairn he said something about a relic and a ritual i said my confidence edging back into my voice after the years i had spent around the world surrounded by strange and wonderful things i wasntgoing to be kept in amazement for long i tried to tell him i dontdo rituals but he refused to acknowledge that i gave cairn what i hoped was a withering glance but he just looked a bit sheepish yes well i gave him instructions to get you here by any means you are quite truthfully my last hope every one else failed harry sighed running a hand through his hair moving his hair so that his scar was easily visible i found myself staring at it again before i looked back into his eyes you should have come to me first i said with confidence i knew i was the best in my field there was no use in denying that but you re also a muggle perhaps i should have been a bit put off by this statement but i had no problems with who i was i also knew my inability to do magic didnt stop me from knowing everything to do with almost every ritual and occult relic on this planet muggle or not some good your wizard choices did then i snorted this out and was rewarded with an amused look on harry face not a speck of good but once you hear my problem you might see why i was loathe to involve a muggle such as yourself i had begun to tap my fingers on the table getting too eager to hear what this perilous tale was that needed my immediate help something that would also cost twenty thousand pounds or more to get me over here to deal with reaching into his robe harry pulled out a cylindrical object about a foot long it was made out of some kind of dark wood a reddish brown colour and had engravings all along its surface he placed it on the table and then looked at me expectantly i had an idea just seeing it what it was but i needed to pick it up look up close at the engravings to be sure my hand trembled as i reached out to touch it but if it was what i thought it was then i had every reason to shake i had every reason to run out of here and swim back to new york the marks on the wooden cylinder were definitely of the oghum alphabet and i could read it as well as my native tongue it read simply enough the gates of death bar not perhaps not as simple this cylinder was in all likelihood a relic that i had never seen before but which i had heard whispered enough about beneath the surface of the occult this was a clag a bh is a death bell to further confirm my suspicions i turned it in my hands and quickly found the opening at the end it popped open and showed that this object was indeed hollow i placed it rather carefully back on the table and held my hands in my lap wanting to keep their shaking out of sight of the other two you know what that is harry potter didntask a question he made a statement seeing in my close handling of the object my widened eyes my quickened breaths and my badly covered shivering that i indeed knew what it was it is a clag a bh is it was an ancient celtic object used at least in all the stories i ve heard to raise the dead i whispered this last out keeping my eyes on the table in front of me do you know the ritual to go with it this was asked calmly and it brought my eyes sharply up to look into the bright green ones in front of me the ritual i laughed softly my voice sounding even slightly crazed to my ears i know it i ve studied it but i ve never performed it aside from the fact that until now i didntthink that i waved my hand at the wood object sitting scaring me with just it existence i didntknow that even existed or had existed aside from that it wrong i frowned the purpose of that little object was to raise the dead bring back something that wasnt supposed to be here and the two men sitting across from me where perfectly aware of what they were asking i am hiring you to perform that ritual for me i need someone brought back to life i stood up and slammed my hands down on the table causing cairn at least to squawk at the suddenness of my actions the butterbeer bottle fell onto it side spilling out the last of its amber liquid onto the floor i wasntcaring i was staring in horror at the young man sitting calmly across from me perform it do you even know what it entails i grabbed the object and popped it end off and rather roughly thrust it under harry nose do you see this is hollow do you do you know why i sneered at him of course you don t otherwise you would realize what you re asking it for blood to bring some one back from the dead this has to be filled with blood human blood any magic done with that sort of sacrifice is something you dontwant to get involved in it will only go bad bringing some one back from the dead is dangerous you dontknow what you ll get i slammed the clag a bh is back onto the table uncaring at if i had damaged it it was telling of my mood that i didntcare about damage to a historical object i was a little relieved to see harry face pale looking at the wooden thing on the table with a mixture of horror and determination instantly i knew that what i had told him hadnt changed the black haired man ideas i sat down feeling exhausted i really regretted at that instance mydamned curiousity in using that floo powder earlier of course studying the occult around the world i had come into contact with plenty of rituals to bring back the dead almost every society in the world had at least one if not more it a telling fact about our society we re all so scared of death that we always try and find some way to lengthen our lives stop death or even restart life when it lost any one who d watched movies could tell you a bit about some of these movies but what most people didntknow was that some rituals worked in my time around the world i had indeed seen a few rituals that had achieved what harry wanted in a sense bile rose in my throat at the memories things were brought back but they were never what any one would call human you ve read my books i assume he said suddenly changing the subject i ran with it though glad to be off of the distasteful thing sitting on the table or the horrifying memories in my head yes how exactly is that possible it rather annoying really harry smiled slightly his face regaining a bit of it colour everything in those books are at least basically true the majority of events were at least told with modest verity fine okay but why are there books why did you thrust your society which i shall assume cares about it privacy right into the faces of the people you were trying to hide it from i asked the question that had been buzzing in the back of my head since this had all started harry potter being a reality was forgotten i had accepted that as truth but i still didntunderstand the why of it all that the annoying part actually you see there was this reporter he held up his hands shrugging she wasnta witch but rather a squib and things werentreally going her way so she wrote books about the life of the most famous wizard of all time he made this proclamation about himself a wry humour to his voice i coughed at this though and smiled at cairn who was immediately behind me patting my back as i coughed you re telling me that the author is a squib i finally stopped the coughs to ask this amazed question one with quite a flair for poetic license to harry grimaced at this you have no idea how many times i ve had to explain to people that i never had a crush on cho chang and that i most certainly was not that bad my fifth year well it did explain why the author always told me she didntrealize she was writing fantasy it hadntbeen for her but that didnt explain the entire situation but you would have stopped her the ministry of magic or whatever they would have stopped her from leaking their secrets correct it was too late you cantdo charms on an entire nation much less the world he smiled wistfully at that and i didntdoubt that many times he had thought just that but we were lucky enough that no one would ever believe that story was true you all immediately accepted it as a children tale and that was that my fingers began to tap against the wood of the table i was sitting at again my brain racing over the idea that the entire world had just had the wool pulled over it eyes it was all rather amusing except for the fact that i had been one of the billions to be fooled as well and no one likes to be treated like an idiot so what else i asked a small note of annoyance in my voice harry just smiled slightly hearing it as i told you i need you to bring someone back to life my fingers stilled and i resisted the urge to curl my nails into the wood i regarded harry with what i thought was a great deal of calm you know the clag a bh is can only be used once several names ran through my head all the choices of people he would want back from the dead lily james sirius dumbledore remus any of those people i would say he would want back alive but which one meant the most to him which out of the five names would he tell me now he wanted me to risk my body and probably my soul if i had believed in it for them to stand in front of him again my mind raced trying to make the most likely choice if i had to guess i would say one of his parents after all he had gone his entire life without them given the chance would he step across a dark boundary to bring one back i now it can only be used once i only need it to be harry sighed a pained expression passing behind his eyes i knew in his head he was fighting the urge to cry out that he wanted all of his loved ones back from the dead the books got that right she mentioned all the right names of the dead and what they meant to me he shook his head before looking back at me steel in his eyes i need you to bring sirius black back to life a n clag a bh is this is gaelic for death bell doesntexist but i liked the sound of it but no idea how to pronounce it heh oghum celtic alphabet like runes almost a n so i feel slightly bad i went from daily updates for a week and now i back to work and i haventupdated in 4 days well sad as it is it how it will likely be for awhile only about two updates a week blueskiezrusty i glad you found it funny i try and make it entertaining to read i quite sad the daily updates are gone as well but silly need to work and make money ythefrown2day i shall try hard to update a lot but well sorry in advance leelo77 oh that makes me really happy that this is your favourite make sure you tell me what would make it even better for you i happy to have snape in the story as well he one of my faves quite adorable that sounds really odd doesntit rheniel thank you again and again as for snape well tell me how to make snape more snapeish i know i not that good at writing him him and sirius tend to be immature together in my mind and aine will be getting along with snape just to throw a kink into everyone who thought i was putting her together with sirius from the start and isntslytherin just swell as for salem well it unlikely that i can go simply because of the money but if you go have fun for all of us ah 20 chapters already and i not even really nearly done such a long story i love it this chapter introduces the other teachers most are familiar please read and enjoy and of course review chapter 20 my waking the next morning found me staring rather confused at some dark velvet curtains that were impeccable and therefore certainly not to be found at 12 grimmauld place then i remembered where in fact i was and what i was doing here i was in my room at hogwarts where starting in just a few days i would be a teacher it was a situation that even in my more fanciful moments i couldnthave come up with and i wasnteven seriously there to be a teacher instead i was there because sirius had to locate a lost horcrux of voldemort so harry could finally defeat the dark wizard it all would make an interesting novel or a movie i started to debate with myself about who would be best to play me in this theoretical picture as i silently worked this out i made my way out of bed and into the bathroom that was attached to my room good thing about that too i didntwant to have to share bathrooms with any kids the least teachers can get is their own bathrooms once i was bathed and refreshed and suitably clothed in a pair of jeans and a t shirt i had to think of what i needed to do first and with most normal healthy people in the morning breakfast was first on my mind of course i also had no idea where breakfast was going to be dobby i called out the only house elf name i knew i couldntbe calling for him every single time i needed something though i needed to either learn some other names or more ideally learn to do things for myself a small popping sound proceeded the sudden appearance of dobby in the middle of my living room the rooms i had been given consisted of three rooms my bathroom my bedroom and the other room which i had decided to call the living room but which could also be called the study since it had a rather nice oak desk in the corner no television though i wasntsure what a muggle at a wizarding school was going to do for fun not that i would have time for any fun research research research the connection had to be cut miss aine mackinnion is wanting something i stood for a moment staring down into the house elves rather large green eyes wondering once again how any of this was possible the creature standing in front of me was just not supposed to exist and yet there he stood shifting nervously from foot to foot waiting for me to speak i sorry dobby i knelt down in front of him going eye level with the short elf i didntthink it was entirely fair to always stand towering above him i dontknow any other house elves names and i dontknow where i supposed to go for breakfast his face broke into a rather goofy looking grin and he started to bounce excitedly clearly he was pleased to be of use to some one the grin completed a rather clown like appearance that went well with the large green eyes and pencil nose not to mention the clothing he was wearing breakfast is in the great hall dobby will take you down dontworry about other names need anything just call on dobby it was rather hard not to smile back at his enthusiasm it was really rather hard to not like the small house elf he was really quite endearing i quickly followed him out of my room and down the dark hallways of the dungeons and up some stairs i tried quite hard as we went to memorize where i was going i was also trying quite hard to ignore the moving portraits on the walls after all it hard to concentrate on where you re going if you re gobsmacked over a walking talking portrait doubly hard when they start talking about you as you pass finally dobby stopped in front of some large doors so i assumed this was the great hall thanks dobby i waved and he mumbled a response before popping out quickly behind the doors would be strangers who i was going to have to work with now all wizards and i wasntsure how they would all respond to a muggle in their midst but never one to take a step back from the unknown i took a deep breath and pushed open the doors it was quite the dramatic moment the great hall was just that a great big hall huge in fact hanging from the ceiling were large banners all in shades of green and grey thereby indicating that slytherin had won the cup the last year i could just imagine sirius face when he had seen that there were four large tables going down the length of the hall but at the very end on a dais was one large table where all the teachers sat all staring at me as i made my entrance and of course i was the last to arrive it really saying something when even sirius manages to get there before you i tried not to run to the table managing to keep at least an iota of decorum i saw sirius and he smiled rather encouragingly at me and motioned me over to him where he had saved a seat nice that quietly and somewhat subdued for me i made my way over to where he was and took a seat we ll forgive the slight tardiness miss mackinnion simply since you didnt know what time we have breakfast the headmistress sat a few seats down from me and i leaned forward to nod my head at her this will be the best time to introduce you to the other teachers at hogwarts she skipped over sirius and severus and quickly said the names and positions of everyone at the table some i knew as teachers from the books some were new to me there was matronly professor sprout still in charge of herbology as if her name would make it acceptable for her to teach anything else she smiled at me and i knew i wasntgoing to have a problem with her at least then there was professor flitwick so small one could have missed the man charms was still his domain and like sprout there was no animosity in his gaze though he looked perplexed enough then there was professor sinistra who i didntknow too well from the books i vaguely remembered a mention or two of the woman but she never played a large part she was the teacher for astronomy and her look matched her position she wore black robes and her face was dark my educated guess would say she was from india or pakistan and the look she was giving me wasntpleasant i might have some problems with her someone else who was new to me was professor vector as bluntly as was possible she was rather nerdy she looked like every single stereotype i had ever seen of a math teacher her gray hair was in a tight bun wire rim glasses set on her pointed nose without even telling me just from her appearance i knew she was the arithmancy teacher that was a class i certainly never wanted to take she didntreally look at me so i wasntworth her concern which was good enough for me i d rather be ignored two women i certainly remembered from the books were madam pomfrey and madam pince the school nurse and librarian respectfully they seemed quite the polar opposites pomfrey was rather large and seemed to just set people at ease pince on other hand was cold and sort of like a human crab it was hard to explain her their reactions to me seemed the opposite as well madam pomfry warmly said hello as she was introduced pince barely even nodded it was a relationship i was certainly going to have to work on though i needed to spend a lot of time in the library hagrid was a large presence at the end of the table his eyes were black and warm seeming to accept me as an outsider much like himself being a muggle didntreally help me here but then i guess a half giant flunk out didnthave much chance of being too well liked at first either he was still groundskeeper and care of magical creatures teacher but recalling his fondness for painful creatures in the books i thought i might stay away from his classes or at least any that involved things that could bite claw or blast anything nasty at me a completely new face to me was the ancient runes teacher the subject had been mentioned in the books but the teacher had remained a mystery never being seen at all professor futhark was in what i would have assumed in muggle terms was his late forties his hair graying at least what was left of it the top of his plate was shiny only the sides of his head holding valiantly onto the remaining hair he had left he had a sort of jovial look except for the dark look in his eyes it was hard to tell whether the look was directed at me or at the empty plate in front of him madam hooch looked like quite a tough woman her yellow eyes didntlook like they would miss anything which i guess would be quite helpful when dealing with quidditch games those i was looking forward to seeing i expected from her rather stern expression to have some problems with her but she said hello quite pleasantly the last teacher i was introduced to was a bit of surprise to me i knew who she was just not in regards to being a teacher this placement had certainly happened after the books her hair was a rather normal tawny color and she had dark eyes that were twinkling though i was quick to notice their direction straight at sirius she was a pretty young witch one nymphadora tonks was now the transfiguration teacher i was surprised at her being here since the book had made her near inconsolable after remus death since they had been quite involved at that point with her appearance i was certainly going to have to explain that to sirius he wouldntknow that his cousin had a relationship with his old friend if i had expected a pleasant welcome from anyone it would have been her but she looked a little wary her eyes darting back and forth between sirius and me professor binns teaches history of magic but being a ghost he doesntreally eat with us often and firenze is our divination teacher but he is also a centaur and not really comfortable eating with so many of us mcgonagall explained now everyone please welcome our new defense against the dark arts and muggle studies teachers a polite round of clapping started and ended quick enough miss mackinnion you might want to start to wear robes when the students get here i glanced round the table and sure enough everyone was wearing nice looking robes i glanced down at my shirt and jeans it certainly placed me in a different sphere actually headmistress i plan on wearing my normal muggle clothes eyes widened behind their spectacles as i spoke i the muggle studies teacher and a muggle there no reason for me to change my clothes and frankly i think it would be advantageous for the children to see how muggles actually dress i ve seen some of the clothes a wizard has come up with to look normal in muggle society a quick image of cairn wearing his trenchcoat and overalls flowery shirt underneathe came into my head making me smile you can all use some real lessons in muggle fashion breakfast appeared before us all like magic i berated myself quietly knowing quite well that it was magic mcgonagall seemed a little thrown off by my refusal to wear robes but she kept quiet i could only hope that she understood my reasoning either that or she was going to wait until later to have a talk with me about it british breakfast can take some getting used to especially if you re used to nice wholesome meals of cereal and toast a good british meal though consists largely of meats and fats plenty of good bangers rashers eggs mushrooms and beans it was certainly not the sort of meal one has when they re watching their figure i though was starving dinner had consisted of a small sandwich and some crisps i quickly ate more then any one should have when i finished my meal i tried to get professor snape to speak to me but it was a task i was doomed to fail since he was sitting a few chairs down from me the logistics just werentthere of course i could blame it on that but the truth of the matter was that the man just did not want to speak to me if the dark looks he was giving me were any indication as people finished they quietly left and soon it was just sirius nymphadora and me left at the table severus had made sure he was not left alone with the three people who he would least want to be around i had been far too eager to eat to actually pay attention to anyone else really that might have been a little rude but my appetite was not to be taken lightly sirius though was happily catching up with his cousin who was still staring at him strangely i wasntsure if it was because she found him attractive or because he was alive i rather hoped it was the later since the former was a little icky for me they were cousins and despite rumours about the british family i was fairly certain that was a no no in this country as well so should i call you professor nymphadora what i sipped my glass of water eyeing the young witch over the rim apparently her conversation with sirius over breakfast had dimmed her attitude toward me a large smile lighted up her face and her hair had suddenly turned a shocking pink colour tonks will be good enough i try and make everyone forget my first name but professor mcgonagall just keeps reminding people but it such a beautiful name cousin sirius had moved his chair back to avoid the expected mock punch the pink haired girl directed toward him brings to mind all sorts of greek nymphs bathing nude and sirius brings to mind a large drooling dog i said innocently beating tonks to the reprimand of his mocking of her name the statement certainly amused tonks who now had her hand covering her face laughing quietly into the palm oh poor boy and you re attached to her as well apparently sirius didntfeel any need to keep quiet on that score my eyes must have been hot on him wondering the extent of the information he had unloaded on the young witch his steely eyes on me though indicated with force that he wasntgoing to be that stupid it was the same story that snape and mcgonagall had heard a spell had backfired that was the official explanation for something that we could have problems hiding so why exactly is a muggle teaching here it was the question that i didntdoubt all of the teachers were asking themselves some probably were asking the headmistress and probably not in dulcet tones it was a question that i was certainly going to have to deal a lot with especially when the students arrived back at the school to find a muggle in residence and teaching them well i friends with harry and since we have this connection and sirius had a job here i accepted one as well it just temporary of course my fingers were tracing the patterns in the wood as i considered what i was doing in the school and how long i would be there i would be home soon if i could cut the side effect and even if not we would likely leave once sirius discovered where his brother would have hidden a dark lord secret object it an interesting opportunity for a muggle like me as well certainly tonks tilted her head and regarded me with great seriousness i expected some dark and painful question to cross her lips perhaps something to do with why her long since dead cousin was sitting there munching on a banger have you ever seen someone change their nose a n the ancient runes teacher was never given a name so i made up one but since rowling tends to like giving names that reflect who the person is and what they do the name futhark is from the fact that the first six runes of the alphabet spell that word out so the old german runic alphabet is referred to as the elder futhark see i look into these things a n another chapter and the story marches onward and i really need to say that i adore the hp lexicon really without that site i d have a lot of mistakes when it came to places and times i love the books but i certainly cantremember everything rheniel longest review but really thank you i adore the long ones though really i love the short ones too i glad you like dobby and tonks as far as dobby goes well i didntreally think it through too hard i just figured he wouldntbe as manic as before and tonks well i dontreally like it when people make her too mature she a great character to have fun with or to bring great clarity to a situation as for muggle studies i still deciding what i going to do with that class leelo77 i made leelo jump there ll be plenty of the triangle that is sirius snape and aine it just fun to play with them ythefrown2day dontfeel bad i didntmean i had anything against what you said i just am personally sorry that i cantupdate more often it was nice to do it once a day thank you though for the compliments chapter 21 i stared at one nymphadora tonks as she started to quickly go through a procession of different noses large small pencil like tomato shaped snape nose sirius s even my own made an appearance she likely thought the silent stare was due to what she was doing instead i was just quite relieved that her seriousness has been a red herring to her silly nature silly was good i quickly dropped the silence and laughed at the different olfactory organs she produced i even made my own suggestions asking if she could make her entire face change she then proceeded to slide her own features into the exact replica of sirius it was disconcerting to say the least and caused sirius to cough out the half chewed piece of meat sirius are you done eating yet i asked as he drank some water to clear his throat his bright haired cousin had resumed her normal face if you are i wanted to know if you could give me a tour of this place i should have expected it without a moment hesitation his face slipped into it wolfish facade his grin was roguish and expectant silver eyes danced as they looked over me my asking him for a tour was immediately read into as an invitation into my bed the man might have been sex on a stick but that didntmean i wanted to taste that particular snack at the moment if ever if you can keep your pants on please a choked laugh came from tonks you know this place i don t i could ask someone else but with our mandatory connection it easier to just ask you i didnt say my other reason a tour might alight on some locations for his brother to have hidden things the tour might bring back long since forgotten memories secret corners passageways the man wasnt stupid i knew well enough that he understood my other reasons for asking him for the tour sure he pushed his chair back and stood up standing tall next to me i was amazed at the body next to me the robes only seemed to accentuate the lines his hair tied neatly back his body all laziness and readiness wrapped into one he was certainly proving to be a difficult dichotomy at one time the cock sure playboy at others the vulnerable broken boy i cantpromise about keeping my pants on there were no doubts about which one he was now with a mumbled goodbye to tonks the two of us headed out of the great hall which sirius explained as we walked out telling me in detail what the hall was used for all the different great feasts that occurred during the year how the banners changed depending on who won the cup it was all knowledge that was useless since i was already aware but i let sirius talk on he had taken to his task of tour guide quite well and there was no need to silence him now there was also the likelihood that his talking was for himself as well somehow seeing that the speaking of what the rooms were for as a way to remember things that perhaps in explaining the sorting at the beginning of the year that he might remember something that would prove useful to why he was really there sirius what the empty portrait for i paused infront of the doors and looked back at a picture frame that hung on a wall it wasnt completely empty instead it contained a room and a chair but nothing that would seem to necessitate having it hung prominently on the great hall wall actually i dontknow that wasntthere when i went to school or at least i dontremember it but i finding things new all the time and then later remembering them you ll just have to ask tonks or someone about that i ll ask severus sirius snorted at that statement but surprisingly for him he didnt say anything else about it maybe it meant he was starting to mature a bit we headed out the doors leaving behind the empty portrait though my concern over it disappeared the moment we stepped through the doors starting on the ground floor i was shown rooms that i needed to know about the staff room was a necessity where teachers could spend sometime away from other students or sometimes for some meetings of the entire teaching staff there was also classroom eleven which housed the divination class i was confused by the sudden appearance of a forest clearing as the door opened my senses being overwhelmed by the sudden change in environment and climate sirius though reminded me who the divnation teacher was and that a centaur needed an environment that they were comfortable in filch office was a definite place i needed to know mainly from my desire to avoid the place at all costs i wasntlooking forward to meeting the school old caretaker though i was curious about mrs norris how any cat could be that bad was beyond me other places on the ground floor proved to be less desperate for me to know such as the broom cupboard where sirius told me about some clandestine meetings he had while in school he delighted in the telling until i rather calmly kicked him in the shin my look telling him to get on with it i didntneed to know about ever single girl he had snogged in the cupboard the first floor proved to be more important for me to know intimately since it held both my classroom and sirius s the defense against dark arts room had high ceilings windows lining one of the walls and raised at the back of the room was door which sirius indicated was to his store room sirius you are going to do a lesson plan arentyou i walked around the quite bare room thinking how different it must have looked with all the different teachers of the subject sirius though hadnthad any time to put his own stamp on the place he regarded me with one eyebrow raised i just cantpicture you planning out your teaching for a year i ll put something down though i doubt i ll even remotely stick to it old moony was the one for plans and lists and the such but i ll certainly keep old mcgonagall happy she my boss after all we moved then to my class room and it was certainly different from sirius s one large circular window was cut into the wall beaming down light into the room the teacher desk was placed at the front and four lines of smaller desks were lined in front of it it was strikingly similar to was i was used to in school in the back right corner was a door that upon further inspection proved to be my office probably from the former teacher of the subject random muggle objects laid strewn all over the office and classroom a telephone a bicycle a car engine an umbrella such mundane things all points of great interest for some wizards and witches it made me laugh softly as i inspected the old bicycle certainly an early model teaching this class was going to be interesting i was likely going to have to do a real overhaul to the course as well i doubted muggle studies was ever really dealt with too seriously you re going to have fun with this sirius had noticed the soft laugh looked pleased at the sound actually he was playing with a little stuffed bear squeezing it in his large hands it ll definitely give me a new outlook on my normal life imagine being a foreign species the tour progressed from there the first floor also contained the history of magic room mcgonagall old office which tonks now occupied and the location of the old hospital wing on up to the second floor showed moaning myrtle bathroom which sirius chose to stay out of i doubted this was based on it being a girl bathroom instead based off a need to not meet with the perpetually depressed ghost i though made a note to go back later just to see the entrance to the chamber of secrets i was here at hogwart s i certainly wanted to see all the places of interest from the book the second floor also held one place i had already seen the entrance to the headmistress office and down the hall was sirius office it was quite bare like his classroom but i didntdoubt that soon enough he d have a large comfortable couch in there random books on the shelves pictures of his old friends lining the large fireplace mantle third floor charms classroom forbidden hallway trophy room hospital wing i was rather surprised when with no trouble remembering sirius recalled the location of the secret passageway to hogsmeade behind the humpbacked witch statue so not all of his memories were being blocked or fuzzy to his view though this memory of his old marauder discovery of all the places secret in the school was a good one there was no reason to not remember fourth floor the only thing of real interest on this floor was the large library it took all of sirius pleading pushing and guiles to get me to leave the enormous room overflowing with books and all on things i had an interest in it was possible that the solution to our problem was in there as well but sirius demanded to finish the tour and he was right i needed to know where everything was fifth and sixth floors flew by nothing but bathrooms corridors the arithmancy and ancient runes classrooms seventh floor though held professor flitwick office the old divination classroom the gryfindor entrance and most interesting of all the room of requirement it didnttake much cajoling to get sirius to show me how it was used right across from a rather silly looking picture of what looked like some tubby little teletubbies prancing about to the direction of a strange looking man the room was supposed to be sirius had me walk back and forth in front of it three times thinking hard on what i needed all i needed at that point was to see how it worked so after three times i turned to look at the wall and saw only a blank wall it only appears when you really need something so it not surprising it didntshow up after all you re just curious not needy i was a little disappointed but shrugged it off at some point when i knew what i needed i d certainly be back to make sure that the room did in fact work the way sirius had explained i wondered briefly if i could make it have a television and radio for when i was bored plain old muggle devices i bet you used this to meet all your girls didntyou my snide comment brought a small blush to the older man cheeks indicating that what i had said was in fact true i definitely didntwant him bringing me to the room and being in charge of the requirements i didntneed to see the type of room he would think of to try and romance a young girl the fact i was 29 didntreally matter in this case leaving the failed attempt to get into the room of requirements the last part of the castle pointed out to me were all the towers we didnt bother going up them all not needing to do anymore walking then we had already done moving around the castle was practically a five mile jog in terms of exercise for me we took a leisurely trip back down the floors and this time i looked around at all the strange things the moving staircases the portraits that spoke and walked off the random ghosts floating everywhere sirius made sure to remind me of certain things on the way down dontstep there you ll get stuck watch out for that painting the knight is a little balmy that door isnta door it just likes to pretend arent you going to show me the dungeons we were now back on the ground floor and judging by sirius growling stomach it was already time for lunch that tour had taken about four hours my question seemed to surprised sirius a bit like he didntthink his lack of attention to the lower levels of the school needed any explanation the only things that live in the dungeons are snakes and me he looked somewhat abashed at my statement he never did think before he spoke already forgetting that my own rooms were down in the dungeons i never really thought i looked like a snake though my skin might not have been as soft as i would have liked i didnt think it was really scaly you know you are going to be a teacher so you need to put this little grudge against slytherin behind you you cantplay favourites i said this sensible thing even though i knew quite well i wasnt going to follow my own advice ever since i had started teaching i always had my chosen students sometimes the students were even surprised i liked to pick the ones who hated my classes the most it was fun to tease them i dontplan on playing favourites i just plan on making the bad students suffer it not my fault that they re all going to be from slytherin i snorted at his stereotyping even though i knew that he knew more about the subject then i but it wasntpossible of an entire house of students to be bad right i sure quite a lot of the people he had gone to school with might have not liked sirius but that didnt mean they then started to hate all gryffindors of course that might have been the case if they had been slytherins really the little feud was quite impenetrable a n so i read somewhere that you re not supposed to respond to reviews in the story but i dontsee the harm for it so i wontstop after all people donthave to read my comments but i wontreply in this chapter though thank you all for reading and reviewing yes the slytherins and gryffindors certainly will be interesting to write i will say this though rhennan you were my 50th review thanks such a nice milestone oh as for continuity problems right really sorry about that it is 300 yards but to begin with it was 500 but i decided to lessen it to make it a bit more interesting just looks like i forgot to change it once sorry about the confusion but also thank you for pointing the problem out to me i truly do appreciate it this chapter might be the last for a few days busy at work and such but a week at most anything more then a week and i shall never be forgiven by myself most of all really though nothing too long and here we have it another chapter and as always please read and review i ll give you a really large cookie chapter 22 lunchtime upon us we walked back to the great hall i was just pleased that this time i didnthave to follow anyone quite sure in this one place at least that i knew where i was going of all the places i had seen i had made sure to definitely remember where the great hall was after all that was where i had to go to get food and that was an all important factor for me feuds are really silly you know i pushed open the large wooden doors and was rather happy that at least this time i wasntthe last one to get to the food in fact snape and mcgonagall were the only ones there yet feuds can be good sirius huffed his eyes firing up at even the mere sight of the slytherin i ignored him and without a second thought i headed up to the dais and plopped down in the chair next to snape whose lips twisted unpleasantly at me perhaps that was what he called a smile i doubted it was what he intended but i chose to assume it was a pleasant expression severus what do you think about feuds apparently the formality of breakfast this morning was gone with lunch since the moment i sat down food appeared on the plate in front of me i grabbed a piece of bread twisting it and stuffing it into my mouth chewing waiting for the hawk nosed man to answer the question why are you talking to me i just curious what you think i shrugged my shoulders i smiled brightly at sirius who was eyeing me with distaste not that i was trying to cause trouble or anything but teasing sirius was fun sirius had dropped into a chair in front of me displeased at my choice of seating the idea of eating near the slytherin certainly wasnt doing much for the canine appetite since he barely poked at the food that had appeared in front of him instead he was putting all his effort into glaring at me and probably more specifically my choice of questions why are you asking about feuds next to me severus was watching me carefully judging his eyes flicked to sirius and i d be blind if i didntsee the smirk that tugged at the thin lips displeasure at answering my question obviously didntbeat the pleasure at seeing sirius discomfort it just a little argument that sirius and i are having feuds can be interesting intriguing how exactly do you think a feud can be interesting my eyes were wide and i tried to look innocent but it was a far reach for me i was trying to goad the two men there was no innocence at all about my line of questioning between the people on both sides of the feud a bond can form against something they all perceive as evil wrong unjustified black eyes glittered regarding me thoughtfully there was that shiver again but i ignored it that funny it amazing to hear you and sirius agree on something it was quite hard to keep the amusement out of my own voice of course i was teasing the two of them but perhaps if i showed they had something in common the feud would cool deep lines appeared between severus brows he glared at me hard black eyes practically glowing mackinnion just eat your lunch and stop meddling i chuckled softly doing as i was told bringing a silver spoon to my mouth sipping the hot soup carefully staying quiet not because of his statement but because i was just amused he had noticed what i was doing not to mention the few lines of communication he had with me rather pleasantly before he realized or the fact he had dropped me to the level of just using my last name it was a bit of an improvement over muggle let her alone snivellus i dontknow why she would want to talk to slimy git like you but if she does you can damn well let her sirius glared at severus before turning his eyes on me my brown ones met his grey and you dont talk to him my mouth twitched with a hidden smile it was rather amusing that sirius could get angry at snape for not talking to me and then with me for talking to snape he really couldntfigure out what he wanted to say or not black cover your mouth before something flies in and takes nest snape had pushed back his chair scraping the stone as he did so my speaking habits are not yours to analyze with a flourish of well timed robes a sneer and long strides severus stalked out of the hall i really do wish you two would act like teachers mcgonagall sighed into her coffee sipping it as she shook her head i feel like i 30 years back dealing with you two the boys certainly like their feud you re not helping either miss mackinnion her gaze was certainly displeased and i flushed slightly at the deep look so maybe i would cut down on my goading of the two men though i was only trying to improve their relations through the subtle and devastating use of inciting arguments if they could just air their issues well either they would deal with them or just kill each other maybe i shouldntbe trying it death was perhaps more likely with those two i really sorry about that headmistress my eyes drifted down trying to at least appear apologetic bespectacled eyes regarded me and i should have known she wouldntbelieve the innocence inflected in my voice i sent the old teacher lesson plans to your room i suggest you spend some time in your room alone going over them well that was as subtle as a giant working at a 9 to 5 job in a cubicle i smiled and nodded though as she got up and left why do you feel the need to actually speak to him i blinked to find sirius face inches from my own leaning forward steel piercing into me he looked curious but sure enough beneath the surface was that fire that always roared when severus snape entered the conversation sirius we might be connected in a rather annoying physical sort of way but until i discover that we re also mentally connected you will not be hearing all my dark secrets is there a reason you think talking to that snake is a dark secret well i sure you would consider it a dark secret if i liked him i knew quite well the reaction this statement was going to cause grey eyes turned stormy widening in his face his face grew somewhat ashen before promptly going bright red in anger that that just wrong he a slytherin he all sallow cold and unpleasant no one would like him it d be like making love to a corpse sirius what are you thinking i sighed drumming my fingers on the table trying to keep my voice down even though sirius wasnt following suit more teachers had started to appear for lunch and i certainly didntwant to start any rumours at my new job just what i needed the muggle is playing two teachers at once fooling around behind each of their backs once again i found myself growing increasingly annoyed with the raven haired wizard i meant that i liked him not that i wanted to rip off his clothes and back him into a wall in the privacy of his office and then see if he cold and unpleasant all the time not going to do it it was an interesting thought though i thought you liked me sirius voice practically whigned his eyes looking up at me like a little child s my fingers were starting to dance hurried over the surface of the table it was either tap them or curl them into a fist and punch the man for annoying me so much sirius i may occasionally want to rip your clothes off as well hopefully the compliment would distract him from my use of as well but i not going to my tone was firm while saying this and when i was referring to severus i meant i like him as a person and if you must know i speak to him because i can understand him i glanced down the table and was happy to note that the other teachers seemed at least to be oblivious to what we were saying the argument we were having wasntexactly one i wanted other people to hear who i wanted to rip the clothes off was preferably a topic best left unknown to most people i was fully capable of letting those that needed to know know when it was necessary like when i was in the process of ripping their clothes off understand slime sirius snorted he didntlook too pleased but his eyes had softened from their earlier steel he likely felt gratified hearing that i at times wanted to see him naked the man couldnt go on living if women didntfind him attractive this argument was on it tail end and i wasntabout to restart the ignition on it by going on and defending severus not being slime that would just get sirius going again and i couldnteven really come up with much to defend the potions master anyway after all he really had been practically slime to me since i had got here yesterday the only reason i didntthink he was slime was based on the well tuned female instinct and the facts were that he had saved harry in that seventh book and draco had vouched for him i am going to go to the library do you think you can stay within 300 yards of it i stood up as i asked the question not that i was even really asking more like telling the man the argument had lit a new fire in me for cutting this little side effect of the ritual once school started i would have more to do so now was the best time mcgonagall couldntbe displeased with what i was doing i might not be staying in my room reading nonsensical explanations for why people knitted but there couldntbe much of a problem with staying alone in the library trying to solve a problem she herself had told me to deal with it quiet thoughtful eyes regarded at me before sirius stood up as well that fine i ll spend some time in my office there should be less then 300 yards between the fourth and second floor we both left the great hall together sirius had his hands deep into his pockets and was trying very hard to not ask something his brows were knit together and his bottom lip was between his teeth the man was really quite easy to read sometimes out with it i sighed ready for something thoroughly annoying if you want to rip my clothes off does that mean that you like me i wasntabout to tell him that in fact i did like him that if the man of my dreams was made into flesh that he would likely look like sirius black personality might be a different issue though i certainly wasntgoing to tell him that he needed to stop biting his lower lip since it was drawing my attention to how absolutely kissable the lips were it would all just make his ego grow some more and there was of course the fact that i wasntgoing to do anything on my little infatuation the after effects would be too annoying to warrant the pleasurable beginnings sirius post coitus would be too thrilled with himself i like you black but believe me when i say i plan on never sleeping with you i patted his arm fondly as we reached the second floor i didntwant him to pout after all being friends with a girl i sure will be a new experience for you his expression had traveled far from joyous to amused to sullen apparently being friends with me hadntbeen the first idea he had i waved at him though and moved up the stairs to the fourth floor and the library i had left the man behind but that didntstop my mind thinking about him as i walked on he had a point about my conversing with snape there really was no reason to keep pushing the man into speaking to me when he didnt really want to i quite instinctively though knew that professor snape was not evil or affiliated with lord voldemort anymore draco might have been a stuck up little obnoxious snob but i happened to trust the git he trusted his former head of house and had charged me with the job of watching over the slimy twit the man wasnteven slightly nice to me and i was watching out for him and defending him to sirius the former gryffindor might have been a pain in my ass but he was still more of a friend to me then snape and i defended him to my friend how the world works so the reason battling forth in my brain was the answer to the question why i had told sirius the truth before i happened to like the man though the reasons for that were even more complicated and quite possibly based off fiction my ideas on liking the man had come from reading those now cursed harry potter books professor snape had always been an enigma in them and i had felt an affinity for the man he had been seduced by the dark arts even as i had been seduced by similar things we had been more curious perhaps then either should have been in our situations and sometimes we regretted the results afterwards he was also an intelligent dark sarcastic individual who spared no thought to other people feelings though if the books had been correct he had risked his own life for his students so there was a bit of courage thrown in there hell there had to be courage if you were planning on double crossing the most dangerous and dark wizard of all times so my brain had come to a conclusion while sirius black might have been my ideal man in the flesh severus snape had the personality of my perfect man i had always been a bit twisted in the type of guys i liked this was certainly an interesting development interesting and potentially very dangerous for me a n well i guess there was no reason for me to worry about it being a week before the next update had a bit of time to write some more surprisingly thank you to everyone who is reviewing the story it quite gratifying and useful at times as well everyone please continue to review and tell me what you think good and bad i like getting ideas as well it interesting to see what everyone else thinks should happen ah on that idea i ve had some people ask me who aine is going to end up with since there has been numerous indications that she likes both severus and sirius what an interesting question too bad that i not going to answer it of course heh arentthe boys fun though i shall also continue to apologize though for my characterization of snape especially really i try and write him as close to ic as possible but in these original stories sometimes it can be hard so try not to kill me in case he does something ooc chapter 23 one of the first situations i had to deal with was madam pince apparent dislike of me on sight seeing as how she was the librarian and i wanted to spend quite a lot of time in the place her dislike for me had to change in any normal library i wouldntgive a care whatsoever to whether or not i got along with the people who worked there but this was certainly a different case the books in this library werentall the normal open the book happily read then put it away type no if i picked the wrong one i could get attacked or sucked into a story with lots of spiders if i were sirius this would probably be no problem he d just saunter in a rakish grin planted on his face he probably then promptly hit on the poor woman with some cheesy line like you look tired it must be from running through my dreams all night okay maybe not that cheesy but he d be able to charm her into giving him whatever he needed making her like him instantly say anything else about the man but he had undeniable charm being female i might have some charm but none that would work on the female librarian hell even severus could get what he wanted with no problems he d just breeze in demand what he wanted probably threaten a little and he d walk out in five seconds with everything he had asked for it was unlikely anyone was going to stand in his way not when he wanted something it was close to my own personality but i didntthink i would be intimidating at all to madam pince one sentence sounding even slightly threatening and i d probably have a toad head walking into the library i was once again amazed at it size it wasnt even just the vast amount of space filled with books that gave me an excited little shiver it was knowing that almost all of them were filled with things i didntknow about it was a veritable cornucopia of information about and surrounding what i loved most i felt like that kid in a candy store who cantdecide where to go and just ends up staring at all the things they want she must have had a sixth sense because five seconds after i walked through the door madam pince was upon me her face was pinched into a scowl at me and i tried to smile to lighten her up suffice it to say she looked anything but lightened is there something i could help you with did you get lost the last question was said with a certain sense of sardonic humour no i meant to come here this was the place i was the most excited about seeing i love books i dontnormally see this many in one place it must be really hard to keep track of them but you probably do a wonderful job with it it looks impeccable in here best looking library i ve ever seen actually i want do some research as well you couldntpossibly help me locate some books about spiritual connections resulting from spells and rituals could you so charm and fear aside it turns out that i had one ability that worked well with madam pince complete and total brown nosing after dealing with students who treated the library as a place of exile to suffer while wasting their free time doing homework she was surprised and rather happy to have someone who wanted to be here well i assumed she was happy it was hard to tell behind her vulturelike appearance but she helped me find some books so that was a good enough sign i was led over to a section of books in the back it was rather similar to what i was used to which was a comfort in a way though the organization was based around things i didntknow my hand reached out to take a random book off the shelf but a piercing voice stopped my hand just centimeters from touching the spine dont touch that madame pince lips were pursed even closer together and she didntlook too pleased with me apparently i was only allowed to touch the books she said i could some of these books are dangerous that is one of them with no flourish and without me even seeing her pull it out all of a sudden an old fashioned feather duster appeared in the older woman hand the handle was made out of a solid dark coloured wood the feathers were grey and brown with a small flick of her wrist madam pince moved the feather duster i thought it was a little odd for her to be dusting right then and there and almost mentioned that i was still hoping to get some books good thing that i didntsay anything though since that small flick of her wrist caused a few books to dance off the shelves and float over to a nearby table your wand is your feather duster i must have sounded amused since i was given a rather stone cold look that really rather practical good idea i covered my first statement and the look cooled a bit these books are fine for you to touch donttouch anything else though the vulture like face brooked no nonsense on this subject so i just nodded along you do and i really wontcare what happens to you what books are these i walked over to the table gently trailing my fingers over the binding of the books dust covered a few of them still showing that this was the first time they had been off the shelf in a long time age had yellowed the paper and cracked the binding and the titles on the covers were hard to read dark eyes followed the movements of my hands judging me from what i was doing a few books on ancient magic and rituals you should find everything you need in those books walking away the librarian left me alone with the safe books on the table i poured over the books reading each one carefully and i knew from the first page of the first book that i opened that madam pince had chosen these particular books for me because they were easy enough to understand for a muggle there wasntmuch about the wizarding world that would need explaining these books were all about principles theories behind some spells and rituals even though i knew that madam pince most likely knew everything in these books she wasntentirely right everything i needed wasntin these books they were certainly interesting and some had ideas that were worth looking into but none even mentioned the clag a bhais or any other object that could be used to bring the dead back to life in fact the books were sorely lacking in anything related to resurrections could i really be surprised though after all madam pince had retrieved these books from sections that any student could get to and bringing the dead back to life was likely to be a taboo subject my solution was likely not to come with any direct links to that wooden cylinder that so changed my life if there had been a book on it then harry would have been able to find a wizard to deal with his problem instead he had come to me my knowledge on it had been limited at best and hadntbeen found in books this lack of perfect information wasnttoo bad though while i wasntfinding out too much about mine and sirius problem i was certainly learning plenty that i could use when i got back home i could write a book on spiritual connections resulting from spells and rituals there was certainly enough new information in these books of course i was likely going to not be allowed to do that i wonder if harry did put a spell on me i mused out loud wondering once again if the young man with his messy hair had actually not trusted me draco i was certain didn t so it was likely that he may have done it could someone tell when a spell had been placed upon them was there a tingle or a glow or was it just normal i really should look into that as for my problem with sirius this was going to take more time then i would like it and now there was a new problem that was going to pop up how exactly i could get books on the subject matter i needed without looking suspicious i couldntvery well just go up to madam pince and ask to see books on resurrections or the clag a bhais if she even knew what that was that would be a large glaring sign to what i had done when one added sirius and his sudden excursion back from the dead so imperfect knowledge was going to have to do for the moment when it had finally gone dark i felt a slight tug at the center of my being it broke me out of the concentration of research it was something new something i hadntexperienced before but i still knew what it was exactly sirius wanted to get somewhere that wasnt within the 300 yards since it wasntreally that strong he obviously wasntdesperate in what he wanted it was almost like he was just reminding me that he was there i was suddenly hungry madam pince i walked over to her desk carrying the books i had been reading now normally i would have put them back where they had come from but i had the distinct feeling that it was probably safer for me not to these were quite helpful i need to have some dinner now but i didntknow what you wanted i shrugged the armload of books indicating i didntknow what to do with them she jabbed her finger at a corner of her desk and i placed them there carefully the top one though i picked up again would it be possible for me to borrow this one the aged red book was titled spells and rituals that bind by allegra montevich it was the only one of the stack of books that i hadnthad a chance to read and the title at least suggested that it would certainly be worth my time to peruse for quite a while all i got was a stare from the woman made me worried that i might be her dinner but she brought out her feather duster and made a pass over the book with it i must have looked curious since she answered my question without it even being asked i put spells on the books to be sure no one ruins them they re in my care and you have to protect them i understand i once got right angry at some kids at school because they were destroying some books it was just not right since they were ripping pages out throwing the books around the librarian was useless didnteven get them into trouble i got back at them later though i smirked remembering the looks on those girls faces at the prank i had pulled on them they certainly didntthink about ruining anymore books the story did much to bring the aged librarian over to my side she actually looked somewhat fond of me as she handed the red covered book over to me madam pince it time for dinner why dontyou come down with me i d like to know a bit more about these books i gestured to the room behind me encompassing all the thousands of books in truth i might have been trying to butter the old woman up still i also did have respect for what she did and why she did it she saw herself as the protector of these books books that couldntlook after themselves disregarding the books that could like that monster book of monsters i had read about in that third book it was certainly a hard put position not with most children and adults not caring about the books her acceptance hadntbeen something i expected but she actually stood up after giving me a strange look the look had made me quite certain she would scoff at my offer of friendship if we dontget down in time we might have to sit next to professor vector the woman only talks about numbers and her cat i laughed softly and followed the older woman out of the library commenting on my own experience with people and their pets i once knew this girl who kept a photo album of her cat a n hey if anyone went to the witching hour in salem ma let me know how it was i couldntgo but if you met a snupin obsessed girl named rebecca that would have been my friend i wonder how the quidditch went i really wanted to meet charles delint and tamora pierce too oh well maybe some other time if they do it again next year i shall try and go here another chapter and right after the last one too though neither of them were too long but the next one will be much longer so i dontfeel that bad anyway enjoy and review you know if you donti will just end up in a fetal position rocking back and forth in the corner wondering where my monkey went monkey monkey oh dear i in an odd mood at the moment time to end the author notes ciao chapter 24 if i had a list of mission objectives then appeasing the great library monster was one of the first ones and i could now safely say that making friends with the librarian was checked off though perhaps using the word friend was a bit liberal but i try to be an optimist in these types of situations more often then not i a realist or a cynic but for this well irma spoke to me without the cold aloofness that had been our original encounters and the fact that i was even told her first name pushed forward my idea that i had made friends with the vulture like guardian of books all through my first dinner at hogwarts i didntcount the sandwich and crisps i had in my room the night before i discussed with her the books and the library in general she made sure to tell me plenty of stories of the hoydens who attended the school and of their complete disregard for books it gave me a sense of the students i would soon be teaching though i was certain to take what she told me with a grain of salt after all she was a cranky old woman and all the students couldntbe the spawn of satan come to earth to rid the world of the joys of books granted after my own experience with the prepubescent population a large portion of them were likely related to the devil in some way shape or form the aged librarian was actually pleasant enough surprisingly so the glimpses i received of the woman from the book made her out to just be a thorn in the heroes sides in actuality though she just took her job very very seriously while reading the books i had almost considered her a villain she wouldntlet them into the restricted section to get the books that they needed to save the day of course i was an omniscient reader i knew what they needed that book for but she didn t frankly she was protecting them from books that would harm them she d never let any of the students know that actually i dontknow if she realized she was helping the students either you can make some surprisingly good choices i looked sideways at severus who was accompanying me down to the dungeon not that it had been planned or anything we both just happened to have rooms down there and both had left the hall at around the same time that just how things worked out up until now he had been quiet enough for me to assume that he had forgotten about my presence or at least was trying his hardest to ignore me the quiet though had been pleasant enough i didntfeel the need to speak to him to fill the gaps it was different then with sirius with him it was talk or he would say something to annoy me or even worse he d get thoughtful introspective even depressed i try to make good choices all the time but what are you referring to i doubt it would be my delightful wardrobe my delightful wardrobe got a pointed look that basically said all that he thought of muggle clothing judging from who you arrived with i doubted your ability to choose suitable people to converse with who i arrived with his name is sirius i know you re smart enough to pronounce the syllables it just three of them come on say it with me sear e us not hard at all i paused at the entrance to a corridor that would lead to where my own residence was it was just down the hall from the potions classroom the look i was receiving was lacking the amused quality i had been going for in fact i was fairly certain that his estimation of my intelligence had just gone down which is hard since i dontthink he thought much of my brain at all you really are a half wit well at least i can remember people names i snorted softly there was no offence to be taken at the insult in fact i was wondering at that moment when severus was going to realize that he had actually stopped when i had even though he should have been going on to his own quarters i have no trouble with names there are just some i feel arent important enough to say i whistled softly you two i shall admit defeat tonight but i swear i shall break this feud apart either a miracle had happened and professor snape actually looked a little amused or he had heartburn it was entirely likely that it was the second option but far more pleasurable to think a crack had appeared even if it was less likely so you approved of me befriending irma then i asked getting back onto his original statement i didntthink you would be friends with anyone here that was something that had permeated my ideas from reading the books so long ago that the high aloof cold demanding potions master would not dirty himself with or be friends with any that worked at hogwarts after all there had been the idea that he was still working for voldemort and therefore would be considered better then the blood traitors and mudbloods that were working here on the other hand he wasntworking for voldemort but he was still usually a smug bastard and not the type i ever imagined to sit in front of a fire having tea and chatting with his fellow colleagues the very idea of it made me laugh unlikely for me i happened to do that out loud and in front of severus i dontcare what you think what does it say about me i wonder that i try and talk to you all the times i have i mused softly ignoring his own comment completely there was no reason to take his insults too seriously i was beginning to get quite a good handle on the man most of the insults and the threats were weak almost out of habit granted there were times he needed to be taken seriously his hatred for sirius was certainly real as real as the fear i had seen on his face when he had been threatened with voldemort return that you have rare instances of true enlightenment there it was an actual tugging at his lips the man was actually almost smiling certainly it wasntan actual smile not even close to one but one has to take joy out of the baby steps before the leaps and bounds oh severus that was almost a joke and you almost lost it for a second there i reached up and poked his cheek which was cool to the touch so the man didntjust appear cold there was almost a smile there i brought the hand back quickly tucking it behind my back trying to look too innocent to kill or hex into oblivion since that was the direction professor snape mood was taking him note to self donttease severus professor snape he corrected a bit late though since i had been calling him by his first name from the start severus i said impishly enjoying teasing the man i had no real cares for my life now i think it you who cantremember names so severus do you think people start to fit there names i didntwant to lose any limbs in the near future but if you haventtried teasing a stick in the mud potions master then you really dontknow what you re missing after all your name likely is derived from the word severe isntit the man stared at me likely deciding which end to start from either i would lose a leg or an arm first i wasntvery good at hopping but then i didntreally want to lose an arm either so many essential things require both hands you re name fits your attitude though i wonder what you would look and act like if your name was perhaps something like chuck i blinked thinking over what i had just said now i was looking at the hawknosed man and seeing him as one chuck snape fits of giggles erupted past my lips and it was so bad that i was soon bent over trying to get my breath back are you through sorry i took a few deep breaths and stood up straight trying very hard to put the correct name back on the man in front of me you probably wouldnthave made a very good chuck and you do you think you fit your meaning brilliant and happy the giggles stopped not many people would know the meaning of my name meaning that either severus had a baby names book hidden under his bed or he knew some gaelic really the man had a few things hidden up his sleeve well it depends on which brilliant you think it reflects i not brilliant in definition of intelligence but as far as bright and shining like a star well i do try my best i just have a sparkling personality i try to be happy as often as i can but i usually end up sarcastic and obnoxious severus grunted softly at that agreeing with my own assessment that i was obnoxious do you think i brilliant and happy i leaned forward peering up at him earnestly you your name should be claoidh he coughed into his hand a grin settled on my lips while my own personal handling of the gaelic language wasnta hundred percent i knew enough to know that claoidh meant annoy and vex it also happened to mean torment as well which severus was almost definitely going to know for himself the real question became in what way i was tormenting the slytherin head of house oh severus am i tormenting you in someway i fluttered my eyelashes going for the exagerrated flirtacious behaviour that i was sure was going to cause that tick on the side of snape jaw that he got when he was really rather annoyed i never gave you permission to use my name he decided to ignore the point of my question instead going back to the earlier argument i sighed somewhat annoyed that i hadntgotten an answer to that question my curiousity had been poked to life again i a dimwitted muggle we dontknow better we call everyone by their given names your name is severus so i ll use that and anyway i am a teacher as well it wouldntbe fair if i had to call you by your title that just for students i huffed softly displeased with the idea of being treated like a lesser being while i was teaching you re not dimwitted aha a compliment it is cracking i smirked you know if you like you can call me aine that would be the fair thing he grunted and one could take that as a yes i ll use your first name or a there something wrong with you that all the doctors and psychiatrists in the world will never be able to fix it was up in the air which option it was well this has been fun good night severus i grinned at him waved and turned down the corridor heading to my own rooms before i ended up pushing things a little too far i wasnttoo tired but the headmistress had told me she had sent down old lesson plans i was certain that spending an hour or so reading some antiquated ideas on how muggles used bicycles to churn butter or other nonsense would easily put me to sleep a n another chapter and this is a nice long one i ve always wondered if people prefer more chapters but shorter or longer chapters but more time between updates oh well i wanted to do a nice long chapter with stuff actually happening imagine that shocking isntit i think i managed to guilt myself into a long chapter since it been almost a week since the last update so everyone who went to witching hour i hope you all had fun my friend went and she said she had fun and got a lot of snupin artwork done and met a girl who looked just like snape apparently she really looked like him like almost jumping her i wish i could have gone and met the harry draco fans apparently it was good though since she plans to go next year in las vegas must be good to travel across the country so i have also discovered that i am a review whore i want more reviews more more more even if they re just one word good bad though if it bad i would like to know why and to get more i thought i d bribe my readers isntthat horrible yes i am a horrible person oh well if i can get ten reviews for this chapter i shall go back to doing one chapter a day for at least a week if not it ll stay the normal 1 to 2 updates a week i dontexpect 10 reviews but i thought i d try the bribe chapter 25 the lesson plans proved to be more interesting then i gave them credit so much so that night turned into day before i realized it when i finally went to bed it was early morning and i slept through breakfast briefly my brain wondered if it was bad form to miss breakfast with the other teachers but i was too tired to really worry about it perhaps it was something i wouldntdo when school started but before the students arrived i wasnttoo worried about appearances when i finally opened my eyes it was with the idea that i still hadnt slept enough it was a problem of mine my predisposition to sleep most of my life away willpower was really all that kept me from going back to sleep glancing at my wristwatch on the side table told me that it was eleven in the morning not nearly enough sleep despite my own personal wish to sleep again i got up showered and retreated to my desk where i had finished writing the lesson plan i had to give to the headmistress today the students were arriving in just three days so it would be best to give the headmistress my lesson plan as soon as possible it was going to be an experience for those students as well while my stay at this school was hopefully going to be short if sirius got his act together that didntmean that i wasntgoing to take the job seriously i had a responsibility to my students even if i hadntintended to teach here before but i was here now and they were certainly going to get a rude awakening having a muggle as their muggles studies teacher this year was going to be taught in a manner that in no way resembled the previous a knock broke me away from my concentration opening the door revealed a house elf not dobby but one i had never met before hello miss mackinnion the headmistress wants you down in the hall now thank you with no warning and quite a loud popping noise the house elf disappeared uh thank you i shook my head saying it to the empty air a grumble ran through my stomach making me realize i hadnteaten since dinner the night before and it was now noon i grabbed the finished lesson plan and headed down to the great hall deciding to drop off the plan at mcgonagall office before even knowing that she would be in the hall it was likely she wouldntwant work while she was trying to eat the halls were rather quiet except for the chattering portraits and the random ghosts that wandered past that was something that was still taking time to get used to magic fine evil dark lords okay talking portraits whatever walking and talking incorporeal beings well that was still a bit odd though it was oddly liberating now i knew i had been correct all those years saying that ghosts existed to my friends in school though i doubted that i could prove it to them when i walked into the great hall i was greeted to the sight of all the teachers once again sitting at the table the sight was slightly surprising since lunch was rather informal and people just came in whenever so it was rather a coincidence that everyone was there at the same time apparently this was a mandatory lunch well i guess i wasntasked down here for my sparkling personality if you can sit down miss mackinnion i can finish what i was saying mcgonagall said ignoring my statement completely i took the free seat which happened to be next to madam pince at the end of the table i leaned over to the librarian to ask what had happened but the look from the headmistress quelled that idea so i sat straight in my chair and tried to look attentive though really all i was looking for was the food there was another attack that explained sirius worried look when i walked in who was attacked professor fulhark asked from the other end of the table once again it was just muggles but that doesntmean the parents of our students arentworried even though no wizard or witch has been attacked the ministry is taking this very seriously with the start of the school year we will have an auror on duty at all times at the school despite that though i expect you all to be absolutely heedful of any danger i know that with the dark mark appearing and muggles having been killed some rumours have been circulating whatever the cause is though i expect complete attention from you all frankly the ministry believes that the rumours are unfounded the likely answer is that some muggles are copying what they read in that book the minute the headmistress had finished talking and sat down immediately a cacophony of sound erupted with everyone discussing what they had just heard just muggles some muggles copying the book i said softly into all the noise with all the noise i didntexpect to be heard but maybe it was the look on my face that caused everyone to quiet down after all there was no way that i couldntlook exactly as i felt and that was absolute supreme anger let be on our guard for the bad people but dontworry too much since he just killing muggles that is if it is one guy doing it after all it far more likely that it some gung ho teenagers killing people like they read in that harry potter book now miss mackinnion that s mcgonagall tried to speak but i wasntin the mood to listen dont make apologies headmistress i know full well that none of you care if a few muggles die but i do care and yes i biased being one of the unimportant subspecies of muggle so perhaps i was being a little irrational if i thought about this i would fully realize that mcgonagall didntmean anything malicious that none of the teachers here meant anything it human nature to not worry unless it involves you when voldemort was killing wizards and witches that caused panic but killing muggles was almost a world away i never was one to be rational in moments of distress aine sirius started to try and calm me down from where he sat half way down the table your outburst is uncalled for professor sinistra sneered out her dark face angry next to her sat severus who was quietly staring me down from the other end of the table uncalled for or not i disgusted by all of your attitudes a wizard is out there killing people not a bunch of teenagers playing a horrible joke granted the dead are not your people but still no more words came out of my mouth my throat having closed at all the horrified stares i was receiving i stood up and stormed out of the great hall staying any longer would likely result in my immediate dismissal from the staff which would ruin harry plans i was trying to think at least slightly but at that moment i couldnthelp but think that i was the only person standing up for the entire muggle population aine sirius came running up behind me as i stalked toward the dungeons grabbing my arm to stop me from going any further he was out of breath showing that he had ran quite hard to catch up with me mcgonagall didntmean anything she just means that the ministry is taking this seriously even though no wizards died how kind of them you re being a little illogical about this of course i just a muggle and that was stupid i didntmean that how can they not think that voldemort might be alive how can they just think this is a bad joke that might happen to have resulted in a few deaths it was a preposterous idea to me of course it was voldemort did they actually think that we had fireworks that shaped out the dark mark their knowledge of muggles was really bad if they believed that or that fireworks lasted more then a few seconds of course they dontthink he alive only harry and draco knew about that horcrux and us now i snorted can you blame them they ve been blissfully unaware for the last ten years thinking that their hero harry potter saved the day and destroyed the bastard so is it that hard to understand that they might prefer to believe in a prank rather then the return of the worst evil they ve ever encountered a prank it killed people and you call it a prank my voice rose as i spoke other people call it a prank donttry taking this out on me his eyes narrowed at me the silver eyed turning to steel you re blowing this out of proportion and acting like a child and you re an insensitive lout eyes narrowed at him and his face grew stormy in response there was no surprise that sirius was now returning my anger in kind i was trying to talk to you if i had known you were going to act this irrational and bite my head of for even attempting to discuss this with you i wouldnthave bothered why dontyou go do something useful professor black go write your lesson plan or better yet go find where your damn brother hid that horcrux i turned and ran down the stairs or more correctly i stomped down the stairs once i was in the dungeons my steps slowed and things started to appear more clear yelling at sirius hadnt been the right thing to do he had just been trying to help but i couldntget around the idea that while people were dying the wizards were more worried about themselves then anything i should go apologize to sirius but the two of us couldntdo that it didntreally suit our temperament though maybe tomorrow when my temper had cooled i would offer the olive branch to him or maybe not after all he had referred to the deaths of muggles as a prank if it had been wizards it would be a horrible crime a problem that had to be solved but my kind damn i had joked before that i was like a subspecies now though it was seeming like a reality and i was still quite fuming about it a knock at my door broke me out of my thought process it was probably sirius come back to rub it in some more maybe this time it would be that the deaths were all faked by the shifty muggles and now the dead people were laughing it up in a bar somewhere sirius would you please take your wand and stuff i threw the door open as i said this but my threat drifted off into thin air as i stared helplessly at professor snape his perfect black eyebrow was raised at me in question mistake me for that dog again and i will not be responsible for what happens he walked past me into my rooms without asking for entrance but i let him walk in not that i really could have stopped him but i could have tried to frankly though i was too surprised to see him here to really do anything at all though i would love to know what you wanted him to do with his wand i have some ideas of my own but i would appreciate a different perspective my lip twitched at the joke i quite sure that your ideas are far more creative then my own but please do come in i rolled my eyes and closed the door really severus are you sure you can trust yourself alone with me in my room that doesntneed a response he turned and looked at me his dark eyes piercing into me do you normally have psychotic episodes like that at meals my eyes went hard looking at him standing by the fireplace like the lord of the manor he was going to be just as annoying as sirius my episode i paused annoyed at the word usage though psychotic episode did seem to adequately what had happened if not my mindset it best not to talk about that after all we want to try and stay on good terms dontwe an eyebrow rose arms crossed i not too worried about keeping on any terms with you you certainly know how to make a girl feel loved i snorted the other eyebrow rose at that statement he coughed quietly into his hand looking a little put out by that comment mcgonagall didntmention that the muggles that were killed were killed in the process of a break in he paused letting me think about that it was a random subject change from my outburst who ever it was that killed them i cut him off at that point a sharp bark of laughter being heard who ever of all the people in this school snape was the one who knew with an absolute certainty who it was that was doing the killing my derisive laughter rolled off his back though and he continued on who ever killed them did so while breaking into a school in new york city that certainly stopped all reasonable thought processes from forming in my brain why would voldemort kill people in new york city and even more important was why he would want to break into a school does that mean anything to you severus was watching my reactions carefully expecting something from me at this information there was something that he knew something he was waiting for it should have been impossible he shouldnthave known where i came from that information wasntcommon knowledge here there was the possibility i suppose that he knew about me from my books but as matt liked to point out so often they werentexactly widely read and severus likely didntread muggle material too often other then muggles are being killed by a wizard and none of you care i started to tap my foot wanting to end this conversation as soon as possible the potions master was digging for something i didnt want him to come up with any treasure so it wontconcern you to know it was new york university that was broken into more particularly the history offices of the school damn he definitely knew something when he was digging for something he was about as subtle as a bulldozer nyu had been broken into by voldemort that was too close for comfort the only thing he could possibly be looking for at the school was now at hogwarts me severus you re a smug bastard if you know something you could just tell me instead of digging for it it a little beneath you yes that is the school that i normally teach at isntthat an amazing coincidence i sighed walking over to chair by the fireplace and dropping into it strangely exhausted for the middle of the day i never thought news could tire someone out before but now it was a fact i was tired from just hearing about events do you know the names of the people who were killed i asked wanting to know if i knew any of the dead first cairn had been killed in my flat now possibly my coworkers had been killed harry reluctance to involve a muggle was starting to become crystal clear no after all they were just muggles a smirk played on severus lips as he threw back mcgonagall original words to me the words that had started my fit earlier i wasntangry hearing them anymore though strange as it perhaps was the slytherin was actually making a joke i regarded the dark haired man from where i sat certain things were playing across my mind things that were trying to be solved and answered he knew more then i had thought and certainly more then sirius would have thought draco would probably be the one to say professor snape would have figured it out ten minutes before you stepped off the train there is no way you can fool him but would any of them be happy about what i was thinking about doing the thing was that he knew something i didntknow to what extent though he was reaching which meant that he didntknow everything i could easily play the silly girl and get him off my back i would just have to watch my steps perhaps a bit more carefully even more so watch sirius s it wasntexactly a pleasing idea though aside from the notion of telling him what was going on there was also the case of my connection to sirius it would certainly be more helpful to have someone helping me out someone with knowledge about the magical side of things sirius was good at magic off the cuff but studying and research that wasnthis strong suit sirius is going to kill me i pinched the bridge of my nose already expecting the headache that was going to occur there a higher likelihood of being killed be a trained kneazle house pet i brought sirius back to life with a clag a bhais there was no use beating around the bush with this sort of knowledge there was no real reason to tell severus but i happened to trust the man this was part of the reason i knew sirius was going to be pissed off it was the truth though call it woman intuition a sixth sense or whatever you would like but i knew that professor snape was certainly not working for voldemort nor was he out to kill or rule over anyone excepting perhaps the more talentless of his students sirius was never going to believe that snape was trustworthy there was no great look of surprise that appeared on his face proving that he had at least suspected what i had just told him the man didnt lack intelligence so the idea of him falling for harry simple story of sirius just falling out of the veil was a bit silly but when i had said clag a bhais he had looked a little surprised well if he knew even a tenth of what i did about that object then that look was to be expected i realized someone had to have been stupid enough to bring that canine back from the dead i had though thought it was more likely to have been the saintly potter and where in the heavens did you get a hold of a death bell i frowned crossing my arms over my chest for some reason i had been out of the running as far as bringing the dead back to life why couldntit have been me to resurrect sirius i not without any talents you know he sighed like he was dealing with a child i just had thought you were smarter then to do a dangerous ritual like that i opened my mouth to respond that of course i was smarter but he cut me off take the compliment when it given mackinnion fine i uncrossed my arms i didntget the clag a bhais harry had it not sure how he acquired it and it likely i wouldntwant to know i was being regarded with an ambiguous look now there was no way that i could tell what he thought about me even though he had made it clear he wasntvery fond of what i had done though there was a chance that was to do with who i had brought back to life the same reaction would have been likely if it had been james potter who had walked into hogwarts harry had me bring back sirius because he might know where the last horcrux is his brother stole it at this severus finally looked surprised there was another one and regulus took that one that was stupid i think it was rather brave actually as i said it was stupid he died and what good did it do except prolonging his master life if he hadntstolen it then harry would have likely found it before and destroyed it regulus probably stole it for that purpose to help his lord too bad for him the gesture was misconstrued i desperately wanted to deny that possibility but there was nothing i could back up my refusal with it was just for sirius sake that i wanted to think some good of regulus saving lord voldemort having his brother back in the role of evil death eater would be horrendous for sirius to deal with the theory was actually rather sound excepting sirius memory of the last time he saw his brother but even that could be read into that he was afraid of being killed for stealing not because he was trying to bring down the dark lord you re a very negative person you know that i huffed out slouching in my chair and glaring at the dark haired man who was now leaning against the fireplace mantel realistic my dear so i told you pretty much everything are you going to betray my confidence woman intuition or not there was the possibility i was wrong after all it could just be cramps and not sixth sense at play the quiet lasted too long and i shifted nervously under the heavy gaze shiver ran up my spine as i felt the eyes travel over me from head to toe and who would i betray you to a small smile had actually appeared on his thin lips and i found myself staring at the strange thing i broke my gaze away from his lips and promptly brought it back up to look into his eyes well you might tell other old order members harry doesntwant everyone knowing since he the hero and he canthave more people in the spotlight i rolled my eyes at that little statement since it was ridiculous and the potions master knew that well enough by now he ll probably want to curse me when he finds out i told you but i had my reasons and those were there was blatant curiosity in his voice well there was a side effect from my ritual bringing sirius back to life you mean that ridiculous spiritual connection you two have from one of his spells backfiring there was definite sarcasm in his voice as he said the end of that making me see that he had never believed that sirius and i were connected by any accident that was likely one of the biggest clues to what we had actually done ah so you dontthink he that incompetent of course he is but when added to his coming back to life rather suddenly certain connections could be inferred well whatever my brows knit together well i need some help severing the connection my knowledge is rather limited on the subject of actual magical connections i know that the blood was the cause of it and the wound i have wontactually heal properly i pushed up the sleeve on my left arm showing severus the reddish flesh that had knit together again but still looked weak like at the slightest provocation would open up once again i trust you and i know you would be the person best suited to helping me find a way to get rid of sirius i smiled at him as i said this last putting it in a way that would cause the slytherin to empathize with me getting rid of sirius wasntwhat i really meant more my mandatory connection with him that limited my movements and kept me going home though the idea of being connected to sirius was likely to give severus nightmares for weaks so he would be more inclined to help if made it sound like i didntwant to be around the animagus you need my help i sighed nodding my head why the man was repeating what i had already said was beyond me and what do i get in return his voice practically purred as he asked this and my stomach twisted upon hearing it the shivers back in force the question was too intimate in it nature for me not to read into it random fantasies flew through my head i shook my head though needing to get back on track and in focus i leaned forward and smiled brightly up at him i wonttell sirius that you burst into my room while i was changing and saw me naked severus eyes went wide a pale blush creeping over his white skin i never did that of course you didn t but sirius wouldntknow that he d believe me i tapped my forefinger on my chin looking thoughtful for that matter everyone else would believe me as well your reputation would certainly be ruined imagine all the teachers thinking that you would try and force yourself upon a poor defenseless muggle my eyelashes fluttered innocently of course if you promise to help me i swear i wonttell about your dirty habits for more moments then i could count severus stared at me hard only then did i think that he was a wizard and could and likely would curse me with something suitably horrible for even thinking about threatening him though he certainly couldntkill me but there was likely a memory charm he could do to make me forget about threatening him it would have been interesting to see the debate raging in his head at this exact moment hex her or agree with her probably a rather one sided argument but i was shocked more then just shocked i felt like i had been run over by a ten ton lorry and survived been selected to be the next miss america had matt tell me he was sorry for being an ass for all these years since what i was seeing was just as unlikely as any of those things severus snape was smiling not a sneer not a grimace not even a smirk it was a full complete and amazing smile it wasntfull teeth or bright and beaming but it was shocking because it was genuine i was so dazzled by the expression that i almost missed the compliment that followed the look you would have made a surprising slytherin a n well i didntget ten reviews for that last chapter but seven is great of course i adore any review i get but cantreneg on my deal though so no daily updates though if i get three more for that chapter i ll be happy to do the daily updates i had intended to do good sized chapters each day as well oh well it looks like most of you prefer long chapters less frequently then shorter ones sooner i shall endeavour to keep everyone pleased this particular chapter isntsuper long but that simply because the next one is like 4000 words didntwant to combine the two thank you to everyone who reviewed i really am fueled by reviews after every review i get i feel like writing soooooo everyone keep that in mind the more reviews i get then longer and more frequent the chapters will be not that i hinting at anything well maybe a little oh and to those who wondered really dontworry aine shall start teaching soon only like one more chapter after this and then the students arrive sorry if it has seemed long but when i started to write this i was determined not to just skip to the major plot points i wanted to make sure the story got developed and that the characters were as well so while it may be a long story i do hope it is worth it please though tell me if you think it getting off track chapter 26 i was on my way to see sirius it was now after dinner and here i was on my way to see the man against all my own personal ideas i could be the greater human being and go to apologize for my having gotten angry at him earlier even though all he had been doing was trying to see if i was okay but quite frankly i not that great of a person and i still was stubbornly annoyed with sirius for calling the outright murder of muggles a prank right so maybe he hadntbeen calling it that himself but stating what other people thought and so therefore my entire reason for being angry with him was moot i had been trying to convince myself to stay annoyed with him but in the end the logical side of my brain was telling me that there was no reason to be annoyed in fact i had just convinced myself out of the annoyance all that aside though that wasntwhy i was making a trip to sirius room no this trip could entirely be blamed on one egotistical potions master it could be blamed entirely on him and his inability to keep his mouth shut about certain things severus professor snape i just told you something that may end up with me being transfigured into a rat and you re still going on about that it was a secret you werentsupposed to know do you get that first i dontthink sirius could transfigure a bag into a paper hat second is it really counted a secret if i knew before you told me you suspected that all now shut up about the protocol of what i need to call you you can not tell sirius that you know he doesnt have to know and if he does he ll not be happy about it i was tapping my fingers along the arm of the chair i sat in the professor was still standing by the fireplace his fingers steepled in front of his face looking thoughtful about what i said perhaps he would actually show a little compassion to his former rival you want me to not tell him that i know because it might hurt his feelings an eyebrow rose in my direction there doesnt appear to be any real reason to keep him in the dark about this my fingers dug into the wood glaring at the man standing nonchalant in front of me of course he didntsee a problem telling sirius causing a blow up of epic proportions after all sirius being angry with him was nothing new the problem was that i was going to have the gryffindor man angry with me and the headache was something i wasntlooking forward to so i was thinking a bit selfishly but there was legitimate reasons i dontwant him to know because he hates you he doesnttrust you he thinks that you are working for lord voldemort and the mention of the name the normally implacable potions master winced he finds out that you know he ll assume that you shall inform your master not true i know i raised my hand cutting him off before he even had a chance to say anything the point though is that i need him to concentrate on finding that horcrux i will let him know that i know a small smirk appeared on his face for no other reason then it the right thing to do i snorted i could tell everyone you tried to attack me you already used that one up getting me to help you with your involuntary desire to stay in black company and now i was on my way to do a little damage control it was either let professor snape tell or do it myself neither choice was really a viable option in my opinion but i had been boxed into a corner by that slimy git letting severus do the breaking would just result in more problems after all he would put it in the worst way possible and likely he wouldnt do anything to calm sirius about his supposed allegiance to the dark lord wizard instead he would mock taunt tease and aggravate sirius now if i told sirius well he would still be pissed off incredibly so but i could at least make him see that this could be helpful in the long run after all severus was a slytherin and regulus had been a slytherin so where sirius couldntgo not that i expected severus to offer up much help so now i had to go and give myself a canine sized headache sirius opened his door looking ready for bed though thankfully fully clothed for bed there was no way i was going to trust myself in his room if he was going to be less then fully clothed rather tempting i have to say just having the bed nearby i have to say though that given some thought on the matter i would have assumed that the man would have gone to bed sans clothing or perhaps that was my own furtive imagination the look he gave me as he opened the door though was less then pleased rather annoyed really have you come to yell at me like a banshee again my eye started to twitch i was no banshee nor did i yell like one but i couldntget into a fight with him over that again i only had enough patience for one argument this night and that one was the lesser of my two worries a banshee though really my skin was not green tinged nor was i in any way skeletal could lose a few pounds actually so i really wasnta banshee in any appearance and if he was suggesting my voice had any banshee like quality right have to tell him about severus not focus on the screechlike qualities of my voice look i really sorry about that i understand i swallowed my urge to stubbornly cling to what i thought earlier i understand you didntmean anything malicious so i sorry for yelling at you he had moved further into the room which was done up in all red and gold colours obviously a tribute to his favourite house his own house not answering for a moment he dropped into a chair by the fireplace a large overstuffed red armchair what do you want at my surprised and frankly outraged look he smirked slightly i haventknown you very long only a week really but in that time i have realized your deadly stubborn you only apologize after you have been apologized to not to mention you looked like you had swallowed a skrewt when you said that my nose wrinkled and my brows knit together as i huffed as his rather apt conclusion so he wasntthat thick headed despite some very compelling evidence to that case i muttered softly mainly about annoying thick headed canines and walked over to sit on the couch in front of the fire sirius i have something to tell you it not easy to tell you but i going to have to going to have to tell him or risk having a full blown fight break out between two old rivals whenever anyone starts a conversation with that line things just go downhill from there sirius looked immediately concerned though and moved from the armchair to sit on the couch next to me peering intensely forward at me is everything all right he asked earnestly why couldntyou have been like that before instead of treating the murders as unimportant because they were muggles there was a degree of compassion in the silver eyes i hadntbeen paying attention before had he had that look before a groan came past his lips and he leaned back into the couch rolling his eyes towards heaven i believe we ve been over this already i didntmean that i thought it was unimportant because they were muggles but that other people would think that why are you taking this all so personally personally i am a muggle how much more personal could it possibly be and apparently i the only one who cares at all about muggles i paused thinking that sounded a bit silly since after all i was a muggle and therefore i should care about myself that wasntall that was getting me worked up though it was what severus had told me earlier that the second attack had been a break in at nyu it was possible that i was what they had been after and so the conclusion would be that whoever had died had died because of me i wasntangry i was feeling guilty the logical side of my brain broke that down quickly enough saying the only one at fault for a person death is the person who causes said death not to mention if i was going to blame myself for their deaths i could go steps back and blame other people i could blame sirius for being dead or harry for wanting me to bring him back there were plenty of people to blame but it doesnthelp at all placing blame on people well except blaming voldemort blaming him was after all a given the bad guy of the story is always the center of the blame okay okay nevermind i shook my head digging a hand into my own brown locks i was starting to feel a little stressed what i wouldnt give to go back to new york and teach a class of future stock brokers and corporate ceos hell at this point in time i was ready to go back home and teach a class of preschoolers who knew only to poop in their diapers and how to eat crayons i tired stressed and frightened okay you might be used to fights with evil wizards who want to kill you but i not all right without saying anything sirius had slipped his hand over mine squeezing it gently warmth flowed from his hand into my own i looked up from my intense perusal of the crimson carpet to find his face a mere few inches from my own his eyes silver and flowing an intensity that i had yet to deal with before my face grew hot and the old shivers went down my spine being this close to this particular man was a fantasy come to life but not a good idea sirius i said his name in an attempt to stop where this was going to stop what i perhaps did want to happen but which was inevitably going to lead to a whole lot of trouble moving my lips though really hadntbeen a good idea because now his eyes were watching them i was frozen still as he moved in even closer time seeming to have frozen along with me he paused only a few inches from my face i could feel his hot breath on my lips there was no way that i could allow sirius black to kiss me but my brain and my body were at odds once again i knew it was a bad idea i knew it was going to cause trouble but my body didntrecognize those arguments instead all it saw was the way his hair was loose and falling into his eyes how those eyes were shining silver eager and passionate all my body saw was his lips all i could feel was the hot breath all i could smell was sirius own distint scent of cinnamon and fragrant if i could stop this thoughl and even more damning was how i realized i was leaning into him ready to accept his kiss fate though sometimes has it useful moments even if it was such a cliched use of fate as a knock on the door a n a nice new long chapter since people have told me they prefer longer chapters that what i going to do i have to say i prefer doing less frequent longer chapters takes a bit of pressure off me to update more often thank you to everyone who reviewed i adore you all i have to say though that an interesting point was brought up when someone suggested she choose severus is she going to choose anyone i the writer and even i dontknow that aspect of the plot sort of grows on it own but the point was valid that she certainly has more in common with the potions master then sirius but physical attraction also has a strong case too good case of head vs heart or more correctly mind vs lust heh even i looking forward to the end and resolution of the whole scenario anyway enjoy this chapter and as always i love hearing everyone thoughts on the story chapter 27 fate sometimes has it useful moments a knock sounded on the door and the noise broke me out of the coma like state i had just been in making me jump off the couch suddenly very eager to get away from the man lips sirius sighed rubbing his hand over his face and if my hearing wasntmistaken he was mumbling almost over and over again he got reluctantly up off of the couch and moved to the door i moved back onto the couch crouched on top of it peering over the top watching as he opened the door almost like i was using the couch as a barrier between the man and me if i was lucky it was severus here to tell sirius all the details of what i had told him if i was unlucky then it was severus here to tell sirius all the details of what i had told him and that he had seen me naked effectively cutting out my blackmail to get him to help me instead of a hawk nosed potions master sweeping in like he owned the place i watched as a flurry of brown hair flew into the room latching onto sirius and knocking him back a few steps i sat up a little straighter a bit in confusion and as much as i hated to admit it a spark of jealousy looking at the young woman who had her arms tightly around his waist the jealousy though died down at the absolute disarray appearing on sirius face he was as in the dark as i was sirius you re alive harry told us as much but her voice was filled with unshed tears and amazed disbelief i then noticed the young man standing in the doorway a bright smile plastered on his freckled face when added together with his bright red hair then there was really only one family that the man could come from he had to be a weasley all right so there are plenty of red haired and freckled men in the world but i wasntjust jumping to conclusions after all he knew sirius and was at hogwarts and knew harry adding two and two together this time came to four the age also named him as ronald weasley harry best friend so the unveiling of the young man still standing in the doorway made me look more closely at the young woman who now had disentangled herself from sirius and was wiping away a few tears from her brown eyes if that was one ron weasley then this had to be his wife and mother of his two children hermione granger well probably hermione weasley now i almost choked on the laugh that threatened to spill out at that name with the discovery of their identities i ducked back down behind the back of the couch a bit peering over the top and watching the reunion from my impromptu bunker though judging from sirius still confounded look he hadntbeen able to put two and two together he was still coming up with three mione luv he hasntseen us for twelve years dontyou think he might not know who we are though more correctly the last time he had seen us we were just 15 years old ron walked into the room and held his hand out to sirius the smile still stuck on his face how it going mate how was being dead it was rather nice being just an observer since the two new arrivals hadntnoticed me yet at all one couldntreally expect them to since there was a living miracle standing in front of them no one had ever looked better after being dead for so long i took a perverse amount of pleasure from accomplishing that ron weasley hermione granger now things were clicking with sirius and he was looking at the young man and woman like he was now remembering them wait harry mentioned you two had gotten married so it hermione weasley now isntit i couldntreally blame sirius for being a little slow after all except for the whole red hair and freckles thing i wouldnthave placed them either the movie representations for the two had been quite a bit off this ron was better looking in my opinion though no one would ever say that he was going to win any best looking wizard contests in any reality but unlike the version i had grown used to this one wasntas goofy looking instead he had filled out growing into a young man who perhaps wasntexactly mature looking but didnt look like he should be working as a clown either his clothes werent second hand rags anymore either instead plain well worked clothes that just showed that he had grown up and was doing rather well on his own or with help from his ever clever wife now hermione on the other hand and meaning no ill will toward the girl even though she had just hugged sirius was not as attractive as the girl who had played her in the movies though that casting i had always thought had been a bit off hollywood going seemingly more for attractiveness then to match all the characteristics of the character in the book this young woman was rather plain looking in a purely objective way her brown eyes though sparkled with intelligence and the smile she had made her face shine it was a face with character even if it wasntgoing to fit on the cover of vogue or wizard weekly i rather preferred the reality to what the screen had chosen i was gratified too that the brown hair was still rather bushy though tamed a bit by being pulled back with a simple hair band now it was sirius who was hugging the girl and my eye twitched involuntarily he then moved and clasped his arms around ron in a warm greeting i hadntthought that he had been particularly close with these two gryffindors it had always been my thought that they had been harry friends and that was the only real connection i had never really thought much more about it but as i had been told many times usually by draco there was a lot that the books had missed the order had been headquartered at his family house and hermione and ron had been there quite a bit and hermione had been involved in saving sirius life back in that third book now that one had always been my favourite i had loved that hippogryff i wonder what had happened to that bird the idea crossed my mind that it had settled down with another hippogryff in the north of england and had raised many hatchlings or whatever a creature like that had eggs or live babies it was an idea worth possible further investigating sirius mate we re not interrupting anything are we ron had finally noticed me and raised an eyebrow at me peering over the couch causing my cheeks to pink slightly realizing that i had basically been hiding from them common courtesy suggested that i should have greeted them as well when they had entered the room or at least made myself known but it was far more interesting to watch silently the red haired young man voice suggested that there had been something indecent going on when they arrived remembering the close call before their knock only made my cheeks redden more not that i could blame you this off hand compliment just made the red darken hermione didntlook put out at her husband admiring statement she just rolled her eyes not really no sirius smirk suggested though that he was thinking about what had almost happened as well and that he considered that something had certainly almost happened and given the chance he d finish it soon hermione ron this is my fellow professor aine mackinnion she teaching muggle studies this year aine these are harry old friends ron and hermione i waved at them from my position on the couch not really wanting to move from the spot hopefully they would just take it as embarrassment at being found in sirius room though really that wasntwhat i wanted anyone to think either muggle studies really hermione was regarding me carefully and i couldnthelp but think i was being judged in some way i wanted to teach that but i could never get a job here inside i winced so i had the job she had wanted though the very idea that she wouldntbe given the job seemed utterly ridiculous after all she was hermione granger the smartest witch of her age the one who could do any spell put before her and with her muggle parents a perfect choice to teach the subject some of my thoughts must have showed on my face since hermione gave a soft laugh dont worry i not going to spend the evening glaring at you i had wanted the job but the old professor lilikins wasntgoing anywhere anytime soon by the time she had decided to wander off to america i was happily situated at the ministry in the muggle affairs department so it all worked out rather well how did you get the job i was still crouched on the couch not moving a muscle even though i was being spoken to from the other side of the room it might have looked rather silly but now i was comfortable and not about to move judging from her question she had heard some things from harry but certainly not everything including anything about me well telling her a bit about me was certainly not going to cause too much of a problem well who better to teach muggle studies then a muggle i smirked slightly but it became a nervous smile as ron and hermione looked at me mouths agape okay maybe a muggle born wizard would have been better but i needed the job and harry was nice enough to get me the position that ridiculous ron whistled a muggle teaching a bunch of teenaged wizards i remember what fred and george did to their teachers he paused for a second of course you wonthave them to deal with so you re lucky there but every year has the students who want attention by playing jokes and sometimes they re dumb enough to do it on their teachers are you saying your brothers are stupid hermione rose an eyebrow an amused quality to her voice ron just scoffed at the question if they were stupid they wouldntbe making more money then everyone at the ministry combined he voice lowered there not that it would be hard with our salaries but still a muggle with wizards even a harmless joke could be serious to someone who cantdo magic it a ridiculous idea muggles wouldntknow the first thing about teaching wizards he smiled slightly at me no offense or anything none taken i smiled rather amused by the whole conversation i think it rather a brilliant idea actually the students need to learn to interact with muggles hermione smiled reassuringly at me while a muggleborn wizard might be able to handle the students they still are influenced by their new surroundings and situation a muggle is always a muggle and mcgonagall would flay anyone alive that messed with a muggle at the school i sure you ll do fine oh i not worried about that in the slightest actually i d be more worried about sirius over there i nodded at sirius who was looking surprised at my suggestion i will be a fine teacher i sure all the students will look up to me with awe and respect ron and i both snorted and hermione had to cover her mouth likely to hide a rather amused grin this all caused sirius to get rather sulky but he got over it quickly enough offering both of his guests seats he himself took a seat next to me on the couch but i made sure to scoot down to the end not wanting to sit too close to him this movement didntpass by unnoticed but he just smirked slightly i sat on my end of the couch and played the rather quiet observer it was quite fascinating watching sirius chat so animatedly with these two young adults who he had last seen as rather feisty adventurous fifteen year olds it was like seeing a whole new sirius as he conversed his eyes werentbroken or haunted and for once he wasntbeing flirtatious or being a trouble maker he was just talking to two people he hadntseen in a very long time at least in their standards of time i really should ask him how time had passed in the veil my eyes followed all the movements of sirius hands watched as his hands brushed back his hair out of his eyes with little concern to how it messed it up even further watched as his hands moved back and forth as he talked excitedly with hermione about her children or with ron about how quidditch was going the slender fingers were circling patterns in the red fabric of the couch fascinated i couldntbreak my gaze away from watching the older man until of course he noticed my constant perusal the pleased smile made me take my eyes off him immediately noticing that sirius hadntbeen the only one to be paying attention to where i had been looking hermione looked thoughtful and ron looked like he was about to laugh adamant not to be caught staring at sirius again i instead kept my eyes firmly on his guests trying to act attentive to the conversations though frankly all i was wondering was what i was going to do when they were finally gone and i was alone with the man again i still had to tell him that i had blown our cover with severus not that it had been the best cover in my opinion my attention though was brought sharply back to the conversation going on around me as sirius almost destroyed one of harry imperatives to keep his friends out of all this sirius hermione was leaning forward in the chair she had curled up in her brown hair falling over her shoulder i thrilled that your back harry is at the happiest i ve ever seen him but her voice stilled for a moment her eyes going serious i dont understand how you are here with us right now i knew harry would have explained to hermione exactly the same thing he would have told everyone else that it had been a mystery as to why sirius came out of the veil she was as subtle as severus in her digging though and it had to be as obvious to sirius as it was to me she was skeptical of what harry had told her wanting to know more information on what had happened i didntthink that she was distrustful of what her old friend had told her just that she thought she could find out something secret from the source oh you can thank aine here she the entire reason i here right now sirius had a bright smile on his face as he answered hermione my foot whipped out and kicked sirius hard in the side he grunted in response so apparently hermione rather obvious digging was actually rather subtle for mr black as subtle as my own kick which i was now playing off with the innocent school girl act i sorry sirius dear my foot fell asleep i giggled even though that felt like it set me back 10 iq points i smiled at hermione and ron who were looking at me like i was a bit crazy just ignore sirius he been flirting with me shamelessly for a while now and his latest try has been to say that i his reason for living it really is rather flattering ron blue eyes seemed trusting believing my coy tittering but hermione still looked a bit skeptical next to me sirius was looking rather shame faced a blush on his cheeks realizing now what he had almost done well that certainly true sirius laughed recovering immediately from the slight slip and really could you blame me his arm was now lazily draped behind me over the back of the couch his body closer normally i would have kicked him again pushed his arm away but now i had to just laugh quietly following through with the made up story next to me sirius looked rather pleased with where the situation had gone sometimes i couldnthelp but wonder if he had contrived all of this to give him reason to get closer without me hurting him i sat quietly not moving for fear of accidentally touching the man next to me but i watched as the conversation started up again this time staying far away from where sirius had been these last twelve years and how he had managed to come back to life again the weasley couple were pleasant company but i had to say that i was rather thrilled when they had to excuse themselves and go back home to their kids aine can i speak to you hermione pulled me off to the side out of the hearing of the boys i put on a well placed smile even though i was expecting to find it falter in the next few seconds when you re teaching the students just remember this you may be the muggle and they the wizards but you have the best card up your sleeve they all care about winning the house cup she grinned at the suggestion she was making i couldnthelp but let out a relieved sigh advice was far better then what i had been expecting i dontknow what you and sirius are doing here but be careful i know harry is up to something and wontinvolve me because of the kids but if you need any help just contact me i watched as hermione granger said goodbye to sirius promising to visit again with the kids and then push her husband out the door before he started up about quidditch again perhaps i should tell harry about what hermione had said to me it would likely be something that he would want to know that even despite his own caution his friend had begun to suspect him actually it was rather naive of the usually intelligent potter to think that his super intelligent friend wouldntnotice things what did hermione say to you i blinked at sirius she has some suspicions i tried to look at him sternly but i couldntkeep the amusement from my eyes of course your little slip didnthurt at all i rolled my eyes well it got me closer to you with you having nowhere to go he smirked slightly and my eye twitched in response the man had some devious qualities quickly i moved away from him and curled up at the end of the couch again glaring at sirius as he sat down as well making sure he knew well enough to keep his distance this time if he intended to stay on this particular piece of furniture issues with hermione and her inkling aside there was still the original purpose of my visit sirius my original reason to be here curiosity shone in sirius eyes and he looked strangely attentive well severus at even the mere mention of the potions master name the curiosity died and anger flared up in his gray eyes though that could be because of mentioning the man or my use of his first name professor snape knew about you being raised from the dead and our connection there was a certain quality of rage that hung around sirius after that little statement it occurred to me that he wasntbeyond the option of storming out of this room right now marching down to severus room and beating the crap out of him when it came to severus i didntthink that sirius would bother with magic well he sort of knew but i told him i grimaced at the look i was receiving now it was exactly as i had imagined it would be the rage that had originally been directed at severus snape was now partly aimed in my direction there was a certain amount of betrayal appearing in sirius face his face hard his eyes even harder dontget too angry with me i know you hate the man but i trust him he not working for voldemort and i needed some help researching how to sever our connection his eye was twitching his fingers digging into the material of the couch you he took a deep breath closing his eyes a few minutes passed as i sat there fidgeting nervously in the silence finally he broke into the quiet his own voice almost inaudible you told him everything didntyou the ritual our connection the horcrux at my mute agreement he sighed harry wanted no one to know and who did you tell the one person who is the most likely to prance off to the dark lord and tell him everything i snorted unaccepting of that conclusion the image of severus prancing anywhere was enough to make me want to laugh even if the situation didntwarrant it you hate snape i know that but he not evil you re going to have to trust me on this one i stopped there waiting letting him even try to tell me that my trust wasntworth it when he stayed quiet i continued on he a smart man he had already put two and two together he suspected what i had done it was either tell him or let him continue to dig around and if he had done that then someone else might have started to pay attention harry is not going to be happy sirius sighed the rage cooling off a bit hell i not happy when it comes to that man you re never happy i huffed softly you re just going to have to trust me now it was his turn to huff at my remark you donthave to like him you donteven have to spend anytime with him all you do need to do is promise not to try and kill the man i wouldnttry sirius gave a particularly nasty smirk with that comment apparently finding the idea of killing severus funny i couldntfind it too amusing though not when i was actually worried he might be a bit serious no bad puns intended yes right anyway i shall deal with severus so you can just continue looking for that horcrux like you have been doing havent you my eyebrow rose in question and sirius coughed into his hand looking a tad bit quilty sirius you have been looking right yes but his voice dipped a bit my memory isntworking the way i want it to sometimes i find myself going in circles in this place his face was vulnderable weak but he forced a bright and sunny smile onto it dontworry though i think once the students are back and the place is alive again things will get better i didntsay anything there really wasntanything to be said nothing could be said to make sirius feel better about the holes in his memory i didntknow what was keeping us connected and i had no idea what could be causing this problem either or if it was even part of the same problem he had been dead that could be the problem or it could just be age getting to him it was actually a good thing to have involved severus if sirius couldntdo the job do you want to know something amazing i grinned at the man changing the subject seemed the best idea i actually manipulated severus into doing what i wanted and when i did it the amazing thing was that he smiled not a smirk or a sneer a full blown smile it was like seeing the statue finally crack i think i should mark it down on my calendar it certainly unlikely to happen again really the man should learn to do that more often it softened his face actually warmed it up a somehow sirius had moved faster then i had been able to notice being so distracted by my own conversation on the professor smile now i had a completely different distraction making me see stars my body going cold and hot in a space of a few seconds sirius lips had covered my own warm lips pressed to my own which felt cold in comparison his breath mingling with mine my wide eyes stared into his silver eyes unable to blink or look away ages past or seconds my brain had lost the function to tell time until finally at last he pulled away a small smile on his lips and not a glimmer of guilt or regret on his face why why did you do that my voice cracked as i said the words my tongue licking my lips and catching a lingering taste of cinnamon you looked too happy talking about snape smile i couldnthelp it he pushed himself off the couch holding a hand out to me to help me up i ignored the offer and stood up on my own now realizing fully what he had done and not too pleased that he had pulling back his hand he looked a little regretful of my turning down his offer but he shrugged and smiled consider it your payment for me not killing professor snape now i need to get some sleep the students arrive in just five days and i have a lesson plan to finish and a horcrux to try and find good night he didntsee that i left just walked into his bedroom and closed the door leaving me standing rather awkwardly in the middle of his living room cinnamon still clinging to my lips a n it been a week since everyone seemed to prefer longer chapters this is likely to be normal but at least it nice and long and important stuff happens thank you tish for the review of the last chapter as the only reviewer i feel free to respond to you while she certainly thinks sirius is attractive aine doesnt like him just for that though it certainly true she has more in common perhaps with severus they re both interesting choices but i have to say relationships are not definite so who knows what will happen i hope people liked the appearance of the weasels i mean the weasleys it was an event that had to occur since with a dead man coming back to life everyone was going to find out no one else who cared about sirius is really around in this chapter the students arrive which i know people have been waiting to happen it only been 28 chapters heh please also remember i am terrible at poetry so the hat song well try not to judge me on that too hard and with students means some more new characters anyway please review the story this chapter took so long for me to get finished since i didntreally want to write too much i want to write when i get reviews not trying to blackmail or anything it just a fact not to mention it helps me decide where to go based on what people think so no cookies this time but more reviews faster updates chapter 28 to say that i was avoiding sirius over the next five days would perhaps have been a misstatement i wasntavoiding so much as taking great pains to not be in the same place as him the two things are completely different one means that you re embarrassed the other means that you just dontwant to see someone my great pains became so blatantly obvious that everyone noticed and remarked upon them after all sirius and i had arrived at the school together and had seemed to have gotten along so remarkably well that days of avoidance and silence was like a marching band on the grounds trumpting knowledge to everyone who could hear headmistress mcgonagall made a point of asking me point blank if we were starting a feud of our own which while our business it was not allowed to interfere with our teaching nymphadora or tonks as she made the point every time she saw me though i still admit to amusing myself by aggravating her with her real name was concerned about her cousin she made a concerted effort to bridge the gap between us even though she had no clue as to what the fight was about or if there even was one though rather astute she knew it would have likely been sirius who had started it and madam pince rather surprisingly suggested certain things that i never would have thought a lady of her age and personality would have even known about though i was surprised after finding out that she read some rather racy novels my own personal suspicion was that she was planning an ambush on mr filch but the mere thought frightened me enough to drop the idea now severus took a rather blatant amount of joy from the situation even if it was subdued or as subdued as he was capable of are you of all people avoiding i was sitting in the staff room when severus asked me that question it was finally the day that the students were supposed to arrive and frankly i was in the middle of a panic attack now i hadntbeen deluding myself or anything but now finally it was hitting me that i was in completely new territory and that territory included people with the ability to turn me into a horned toad i have nothing against amphibians but it is hard to teach as one i never avoid well then you are particularly talented at being in a different place from black at all times i have to say it a talent i would rather like to acquire the potions professor was standing in the doorway of the room a slight smirk on his face he rather good at it as well that was true while i had tried rather hard to not be in the same room as sirius he had also appeared to be trying something along the same lines as me it grated on my nerves though after all i was the one who had the reason to be annoyed i had been the one who personal space had been violated sirius had no reason to avoid me this isntabout me knowing certain things severus stated the facts simply not hesitation or question in his voice once again the damned man was seeing behind the veneer i hated it when he did that i have to say i amazed that you know anything there was bite in my words my problems with sirius my panic over the students arriving and the overlying problem of voldemort making me snap at the man and while he was trying to goad me into revealing something he didntdeserve my bad temper no this little game of hide and avoid isntat all about you entirely i remembered sirius explanation for the kiss severus had been inadvertently responsible for this mess all because he had to smile but i didntblame him no that was all professor black problem he got unexplainably jealous about my enjoyment over seeing severus mask crack it had been a nice smile though the students will be arriving at around 5 o clock hagrid will be going to meet them and bring the first years in the boats over the lake the other students will take the carriages so they arrive before the first years and can get settled for the sorting all teachers need to be in the great hall to greet the students at 5 30 you are not the head of any house so you donthave much that needs to be done at the moment just stay out of trouble if you can you sprout flitwick and who are heads of house professor tonks took over as the head of gryffindor so i had only a few more hours to prepare for the possible destruction of my entire life really i love students not necessarily children but i like teaching them i was likely worrying unnecessarily over this in all likelihood nothing bad was going to happen they might have had an edge over me but i was still a teacher and they wouldnt use that edge not if they wanted to win the house cup my eye started to twitch when i started to remember the books and the descriptions of some of the pranks the students had played or the attitude of the slytherin house members toward muggles panic was a natural response in this situation no one cares at all about muggle studies the teacher is practically useless severus said drily before sweeping out of the room in a typical theatrical way his robes flaring perfectly around him lips now twitched up into a small smile severus snape had actually tried to comfort me it was done in a way that most people wouldnthave realized it most would have taken it as an insult instead i realized that in snape own way he was trying to reassure me that the students werentgoing to make a big deal over me since i was teaching a class that most didnteven have to take since it was an elective in fact i could likely go the entire year never even meeting some of the students the thought caused my panic to go away instead the stubborn dragon reared it ugly head inside of me i was a teacher and magic or not these students were going to be under my influence everyone knows that if you show any fear in a class you ll get torn down with no warning your body flung aside and the replacement wheeled in all in a matter of a few seconds to coin a cliched phrase i was going to show them all who was boss the ones in my class and the ones that weren t since i was going to be here i might as well take the opportunity to not just teach what a pencil was for or why a pair of bunny slippers wasntsupposed to be worn in public but to also teach that muggles were not subspecies not necessarily meant in a literal way but i was going to kick a little ass put some respect for us normal non magic users into them or if that failed then perhaps i d try some fear seating at the start of term feast proved to be an interesting development one that i was certain that the headmistress had constructed herself if i didntknow better then i would have thought that she was trying to stir up the pot a little but that seemed to be against her nature on mcgonagall right was severus and next to him was sirius and next to him well i couldntavoid him forever now could i there was though the choice of turning to my right and talking to professor sinistra all night but the look she was given me as she sat down suggested that if i tried then i would be sporting a new scaley look sooner then i had anticipated or i could sit up straight stare ahead and not open my mouth for anything other then food and drink that idea though was not in my nature it was too much like retreating sirius i leaned in toward him stopping when my mouth was just a scant few inches from his own ear whether it was the close proximity my breath near his ear or just the fact that i had actually spoken to him he tensed up at just the mention of his name try and keep your mouth off of me in the future my smile was rather open and friendly to the casual observer but i knew that sirius would see the steel in it as well i can only promise to try aine sirius grinned at me apparently forgetting in just a few seconds that he had also been avoiding me for five days my nails started to tap on the wood of the table suddenly i had the bad feeling that i had just been cornered into making the first move severus you have my permission to turn him into whatever you would like when the mood takes you i muttered this angrily over sirius head to severus who at least appeared to not be paying attention to our conversation but his eyes had a distinct hard appearance and he looked rather too eager to comply with my suggestion though really when wasnthe eager to turn sirius into all matters of disgusting creatures the two professors had made a great deal of effort to maneuver themselves so that they were as far as possible from each other at the table a great feat indeed since they were sitting next to each other each one though had moved their chairs in the opposite direction leaving a good foot and a half between their chairs it had the adverse effect of causing sirius to be too close to me though i was going to take immense pleasure in elbowing him accidentally during dinner it wouldntsurprise me if the headmistress didntdo the same thing to severus snivellus shouldntyou be out there preparing to frighten the first years into premature old age with just the sight of your greasy skin severus i corrected sirius automatically but flushed slightly at the look i got from the potions master i dontlead the first years in that job belongs to your cousin she seems to be rather capable of bringing herself to their level i wondered if i should just push my chair in between the two of them since a fight was likely to break out if the growls from sirius were any indication one should never insult his family members at least not the nice ones though with that man and severus anything could set them off but somehow no chairs went flying sirius stayed seated and his growls ended taking the lack of fighting as a miracle it gave me the time to take a few deep breaths and think about what was going to occur in likely only a few minutes the great hall was decked out rather festively to welcome the students back as well as the new ones banners of each of the houses hung over each table though green and grey were the majority of the banners indicating that slytherin had one the house cup last year indeed professor snape had pointed out to me that his house had actually won the cup for the last five years in a row before that he said a note of surprise in his voice that somehow hufflepuff had managed to win for three years i had to share his amazement with no offense meant to the badger house i just could never imagine them winning an essay contest much less the house cup there was still the random empty portrait that hung on the wall it was an anomaly that i had forgotten to get cleared up after my tour with sirius i knew that the portraits in the wizarding world could move and talk and ever run off and disappear to other pictures of themselves so that could be the case with this one but if so then the person in the picture was having a long visit somewhere other then here i had yet to see anyone in it in the week i had been at the school i was in the process of leaning behind sirius to ask severus what the deal with the portrait was when the doors opened and in poured the hogwart students happy to be back for another year of learning i sat up straight and immediately went into my teacher mode no matter how long it had been and with the things surrounding me it had seemed far longer then reality no matter the time it was amazing that the old instincts flared up without hesitation appear strong confident but still friendly and approachable it a hard balance you want the students to like you but you certainly cantlet them walk all over you i didntthink the sweat on my brow was helping the image as i watched them walk in their school uniforms the perfect british school stereotype it reminded me instantly of the pictures i had seen of my own parents when they were children the only difference here were the robes each student wore reminding me that the students walking through the large wooden doors were so different then my parents though perhaps not entirely the only real difference were the subjects being taught but the environment surrounding the teaching was rather similar watching them all pile into the hall i scanned the faces trying to remember faces and associate them with the houses they proudly displayed with their ties it was hard to stare at hogwart students and not expect to see a lightning scar among the bunch of them i couldnt help but wonder as i looked at the youthful faces which of these students was the harry potter of their year the draco or neville hermione or luna none of them of course could have lives with situations even close to their book counterparts but ever year has it troublemakers its bullies its golden child its know it all frankly i was looking forward to teaching these students and coming to conclusions on who fit those roles the sight of sirius and i at the head table caused some students to pause in their progression to the tables no doubt wondering about the identity of the two new teachers from what i had heard they were old hats at getting new defense against the dark arts teachers but getting two new ones was certainly a new experience briefly i wondered if there was someway they could tell just by looking at me that i was a muggle then i remembered that i had made it perfectly clear to everyone that i was never going to wear robes instead opting to wear my normal muggle clothing so in that respect it would be pretty easy to play the game spot the muggle are you excited to see the sorting sirius had leaned in close to me not that he had to go far since he was still being childish his chair still as far from severus as possible sort of though watching an old hat yell out house names isntas much fun as talking to it in your head i shrugged the noise in the hall was rather less then i had expected with so many students in one place and many excited to see each other after a summer away perhaps it had to do with the current that was running under the surface a current of barely concealed fear my history with school had been depression at going back to school wanting to be out in the sun and spending time with friends discussing with people everything you did over the summer these students though were quieter more subdued it was undoubtedly due to the dark mark appearing and the deaths of muggles no matter how the ministry was trying to spin this people were still fearing the worst especially students going to the school voldemort had attacked severus i leaned back to be able to speak to the man around sirius who would be unable to answer my question are there students missing the slytherin head of house leaned back his face impossible to read at my question a small sigh though slipped past his lips and he nodded tightly rather astute yes there are he paused before finishing there are a few students missing some parents like to coddle their children my lips twitched slightly and i sat forward to scan the faces again now that i d identified the problem it was easier to notice the anxiety fear and even a slight amount of excitement on some faces the tables seemed emptier then they should have been even without the first years in the room yet making me realize there were missing students now many people after reading the books might have assumed that the slytherin house table would be the most gutted all the students staying home to join their dark lord the fact though was that no table looked emptier then the last so severus had been correct the parents were likely just protecting their children though my cynic nature understood that any real villains wouldnt have stayed home they would still be here you donthave any feelings at all do you severus sirius gritted out not pleased with the other man comments they re not coddling their children they re protecting them just what i needed on the first day of school the boys to start feuding again protecting them from learning properly i suppose severus voice was calm and cool sirius though was the opposite as he responded you should understand why they re afraid if he comes back then he might target the school but then you would only be afraid of that if you were innocent if you re in league with him though then i suppose there would be no reason to worry well that was a statement that was certainly going to start an argument boys if you cantkeep your arguments to the privacy of your own rooms then please at least make it more entertaining for the students to watch we could try dressing you both up in gaudy uniforms make it like those wrestlers my fingers were tapping on the wood fast showing my annoyance easier then anything else i could say or do not that he would have necessarily understood my comment but severus did look mildly amused by the feeling behind it even if i had basically been making fun of him strangely enough the man had no problems with me mocking him as long as i included sirius in that mockery on the opposite hand though sirius looked annoyed embarrassed and ready to let me have it when he was interrupted with the door opening tonks led the way into the room her hair a bright red dress robes fitted well to her body behind her about 24 young boys and girls followed her dutifully everything was new to them and they looked around in awe at everything amazement at the enchanted ceiling anxiety at the sight of the teachers lined up at the table probably specifically for snape since at that moment he had put on his best glare for them timid smiles for the older students they might have known they were led to the front of the hall right in front of our table i tried to put a calming smile on but apparently a teacher smile wasntreally too calming at all they stood nervously shuffling their feet as tonks moved ahead of them and stood by a stool where the old sorting hat was placed and then i had to stare as what should have been a lifeless hat started to sing sometimes i really wished i carried earplugs with me this year i shall keep this short to keep you on your toes this castle shall become a fort to save you from your foes i was made to sort you to help you make some friends by dividing you into houses with this i hope to mend i have no say over what i do but let me tell you this things are about to happen so unite or you will miss fear returns few remain those that do beware so stay in your old houses but try to think and care or else the stones will fall and make the dark mark call to gryffindor you ll go if bravery is what you do you save all that you see and that the oldest key to ravenclaw you ll fly if smarts is what you try you read and read and read that all you need to feed to hufflepuff you ll strive with hard work and good drive justice is what you know it the knowledge that you stow finally to slytherin you ll achieve if power and ambition is what you believe deception is just a routine but the ends can justify the means dark times lie ahead but all of that aside enjoy the sorting and feast or the teachers will have to chide muggle next to wizard everything will have to change but for now just have some fun and forget the hat that is too strange broken clapping broke out at the end of the hat song though it was certainly a nervous sound my own hands were too numb to do more then a weak touch to each other the song was sung out of key but that didnttake away the general idea of the hat song it was a distinct warning and no one had liked it even snape was scowling at the hat like he had never seen it before mcgonagall was looking shocked though not really surprised and sirius eye was twitching and his hand was curled into a tight fist tonks was laughing at the song trying to make the first years at ease playing the song off as a normal one well now that it done tonks smiled at the students holding a list in her hand we shall start the sorting then i sure everyone else would be happy to start eating now so first off lilac artha a rather pretty indian girl strode up to the chair and sat down rather properly as well her dark brown hair was arranged perfectly and it didntlook she looked too pleased to have the old ratty sorting hat placed on her head but tonks of course gave her no choice and dropped the hat onto her head it was only there for a matter of seconds slytherin the slytherin table erupted into cheers while the other tables just clapped politely miss artha got off the stool a proud smile on her lips proceeding to her table where her newly acquired house mates were sitting and who congratulated her as she sat down severus and i both clapped politely at the sorting of the girl but sirius next to me just grunted at her placing in his least favourite house professor black i leaned in close to him whispering in his ear try not to scowl so hard at the students you might start to look like severus he just huffed softly in response but immediately the scowl faded from his face a smile replacing it his body already relaxing i sat back in my seat once again rather amused at the man sitting next to me he was rather simple to manipulate at times but his uncomplicated nature was one of the reasons i happened to like him i watched avidly as the rest of the sorting took place i clapped as everyone was sorted though i have to say i was a little less avid when hufflepuffs were announced really i have nothing against them they re very loyal and hard working but i just cantsee ever wanting to be in that house i mean a badger the hat usually only took a few seconds to announce which house each of the students was to be sorted into i knew rather well though that it had a tendency to speak to each person when they had it on but with so little time it wasntspeaking to too many people though there were two students who took much longer then the rest a rather pleasant happy looking boy took his place on the stool as tonks had said his name was kerstan faust other then looking good natured he was rather normal looking with black hair and a sprinkling of freckles crossing his nose when he took his place on the stool he looked a little nervous but then almost all the students had looked anxious except those that had then been placed in slytherin it took i d have guessed about 2 minutes for the hat to finally yell out that this student belonged in gryffindor during those couple of minutes though everyone started to look a bit worried the teachers were fidgeting and i was worried that my own experience of not being sorted was going to happen with this poor boy so i was frankly enormously relieved when he was finally sorted sirius next to me was overjoyed though not surprising really considering which house he had been placed in cain montgomery was fair haired and rather the opposite of the pleasant looking boy who had taken so long to be sorted he was looking rather displeased to even be here just like kerstan the hat took a while to reach a decision slytherin the young boy face didntchange at all no nervousness or anxiety on his face he didnteven seem to noticed how long it had taken him versus most of the other students instead he just pushed off the stool and strode over to his table where he ignored the congratulations of his fellow house mates comparisons occurred immediately in my mind two boys had stood out to me in this sorting one from gryffindor and one from slytherin i couldnt help but think about harry and draco for what reason though there was a happy looking dark haired gryffindor boy and a fair haired displeased looking slytherin comparisons were simply physical i dontlike that boy sirius muttered under his breath i had to roll my eyes at that after all he had been thinking that about every student who was placed in slytherin i had to say that i was rather hungry by the time the sorting was finished so i was further disappointed when headmistress mcgonagall stood up to say a few words before we could eat i recalled in the books that dumbledore had done the same thing his words though had always been odd strange and most importantly few somehow i doubted that mcgonagall was going to be similar welcome to all whether this is your first year or your seventh for those returning i shall apologize for repeating what you may have heard before certain things still apply from year to year the forest is completely off limits to all students i realize that in the past it has become fashionable to journey into it as part of a test but it is a dangerous place if you re not killed in the forest your punishment when i find you after will make you wish you had been that made my eyebrows raise and i noticed all the first years seemed suitably frightened by the threat the older students though seemed unconcerned some even rolling their eyes what this little test was intrigued me knowing what i knew about the forest it wasnt called forbidden for no reason any place with abnormally large spiders a giant and aggressive centaurs was certainly not high on my places to visit even on a dare granted a giant and centaurs i felt i could deal with but anything with more then four legs i just felt rather uncomfortable around uncomfortable as in i would be running in the opposite direction from it but children always seem to think they are invincible always testing their boundaries so hearing that some were brave enough to venture into the forest didntsurprise me undoubtedly it was mostly gryffindors and slytherins the former due to their unbearable tendency to dive into anything and the later due to their usual need to prove they were better then the rules i just couldntpicture students of the other two houses to do anything so stupid we also have two new teachers as i sure you ve all noticed by now taking over the now vacated position as teacher of defense against the dark arts will be sirius black at his introduction sirius had stood up and swept a rather elegant looking bow to mcgonagall before taking his seat again his name had caused a certain current of chatter amongst the students it shouldnthave surprised me he had been touted as one of the worst criminals for ages hadnthe not to mention being harry potter godfather and of course the one little fact of his apparent return from the dead as well as professor black we have a new muggle studies teacher miss aine mackinnion now something you should all know is that miss mackinnion is in fact a muggle herself the first muggle teacher we have ever had i stood up at my own introduction smiling brightly at the students in front of me if i had thought they had been surprised to hear sirius name hearing my own introduction had been more surprising being more surprising then a man come back from the dead was slightly flattering there appeared to be some in the great hall who were less then pleased that they would have a muggle teacher on the premises and who were making their displeasure audible many seemed just surprised quiet down the headmistress voice held such absolute authority that immediately the hall quieted down so that no one was speaking anymore whether she is a muggle or not she is a teacher and therefore will get the same treatment as all the other teachers if i hear about any incidents otherwise then i will be very displeased the eyes behind the glasses sparkled dangerously and even i worried about how i treated myself the woman had an iron control over this place as i am sure most of you are aware there have been reports of some unsettling things happening my eye twitched as she started to speak of the events already expecting to hear things i wasntgoing to like while the ministry is adamant that these events hold no threat to the students i am aware that some parents hold different opinions hence our lower numbers this year since we want to make sure you will be as well guarded as is possible the ministry has decided to place an auror on duty at all times apparently he or she was not on duty in the great hall since i didntsee anyone out of place it wouldnthave made much sense if they had been here anyway with all the teachers here there wasnttoo much need for greater protection same as every year there are certain things that are banned from use within the grounds the list for it is on show in mr filch office now i expect everyone to do their best this year as in every year previous quidditch shall begin next week if you re interested in trying part contact your head of house keep in mind though that first years are not allowed to play with very rare exceptions likely that had to do with the more famous rare exception of harry potter must be hard to enforce the rules when everyone knew about someone who had broken them and gotten away with it sighing my fingers started to tap across the wood even as my stomach made quite an audible growl she was now going on about some very boring rule concerning exactly what kind of quills could be used since i was not really a quill user the entire topic was boring me i didnt think that i was the only one feeling that judging by the not so subtle yawns from most of the students and a few teachers minerva you re boring the children i think i might be seeing some wasting away waiting for food my head snapped up and i stared at the once empty portrait on the right far wall where now an old man sat calmly smiling benignly at the headmistress who was rather a deep shade of red next to me sirius looked with strange recognition at the portrait i only discovered who he was when one of the students reacted to his presence dumbledore where have you been young man where a man goes is his own secret but if you must know i have been at a rather delightful party in the portrait of bacchus delight even the monks made an appearance at it a party in a painting called bacchus delight with my limited knowledge on that roman god that must have been one hell of a party especially if it had kept him away from his own portrait for the week that i had been here albus what i say in my speech is not boring mcgonagall said a little displeased with the critique but i suppose i can let everyone eat with that she sat down and still miraculous to me food appeared on the table rather eagerly i tucked in too hungry to care too much that dumbledore had appeared once my stomach was suitably filled i leaned across sirius to get severus attention my curiousity flaring up once again with the disappearance of my hunger why is his portrait in here i nodded in the direction of the old headmaster who was now chatting with one of the ghosts i thought they had place it up in mcgonagall office up with the rest of the former headmasters i should have paid more attention during my own visit to that office i might then have noticed the lack of presence by the most famous headmaster of hogwarts it was his own request severus placed his fork down not that he had been too enthusiastic while eating anyway for once sirius wasnt glaring at severus for even speaking instead he was interested in what he was saying he wanted to be around the students his original request was to somehow be placed at the quidditch pitch but mcgonagall was firmly against that she thought he might be distracting during games or risk his portrait being stolen so he in here now he can irritate us more often i sat back once again finding the answer to be rather in place with my own knowledge of the eccentric headmaster he had gone to great lengths to protect his students including the incident of his own death at the end of the feast the prefects led the first years back to their dormitories leaving the teachers to go back to their own rooms on their own volition i watched as the first years followed out dutifully behind their prefects or at least most of them did the fair haired boy who had taken so long to be sorted hung back a little longer a wrinkle appeared in my brow when i realized that i was getting a lingering stare from the boy that was quite a bit unsettling the hair on the back of my neck raising the feeling broke off though when the gryffindor first years started to exit the hall the boy whose name was cain quickly left to catch up with his own house tomorrow classes start excited sirius had stood up and now stood waiting for me to follow during the unnoticed incident with the student severus had already gotten up and was now making his way out of the hall as if i ever would have expected him to wait for me to finish it will certainly be an experience for the students as well as me i joined sirius standing now and together we headed down from the dais toward the doors i donthave as many classes as you though since first and second years donttake my class saying that i felt a little relieved that i wasntgoing to have to deal with that rather unsettling boy i looking forward to my first year class with gryffindor the students i saw were interesting looking his smile turned to a frown though too bad the class is with the slytherin first years as well sirius try and at least attempt to be fair to them i glared at him as he rolled his eyes you re such a child but you adore me quickly he bent down and gave me a quick peck on the cheek before dancing away from me good night i told you to keep your lips away from me my voice cracked a bit as i yelled that out having to control my own urge to smack the man i said i would try darling with that last statement he strode off leaving me by the stairs to the dungeons as i descended them i couldnthelp my feet from stomping with a rather annoyed reaction to the man as was starting to become a normal habit all i wanted was to go to bed now and get enough sleep to prepare for my first day teaching a n another chapter it seems it really will be about one a week now but they re all nice and long so hopefully no complaints also with students having been introduced there has been some talk about them being like harry and draco other then some purely aesthetic similarities they will be nothing alike i doubt there will be a great feud other then the normal slytherin vs gryffindor one this story can not just be the books with different names sorry if that disappoints anyone oh and please everyone leave me reviews i feel like i begging but really i need more feedback on the story i would love to know what everyone thinks what working or not where it should go or where it shouldn t if you write reviews already believe me i love you now the rest of you think of it as early christmas presents chapter 29 five seconds after entering my room a knock sounded at my door halting my own dreams of a good night sleep now sirius your lips come near me again and i will tear i opened the door expecting to see one sirius black instead a rather too amused draco malfoy stood there my cousin has been rather busy with his lips has he just as severus had done draco just walked into the room not even bothering to wait for permission not that i could have refused either of them entrance draco you know i love spending time with you and your delightful insights but i start teaching tomorrow and would love to slip into my pajamas and just go to sleep aine while most men might enjoy hearing about your sleeping habits it does nothing for me though i would have imagined you as sleeping in your all together if i wanted to imagine he took a seat on a chair by the fireplace making himself comfortable for what i was beginning to worry was the long run despite your obvious love of my company and our week apart your reason to be here is i stayed standing since i wanted to make it at least appear that i was ready for his exit you know about the second attack i couldntstop my foot from starting to tap this subject was quickly becoming taboo for me instantly raising my ire draco if you ve come to tell me another theory on how the muggles killed themselves i might be forced to see if i can actually fit a wand up certain orifices draco smile was rather kinky at that statement and i closed my eyes figuring instantly what i had said was certainly not a threat to the man if anything it was something he might have suggested himself actually harry was rather worried about you it an anomaly undoubtedly but one i was sent to check upon i working on stopping that of course that was utter bull no doubt draco secretly adored harry far gentler nature now i had basically given up on the young man quick departure from my room and resigned myself to a lack of sleep by sitting down on the couch across from draco severus told me that the muggles died in a break in at nyu it connected to me isntit there was a flicker of surprise on the blonde face he shouldnthave told you that and i probably shouldnthave responded by telling him that i raised sirius from the dead and that we re here looking for a missing horcrux now there was definitely a lasting look of surprise on the pale face which quickly dissolved into anger at my choice you oh donttry to get angry with me over something you would have done yourself you dontwant to keep this a secret from everyone that harry choice you know and trust severus and given a choice would have asked his advice and in my own defense as well he had already guessed what was going on it was either tell him or let him continue digging my little mini rant quieted whatever it had been that draco wanted to say just proving that his anger had been pretty much a token response it had been the response that harry would have expected from him had he been there but the reality of it was that draco wasntthat angry at least not in my choice of confidante so professor snape knows now sirius must have been pleased with that i snorted softly in response to that sirius is rather displeased but i explained that i needed severus help to break our connection and that he might be able to help find the horcrux since he can go into the slytherin rooms the professor offering to help is surprising well there was some threats made i left it at that not really wanting it to get around that i had threatened the professor with nudity draco raised an eyebrow at that but i stayed muted on the subject sirius had a visit from the weasels i hear and you arentgoing to get off topic i narrowed my eyes at the blonde pointed face i need to know more about the break in at nyu there was no point in trying to get rid of him fast anymore so i might as well take the opportunity to find something out severus dislike of muggles had made it hard to find anything specific out draco was quiet for a while i dontremember the name of the people who were killed they were killed in the history department though so yes it is possible they were killed in some connection to you the more likely explanation though is that they were just chasing where we had been after all they had certainly known that harry was in contact with you after what happened to cairn the mere mention of the poor man caused a pain to start throbbing behind my left eye and feelings of anger to flare up the ministry and everyone was saying this was all a giant prank they would have changed their minds if they had seen cairn mangled body so there is no reason for you to worry after all what would a wizard want with you i raised my eyebrow at that since after all harry was a wizard who had needed my help they were likely just looking for the clag a bhais skepticism was all that i could manage for that comment it seemed unlikely that they would have broken into nyu for the clag a bhais after all they would have known what it was for and with sirius return from the grave they must have realized that it had been used no worries at all then we should just have a party then sarcasm really does actually suit you draco pushed out of the chair he had been sitting in harry wanted me to check on you so i did i though am curious with the students now having arrived did you notice anything worth note i filled him in on the sorting this evening telling him what i could remember of the hat song also making mention of the two boys of note draco didntseem too concerned with the hat predictions of trouble after all that was a given knowing what he did he did though take special interest in my descriptions of cain and kerstan personally other then the length of their sorting there wasnt much to either boy excepting that one instance of cain unnerving stare but i was a muggle it was entirely possible he had never really been near one before i would ask sirius to keep an eye on those two but i dontthink he would be very objective not when one is in slytherin i will keep an eye on all my students that was the upstanding teacher thing to say well just contact us if you find anything draco had moved to the door but he paused with his hand on the knob i doubt sirius has found anything concerning the horcrux his memory is still coming back to him he thinks it might be better now the students are back i dontknow why harry even bothered sending him here you ll likely have better luck draco rolled his eyes make sure you go visit severus i smiled brightly at draco who just looked at me like i had two heads apparently suggesting to a slytherin that he should go visiting was out of the ordinary images of severus and draco chatting about old times was certainly an odd thought but i thought it was one that should be done the potions master needed to speak to someone who didntthink he was out plotting with voldemort the downfall of the wizarding world good night professor draco slipped out the door and i took a deep breath waiting a few seconds before i got up to go to bed just in case anyone else decided that they wanted to speak to me about muggle deaths horcruxes kisses or my lesson plans when no more knocks came on the door after a few minutes i deemed it safe to move once again with a great amount of pleasure i got up and slipped into my bed quickly falling asleep waking early has never been a thing of mine i would love to sleep until the world ends and beyond if it were possible so my choice to be a teacher was a little surprising since the job dictated that one had to be awake usually around 6 or 7 in the morning though being a college professor i had been lucky to occasionally be able to sleep until 8 or 9 anyone trying to get in contact with me over the weekend would find it nearly impossible since i slept until noon at the earliest the second day of the hogwarts term though saw me awake at 7 o clock and down in the great hall for breakfast at 8 o clock students were already eating breakfast and about half the teachers were already doing the same on the wall though dumbledore still slumbered quietly soft snores coming from him and the occasional mumbled names of candies apparently being a portrait meant you didnthave to keep the same hours you would have when you were alive the man or portrait man must have been a heavy sleeper though since the hall wasntexactly quiet really though did portraits have to sleep i guess it was to recreate the person as close as possible i wondered what had happened to draco after our little chat last night wondering if he had spent the night here somewhere or if he had quickly made it off the school grounds to apparate back to where harry was since i didntsee him at breakfast i assumed he found it hard to be away from his little love bunny for too long heh love bunny i laughed quietly at that thought getting me some very odd looks from the students around me i shrugged the looks off though and sat down on severus right he grunted and i took that to be a greeting likely the closest i would get to one anyway i should ask him if draco had actually done what i suggested but the appearance of a plate of eggs and toast in front of me distracted my attention that of my stomach at least severus did you have a nice little visit with draco last night i smiled at the sour looking potions master after i had finished my breakfast perhaps i wasntthe only one who wasnta morning person but teasing always seems to make me rather chipper in the morning at my question i got a rather annoyed look rather similar to all the looks i tended to get from the man if memory serves me right sirius had come up to the dais in time to hear me ask my question draco was here last night was harry with him he took the seat on my right and with no ceremony started to stuff his face full with the food in front of us ah manners no harry wasn t draco was just visiting i shrugged not really wanting to get into specifics if i told sirius that i knew about nyu being broken into that would cause him to worry i had a general feeling that he would hover if he was worried a hovering worrier was not something i needed or wanted right severus narrowed black eyes met my own brown ones professor snape stood up and walked down from the dais without answering the question he really was moody in the morning and strangely that was taking into account his regular moody nature having finished i got up to go as well wishing sirius as much luck as possible with his first classes no doubt he was certainly going to need all the help he could get as much luck as the students were going to need in his class i quickly caught up with severus ignoring the odd looks i was getting from the students as i practically sprinted out of the great hall so early in the morning wearing my normal muggle clothes rather an odd sight i suppose during breakfast severus i grabbed hold of the sleeve of his robe to stop him perhaps not a good idea judging from the scowl i was receiving i get that you dontlike having people interfere in your business but i was just concerned is all having a talk with draco might have been helpful for you after all you re not exactly surrounded by people fighting to get your attention you seem to be more then eager to crowd me severus snapped black eyes glittering dangerously normal people might have taken a step back at this point i was normal but i was never smart i only eager since i like you my smile and comment must have thrown him off since he actually took the step back really his voice was dry and calm no evidence at all of any discomfort despite the step he had just taken really sevvie i grinned impishly and went on tiptoe giving him a quick kiss on the lips teasing people is something i have always taken quite an amount of joy in this amusement has certainly landed me into quite a lot of hot water over the years there was the time that i had pretended to be dead resulting in my mother nearly having a heart attack and my father grounding me for life the sentence had later been commuted to a month no allowance and all the chores teasing boys had always been fun as well though this only happened with ones i was friends with never would i have teased matt it would have just given him ideas of course kissing someone will certainly give them ideas but judging by the storm that was appearing in severus eyes the ideas he was getting didntinvolve anything nice and fluffy unless by fluffy you meant a certain three headed dog with large sharp teeth and particularly nasty breath my attention though was diverted from the fuming potions professor when my eye caught a flash of fabric from the side i turned and saw a student watching us from the side on his way to having breakfast he had certainly had an interesting morning show i recognized the boy as the cheerful looking boy from the sorting who had been the cause of my momentary worry his name had been kerstan faust an interesting enough name that i was unlikely to forget it he smiled sheepishly at us looking rather embarrassed to be finding his teachers kissing in the hallway at least to his eyes that had probably been what it had looked like a quick peck on the lips was certainly not a kiss in my eyes kerstan saying the boy name brought severus attention away from me to the small boy the full on affect of severus doom and gloom attitude was apparent immediately since the young gryffindor looked mildly frightened without even thinking about who i was doing it to i punched severus arm professor snape needs some lightening up sometimes as you can see so nothing that happened here needs to be told to anyone he understood immediately and nodded retreating to the great hall as quickly as possible not surprising with severus still glaring at the spot he had occupied you hit me now his full attention was back on me and while the doom and gloom had retreated a bit it was still rather an unnerving look oh i sorry about that but you were frightening the poor boy i turned back to him a rather worried smile on my face i was in no way afraid of severus nor did i think he was going to hurt me but he was still rather an imposing figure and someone i really shouldntbe crossing it was just my bad luck that he was also so much fun to tease it was actually rather addicting in a way you kissed me the statement was simple no real emotion in his voice he could have been talking about linoleum and it would have sounded the same it really made a girl feel special i wouldntreally call that a kiss i shrugged if you want i could show you a real one i fluttered my eyelashes once again reverting to my horrible habit of teasing him like the one black gave you severus was still fuming though now i suspected it was in a different direction i was rather surprised he had known about that it wasntlike i had run down the halls shouting that i had been rather surprisingly kissed maybe severus possessed great powers like telepathy so he knew what i was thinking at all times i am not a psychic aha he rolled his eyes at me a rather normal gesture for him i heard your discussion with him at dinner last night it not hard to figure it out when you warn him to keep his lips off you well there went the far more interesting theory of telepathy though that idea was far more frightening in other ways someone deepest and darkest thoughts should never be open for people to read not even just thoughts but fantasies if he could read my mind then he could then find out about that interesting little fantasy of mine including him some leather and some fur lined handcuffs good thing for me he wasnt telepa damn he had been lying there was a small smirk on his lips though that looked a bit forced judging by slight blush crossing his cheeks the man was a master of that magic that could see a person memories whatever it was called my memory wasntgood enough to remember all the odd words in those books i quickly repeated my earlier movement this time putting far more effort and passion behind the punch i gave the man arm read my thoughts again and i be using those handcuffs in an entirely different way that you will not enjoy i hoped at that moment he was getting my emotions and memories because my mind was being rather vivid about what i would do to him if he tried it again i turned and stalked off heading up to my classroom to prepare for my first class ever at hogwarts and thinking of as many possible ways to kill a wizard my first class was a combined class of third year students muggle studies wasntthe hottest class in the school so i only had one class per year meaning that i only had five classes all of which had combined numbers from the four houses as i looked at the students sitting there patiently waiting for me to begin though i realized that there were absolutely no slytherin students i shouldnthave expected differently welcome to muggle studies i stood in front of my desk leaning back on it you re all actually the luckiest of my classes you re all coming in fresh with no experience in this class therefore my changes wontcome as much of a shock to you my teaching style will be practical you will certainly learn some theories but more importantly you will be learning how to use things not just why any questions third year students are not as confident as the sixth and seventh years nor though are they still complacent and cautious like the younger students so i shouldnthave been surprised that the first question i got had nothing to do with muggles in general or how i was going to teach the class instead it was directed at me personally why is a muggle teaching here the question everyone was asking i was almost hoping that someone would ask me about raising sirius from the dead at least that would have been interesting no this question had been one i had been expecting from the start at least it hadntbeen framed insultingly that i too had been expecting a muggle is teaching here and by the way my name is professor mackinnion because this is a muggles studies class a wizard teaching this class is along the same lines as me teaching you all transfiguration someone who cannot do something should not be teaching others that which they can not do for themselves rather simple not simple enough since the questions didntstop there a bright looking asian girl from ravenclaw raised her hand instantly confidence in the gesture in this class at least this undoubtedly was going to be the know it all but arentmuggles not supposed to know our world exists how do you know normally when a muggle finds out too much their memory is charmed a wizard has already put a charm on my memory preventing me from discussing what i know that didntstop the girl questions from coming since the second my mouth closed her hand was in the air once more what is your name by the way michi tsuroda why would you want to work here anyway isntteaching us about your own people a little boring i stood up straight pushing away from the desk not in the slightest it always interesting to view another perspective and the only teacher lesson plans were diverting now issues about me aside does anyone have any question about how the class will be taught i could see that miss tsuroda wanted to ask another question but it wasntabout the class so she kept her hand down though i could see her warring with the urge to raise it and keep asking questions no one else raised their hand though so i concluded the q a segment of the class right what i am going to teach you is knowledge that will help you if you need to ever pass as a muggle i heard a few snorts in the back of the class likely from students who deemed the likelihood of what i had said as zero to none since i am not a witch you re all going to be helping me out in this class i went behind my desk and took a seat now how do wizards contact each other no one ever wants to answer questions on the first day of class so it wasntsurprising that not many raised their hands it was also not surprising that miss tsuroda had been the first one to do so i pointed at one of the other students though a nervous looking hufflepuff one who hadntraised his hand your name and the answer please michael dillon and we normally use the owl post right you write letters and then send them to the person using an owl i nodded at the answer understanding it well enough though personally it had always sounded a little backward now muggles we actually do things rather similarly we write letters and send them to people but we dontuse owls instead there are muggles whose job it is to carry letters to people this seemed rather simple and straightforward to me but to people who had never seen a postman it was rather odd and i had to field quite a few questions that if i had asked to my teachers would have gained me a session with the guidance counselor why would someone want to carry letters around doesnt that one person get tired having to deliver everyone letters arent you worried that the person will read the letters how does the person carrying the letters cross over to other countries and my favourite how had they failed in life to end up with such a crappy job i dutifully answered all those questions and the many more that sprang from the answers to them it ended up with my first class being devoted almost solely to the discussion of postmen and their possible displeasure with their jobs it wasntsurprising anymore that wizards never knew anything about muggles if it took one class to teach them such a simple thing then i wasntgoing to impart too much knowledge on them i dismissed my first class with the assignment of writing exactly what each of them thought about the idea of people carrying the mail with specific guidelines against just saying owls were better the rest of my first day of classes was pretty much empty with only five classes i only had one a day it left me plenty of time to go to the library and study or perhaps even try and find the horcrux on my own they were rather practical ways to spend my time ways that i should be spending my time but after the break i found myself entering sirius classroom right before the start of his class i bored i whigned out dropping into a seat at the front of his class you look a little stressed how was your first class in fact he looked more then a little stressed his face was rather pale and he was taking a sip from a glass i rather doubted that the liquid in it was of the h20 variety his grey eyes narrowed on me at my rather obvious amused question children at evil demons if voldemort wants to win easier all he has to do is enlist the help of those creatures and he d find himself king of england in no time at all sirius dear you know they re not all that bad who did you have first off anyway to frighten you this badly i am not frightened his voice growled as he slammed the glass back on the table they re just not trained properly my eyebrow raised at that the canine apparently thought that children should be trained i had fourth year slytherins and ravenclaws i dontthink i did any actual teaching they spent the entire class grilling me about my past i stretched my body forward over the desk in front of me draping my arms over the front an amused expression on my face it made my not so productive first class seem like the greatest one ever sirius was not a teacher given a chance to guess his future career this had the likelihood of being my last choice instead i would go with something like police officer rock singer or sexy stripper so maybe he could be a sexy teacher stripper were the girls giving you moon eyes the entire time i attempted to make my voice as neutral as possible completely and totally uncaring really i was rather yes sirius muttered that wasntthe problem though it was all the question about how i had been dead when i had been a criminal how i had gotten out of azkaban plenty of questions about harry as well a smile slid on this face a few of the boys asked me about you as well i snorted at that school boy crushes were the last things i needed right now i had enough crushes of my own to keep me occupied you need to take command of your class sirius i ll stay and watch your next one and jump in if you need help i sat up and stretched what else am i going to do i have too much free time with only five classes if you could do magic i d let you take most of my classes he leaned back in his chair and propped his feet up on his desk i ignored the voice of my mother telling him that it was bad manners to do that what was your class like then well it was my easy class the third years who have never had muggle studies before though i spent the entire class explaining what a postman does what a postman i stared blankly at sirius before dropping my head onto the desk muttering about the incompetency of past teachers at this school when he continued to prod me about what a postman was i just answered in a rather nonverbal way you know i have absolutely no idea the significance behind stick up one of your fingers but i dontthink it meant to be too kind narrowed eyes met his grey ones judging whether he was kidding or if he really didntknow i decided it was likely not worth my time to even figure it out the doors opened in the back of the class and students started to enter the classroom judging by their ages they were first years and their ties named them gryffindor and slytherin well this was certainly going to be an interesting class to sit in on i stood up and smiled at the students as they entered though noticeably only the gryffindors returned the smile grabbing a chair i dragged it over to the wall to stay out of the way of the students my presence was generally accepted by the gryffindors though little kerstan faust looked a little embarrassed around me due to his witnessing that little impromptu kiss with severus in the hall slytherin on the other hand wasntso accepting being only first years though they werentvocal about the thoughts on the muggle teacher but the glares and stares i was getting said enough that boy cain was still as quiet as he had been before i dontthink i had seen him speaking to anyone in his house i found myself watching him rather carefully draco had asked me to keep an eye on the two boys who had stood out at the sorting and they were both in this class of sirius s kerstan was generic it rather a rude thing to think but it was true he was chatting with some of his house mates laughing over something there was no presence around him nothing to suggest any spectacular destiny at all or anything strange going on the length of his sorting was probably the same as my own experience he had probably chatted with the hat ever since i had seen him get sorted into his house i had seen him talking to everyone around him that hat probably hadntbeen different the other boy though it was odd to see such complete opposites out of the two boys this was the one i needed to keep an eye on now i had sort of adopted slytherin as my own house so i wasntgoing to suggest that just because this fair haired boy was in that house that there might be something sinister going on but honestly the track record of my favourite snake bearing house was a little grim the main thing though was how long his sorting had taken while with kerstan i could believe he had spoken to the hat i doubted that this one would have said a single word to the old thing sit down sirius voice held a rather strong amount of authority perhaps older students would have noticed how uncertain he appeared and would have jumped on that but these youngsters dutifully closed their mouths even if the slytherin students expressions were anything but dutiful welcome to defense against the dark arts i am professor black in this class you will learn how to defend yourself against the dark arts sirius frowned slightly as the name of the class would suggest this little slip caused the students to laugh softly and me to roll my eyes slightly he was already losing his grip on the class during this first year we shall go over some of the less dangerous dangers including cornish pixies kneazels and doxies a first year slytherin boy in the back of the class raised his hand and immediately i winced knowing what was coming it wasntthat hard to guess not with the boys sitting on either side of him covering their mouths to stop their laughter yes how exactly did you kill thirteen people slytherins certainly didntpussy foot around sirius didntlook too surprised at the question he had likely had a similar one in his first class i didntactually kill any of them i was cleared of that so i cant actually answer that question i resisted the temptation to just bury my face in my hands that was a question that didntneed to be answered actually it shouldnt have been answered at all i really wish that had been the worst it was going to get but sirius didntunderstand that he needed to understand the question period needed to end immediately another hand raised though this time it was at least a gryffindor which meant sirius was a bit more open and friendly i thought you were dead of all the questions that was certainly one that didntneed to be answered his teaching of the class basically made it a duh question yes well the rumours of my death were greatly exagerrated sirius smiled trying to play off the answer as a joke no you did die it even said it in that book you fell through the veil and died there were no rumours that were exagerrated the girl asking the question wasnttrying to be rude or anything her face was straightlaced and deadly serious as she spoke she just didnt understand the joke he had been making wanting a straightforward answer yes i know a frown appeared on his face of course i know that i died and somehow i am alive again what you dontknow how you re alive again a rather smug slytherin at the back of the class asked that question a smirk on his face it was rather similar to the smirks of draco and severus making me wonder if that was the first thing all slytherin students were taught their first night welcome to slytherin now everyone imagine you just saw your cook drop food on the floor now imagine your worst enemy eating that food without any knowledge of where it has been what expression would you have yes that it there the slytherin smirk of course i know how i alive sirius was rising to their baiting professor black is well aware of how he is alive but it far too sordid to tell first years the students stared at me as i spoke the slytherin boy who had asked the question was glaring at me for stopping sirius from answering i really should talk to severus about teaching his house some better manners professor being the ignorant muggle in the room what exactly is a kneazle i innocently asked the question i didntknow what a kneazle was but the real reason to ask was to get sirius back on track he needed to concentrate on actually teaching instead of letting his personal life get hijacked by the students actually professor i was wondering how dangerous kneazles are myself i have a friend who has one as a pet this question was made by kerstan helping me get the class back on track this rather thoughtful gesture earned him a smile from me and sirius eternal love and gratitude that boy was never going to have problems in this class sirius radiated a grateful aura thrilled to have the attention off his past thrilled as well to not have to try and dodge the questions anymore i noticed that any time sirius started to flounder kerstan would ask a question that would jumpstart him i sat back and listened attentively as he went into great detail over what kneazles were now all sirius had to learn was how to do this without me jumping in to save his ass when the class finished it was with a greater knowledge of strange cat like creatures called kneazles not to mention the rather qualified answer to the question of whether sirius could teach a class so i failed the test didnti the two of us were walking down to the great hall for lunch after sirius rather abysmal second period class granted it wasnt all that bad i could think of plenty of other things that could have gone wrong he could have killed a student not to mention even if the students hadntlearned anything i know knew more then i ever wanted about the kneazel mating habits you have a strong personality sirius the problem is that you also have a strong temper you flare up too easily they re just kids but you let them get to you in the same way that you would let your enemies it just that you need to keep control of the class dontlet them change the direction sirius was shuffling his feet down the hall not overly pleased that he hadntdone a great job he had expected to be great at this from the start because after all he was sirius black the amazing black certainly isntafraid of a bunch of children the stupendous sirius would be able to do this with both hands tied behind his back a blindfold on and a enraged giant beating his head but almost no one does this well from the start the first time i taught any class well it was when i was still in college i was doing a stint as a student teacher in a high school it went far worse then yours i ended up spending my entire first class period talking about my failed relationships since i wanted the students to like me i let them walk all over me turns out a parent found out that i had been telling her kid about my romantic entanglements i didntgo back to that school to teach again in hindsight that entire incident had been rather amusing having an irate mother come to school to discuss with you and the principal her displeasure that her young daughter now knows too much about the best ways to break up with a guy who just isntgood enough in the sack it really was a good thing that i was a student teacher since if i would have been fired from teaching permanently good learning experience though guess i cantdiscuss me relationship with you then with my class sirius mused thoughtfully was hoping to get advice from the students there is no relationship i muttered immediately blocking out the memory of that one kiss i quickly found myself up against the wall eyes wide staring up into sirius grey eyes in shock he had moved too fast for me to keep up with and now i couldntmove not with the hard stone against my back or with the equally hard arms on either side of me it not that i haventbeen trying really up this close his eyes were like liquid silver i couldnthelp but feel they were flowing all over me concentrating on those eyes i missed the fact that he had moved in closer to me only when his lips touched mine did my brain smack me back into consciousness i jerked back hard which unluckily for me brought the back of my head in to contact with the very hard stone walls of the school damn sirius moved back and i didntmiss the amusement etched on his face at my predicament did you see stars when i kissed you you are such a i cut myself off though when i realized we were being watched looking to the right i saw poor young kerstan standing dumb struck in the hallway his face was a bright red and his mouth worked soundlessly trying to apologize when he saw me i sorry i keep seeing you in these situations i really wonttell anyone about this or the other time really he backed away slowly before turning and running down the hall out of my sight all this before i could even say anything at all that boy is going to start thinking i a tramp i mused softly sighing about my destroyed reputation as a teacher luckily i didnt have him in any of my classes but if he did ever tell anyone then everyone in the school would know though i didntthink he was the kind to gossip too much at least i hoped not what other time well today was just going from bad to worse and it wasnteven half over yet a n another chapter and i sorry if this one is also a bit too long but i just couldntfind a suitable break point in it but it an important chapter since it gives the reasons for it all thank you to linac428 and queen of the fairys for their positive reviews i glad you both like the story now i do have a question for everyone it not terribly important to my story but i was wondering who people would want to see harry with i ve thought about leaving him alone but with later chapters that a depressing idea then i considered hermione ginny even draco well i do like some slash i thought i would ask everyone their opinion so e mail me if you want or write a review and mention which you d prefer as always though if you like this please review chapter 3 if the books had been even slightly correct then i knew who sirius black was he was harry godfather had gone to azkaban for a long time escaped and then been killed in a battle with some death eaters i didntknow if the book had shown the correct feelings that harry had for his godfather but if it did then it was beyond my comprehension why harry would choose him to bring back to life sure he had care about his godfather but to choose him over your parents with a once in a lifetime chance to bring a loved one back to life my confusion must have shown on my face most people would choose to bring back their parents harry said quietly a certain depressed edge to his voice i loved a lot of people who died that why this decision isntbased on that it based on a different need i found my hands reaching toward the clag a bh is on the table and it was in my hands smoothing over the wooden surface i blinked at harry and looked up at him strangely curiousity shone in my eyes a different need then you dontwant to bring some one back from the dead for yourself this made me feel a little better at what i might have to do i not behind the idea of bringing a loved one back from the dead it can harm the person who asked more then letting the person stay dead people need to let go i had been quite worried that harry was just emotional after the events i had read about in the book and now was trying to find away to bring his friends back to life no though i d lie if i said i wouldntbe happy to see sirius back to life at that point harry glanced over at cairn who was shuffling nervously at the topic of conversation cairn why dont you go deal with that issue we were talking about before he suggested gently and the older man immediately looked relieved it was nice meeting you miss mackinnion he took my hand and enthusiastically shook it in both of his please aine hearing that makes me think i still in class i placed my hand over cairn s and he flushed slightly before backing away he nodded at harry and quickly left the pub heading out the back does the righteous harry potter have a servant i asked still looking after where cairn had left i brought my eyes back to the black haired man an eyebrow raised at him in slight mocking he smirked slightly at that question righteous he shook his head cairn is a friend of mine he just a bit enthusiastic when it comes to me at my amused look he shrugged slightly i saved his life at one point so he helps me out and at the moment i need someone as loyal as him he glanced at the door cairn had gone through i asked him to leave to save him some discomfort he gets nervous when i talk about bringing sirius back to life he doesntlike the idea of me treading where voldemort would have gone my hand was without me even knowing it twirling the clag a bh is between my fingers even as i listened to harry the smooth wood slid over and under my fingers i realized what i was doing though and placed the object i knew i shouldntbe touching back on the table and gave my full attention to harry who was looking rather amused at what i had been doing you were scared of that object when i first brought it out he stated matter of factly i shook my head not exactly sure myself what i was doing apparently my fingers dontknow that i looked at the slender cylinder on the table confusion over my face i know exactly what it is but i have to admit there a part of me that thrilled to see this after all i am a scholar but really it dangerous even as i said this my fingers started to twitch of course that understandable harry was eyeing the clag a bh is with a strange look as well things are dangerous because they draw you in hmm i tapped my fingers on the table a habit i was finding myself doing more and more only when i was nervous it was quite telling to my mood that my fingers had hardly been still since i had gotten to my office today so mr potter what is this need that requires sirius black alive i also assume it the reason you were against asking a muggle for help if i can call you aine then you certainly can call me harry harry smile was friendly but he then got serious and the smile slipped off his face since you ve read the books i dontneed to go into much depth about lord voldemort you know who he basically was all about the horcruxes and then my defeating him my final year at hogwarts he left it to me to fill him in on what i knew or remembered not surprising since i wouldntwant to spend time telling my life story to someone yeah there were seven horcruxes you found them all destroyed them and therefore defeated voldemort simple as that i shrugged not really sure where any of this was going why exactly was it important for me to remember what happened in the books something that for this harry would have been about ten years ago it was a good read but then again it had been real my fingers started tracing imaginary circles in the wood of the table even as my brain dealt with that latest revelation all those fantastical entertaining things i had read had happened to the man sitting across from me watching me calmly his life had been in danger so many times and i had found it all great summer reading simple as that eh the smile on his face was slightly bitter and i winced at it as far as a book it had been simple but i guess the actual events wouldnthave been simple enough for me to read about a boy locating a number of objects and then facing down his arch nemesis but i suppose in real life it would be a bit more difficult sorry it just still a little hard for me to fully grasp that all the things i read happened to you he just waved me off and i continued on but i do remember the books well enough so what does that have to do with my resurrecting mr black at this harry started to snicker softly i think he d be rather put out if a beautiful woman called him mr black makes him sound like an older teacher or something nothing wrong with being a teacher i crossed my arms over my chest and eyed harry with a mixture of annoyance and anticipation are you going to tell me the rest of the story or not right sorry he grinned sheepishly well that was the end for the books rowling might have written an eighth one though if she knew what i do now he frowned his dark brows knit together there was one more horcrux we didntknow about when i defeated voldemort all i did was return him to a state similar to what he had been in after he killed my parents he been regaining power over the last ten years and you think sirius black is that important to a new fight i asked incredulous i really didntknow if the books were correct in this aspect but while sirius had been a good wizard if i needed to bring someone back to help fight voldemort it definitely would have been dumbledore that man could probably single handedly defeat the dark lord i know i would have chosen him first for my dodgeball team my incredulous question caused harry face to relax a bit and his lips twitched slightly he likely had understood my meaning and was no doubt thinking that sirius black would have been a bit put out at my doubting his ability to help out if i could go from what i had read then he really was an egotistical bastard in a good way of course it has nothing to do with the ability to fight the black haired man sitting across from me continued to explain on after my question it has to do with the location of the last horcrux sirius is the only one who knows where it is the only person who knew where it was okay well that was a good reason to resurrect someone from the dead i suppose it would certainly make it easier to defeat the dark lord and even if i wasnta witch i knew i didntwant that man around and gaining power he didnt seem to like muggles too much but there was something that didnt fit wait a second he the only one that knows but if he had known he would have told you before he died and if he didntthen how did you even find out about a last horcrux it didntseem to fit what i knew about this story there was no reason for sirius black to hold something this important from his godson and there was no other way to explain how harry now knew about this so long after his death i dontthink he knows what it is harry even sounded confused at this point i have to say hearing the hero of the story sound so uncertain isnta great confidence booster but he knows where it is we just need to ask him get him to remember something about it i was once again twirling the clag a bh is in between my fingers as my brain was working this all out feeling the shiny wood over my skin was actually helping me think better how did you find out that he would know voldemort obviously wasntthat forth coming draco found out for me well that wasntsurprising at least the idea that he found out from draco wasn t in the last book the two had come to terms with each other i suppose you could say it had turned out that the slytherin boy hadntbeen that bad just trying to live up to his family it was a story similar to sirius black s not surprising they were related he found out from his father harry was continuing on with his explanation which was good since i was about to ask how the basically good draco had found out this juicy bit of information his father was far more likely to know after all the elder malfoy had been a death eater one of voldemort higher ranked ones i suppose you could say if anyone was going to know he would have but unlike his son i hadntgotten any inkling of a good side to this malfoy from the books but i suppose as harry had said some things were different from what had actually happened was lucius malfoy good then i blinked finding that a little hard to believe no shaking his head it was obvious that there was no room for doubt about the side lucius malfoy had been on he was a slimy bastard but i think perhaps in the end he might have tried to redeem himself slightly it couldntmake up for all the horrible things he had done but it was an effort for his son i think at least i hope so for draco sake if nothing else as harry said this his emerald eyes turned a little sad it was hard for me with no parents but at least they loved me and stood for things that i did for draco it was hard to be so different morally and to have your parents disgusted with you because of that i sure they loved him in their own way i smiled and reached my hand out to pat harry s i found myself comforting someone i had only known for about an hour but the look in his eyes was so depressing that i couldnthelp myself maybe it that maternal instinct all us women are supposed to have the boy in front of me smiled warmly at my try to cheer him up boy he was at most about two years younger then me but it hard to look at an older harry potter and not see the boy i had read about so many times even if that one wasntthe real harry potter but a writer fantasy i pulled my hand back and looked away from those warm green eyes lucius malfoy i sure loves his son he just also happens to be an evil git my lips twitched slightly but didntthink it appropriate to smile then if lucius malfoy knows about the last horcrux why dontyou ask him where it is there would be no need to throw your soul to the devil and resurrect mr black i wasntmistaken that the smile on harry face was hiding an urge to cry his eyes were bright with what i assumed were unshed tears my maternal instinct must have snapped to the front again because i found myself standing immediately to walk to the other side of the table but when i stood up harry just shook his head and gestured for me to sit down again i dontthink lucius would have known exactly where horcrux is as it stood he told draco about the existence of a last one and that he had heard voldemort say it had been stolen what by sirius i was getting confused again since this still didnt explain why sirius wouldnthave told harry that he had stolen something from voldemort no harry shook his head lucius mentioned it had been another death eater someone who had tried to leave and who was killed by their master harry fingers were now tapping on the wood of the table and i had to wonder if i had infected him with my nervous habit the only one i know who matches that description is regulus black sirius is the only black family member i could ask about it so that is why i need to bring him back from the dead my eyes had now narrowed on harry i hated being the one to bring up small problems with his idea since this was something important to him hell it was something important to everyone but there were glaring mistakes that i couldntjust ignore i was a scholar a researcher i couldntignore facts you donteven know if regulus would have told his brother anything from what i had read in the book they didnthave a good relationship they hated each other so i dontthink it likely that sirius black would have known anything about the last horcrux it would be a better bet to bring regulus back from the dead and ask him there was steel in harry eyes as i said this obviously it wasnta popular suggestion regulus was a death eater i will not bring one of them back to life there would be no guarantee that he wouldntgo back to voldemort or tell me the truth his hand on the table had clenched into a fist it sirius or no one he my best chance to find out the books didntget this right sirius and his brother didntget along but sirius still cared about his brother he kept an eye on him at hogwarts i think he might know where regulus might have hidden something the clag a bh is was flying swiftly between my fingers as my brain dealt with the unhappy idea that the future of the wizarding world my world as well was resting on the idea that a man might possibly know where something is might know where his brother who hated him might have hidden something it was incredibly frustrating but there was nothing i could say in the matter this was harry fight not mine i was just here to give some advice on a relic and perform a ritual if i chose to i could say no i suppose refuse to bring sirius black back to life after all i wasntsure if it would really do as much good as harry potter wanted it to the young raven haired man seemed to be grasping at straws in my opinion he would be better off bringing dumbledore back and then the old man could help find the horcrux it the best chance i have to find it aine i have no idea where regulus black would have hidden anything bring dumbledore back i said finally airing my own thoughts the main was the greatest wizard wasnthe even if he doesntknow where the horcrux is he d be the best help in finding it not to mention in fighting voldemort this caused harry to go quiet it seemed he had thought of this as well his brows furrowed deep his eyes dark green now i had thought of it you re right but i need the person who has the best chance of finding the horcrux battling voldemort isntgoing to work not as long as that horcrux exists sirius is the only one who has any hope of knowing and i might get lucky he might even have seen it i snorted at this thinking that luck wasntsomething any one should be relying on in a situation like this but i didntsay anything else after all harry potter was the hero of this story even if this wasnta story any more this was tried and true real life and i was now involved i knew why he didntwant a muggle helping on this it was extremely dangerous the ritual and it dangers aside when voldemort found out about this i couldntcontrol this involuntary shudders that went down my back just what i needed the dark lord after me i almost wished i had taken mat up on his offer of a date almost you re sure there isntanything else you can find out from lucius malfoy i propped my head up on my hand resting on the table what the horcrux is or anything i dontwant to raise someone from the dead unless i am sure it is the only way the sadness crept into harry eyes again and he shook his head there is nothing we can ask lucius malfoy he dead i didntsee why this would cause harry any distress but he continued on he was heading to a trial for his continued involvement with lord voldemort even while in azkaban on the way he met with well a group of overly enthusiastic haters of voldemort i didntlike the man but he was still draco father and i dontthink anyone deserves what he got he was actually torn apart harry shuddered and my eyes widened they were all wizards and witches but none of them even bothered with wands i sometimes close my eyes and see it happen again poor draco he trailed off his eyes falling down to stare at the table i had a suspicious feeling that they were bright again with unshed tears i found myself holding my hand over his again squeezing it gently people get scared and do horrible things i think you re not the only one who sees that when they close their eyes muggles it appeared werentthe only ones who did stupid things in mob settings nothing is worse then a crowd of people you lose all your intelligence your will to speak for yourself you just go with the flow and in situations like that well the flow isntsomewhere you normally would go still the idea of ripping a man apart even one who had done plenty of horrible things was leaving a horrible taste in my mouth i think i need something to drink i said a distasteful look on my face harry looked up at that and there was nothing in his eyes anymore except surprise at my voice i had the impression that he was just in his own little world i ll go get us both something a story like that left a bad taste in my mouth he nodded and slipped a few coins to me across the table he didntsay anything and i bit my lip at the blank expression i had to control my urge to just give him a hug instead i stood up and walked to the bar behind it stood a bald man stooped whether from age or a hump on his back i wasntsure and what does the pretty muggle want he asked amusement just dripping from his words i narrowed my eyes at him and decided that i wasntoverly fond of the barkeep i wasntsure why harry was discussing such important and secret things with me when this man was in the room and could over hear it all but what did i really know about any of this or them two firewhiskeys i said handing over the few galleons i decided harry and i could use a stronger drink and this was the only one i could remember from the books the amused expression grew bigger on the old man face as i made my choice he shook his head and retrieved a bottle of firewhiskey quickly pouring two glasses for me i restrained the urge to tell the man that his glasses could use a good cleaning it was probably not the best way to deal with a wizard he handed me back a fistful of strange coins some silver and bronze i had never seen their like but i took them and thanked him if perhaps a little ingenuous i deposited the glass of firewhiskey in front of harry as well as the coins before taking my old seat across from him he looked amused once again no doubt about my choice of drink we both looked like we could use a drink and in this kind of pub i was quite sure i couldntjust order a shot of vodka i took my glass and sipped it very carefully and quickly put it down as my mouth started to burn i coughed and didntlook up since i was sure i could hear laughter coming from the old barkeep and probably from harry as well it strong stuff this i looked up and saw him drinking it normally at my look he just shrugged i ve had it many times it your first time dontworry about it i sure even old tom over there would have coughed up a storm his first time he jerked his thumb in the old man direction i decided it was probably best to get back on track with the entire purpose of my sudden trip to england though best to also stay away from anymore talk about a torn apart lucius malfoy at that thought i grabbed my glass and downed half of it to harry surprise and to my own i didntcough at all all right then you want sirius black brought back to life you ve given good enough reasons i suppose and you re paying for it so i ll do it i downed the other half of my firewhiskey after saying that i knew i was agreeing against all the sane bones in my body i knew that this ritual entailed blood and as such was going in a direction that i didntreally want to go i knew that i was going to go against any laws our world had spiritual or not bringing a dead person back to life but i need to warn you about something harry had looked overjoyed at my acceptance but now a wary look appeared in his eyes this sirius black of yours he fell through a gateway a veil correct i was verifying what i remembered of that fifth book at his nod i continued i dontknow how that will interact with this ritual i dontthink the creators of this relic or the ritual itself took a magic veil into account so i cantguarantee success because of that on top of that you need to be prepared i took a deep breath before what i was about to say i always prepared a small smile tugged at harry lips and i couldnthelp but think of him as a old eagle scout not for this you re not you need to be prepared to kill sirius black if what comes out well if what comes out isntright apparently he wasntprepared for this hadnteven taken this into account not that this surprised me most people thought of the perfect idea of raising someone from the dead perfect body perfect mind all their memories intact they never wanted to think of something going wrong they certainly didntwant to think of a writhing mass of flesh twitching as it tried to live even knowing it shouldnt have i blanched at my memories of what i had seen around the world certain tribes had tried resurrections but almost always the result was something that no one in their right mind could call human anymore sometimes it was almost like a zombie movie but usually it was just a twitch a guttural moan and then stillness it was always the worst when they made sounds if your godfather comes back to life and his body isntright i refrained from explaining in detail what that could mean from the look on harry face he was doing a good job thinking up his own ideas if it not right he ll be in more pain you ll have to end it for him it wontbe killing him really just sending him back where he was can you promise me you ll do that i wontdo the ritual unless i know that is taken care of i felt bad at the horrified look in harry eyes but i stood firm on this if i didntit would just hurt harry more in the long run seeing how unmoveable i was in this harry nodded dumbly unsure of himself to speak fine then i smiled slightly trying to encourage harry out of his terrified imagination now i need to go back home there are some aspects of this ritual i want to make sure i have right and i need to get some ingredients and other things i tilted my head to look at harry i hope you dontneed to have this done right now the preparation will take about two months i ll be ready about the first week in august i was sure this wasntexactly what harry wanted to hear no doubt he wanted to start right away but seeing as how i was the only one who knew the ritual there was no arguing with me on this i knew best after all and two months was better then never that fine his voice didntsound like it was but then i guess with an evil wizard gaining power by the day two months was a long time to wait he reached into his pocket and pulled out an envelope much like the one cairn had i ll send you back now by floo powder in two months i ll have cairn come pick you up again will you still be at your office then i shook my head i always avoided my office in the summer months because there was a higher chance of running into matt caulder when i was there and one can only come up with so many turn downs to dinner or a movie without becoming suspicious i stuck my hands into the pocket of my pants pulling out a piece of paper looking at it it was just a receipt for dinner i had last night at a restaurant i turned it over and used a pen also in my pocket to write my flat address on this i handed to harry that is the address of where i live dontworry though it has a fireplace as well just dontcome popping in until i ready i wasntexactly over eager at the idea of having strange people men being able to enter my apartment at anytime but there was really no other way for it at least i trusted harry enough not to come willy nilly i ll set up a temporary stop at your flat on the floo network like i did with your office they dontlast longer then three months so you wonthave to worry past that he smiled and pushed the piece of paper into a pocket in his robes if you ll stand up in the fireplace i ll send you back i stood up and moved into the fireplace but then i noticed the clag a bh is was still firmly gripped in my hands i handed it back to harry with a sheepish grin i dontthink i want to bring that back with me it not too safe with me i wasnt sure if i meant this in terms of voldemort of from myself it was certainly a valuable relic and i wasntentirely sure i could trust myself around it the young wizard took it and deposited it into a pocket without a second glance at it he didntquestion my statement of it safety now remember state the exact address of your office in a clear voice i dontwant you getting lost he paused and reached out taking my hand planted a feather light kiss on the top of it thank you aine i smiled if a little shakily and when he threw down the floo powder i siad my address clearly like i had been taught when the smoke cleared i was looking at my office once again i took a few shaky steps out of the fireplace before falling into a chair my brain running over everything that had just happened i knew my day was going to end weird a n so i was reading someone else story and they stated that if a story has 40 chapters and 150 reviews then it a terrible story so what does that make my 30 chapter 79 review story apparently a really really really terrible story it a little depressing oh well i have come to terms with the lack of reviews but thank you to the few people who do actually review i of course shall continue writing even if no one cares i stubborn like that chapter 30 what other time i turned back to sirius not because of the question but at the cold chill i felt hearing him ask it other time i fluttered my eyelashes playing off the question with the innocent girl ploy maybe i should have remembered that ploy never really worked too well for me really it appeared that i wasnttoo innocent looking i found myself back up against the wall again this time a tight grip on my shoulders kept me from moving the longer slender fingers dug into my skin making me wince slightly it was likely that i was going to have some bruises later on gone were the fluid silver from before now it was the heated steel professor black was not happy of course neither was i no one likes being pushed into a wall at least being kissed was a pleasant outcome this didntlook like it was going to end up pleasantly you kissed him didntyou a growl came out from his throat rumbling low and menacing him could only be one person to sirius you actually kissed snape seeing no disagreement in my eyes his eyes got colder a darker aura surrounding him he dangerous he has no feelings he a shell of a human being what are you playing at aine he seemed to take my continued quiet as a by your leave to get louder angrier you re messing around with me and him what is going on a surge of anger coursed through me and somehow i managed to find enough energy to push the man away from me pulling his grip off of me sparks flowed out of my eyes at the man still fuming in front of me how dare he say that i was playing around with him as if he was the center of my universe and everything had to do with him he had kissed me twice not the other way round he was the one expecting me to jump into bed with him i had never suggested it he had absolutely no right to judge what i did or even who i did it with his own feud with severus had nothing to do with me and anyway it hadnteven been a real kiss with severus i going to have bruises my voice was low quiet calm even it didntmatch what i was feeling on the inside but i needed to make him understand what he had done that he had hurt me at my comment he looked instantly contrite opening his mouth to apologize but i cut him off i did indeed kiss severus the apology pretty much died there that is none of your business so i will not discuss that with you at all i consider myself severus friend though so on his behalf i shall say that you re wrong the man of course has feelings nor is he a fiend i rubbed at my shoulders wincing at the throbbing in them as for messing with you it fairly apparent that yes i am attracted to you but i have made no moves on you that was all you and severus i attracted to him as well i saw the argument in his sirius eyes before he even opened his mouth donteven say it sirius you hate him i get that believe me we all get that but he has good qualities different ones from you hence how i attracted to you both i sighed getting weighed down by all this believe me sirius this is not exactly what i planned i just want you to find this horcrux so harry can defeat voldemort fast and then i can go home after breaking the connection between us sirius said softly and i wondered if he meant that two ways yes and severus might actually help with that he heard that in two different ways as well i see now that i have been perhaps a bit too flirtatious with you and severus i promise to stop that now i smiled slightly hoping that he would accept the olive branch so we could go back to being friends i doubt you could just stop with severus and continue with me there was a joking quality to his question and i sighed relieved that this whole incident hadntcaused our relationship to be irrevocably damaged or maybe the other way round i suppose both then he sulked softly but the air around him had lightened considerably in that moment when the air around him had darkened his eyes getting hard i could see the scary escapee from prison that had frightened people so long ago sirius might act the fool now playing around with women but he was someone to avoid crossing we walked the rest of the way to the great hall in silence neither of us really having anything to say well that is to say we had nothing that we could say out loud i didntdoubt that inside sirius was having a serious argument with himself about what had just come to light not to mention i sure there were plenty of situations in which severus came to great harm playing out in his head for my part there was nothing to say i was starting to realize that i had indeed been playing with the two men not that it was something i had set out to do at least not in such a serious way it was one thing to tease them both but for sirius at least it had been heightened to a whole new level could i say that i was unaware of what was going on not really no in fact i had liked the flirting but it was making me forget some important facts i wasnthere for fun i wasnteven really here to teach i was here because sirius had to find the horcrux and i was basically distracting him so now it all had to stop i could just be happy though that it wasnt being ended in a way that left sirius and i as enemies walking into the hall together greeted both of us with the sight of so many kids happily eating their lunch and at the teacher table sat the thing that had so shortly been a cause of contention between sirius and i not that the thorn in sirius side would ever show any concern about the effect he was having on the other man or would he notice the effect he ever had on me hello everyone i smiled at everyone as i took my seat noticeably severus stayed quiet but if my eyesight was still good then there was a faint blush on his cheeks that kiss from earlier certainly had thrown him off the man really needed to get kissed more often if that small peck on the lips was actually flustering him sirius threw a nasty glare at severus as he took his own seat i dont think he even needed any problems with me to cause dissension with snape it was almost just a traditional gesture for him go to lunch glare at severus sit down eat the food how was your first class dear professor sprout sat next to me a friendly open look on her motherly face oh it was fine it still a little surprising to be teaching things that are so mundane to me but overall it was quite good though i still have older students to deal with those might be harder no problems with the students then there was almost an expectant worry in her voice such that she assumed that something had happened and if not then something bad was going to happen nothing more then your usual poking and prodding of the new teacher they were testing me to see how far they could go i pretty sure that i at least passed the test i shot sirius a look and he just coughed into his hand looking a little shameful well that good the tone of professor sprout voice indicated that she at least wasnttrusting the students continued good intentions at some point i was going to come up with a problem and i didntdoubt that the problem likely had a name one thing you learn as a teacher is that every school has certain almost stereotypical students apparently i hadntyet come up against the troublemakers or even the bad boy though after a class with miss tsuroda i didntdoubt i had met the know it all do you want to know the names severus asked from down the table i opened my mouth to answer it certainly wasnteveryday that severus actually offered help to me and as such it was basically a miracle i really wanted to comment on that tease him a little but out of the corner of my eye i saw a twitch appear on sirius temple i remembered the argument and my earlier promise there was going to be no more teasing or flirting even if it had been innocent enough and for me who had a problem keeping the teasing out of my normal conversations with severus that just meant limiting my contact with the man no thank you professor snape i think i shall work out whom everyone is on my own black eyes widened and for a moment i saw just a flash of something before he started to scowl once again as much of a miracle as it was for severus to offer help it seemed it was more of a miracle to him that i turned him down it really did kill me though to see that flash of what might have been disappointment but in the long run it was far better to keep everyone on good terms and sirius is just too hot tempered enough with out me giving him more reasons to blow up after eating i slipped off on my own and headed to the library for continued research on my own personal problem i had read every book madam pince had given me on spiritual connections and so far none of them had produced any viable result i had tried a few with madam pince help when it came to magic but the results had varied from nothing happening to one incident where my hair turned a rather pukish shade of green for a day luckily before school started all that particular incident had accomplished was giving amusement to all around me snape had mocked sirius had laughed and tonks had suggested far easier ways of changing my hair colour if i was so inclined headmistress mcgonagall had merely suggested that the particular shade of green didntreally suit me since i had gone through all the spiritual connection books i was now reading just about everything i could get my hands on just in case any of them held a clue to what i could do to solve this everything and anything was fair game books on famous wizards in case a wizard or witch had a similar problem books on beasts and monsters in case one had a talent for connecting to people books on potions in case amazingly one could be used as a cure i even read an entire book on wizarding fashions in case somehow clothes were the answer i must have looked rather amusing to all the students who came into the library or being serious the five or six who came in after all it was the first day of classes here i was a muggle teacher with absolutely no magic unless you counted my sparkling personality and i was spending the entire afternoon of my first classes in the library surrounded by piles of books on magics that i could never use really it was rather futile and actually if i had thought about it before i would have realized it was also a mite bit suspicious professor the voice was rather small and timid and even before looking up i could have guessed it was a first year and upon doing so i saw that it was the particular first year who seemed to have a habit of walking in on me doing odd things mr faust can i help you i just wanted to to apo apologize to you he was fidgeting moving anxiously back and forth on each foot his face was a bright red not surprising since he was apologizing to his teacher for seeing her in compromising positions not just once but twice oh dear kerstan you really donthave to apologize shaking my head i closed the book i was reading after all it was my fault not yours still i sorry kerstan seemed to lighten up considerably after me taking the blame his voice was more certain his eyes moved over all the books on the table and he looked confused do all teachers study this hard for classes i glanced at the books and saw them from an outsiders viewpoint here i was sitting at a table surrounded by piles of books that made it almost hard to see over it certainly did look like i was working hard no not all teachers do you ve had professor black class havent you the young boy with the dark hair laughed at that and once again i wondered if this young boy was the harry potter of this age but thinking things like that are foolish gryffindor happy dark hair that doesntmake you harry potter it can t it was highly doubtful this boy had any events in his life to match any of harry s nor would i want him to have had any i do hope his classes improve kerstan said softly at my sharp look he blushed slightly for his sake not mine the slytherins will tear him apart if not i nodded at this rather correct statement kerstan do you know that boy cain montgomery he in slytherin the boy was friendly enough that i didntdoubt he would have learned everyone name at my question he looked a little surprised but nodded the gesture was hesitant though you know about him already then do you his voice was low and nervous like he was telling a dark secret my eyes widened at the comment though well no i just wanted to know if you knew him but now you re going to have to follow up on that little statement i gestured to the seat across from me and slowly kerstan sat down in it still fidgeting well i assumed as a teacher you would have known already my look indicated that was certainly not true well it just a rumour that been going around of course someone should never trust rumours but really it just that the thing is cain father was reportedly a death eater not that it was proven but he died suddenly around the same time as that last battle my eyes were certainly large now if draco wanted me to look out for things that might be important this was certainly one of them not that a parent beliefs necessarily translated into the son beliefs after all draco would be the first one to point that out his father had been a death eater and he had managed to turn away from that destiny but that could be also placed upon the help he had gotten from harry that last year as well i didntdoubt that without severus and harry draco would probably be dead or in azkaban now as for cain i was not making a judgement but my eyes were going to watch him far more carefully now you re certainly right people shouldntbelieve rumours he isnthelping with his attitude either i haventseen him say more then two words to anyone teachers and fellow slytherins included well you re a nice kid maybe you can become friends with him my suggestion brought a look of distaste to the young boys face he in slytherin and of course being a gryffindor you wouldntbe afraid of what other people might say i lifted an eyebrow at the dark haired boy a deep sigh erupted from the boy looking beaten already of course professor thank you kerstan i smiled up at him giving him a rather blatant dismissal which he happily took and bounded away from my table tapping my fingers on the table relaxed me a bit and helped me think so young cain montgomery father had been a possible death eater it was a bit of a coincidence that with the return of lord voldemort a son of one of his death eaters was now at the school at the same time that sirius and i were here looking for the all important horcrux i looked down at the book i had been reading and realized that my heart wasntin the research anymore not for today at least my own personal problem was going to have to wait i waited outside the potions classroom at the end of the day before dinner as the students poured out i got a few strange looks once the classroom was empty i walked into the room severus was looking rather disgusted at a pile of different coloured vials on his desk apparently the potions work hadntgone too well since there were colours varying from brown to red to an interesting shifting purplish black knowing next to nothing about potions i still knew that you wanted all the potions to be the same colour to indicate that everyone had made the same thing i dontthink i would have wanted severus job not if this was any indication of the student potential in the subject not that i could personally understand the problems after all didntthey just have to follow the directions on the board it seemed rather simple to me sort of like following the directions on the back of a box of cake mix do everything right and you have a lovely two layered chocolate covered golden cake if you didn t then you had more trash to throw out going well the smirk on my face was entirely out of habit i couldnt have controlled it if i tried even with the glower i was getting from the hawk nosed potions master at that very moment it wasnt my fault it was just amusing and my face reacted before my brain thought about it they re all just incapable of learning the art of potion making he sneered out looking away from the pile of mismatched colors on his desk to look at me cooly can i help you professor mackinnion i would assume potion making would be like cooking i bet you re probably a wonderful cook severus i smiled brightly before the smile faltered my brain reminded me that i wasntsupposed to be flirting with him anymore to avoid further troubles with sirius never mind anyway i wanted to talk to you about one of the slytherin first years at my comment about potion making and cooking severus had looked surprised now he just looked mildly annoyed it was in general his normal appearance he looked about ready to throw me out so i thought it best to just hurry on before i found myself outside wondering about the bruises i would have on my delicate derriere if you keep telling yourself it delicate you too will believe it cain montgomery do you know anything about him a perfect black brow raised in my direction there was no answer at least not verbal instead severus dug through the vials on his table and held up the one which was an interesting shifting colour between black and purple cain montgomery is like that vial so using sarcasm on severus wasntnecessarily the best idea really the man didntseem to appreciate the finer points of humour not if his grunt was any indication or the look of disapproval on his face i was indicating a likeness to what was in the vial his voice took on the quality of a teacher this was likely the way he sounded when speaking to his students at least this would have been the way he sounded when talking to students if he was actually ever patient with any of them it kind of made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside that he was actually even trying to explain any of this to me all right i understand that but not being a witch you will have to explain that a bit better to me i referring to the colour the boys shifts i tilted my head to look at the man hoping that the change of view might help me understand that little ambiguous statement a bit better shifts how does a boy shift was that a wizard term that i wasntaware of sort of like teleporting or apparating well judging by the rather succinctly confused expression on your face i suppose i shall explain a bit more cain montgomery goes back and forth he seems to be rather unreadable wait wait wait i held up my hand shaking my head trying to take a moment to think that through are you saying that the almighty professor snape cantread one of his students even more so one that in his own house i think i a little disappointed there goes that eyebrow again i suppose you have better insight well i smirked again really i swear that it not in my control most of the time you should have known this but i heard from young kerstan that cain father was a death eater a distinct gloom cast itself over severus face he stood up and started to pace back and forth across the front of the room thinking myself at least slightly intelligent i stayed where i was in the back of the class generally gloomy teachers are best at distances sort of like monet paintings or shows involving clowns and watermelons that advice taken doubly so when that gloomy teacher also is a wizard didnt you know his father really i was taking my life into my hands by bringing up his past the question though made severus stop his pacing and stare at me as if he was just remembering my presence in the room no i didntknow any montgomery he ran an agitated hand through his hair a gesture i hadntseen him do before really i didnt think the nervous act really suited him too much he would likely kill me if i said it but it was more of a sirius thing to do just because i didntknow him didntmean he wasntthough he had many followers that were secret well there was no need to ask who he was referring to there but there went my confirmation on the rumour now it was still speculation as to the connections of cain father well i probably donthave to tell you but can you keep an eye on him just in case it too much of a coincidence to have a possible death eater son here at the same time we re looking for something important severus started to walk up the aisle toward me and even before i had a chance to even think about it my feet had already taken a few steps backwards it an instinctual desire to flee before a predator and if this man was anything he was certainly a predator but i stopped the movement and stood my ground he stopped just in front of me you have no real proof that he is involved you have no real proof that his father was even a death eater it just a gryfindors word against a slytherin he continued walking up toward the exit stopping next to me once again do your dirty work yourself it time for dinner he wasntgoing anywhere if i didntknow the man better i would say that he was actually waiting for me to go with him to dinner that though would be entirely out of character almost like a nice thing to do but the fact of the matter was that he was waiting now i could go with him entirely as professional working friends not a sight of flirting at all it was of course possible for me to be around sirius and severus without teasing them that wasntthe problem no the problem was that the more time around the two of them and it wasntbecoming an issue of wanting to tease the two of them but something else i couldnthelp my contact with sirius but severus i could limited contact was likely best in this situation i not too hungry that was a lie i was starving the house elves were certainly going to be getting a visit from me severus certainly looked disgruntled at that statement as if he had been expecting me to hop up happily and run off to dinner with him that would have been true just a few hours ago but since the incident with sirius well i wasntabout to add any more episodes to that little feud even though i really was jumping on the inside at severus invitation to dinner if i find anything out about your connection with black i ll let you know at my surprised look he huffed i wouldntwant to have to deal with the students impressions of me after hearing that i supposedly attacked you ah and here i thought the world had been sucked into a negative space where everything was opposite in this special world severus was actually helpful loved kitties wore pink and was best friends with sirius no more words were said and the man swept out of the potions classroom he was on his way to the great hall where he could partake of the tables overflowing with food while i on the other hand was relegated to asking for leftovers from the kitchen and why because sirius had to be a little baby about my relationship with severus it was with a great degree of sulking that i stomped out of the classroom myself that night i had an interesting dream severus and sirius were playing tug o war with a giant stuffed unicorn in the background headmistress mcgonagall actually had her hair down which was really the most shocking thing in the entire dream and was dancing with the portrait of dumbledore harry and draco were dressed up as bunnies and not surprisingly were cuddling up together there was also a large donkey that somehow how looked exactly like mat without actually looking like him at all as is the way in the dream world it was all fairly normal as far as dreams go not the weirdest one i had ever had either that dubious distinction went to a particularly odd dream involving a bunch of neon elephants bouncing around on large rubber balls that dream i had written off due to some bad curry my mother had made the night before if sirius and draco had been right about my cooking ability i didntdoubt that i had gotten the talent or lack there of from my mother at some point in the dream though things took a dark turn everything faded out or more correctly it seemed like i was pulled out of the dream pulled so far away that everything else got smaller and darker the horizon was now dark misty rain falling hard on everything in this dream world i felt controlled confined and frightened out of my mind it was an odd turn especially since i normally regarded darkness and rain rather fondly the thought of the two didnt scare me or make me sad quite the opposite instead but in this dream i was scared something was coming and that was when i had woken up luckily for me touching my cheeks i could feel the warm salty tears on my cheeks never before could i remember having a dream that affected me so much and what i remembered there hadntbeen too much to it no large monsters or embarrassing situations no instead this was entirely based off the feeling in a dream with the day dawning and sleep slipping off me the dream was already beginning to disappear but the horrible feeling stayed with me cold water fell down on my head and still i couldnthelp the feeling of desperation and depression that was clinging to me it made my body heavy my skin sticky and clammy and suddenly i felt an incredible urge to cry something was wrong with me i retreated from my shower knowing that it wasntgoing to help like it had in the past the clear water wasntgoing to wash anything away wrapping a towel around myself i walked back into the bedroom it was rather lucky that i decided to cover up now i not sure exactly what the protocol is for when a house elf sees you naked i sure with normal ones it wouldntreally be that much of a problem for you at least for the house elf though they would likely find the hardest thing in the room and bang their heads against it in apology the elf standing in the middle of my bedroom was of course dobby lucky or not being freed gave him some new insight on situations an enslaved house elf for want of a better word would consider walking in on their master or mistress naked as a horrible offense and would punish themselves accordingly dobby on the other hand was a freed house elf so therefore he didntneed to punish himself for my sake of course that didntstop him from finding the hardest thing in the room which happened to be the stone wall and was now as i stood there banging his head rather painfully against it he may have been freed but all that did was give him a normal person insight on the embarrassing situation just imagine what would have happened if i had been naked and not wearing a towel dobby i pulled him away from the wall a feat in itself since the little guy was far more powerful then his small demeanour might have led you to believe as flattering as it is that the sight of me in a towel makes you want to bang your head against a wall is there a reason you re here the question caused the large eyes to blink uncertainly at me before the small elf jumped up and pulled out an envelope i thought for a second to ask where he had pulled it from since he wasntexactly wearing anything with pockets but i thought better of that idea it was likely a magic thing and those were things better left unasked a letter arrived for you miss here dobby is sorry he intruded sorry i was worried that he was going to start banging his head again but instead he just nodded the bruised looking head and popped out of the room if ever there was a magic trick i would have liked to have learnt that was it being able to get places so easily would have been useful i could have scared the crap out of my students back home too never would have known where the teacher was the letter that had been thrust into my hand was over all a rather normal looking one the envelope was white normally shaped and made out of what i assumed was normal paper it was addressed to me one professor aine mackinnion at hogwarts school for witchcraft and wizadry small indentations indicated that it had been sent by owl post sitting down on the edge of the bed i cracked open the envelope and pulled out the paper from within opening it and starting to read what had been sent to me dear aine should i have started the letter with dear i wasntreally sure i dont write too many letters anymore anyway draco has informed me that you are fine and dealing well with the reported attacks i sorry that i couldntcome see you myself but there were some things that had to be dealt with at the ministry hopefully he wasnttoo rude to you he informs me that he was the epitome of gentlemanly behaviour but that just means he didnttry to kill you learning to take everything he says with a grain of salt took me quite awhile the real reason to write is that he also told me that you have informed professor snape about everything do you know what a howler is i flinched a bit reading that bit but calmed down when nothing was screamed out at me and anyway those things supposedly screamed from the opening i sure you do i considered sending you one of those but that wouldnt have been very sensible for keeping this all a secret that you told him of all people i think it was a mistake so the feelings between the professor and harry hadntbeen cleared up that easily not that one can really blame harry severus had treated him rather harshly while at school draco though has enlightened me to the upside of letting professor snape in on this a snigger made its way past my lips sometimes my mind really did live in a gutter there were ways of persuading that didnt include handcuffs or beds but they werentnearly as fun dont tell anyone else frankly you re only there because of the problem you and sirius have otherwise i would have you home in america right now you re in rather a lot of danger at the school so i would like to at least know you re taking care of yourself and being careful at least try to and while you re at it look after sirius i ve been in contact with your parents as well i thought it best to give them a place to contact you so they ve been writing my place and i am now passing the letter on to you keep sirius working hard i need that horcrux now i dontwant to push him but it getting worse harry really somehow in the letter it had gone from me not being able to really take care of myself to having to look out for sirius out of the two of us he was the wizard the one with the wand who could easily deal with anything that came his way but here the muggle was the one being asked to look after him apparently i looked far stronger then i thought since draco had basically asked me to do the same thing with severus so harry didntwant to push sirius but it was okay for me to do it it looked like i was doing his dirty work so the godson could keep his relationship with his godfather all nice and fuzzy and warm i in a lot of danger at the school i reread the letter again my brows furrowed together at that point sometimes i wondered at the intelligence of the boy wonder after all was i safer at home hadnt people been killed at my school in my department likely by death eaters looking for me i flipped to the next piece of paper and stared at my mother perfect script all right so harry wasntexactly thinking correctly but it had been considerate of him to contact my parents after all it wasntlike i could use the phone to call them muggle contraptions are few and far between here aine should i be concerned that a young man named harry potter contacted us about you that cantbe his real name can it he seemed nice enough but he must get a lot of ribbing if that is his real name are you getting involved with some strange crowds over there not that i should be surprised by that after that stupid incident with that ritual i hope you re getting that situation solved make sure you try and take a look at freidrich book on spirituality in rituals there might be something there to help in case you haventfixed it in situations with blood it tends to require blood to break what was done you could try performing the ritual again or perhaps in reverse the harry that i spoke to let me know that you re doing some work over there of course he didnttell me exactly what or where just that you were teaching i shall think that this has to do with the person you re connected to why you re working when you should be solving the problem i dontknow just be careful i dont know if you know but some people were killed at nyu in your department so actually it a good thing you re over there now i was safer here two different views from two people perhaps the truth of the matter was that i wasntreally safe anywhere if i was at home i might have been killed in that attack as well the flip side though was that if i wasntover here there might not have been an attack at the school so being at the school was safe enough for me now it was one of the safest places apparently but judging by what happened in the books it wasntas safe as people assumed your father is not pleased with you but he wants you to be safe he a little suspicious of the break in at nyu i probably donthave to tell you that he been having his friends at the job looking into it things arentreally as they ve been portrayed in the press it was a little suspicious to us that the break in was your department right after you did something so stupid as a resurrection so we dontknow what going on but be careful and in case you get involved with anyone while you re there just be sure to be careful love you mom trust my mother to warn me about protection during sex while writing a letter to me about murders and resurrections and she didnteven know that there were any men in my life when i got home i was going to have to have a talk with her about her view of my personal life sadly enough for me i wasntthat promiscuous the way things were going lately i certainly wasntgoing to have to worry about any of that while i was here the really sad thing was that it was entirely of my own making it was a little worrisome though that dad was looking into the break in the worry was that it could bring the trouble to their door after all if the death eaters had broken into the school to get at me then my parents were certainly at risk i noticed a last piece of paper under my mother letter we re keeping an eye on your parents you ve got no time to worry just make my cousin find that horcrux faster and this will all be over while you re at it keep him away from professor snape i looking into the backgrounds on those two boys you told me about just keep an eye on them and send us anymore information you get it might also be a good idea to keep your lips off anyone and concentrate on what you re doing draco really was an ass sometimes though in his defense he had at least reassured me about my parents though the likelihood was that he hadntrealized he was doing it for him it was entirely about what was important to him the fact was that was harry and it just happened that our welfare was important enough to harry so therefore was important to draco i had expected worse from harry after hearing about my little discussion with severus but he at least wasntas close minded about the problem at least not with draco doing the pushing there was a great deal of relief that accompanied the letter having harry angry with me was something i had worried about draco i could deal with hell i expected it but harry was someone i wanted to keep on my good side i doubt he d be too happy with the way i had been teasing his godfather i realized i had been sitting only in a towel reading letters for a good 30 minutes i still needed to go have breakfast today my class wasntuntil after lunch but that didntmean i could just stay shut up in my room all day not to mention my stomach would not allow that i got dressed and rather lazily swept my hair up into a ponytail after all who really did i care to make an effort for as i passed out of my rooms i spared a moment to realize that the letters had swept the nightmare from my mind and the feeling of dread was gone in fact i barely could even remember what i had dreamt about except headmistress with her hair down that was something that was going to stick with me i wondered if i could get her to do that for real it might cause a shock for the students though but i needed something fun to pass the time a n well i hope everyone has seen the new harry potter movie i saw it last night at midnight if not hopefully you get to see it soon it was a lot of fun funnier then i thought it would be and an enjoyable 2 and 1 2 hours thank you to everyone who has reviewed really there was a point where i considered stopping this story due to the review chapter ratio but everyone is right the number of reviews doesntnecessarily mean anything but that doesntmean you shouldntreview cause if you re reading this it the nice thing to do chapter 31 sirius you dontlook too good i was walking with him up the stairs to the first floor and our classrooms it was true what i had said though the man hadntlooked at all good when i had walked into the great hall indeed his appetite seemed to have been missing barely even touching any of the food on his plate his pallor had been ashen as well bags under his eyes i fine just pining away for you he smiled at me stopping to reach playfully toward me i smacked his hands away huffing softly at the idiotic behaviour but i couldntavoid the inevitable smile the slipped on to my face apparently i wasntallowed to flirt with him but that didnt mean he couldntdo it to me as if i would ever expect him to stop now sirius just remember today dontlet the students get the best of you it your classroom the two of us stopped at the top of the stairs students streaming past us to get to their classes some of them pausing to say hello to the two of us before hurrying on sirius robes were a bit askew so i reached out to fix it i suppose it was a habit that all women have probably a genetic impulse to help when we have children a few students who were walking by at that time sniggered shouting out that we looked like a married couple that rumour was going to fly now children are so endearing arentthey my eyebrow rose at sirius finding that comment rather silly from him just the day before he had been spouting the evil nature of all children they certainly got on his good side when helping his own agenda though and at this point the agenda involved me go teach your class now i muttered pushing him in the direction of his classroom waiting a moment to watch him saunter off feeling rather proud of himself hopefully sirius second day of classes would be a vast improvement over the first as far as my hopes for the day went though well everyday i managed not to get cursed i considered a triumph and if some of the students learnt a little bit about muggles and practical uses of some muggle artifacts well then it was just a stellar day unlike sirius and a good number of the other teachers though i had a limited number of classes muggle studies really wasntthe most popular of classes there were certainly no students queuing to get into it this lack of classes was mainly due to the fact that the class was an elective starting the student third year sirius and severus each had mandatory classes so their days were full something i sure that sirius at least would love to trade me for my class for the day was going to be a combined one of fifth year students but it wasntuntil after lunch so i had the morning to bum around i could go sit in on sirius classes again that was an amusement in itself watching as sirius grappled with his own students for control but spending more time with sirius was tending to give him the wrong ideas though technically i suppose the ideas themselves were correct i just didntwant him to have them going to sit in on severus class was also thrown right out by my logical brain not that i was necessarily sure that it would be too amusing i didntdoubt that severus would run a tight ship when it came to his classes and there would be no room for much enjoyment though i was curious how he actually did teach not just the wholly unflattering descriptions i had gotten from the book somehow in that respect i didntdoubt that the book had been rather close to the mark there were no other teachers i felt especially comfortable with to sit in on their classes though i sure most of them would have welcomed me happily enough perhaps once i had gotten more used to the school and with more time the other option to spend the morning was the most suitable to study in the library the very thought though exhausted me studying was something that was normally an enjoyment but since resurrecting sirius and discovering my strange need to stay too damned close to him i had spent too many hours reading books not that the books were even helping me as it was excepting some exciting new opportunities in hair colours i hadntlearnt anything to help me what i wouldntgive for a computer connected to the internet magic was amazing enough but the internet was something else entirely in the end i chose to just wander around the castle in the week or so that i had been here other then my tour with sirius i hadnt really had much time to actually look around the enormous castle my experience with the tricks and deceptions of the castle were strictly speaking non existent so it was with great care that i started to make my way around the castle it was on the extremely annoying trick stair that i had my first run in with the castle resident poltergeist taking advantage of my foot being stuck in the middle of a stone stair i was the perfect target for the bucket of water that rained down on me peeves i growled out water dripping from my hair nose and every other place on my body the cackling spirit floating above me hadnt introduced himself but there was no need for him to have with the possible exception of some of the students no one was stupid enough to throw water on a teacher the widdle muggle is all wet he flew in circles over my head his horrible voice cackling poltergeists were not pleasant creatures at all at that moment i thought even a banshee would be better company even matt caulder at the school christmas party after quite a number of drinks was more pleasant than this thing and that was saying a lot since matt got touchy when drunk this widdle muggle is plum tired of you after only a few minutes choosing to ignore one of the most excruciatingly annoying creatures on the planet i instead concentrated on getting my foot out of the stair it was as i was doing this that i noticed a flash of black out of the corner of my eye i turned quickly enough to see someone dart round the corner into a hallway a flash of blonde accompanying the black of their robes those robes had been student ones and it was now the middle of class time so whoever it was in all likelihood was skipping class so occasionally students might have free periods but that didnt register in my brain as a probable situation here whoever it had been had made sure to avoid me after all they couldnthave missed me not with peeves cackling around me and my foot part of the stairs the teacher instinct kicked in at full blast aside from the need to impart knowledge of the younger generations there is also the desire to make their lives miserable for doing all the things we ourselves likely did as children of course we say it for their own good but usually it just because we got caught for it ourselves i started to quickly follow after the elusive student only when my face met the stone floor did i remember where my foot was the muggle canteven walk peeves did you know that this muggle knows some cleansing ceremonies that can rid places of ghosts and poltergeists i managed to pull my foot free likely the adrenaline from my anger toward the damned spirit i let the mild threat hang in the air somehow i doubted that it would be taken with much gravity but peeves wasntmy main consideration at the moment i jumped up and peeled round the corner running in the direction that the boy had gone i skidded round a corner only to back track quickly as i came upon the student cain montgomery was standing in front of a door on the third floor in the chasing i hadntnoticed that we had ended up in the forbidden area of the floor i stayed close to the corner daring to just peek around at the boy i wasntexactly sure why i was hiding from him after all he was in the wrong here there was no doubt in my mind that he was skipping a class and on his second day as well but the other reason i was at this school trumped my feelings as a teacher keeping an eye on him and seeing what he was up to were more important that schooling something suspicious was going on there was no doubt about that not judging by the way cain was looking around him making sure no one else was nearby it was lucky for me that the marauder map was not something that had been replicated and sold to all the students here i considered for a moment asking harry if i could borrow it if he still had it it could be useful keeping any eye on some people teachers as well as students i was musing to myself the joys of being able to tell where sirius was so i could make sure he was doing his job when i noticed that cain wasnt there anymore well my future career as a glamourous spy had just fallen through i sprang forward from my if i was really honest absolutely terrible hiding place and threw open the door in front of which the young boy had just been standing in front of all that greeted me as i opened the wood door was an empty disused classroom old furniture like wardrobes and desks covered by sheets lined the walls chairs stood piled upon each other in the center of the room dust clung over everything even seeming to cling to the very air the boy was no where in sight in fact it looked like no one had stepped foot in this room for a very long time while i had been distracted cain had mysteriously disappeared though perhaps it wasntthat mysterious my mind had distracted me long enough that he might simply have walked away from the door and disappeared around the corner there was no point in looking now there would be no sight of the boy anymore i sighed and the displacement of air caused dust to stir up in front of me it made me remember 12 grimmauld place sirius might find the room rather similar though whether it would be in a good way was unlikely dust made me leave the room quickly enough the question was what cain had been doing or really if he had been doing anything on the one hand he had been skipping class acting strange and in an odd part of the castle but on the other hand it was his second day in a very large castle he might have just been understandably lost sirius would have taken his placement in slytherin as a point against him for severus it would have been a mark in his favour i though was trying to be as neutral as possible in the matter that first night he had undoubtedly been staring at me rather strangely but even that wasntanything to suggest there was something sinister about the boy it could have been curiousity about a muggle or even a school boy crush or just malice directed toward a muggle as for the issue with cain father well that hadnteven really been confirmed and even if it was true that meant really nothing a boy can not be held responsible for his father actions draco was a perfect example of this i starting to think too hard about this i frowned rubbing at a sudden ache in my head my eyes closing against the throbbing feeling voldemort horcruxes regulus severus sirius perhaps the weight of things was starting to get to me despite my love for the occult and experience with certain rituals i was really beginning to realize i was in over my head but damned if i could get out did i even want to my curiousity was far too great to just back away from everything with a sorry did my best the throbbing had subsided making me realize that i was still standing in the hallway in front of the empty room i glanced down at my watch seeing it was nearing lunch time deciding that my desire to roam the castle anymore had faded away i made my way back to my own room to change from my still damp clothing i was careful around the trick stair and looked around for peeves not wanting to get a second dousing from the annoying spectre the few students i saw on my way down to my rooms gave me curious glances though they apparently thought that it was normal for a muggle teacher to be roaming the castle wearing soaked clothing i was really going to have to work on my lesson plans just in case they really did think muggles liked to wear wet clothing a change of clothes certainly helped improve one mood at least it helped calm me down before i went down for lunch at the teacher table sirius looked even worse then when i had left him this morning even though i would have thought it impossible his colour hadntgotten any better and now he was rubbing his temples his eyes closed his food laying untouched on his plate hard classes i slipped into the seat next to him speaking softly eh he looked up at me surprised a small smile on his lips it nothing just had a problem with one of the students in my class enchanting one of his fellow classmates into a rather large pink bird it made such a racket that i got a headache part of it is still lingering his smile widened further rather neat trick actually that something prongs and i would have done at school i was really just glad that his eyes didntdeaden at the memory of his old friend in fact it seemed to perk him up a bit and he finally noticed the food in front of him the way he was digging into it made it hard to believe he had looked rather sick only moments before so some kid had enchanted a classmate into a pink bird likely a flamingo it seemed that sirius might have located the troublemaker of the school i wondered briefly if i wanted the student to be in my class or if it perhaps would be safer without them dealing with a large bird gone amok might be rather difficult without magical means i rather doubted that i was capable of wrangling any large feathered or furred animals after a few minutes severus came up to the table and took a seat at the other end of the table as far from sirius as possible i moved out of my chair and moved instead down to the table to sit next to severus i was quite sure i didntimagine the heated glare i felt coming from sirius as i did this some things had to be discussed with the potions master though severus can i talk to you about some thing i kept my voice low so none of the other teachers could hear us though at the moment the table was only half filled speaking to me again are we pure ice dripped from his voice making me back up slightly to look at him strangely i wasntaware that i had stopped speaking to you or in fact that you ever wanted me to the frown on my face was mirrored by severus own frown of course i don t he muttered his voice harsh what do you want i raised an eyebrow at this but didntsay anything i needed to discuss what had happened without causing more problems of course sirius would likely have been hurt that i didntwant to tell him first but the fact was that severus was his head of house and would be better suited to keep an eye on cain i found cain montgomery skipping class he was on the third floor near the forbidden area i had expected severus to join me in my adamant acknowledgment that this was suspicious behaviour instead though he just huffed softly then take points away from his house what are you bothering me with this for dont you think it odd he was acting all suspicious your company is putting blinders on your sight his eyes looked past me to stare maliciously at sirius who i sure was doing the same right back just because a student is in slytherin and skipping class doesntmean he is a death eater now i huffed angrily i am well aware of that you stupid git my hand had reached out to pull on severus robes making him look at me you know as well as i do that what is going on has to be taken seriously i released my grip on his robes a pale blush on my cheeks as i realized that the students were gaping at professor snape and myself for his part though severus looked a little shell shocked at the close contact i dontmean to insinuate that cain is a death eater my voice stayed pitched low this was really a conversation i should be having elsewhere but i was too anxious to wait there really isnt anything else for me to do here you know all i can do to help is encourage sirius and keep my eyes open my voice sounded hurt even to my own ears really when you got right down to it i was absolutely useless as harry and draco had both pointed out they didntwant me here without that side effect i would be home possibly dead though but that was something best left not to think about i ll keep an eye on him severus muttered softly keeping his eyes on the plate in front of him he actually looked a little embarassed thank you i beamed a smile at him he glanced up but quickly dropped his eyes again i got up again to go back to my original seat it was time for sirius management you re not supposed to flirt with him anymore the man hadnteven tried to lower his voice when he said this i was discussing work with him stressing work and eyeing him dangerously seemed to keep his mouth shut whether he understood what i had meant by work or if he was just worried i was angry with him i wasntsure you ve dazzled a good number of the boys with that smile he wore a lopsided grin the man was simply mercurial his mood changed faster then young girl crushes curious i looked up at the students and noticed more then a few of the boys staring at me curiously after my years at nyu i had come to recognize the signs of young men crushes and apparently i had gained a few admirers who knew the smile would work that well i wondered if it had the same effect on sirius and severus well maybe that will mean they ll do their homework i shrugged carelessly eating the sandwich that had appeared on my plate severus is going to keep an eye on some things for me he looked ready to ask the question of what he was keeping an eye on but his mouth closed before the words came out a few seconds passed before he tried again looking a bit more careful and cautious good thing for him too i would have been rather angry if anything malicious had come out of his mouth just then what is professor snape keeping an eye on he gained points for saying severus name with almost decent civility yes there was a point system going on the two were rather neck and neck just some things only he can watch out for i was loathe to tell the dark haired man looking at me so closely exactly what those things were there was no doubting sirius thoughts on the matter cain house would have damned him in sirius eyes already so i hadnttold sirius at all about my thoughts on the boy certainly not about his father there would be no surprise when sirius would jump up ready to detain the boy and question him knowing he had to be up to something the animagus was a good man brave and loyal certainly but he had certain predispositions and one was the unflinching belief that all slytherins were bad a slight exception might be draco but i doubted that even it was highly more likely that he ignored his presence out of love for harry grey eyes looked rather annoyed at me a slight amount of hurt could be seen in them as well thinking that i had something i could tell severus but not him he didntsay anything further on the matter though and this actually seemed to worry me a bit more then if he had i ve got class now i stood up brushing myself off of any crumbs that might have fallen on me good luck with the rest of your classes sirius i ll see you at dinner all i got was a grunt from him as i left as i left the hall i felt hard eyes watching me likely sirius though still angry that i hadntconfided something in him my second class ever at hogwarts was a class made up of fifth year students once again it was comprised of all the houses except slytherin i rather doubted that i was going to find a single student from that house in any of my classes there was going to have to be a discussion with snape about his house refusal to learn more about the muggle world it was for their own benefit after all i should have been more nervous for my first class but instead it was this one that i was dreading this was the first class i was going to have where the students would have had previous experience in muggle studies classes here was where i was going to have to battle to change their already skewed perspectives on my kind after reading the lesson plans left to me by the rather flighty professor who proceeded me in the job i knew i had my work cut out for me apparently the class seemed to have centered largely around how to pronounce the names of muggle artefacts incorrectly i might add and why wizards did things so much better really the class hadnt really been too good at actually fostering the idea that wizards and muggles were basically equals as the students entered the classroom i could see that i wasntthe only one who was a bit nervous they looked rather apprehensive to have a new teacher especially one who was what they were studying in the class if they had even a fraction of intelligence they would have realized that the curriculum was going to change the smart ones must have known that what they had learned before wasntgoing to cut it with an actual muggle undoubtedly the students who had chosen this class as an easy elective were seeing their nights free of homework flying out the window hello i was perched on the front of my desk my feet swaying in the air my muggle clothes always seemed to stand out most when i was teaching the class filled with 20 students who all wore black robes i really was actually dressing down for this teaching job when i had been at nyu i had always wore suitably respectable teaching clothes here though i wore normal everyday clothes jeans and a t shirt matt would not have been pleased but mcgonagall didntseem to notice much difference between muggle clothing or she chose not to care that i wore jeans this will be your third year taking this class and i sure you re all very bright indeed now what is a bicycle my question was met with absolute silence television pencil i thought that crickets might have effectively demonstrated the dead quiet i was receiving with each question not to mention the nervous blank looks i was getting fan telephone finally someone slowly raised their hand professor i think you mean a tellyfun that what they use to talk to each other over long distances cantspeak through fires the young man was a brunette from hufflepuff who looked rather amazed that people didntall see faces in their fires thank you i smiled slightly it is in fact telephone not tellyfun that is a completely separate idea involving joy of tv i slipped off the edge of the desk stretching slightly your education has been abysmal to say the least i sighed and they all shifted in their seats hopefully everyone was able to obtain the book i required for all fourth year students and up they all immediately pulled rather large looking books out of the bags the only book i had required the students to purchase had been a normal everyday dictionary it was the most practical thing i could think of for them understand certain muggle only words half the words they would know everyday language like cat or desk but things like telephone or pencil were perhaps unknown territory there was no need to try and use wizarding textbooks on muggles i had seen a few left over by my predecessor all they had done was go over the theories of how certain machines worked an idea that proved useless because these students had no history of learning the theories for the machines it didnthelp to know why a telephone worked they were never going to have to make one from scratch they just needed to know how to use one what it looked like that they werent supposed to expect to see the person face on the surface your homework immediately groans rose up from the class first class with me and already i gave them homework i just a great person your homework will be to go through the listings for a through h i want you to write down all the words you dontknow you will be going through the entire book but i didntwant to kill you the first week and donttry and cheat on this i will be testing you on any words i dontsee circled so just randomly circling things wonthelp you too much there were measuring glances of the book sitting in front of them i dont think they thought i was too kind to just give them a through h after all one third of the book was still almost 300 pages but a good part of that would be things they would know i didntspare a single moment for guilt i was determined to leave hogwarts after giving the students a bit more hope of surviving around muggles any questions in fact other then the one hufflepuff answering my question the entire class had been rather quiet a lanky red haired girl from gryffindor stretched rather comfortably in her chair in the first row stuck her hand into the air yes your name chauncey cooper she smiled brightly at me eyes twinkling of all the students she seemed the least concerned with how things were going i wondered do you think that the run of muggle murders that have been happening have any connection with the dark mark appearing i leaned on the desk my arms crossed in front of me judging the girl sitting so nonchalantly in front of me her eyes werenttwinkling anymore instead they were considering and a bit serious she appeared to believe there was a connection and was waiting to see what i was going to say well i could either tell the truth or do the appropriate teacher thing of sweeping it under the rug severus would have told her to shut up thankfully i not at his level just yet well i wasntaware that there was a run of muggle murders i rose an eyebrow at that muggles have a tendency to kill each other quite often for silly things like love money power i sure that wizards have done as much certain ones in particular quiet met that statement all of them even with their young age would have heard of voldemort and what he and his followers had done but like so many young people living in times of relative peace that information did not concern them well there have been some curious deaths of muggles chauncey continued to speak apparently not wanting me to wiggle out of the question with some of my own well miss cooper you want my own personal opinion as a muggle involved in the wizarding world she shook her head eagerly well my personal opinion is that yes the events are connected that the dark mark was obviously put up by wizard or wizards unknown and that the same people killed muggles whether this was done with a purpose or just to scare your community i dontknow the fact is that the muggles dontcare since as i said we have death all the time and it unlikely any muggles will consider magic a factor so if the aim is to frighten you all well then the best thing for you all to do is not be scared i stood up straight and that means doing your homework on time and with as much ability as you possess now anymore questions no one raised their hand this time and chauncey in the front row seemed adequately appeased by my answer i set them to starting their homework for the rest of the period and i along with all of them seemed rather thrilled when the class was over i stopped miss cooper from leaving though calling her over to my desk is there a reason you were so interested in the muggle deaths her blue eyes shined at me and she smiled brightly i adore any and everything to do with muggles professor my parents think i odd but i dontcare i just have always loved everything to do with their i mean your world i ve even taken out subscriptions to loads of muggle papers my eyes widened at this so this girl at least hadnttaken this class as an easy elective no wonder she hadntlook displeased with my presence or the homework she was actually enthused that the teacher was a muggle you re rather bright arentyou i smiled slightly most of the adults here dontbelieve there is a connection at all she snorted at that poppycock oh sorry ma am this amused me so much that i laughed i had students swear at me at my other job in the us to hear a student say something as tame as poppycock and act so contrite about that was the funniest thing ever it just that they dontread the muggle papers like i do so they dontrealize that these deaths are odd even for muggles her face was bright red well you should head off to your next class miss cooper i patted her on the back if you can do me a favour while you re reading your muggle papers can you continue to keep an eye out for anything odd let me know when you see anything the red hair bounced enthusiastically in acquiescence before she practically bounced out of the room i spared a moment to wonder if harry would be unhappy with me telling a class that i thought muggle deaths were connected to wizards even more importantly would mcgonagall become displeased with me death glares from that woman i afraid would actually kill me in the end though i was okay with what i had said there was no point in hiding the truth from students i wasntgoing to be stupid enough to say voldemort was alive that would get me kicked out of the school or that there was a horcrux here that would get harry so riled up i wouldntwant to be alive to see it but there was no point trying to pretend the dark mark appearing was a joke the kids werentstupid after all a n well i absolutely adore the new ability to reply to reviews so everyone who reviews i shall happily respond to even the bad ones though i of course will not be mean all reviews are good ones i hope everyone had a lovely thanksgiving and hopefully you didntspend too much time out with the hordes shopping heh enjoy the new chapter and please review i love reading them and it just such a nice thing to do little presents for me chapter 32 when the weekend finally came the students and likely the teachers were ready for the break from each other though all of us had plenty of work we should have been doing the students their homework and the teachers their corrections and lesson plans suffice it to say that most of the students werentreally paying attention to what they needed to do not to mention some of the teachers werenteither sirius do you plan on working at all the two of us were searching some of the upper level corridors in search of any sort of hiding place i was fine i had already set my lesson plans for a few weeks in advance and i had no papers to correct yet i ll have you know that i finished everything i needed to i snorted deciding that in all likelihood he had not given any homework or tests to the students therefore making him free from any real work to do the man had a talent for getting by with as little effort as possible still he amused the students enough that they were seeming to like him not to mention his lack of school work to do left him free to chase after what we were really here for at the moment he was peering behind a peculiar picture of a nurse dancing with an ogre who happened to be wearing a rather formal tuxedo the woman seemed rather outraged that sirius would be so rude as to look behind her painting it was rather shocking some of the things coming out of her mouth i had to hurry the students along the hall telling them that professor black and i were just doing some regular inspections and that they should never remember anything they heard coming from the portrait a flash of black and blonde caught my eye once again and i saw cain montgomery heading down another hallway throwing an apology over my shoulder to sirius i ran to catch up with the young boy mr montgomery can i have a word with you professor mackinnion what do you need with me i not in your class i dontknow what i had been expecting perhaps a new little malfoy draco 2 0 likely a snarky reply a sneer a well timed roll of the eyes maybe instead he seemed rather different there was no overwhelming confidence no image ruling the world no sneer not even a smile his voice was soft his eyes avoiding my own i dontthink i need a reason to speak to you you donteven have to be in my class it the privileges of being a teacher i put my hand on his shoulder and steered him down the stairs level by level until we came to the third floor and my own office truth be known i didntreally like spending too much time in the office there really wasntmuch i could do to decorate the place not like i had easy access to stores or magic to conjure things instead it was still filled with the things the old teacher had left behind a telephone a wide array of spoons plenty of used pencils all with their tips broken strangely the teacher seemed to have never discovered pencil sharpeners and a particularly old bicycle i didntthink i would be able to do a class on bicycles this one was so old i dontthink i had any chance of riding it professor i was on my way to the library to study i winced immediately studying in the library on a weekend that was so unnatural granted it was good that he was learning but it just seemed so vastly pathetic it was true that i had never seen the boy speaking to anyone but there still had to be some people in his house who he had become friendly with over the last week no one can shut themselves out completely mr montgomery i commend the studious attitude you have but this is important now the only thing was how to word this the young blonde boy had sat down in a chair across from my desk and i took my appropriate place behind the desk he didntseem particularly nervous despite being called into a teacher office for no real reason aside from his avoidance of direct eye contact he was otherwise calm with his already odd behaviour i had been expecting some twitching or fidgeting at least are you going to ask about my father well that solved the problem of having to ask the question actually it was part of my thought process yes i tilted my head in confusion he knew i had wanted to ask about his father being a death eater other people must have asked already and yet he didntlook the least bit perturbed or depressed it was like someone was asking him the time i dontdiscuss my father with people even teachers there was little emotion in that response i was beginning to wonder if aside from magic if perhaps human like robots existed as well that fine i am certainly not going to be the one to talk you into spilling your history to me i just a bit concerned about you i haventseen you speak to anyone you said you were going to spend your weekend in the library i just thought i d let you know that you could talk to me if you so wished or severus i paused perhaps severus wouldntbe thrilled at me offering him up as a guidance counselor but since he was there head of house i didnt really worry too much there was no lie in my being concerned over the boy i certainly was concerned i was just neglecting to tell him that i also wanted to keep an eye on him since his behaviour was a little odder then the norm for an eleven year old boy thank you professor i ll keep that in mind can i be excused now there was no way to know if he was happy or not with my offer i nodded and he quickly left the room really i had dragged the boy down here on a whim after noticing him quite a few times i felt it about time to actually speak to him of course i hadntrealized i would pretty much be the only one talking he was as untalkative as a teenager so he had a good head start there hopefully though he would at some point choose to talk to me or severus after all i had basically adopted slytherin as my house and if nothing else he was a slytherin while there were plenty of circumstantial evidence against him i was optimistic that slytherins were not always the enemy just played them on tv you offer to help me look for sirius voice dipped as some sixth year students ran by us the horcrux but then you just run off sometimes i wonder if you even want to find it he should have judged by the hands placed on the hips the narrowed eyes and the general aura of malcontent that he should have stopped there sirius though if nothing is a very brave man or perhaps you dontwant to find it because you want to spend more time with me one of sirius weak points is this one spot on his left side just under his rib cage if hit just right then it pretty much just brings him to his knees it an entirely useful thing to know especially during situations like this where he really deserves it you really were asking for that i tapped my foot on the ground waiting for sirius to stand up straight again there was something that i was asking for sort of similar to that in terms of loss of breath just without clothing so have you found it yet i chose to ignore his little joke my foot tapping faster i looking for the last remaining horcrux of the dark lord and you expect me to have found it in the short time you were gone i was just glad that he was speaking softly after all we didntneed the entire school to know what we were doing what it looked like was suspicious enough it looked like we were searching for something after all sirius there has to be something you remember some place your brother would have hidden things i sighed tired of all of this already sirius responded with a sigh as well leaning against the stone wall his body tense his appearance was one of somebody who looked exhausted as if he had been put through the ringer more then a few times perhaps i shouldntpush him after all this must have been hard for him asking simple questions wasntgoing to make him remember anything this must be particularly hard for him after all it did have to do with his dead brother the one that he thought he had failed across from me a sudden light seemed to go off in his head because sirius had pushed away from the wall looking like he finally had remembered something i need you to go talk to snivellus severus i frowned the reply coming out without me even thinking about it i wasntsure where he was going with this what did severus have to do with the horcrux he better not be suggesting that he was in with lord voldemort again whatever i need you to get in on his good side and maybe he ll tell you something that will help me find the place my brother hid the horcrux all right then that made a little bit of sense regulus had been a slytherin and so was severus how is severus going to know anything about it other then both being slytherins he evil he in with the bad guys of course he ll know sirius waved his hand at this making it seem that what he had said was so completely obvious to anyone with any brains really the man just could not think well of severus for the rest of eternity he was going to hate the man completely he reformed i muttered whatever reformed right anyway he might know of some slytherin hiding places you know i can look everywhere in this damn castle but one place the slytherin rooms are off limits to me why dont you go ask him not that i expected any sort of civil conversations between the two but there was really no harm in trying to help mend the bridge between the two okay maybe there was a harm after all they could hex each other to eternity actually that certainly was a likelihood of course snivellus do you know any places one of your master servants would have hidden something i dontwant to ruin any of their plans but i thought it d be nice to hide something as well my old coinbank needs a safe place that ll be easy i said he reformed my patience with the dark haired man pacing in front of me was wearing thin i wondered if he was this annoying as a dog somehow i doubted it too bad he couldntjust go around in his canine form whatever it appeared he wasntactually paying attention to anything that i said not that i should have been surprised whenever it had to do with professor snape he came across as deaf to anything to went against his won opinions the idea of severus being reformed was so way out there for him that what i said was just not getting through to him but it said something for how desperate he was that he was willing to ask for help from the man he hated even if it was through me and not personally and regulus wasnta servant if he stole something as important as the horcrux i said going back to his suggested opening line to severus i know that but i was just saying what it would sound like to snape he thinks that regulus was the dark lord servant so that was slightly obvious i hadnttold sirius that severus had suggested that exact thing that regulus had stolen the horcrux to preserve his lord life if that had been true it certainly had worked the dark wizard was still alive because no one had known that there was an eighth horcrux or where it was sirius didntneed to think about that though it was far better to just believe that he had been doing right by stealing and hiding it you speaking to him will likely sound like a braying donkey i joked smiling slightly at the twitch that appeared on sirius temple are you saying that i sound like a donkey he moved closer to me making me take a step back no i saying that severus will find you annoying and your voice will therefore transform into a farm animal to him but yours won t he sounded skeptical and slightly amused by the whole conversation didnt say that but more likely i ll be something cute like a baby chicken i shrugged fluttering my eyelashes innocently why are we talking about farm animals i have no idea sirius dear i shrugged again deciding not to mention that he had asked the question the man wasntoverly fond of being the root of problems or at least being told that he was you need to talk to him you re the best chance of getting him to talk no attractive woman would like him i sure even the idea of a woman speaking to him will give old snivellus the jollies for a month he snorted but then looked absolutely disgusted that he had suggested anything sexual about the potions master putting aside the fact you just said the jollies severus is not that desperate he has no problems with women i sure i smirked slightly unlike sirius i had no problems thinking about severus and perverted things and it was fairly amusing that sirius had used a word like jollies wait a second sirius knew that i was attracted to severus which meant that he had just insulted me as well sirius snorted he attractive in a certain way i narrowed my eyes at the dark haired gryfindor in a girls would rather gouge out their own eyeballs sort of way i guess he was smiling openly now knowingly trying to piss me off cantsay that it didntwork you re an arrogant bastard just because all the girl students have crushes on you i huffed are you jealous darling now it was his turn to flutter his eyelashes innocently innocent on sirius strangely works the mere idea makes me want to throw up we re getting off topic now i muttered softly even though there was a small ring of truth to it i didntlike the fact that all the girls liked him the mere sight of me makes you want to strip me naked i snorted at that stupid comment of his it wasntthe mere sight but anyway make nice with him sirius i already make nice with him you ve forgotten that i try and talk to him all the time why is that by the way i happen to like the man i told you this already my arms were now crossed over my chest hopefully he would drop this line of conversation normally looking like hell frozen over would shut any sensible man up but apparently the animagus was not so sensible since he just continued on yes you did mention that but whatever for he not as attractive as i am he said this was supreme confidence the man certainly knew that women found him attractive it an intellectual thing honey you wouldntunderstand i smiled slightly reaching out a hand to pat his cheek softly it was something an older woman would have done to their grandchild after being asked if santa existed i am not stupid he muttered softly crossing his own arms and looking rather like a sulky grandchild actually never said you were it just my reasons for liking severus are intellectual you just cantunderstand someone liking someone else for reasons other then the physical for sirius everything was physical he liked me because i was attractive not that it was the only reason i sure if i asked him he d likely come up with half a dozen other reasons but when you came right down to it how i looked had been the initial reason and the one that was the most important everything for the man was physical how he dealt with people problems if he had a fight with someone it would be with blows not words that just a nauseating idea i blinked up at him in confusion i didntsay anything disgusting the idea of anyone liking snape he shuddered dramatically you re an ass i dontthink i want to even help you with this you can go ask severus yourself i turned and started to walk away from the infuriating man there was no way i was going to stay and argue severus attractiveness or my own attraction to the man honestly sometimes even speaking to sirius was like going to the dentist for a root canal before i got very far though sirius had caught up and grabbed my arm successfully stopping my progress fine fine severus snape is one fine piece of ass that any girl would be lucky to get he paused a particular tinge of green on his face i think i going to be sick i think i might as well after hearing you say that strange normally i love the idea of two attractive men together but that one i think is going to haunt my nightmares i raised my hands into the air trying to physically stop the images from entering my mind i ll help you if you promise never to say anything like that again you donthave to ask twice just see if you can get him to talk about places where a slytherin student would hide things my brother after all spent most of his time down there i ll try everywhere else i ll go over everything twice even with a fine toothed comb but i dontthink it will help he was a slytherin if it not down there it isntat hogwarts the look on sirius face was unhappy like he wasnttoo pleased that it couldntbe him to find the horcrux he looked less then thrilled at having severus help he looked practically depressed that regulus hadnttold him what he was planning on doing so the plan is for me to seduce severus and i threw this out there since i knew something like this would snap sirius out of his sulk getting the man angry is the fastest way to cheer him up well that or offer to sleep with him i wasntthat desperate yet no one said anything about seducing well i figured if i was there i might as well have some fun that really not funny the grey eyes were hard and he looked rather serious at that moment but sirius dontworry i still find you drop dead gorgeous i laughed softly patting his arm comfortingly but you wontsleep with me but you will with old snake skin this little joke had taken a rather serious turn his skin is not scaly defending the man certainly did come naturally and i said nothing about sleeping with him seducing doesnt necessarily mean nudity it was typical of sirius that if i said seduce to him that meant have sex he apparently didntwatch american television we re quite good at suggesting things without actually doing them the fun kind does he was pouting again that is why i would never sleep with you sirius your mind is far too centered on the act of sex afterwards i get the feeling i d be forgotten about i sighed now it was me who was practically sulking i wouldntforget about you you re special his eyes had widened at my comment looking surprised that i would even suggest anything as crude as that probably the only muggle you d have slept with that special sure i snorted of course not i ve slept with tons of muggle women men sometimes dontrealize when they ve said something that has dug their hole even deeper sirius being a man is exactly like that he had just dug his hole all the way to china with that one little statement if there anything a girl loves to hear it that the bloke has slept with tons of women really we love that my silence apparently clued sirius in on the mistake he had just made because his mouth opened and he tried to work it for a few moments but nothing right came out he looked like a fish out of water okay so maybe not the best thing to say but do you really think that sleeping with snape would end any differently then you think it would with me not really a good apology all he had basically done was try and redirect my anger toward someone else in this case severus strange that the two of you would have something in common you d both drop me soon after the act was finished for you the fun part would be over and severus would likely kill me for making him do something he never had wanted to do in the first place not that i had thought about this all that much it just that i knew both their personalities pretty well by now for sirius sex was fun for severus well it didnthappen that often he didntreally like me too much anyway so if something did happen it would likely end with him cursing me to oblivion for making him do something he hated really my confidence had taken a severe blow since coming to this school i telling you i wouldntforget about you sirius huffed well we re not going to find out one way or the other so oh well i shall try my hardest to find out where regulus could have hidden this horcrux i shook my head annoyed that i had let the conversation go so completely off topic in fact why donti just go talk to severus right now about this i started to stalk off again but sirius hand on my arm stopped me again dont do anything stupid his voice was soft gentle even the only stupid thing i could do would be to actually believe you i growled out pulling my arm away from him and angrily walking off down the hallway sometimes i really let certain things get to me sirius it seems was something that always got to me there had been no real reason to get angry with sirius i should know his personality well enough by now to know he hadntreally meant harm by anything he had said it was just starting to get frustrating it difficult knowing that you like two men but you cantdo anything about it and in the case of sirius at least the feeling was mutual but outside interferences had to be taken into account he had the horcrux to find and i wasnteven sure how i really felt about him aside from physical attraction not to mention he wasntreally a long term sort of person i found myself down in the dungeons without even having thought of it it was a weekend so there was no reason for severus to be in his classroom but that probably wouldnthave stopped him thinking of him sitting in his own room relaxing was a little difficult to comprehend it was an amusing picture though severus wearing a smoking jacket in front of his fire drinking scotch so i tried his classroom first and as i thought he was sitting behind his desk doing some work of some sort i was still rather angry so i slammed the door behind me as i entered the room causing him to look up an annoyed expression on his face at the disruption when he saw it was me though his expression softened a bit a curious look replacing the annoyance what wrong his cold voice asked the question with no hint of any emotion but for some reason i felt the compelling need to tell him what had happened sirius is a bloody git i muttered thinking that the insult wasnt really strong enough but in my tempers thinking isntreally a strong suit of mine he thinks that just because i attracted to him and vice versa that we should immediately hop into bed together severus had put down the quill he had been writing with standing up and coming around the desk to stand in front of me he looked annoyed again but when one is mentioning sirius around him that is to be expected anything else he angry with me as well because i like you i huffed glaring to my side at a cabinet filled with potions ingredients if sirius had been in the room i likely would have kicked him so the canine has problems with you speaking to other men there was a trace amount of amusement in severus voice i snorted at that if only that was the case no he has a problem with me speaking to you he hates you he hates you and he hates that i like you so according to black you canthave friends one black eyebrow rose in question no i sighed softly he doesntlike that i attracted to you that the problem while i dontthink he likes that i consider us friend that he can deal with it the fact that you re competition for him that irks him i shrugged both eyebrows were raised at this comment a startled look in his eyes severus looked more then slightly surprised i started to wonder if i needed to be a bit more obvious with men in the future i suppose telling them outright is really the only way to assure that they know you like them it looked like severus really had no clue other then that i chose to speak to him his rather pale appearance seemed to have gotten worse before a very light blush crossed his cheeks well it quite nice to know i can make a man like severus blush a bit he thinks you re evil that you re scaly that you re a horrible person who ll sell us all out i grew angry even thinking about it it one thing to hold a grudge against the man but he should have believed in me since i trusted him do you think he right severus voice was quiet silky even of course not i muttered angrily shaking my head vehemently sirius is just coming up with any excuse to hate you he was even going on about me getting hurt if i got involved with you as if he should talk it would end badly with him as well while i had been talking severus had moved closer to me until he was standing only a few inches in front of me cool hands came up to my cheeks and i blinked up at the man in confusion before i could say anything though his lips descended upon mine now severus is normally described as cold icy frozen really everything he does is deliberate determined and smooth so i had expected the kiss to be quick cold and relatively unfeeling i was surprised though when the warm lips smoothed over mine in a gentle and warm way the kiss wasntas impassioned as sirius had been it wasntas needy and hot instead it was rather soothing and with it i felt my anger fly out the window he pulled back a small smirk on his lips it really was a slytherin trait that you told me that the first kiss wasnta real one he turned and walked back around his desk leaving me staring at him in utter disbelief that he had done that at all for a moment i wondered if i should jump on him and show him exactly what i meant by a real kiss but i didntthink i should push my luck really well there went my whole dontflirt with the boys idea you know i licked my lips as i did that i saw severus eyes flick down to my mouth before returning to my eyes well he wasnt completely ice cold then making out with you wasntthe reason i came down here or even to rant about sirius the silky eyebrow rose again we need to find the horcrux that regulus stole sirius is looking everywhere he can but when it comes right down to it his brother was a slytherin he doesntknow anything about the slytherin rooms you though are a slytherin as well can you help us out i pleaded softly knowing fully well that a request like this was a lot to ask severus in general he didntreally want to help people out i already looking for ways to help you disconnect from black and keeping an eye on the montgomery boy now you want me to tear about the slytherin areas to find a horcrux you re not even sure is here because sirius cantdo it himself i know you dontwant to help sirius think of it then as helping to get rid of voldemort after all you ll never get rid of that mark until he gone i gestured to his left arm and he placed a hand over the place where the mark was the wound on my own left arm was starting to twinge a bit you could always do it for me i joked fine my eyes widened really despite my good arguments i didntthink he was going to agree at least not this fast actually i thought i was going to have to blackmail him again thank you sevvie i smiled brightly running around the desk and jumping on him to give him a crushing hug he was startled by it but quickly pulled me off him a displeased look on his face i though was still smiling up at him i reached up pulled his head down and planted a rather sloppy kiss on his lips you re the best sevvie he moved a step away from me a little fearful that i was going to do anything else to him he ran a hand through his hair making sure it wasntmussed up and tugging on his robes dont call me sevvie it severus or professor snape well at least you re giving me a choice now i winked at him now i shall return to the search with sirius really he ll be happy you agreed thinking that makes me want to take it back now severus muttered sitting down again i laughed not worried at all once he agreed to do something he would do it honour really was important to the man so he wasntgoing to go back on his word i ll see you around severus i waved and ran out of the classroom newly energized to deal with sirius and look for the horcrux a n i love the reply to review option so be assured if you write a review i shall reply with thanks whether the review is good or bad now read and enjoy the new chapter and do i have to keep saying this please review pleeeeeeeeeeeease chapter 33 we didntexpect to find the horcrux and as we expected our search of the castle that weekend came up with nothing the lack of results made sirius rather a surly person to be around after all it meant that he wasnteven going to be the one to find the horcrux not to mention that it rested on severus shoulders a place sirius never wanted to rest anything i was optimistic about our chances of finding the horcrux now that we had severus helping as well not surprising though sirius was not as optimistic about our chances in fact he thought adding severus help was going to worsen our likelihood of finding the dark lord life line it was rather amusing though that he thought this now since it actually had been his idea to get the potions master involved his mind had been changed though likely from my enthusiasm for severus helping us out the man was positively green with jealousy sometimes severus help was something that i atleast wanted but it worried me occasionally that i was putting too much on his shoulders he was helping me find a way to break my connection he was keeping an eye on cain and now he was searching the slytherin area for the horcrux so i was determined to deal with the first issue as much as possible which meant vast amounts of time spent in the library while not in class a sudden visit though interrupted that vast amount of time hermione i had opened the door to my rooms when a knock broke my attention away from the book i had been perusing it wasntlike i was missing much though the book was pretty much a dead end street though i now knew particularly well how to charm a tree into changing colours well if i knew how to do magic then i would be sure to make a purple tree i not disturbing you am i hermione asked the question sincerely waiting to be invited in it made a rather nice change to have someone actually wait for me to let them in instead of sweeping in like draco and severus no no i was just doing a little reading i paused recalling that i wasntsupposed to let hermione know too much about what was going on harry was very protective of his friends especially hermione and ron after they had just had their second child in fact he might not even like that she had even come to visit me perhaps i should have changed my story said that she was disturbing me but it was nice to have someone visit me the young woman entered my room when i stood back from the door offering her a place to sit on the couch while she got comfortable i started to rack my brain to figure out what possible reason she could have to visit me to visit sirius would be expected but she had only met me once perhaps i was starting to become suspicious and paranoid around here but i couldnthelp but think that hermione granger was here for a reason that was likely not to do with how my classes were going so how are your classes going okay so maybe i was paranoid rather well actually despite everyone worries so far no student has turned me into a chicken my offer of tea was turned down by my impromptu visitor so i settled in on the armchair by the fire waiting for her to let me know what was going on well that good being turned into a chicken is never a pleasant feeling i somehow find it hard to believe that you would have ever allowed anyone to do that to you a soft laugh came from the young woman of course not ron was the one who got turned into a chicken his brother fred decided that his squawking was better suited to a bird then a human i have to say though he did make a rather adorable red feathered chicken the image that entered my mind made me laugh along with her after all picturing a large red squawking bird running around like it had just it proverbial head cut off was rather amusing i doubted that it was actually a human sized bird but that just made it more amusing in my head thankfully i haventhad that pleasure yet poor ron though you of course transformed him back immediately didntyou of course she paused looking innocent pretty much of course i smirked slightly so how are you and sirius getting along that was a loaded question if ever i heard one i regarded the brown haired girl sitting so innocently across from me there was a tilt to her lips an amused look in her eyes so it was likely that she was at least partially aware of certain things between sirius and me if this was the reason she was visiting me then i have to say that i was relieved my romantic entanglements or lack thereof were certainly easier to deal with the deflecting questions about sirius miraculous recovery voldemort return or any muggle deaths not that i wanted to talk about my personal life either we get along fine my eyes were narrowed at the woman showing my displeasure at having her get involved with my business i ve been staying in contact with sirius apparently she ignored my discomfort with this line of questioning she brought her head up looking me directly in the eyes her own gaze clear and direct that good i sure he says we re getting along fine as well i said it with forced assurance actually there was a possibility he said other things entirely things including his possible feelings for me and mine for him they might not have all been kind either he had accused me in the past of playing with him perhaps he had told hermione this perhaps this was why the young woman was visiting me now he wounded you know it was a sudden comment strange and it caused me to dig my nails into the wood of the chair hard she didntmean physically of course i knew that he was wounded that he was a broken man on the inside he did well to hide it around people if you didntknow better you would think him a simple playboy the only ideas in his head how to get into trouble and not get caught doing it and to be sure those were parts of his personality but the thing outweighing everything else was the complete and utter despair that hung over him sure he smiled flirted laughed and it covered it all up but anyone who knew him even me in the short time i had known him could tell his time in azkaban the deaths of all those closest to him and his own trip beyond the veil had shattered him inside it was going to be a task for those that cared about him to put the pieces together again the look i was getting from hermione the question in her eyes indicated that she thought me up to the task as far as i thought though i lacked the moral fibre to really accomplish it when i looked away from her unsure of the answer to her silent question she sighed softly ever since i met him he was like a wounded dog sure he kept barking and putting up a fight but it was all just quickening his death he was harry godfather so he was important to him and through that he was important to me but aside from that he was a good man a proud and brave person who i grew to know the summer before my fifth year and then he died and we all mourned but he alive again given a second chance by you my eyes snapped back to her face immediately looking to see what she meant by that there was no doubt that she knew the truth but she ignored my surprised expression going on he cares about you and when i saw him with you it was probably the closest i saw to the wound healing i not asking for anything just dontreopen the wound please i like sirius but i am not going to get into a relationship with him not because you want me to be his therapist and piece him back together again and anyway i have rather a few problems when it comes to love a brown eyebrow rose in question at me well sirius isntthe only person i ve grown close to here at hogwarts i didntknow why but i felt a pale blush across my cheeks professor snape right hermione shook her head a confused look on her face dont you start too he not that bad of a person i get enough of the he evil talk from sirius no no i wontsay that i know that professor snape is really a good person just really deep down really deep she shrugged slightly it just a bit hard for me since he did make my school years rather hard it difficult to see him as a man cant say i ever had that problem this little comment caused hermione to gag across from me a shudder going through her it was fairly obvious whose side she was on well i didntcome here to tell you who you should have sex with i grinned filling in the blank i was going to say date she was now blushing brightly well i am 29 years old at my age it tends to be more of a question of sex then going steady i had pity upon her and changed the subject so why did you visit me if it wasntabout my sexual habits with sirius and severus i had pity but i still liked to tease people it about that break in to nyu immediately her manner was efficient and businesslike my own changed to match her the teacher sliding into place listening i work in the muggle affairs department i keep an eye on situations make sure wizards arentdoing anything to the muggles so i have of course been keeping a firm eye on odd things and that break in counted now the ministry does admit that it was wizards who did it a heavy weight lifted off my heart glad to see a spark of responsibility being shown at the ministry their disregard for it earlier had caused me plenty of sleepless nights wondering about what had happened who of my own colleagues had suffered at the hands of a dark wizard but they refuse to see something vital that the attack had the stamp of voldemort all over it hermione took my sharp intake of breath to mean my own surprise at hearing the dark lord name not to worry of course he gone harry dealt with him as i sure you know from those horrid books but i concerned that someone else might be trying to do what he had done so certain secrets were safe still for a moment i considered telling her that the truth was that he was alive that the deals didnt have the stamp of voldemort on them because of a copy cat but the real deal my choice was made though by the fact that telling severus had gotten be in a bit of trouble but telling hermione would have likely gotten me killed my harry or as good as do you know who died i took this chance to find out exactly who had died at my school i would have thought someone would have told you she looked puzzled well sirius didntknow and as for severus and draco well they werentoverly concerned with the names of dead muggles i muttered softly shaking my head at the habit of most slytherins to disregard muggles there were three killed a simon lucas matthew caulder and a tricia lindwold she listed off the names with great concern watching me carefully to see my reaction there wasntmuch to distinguish who was who apparently i knew that well enough images of cairn or what was left of him flashed in front of my mind eye torn flesh blood every where just the memory caused bile to rise in my throat the look of nausea on my face gave hermione the wrong impression she took my discomfort the pain on my face to indicate that i had known or cared for the names she had listed she was right though i knew them all simon lucas had been campus security and tricia lindwold was a fellow history professor then there was matt caulder i should have felt something from his death he had been my boss but he had also been a thorn in my side it was always sad when someone you know dies but when people pretend to care well i hated when people lied to themselves and others when people they didntlike died i of course didntwant the man dead but i wasntgoing to cry why to the world but my distress over memories of cairn gave a good enough impression of depression over the deaths at nyu i sorry hermione reached out a hand to place warmly over my own comforting thank you i slid my hand out from beneath hers giving a small smile she knew nothing of how cairn had died i wasntsure even if she had known him at all so there was no way i could explain why i had looked pained why i had been sad i have to say i find it a little odd that you come into the wizarding world as a teacher here and then your old school gets broken into and people killed by dark wizards the comforting girl was gone and in her stead was the smart perceptive young woman this woman knew well enough that coincidences were not likely to be the answer here this was one of the smartest witches of her age or any age i took a deep breath preparing my story figuring out the looks to give do you do you think that it my fault that they died it was the university i worked at after all my hand came up to my mouth in horror were they looking for me and killed them because they were angry that they couldntfind me were all their deaths because of me so maybe i was laying it on a bit thick with the surprise and dismay but it was believable because there was truth in it i did think it was my fault that those three people had been killed there was no way that it was a coincidence that voldemort had broken into nyu it had been to do with me so the horror was true and real of course it wasntyour fault hermione said her voice suddenly loud it possible though that you might be connected i dontsee why i shook my head trying very hard to look the innocent how did you bring sirius back to life the question was expected but still sudden with the asking hermione you should know there are always reasons that secrets are kept i didntwant to lie to her try and blind side her with confusing arguments or reasoning on the other hand i could not tell her the truth as far as i was concerned she was already walking a dangerous line getting to close to what was going on and harry wanted to keep her safe for the sake of her children she didntseem too pleased with my silence on the matter so hermione harry told me you have two children what are their names a change of subject might clear the air and in my own experience asking mothers about their children always helped matters especially when they were rather new parents faith and remus hermione smiled fondly thinking of her own children remus i blinked a slow smile appearing on my face sirius must have been thrilled to hear that she nodded he was a great teacher and he became our friend hermione sighed a sad smile now on her face but yes sirius was rather taken aback when he heard we had named our boy remus he would deny it but there had likely been tears in his eyes remus lupin had been his last link to his happy school days peter had betrayed him lily and james had been killed all he had left was remus when he had died it had been knowing that at least remus was alive so to be brought back and find that his last friend was gone now it had destroyed sirius opened that wound wider it was probably a good thing i didnttell him little remy middle name hermione chuckled softly you gave him sirius name as well didntyou i smiled fondly at the woman she smiled brightly nodding at my question my little boy full name is remus sirius weasley it was an interesting name sounded a bit odd really but it was such a beautiful thought really it was the greatest honour to give those two people he would have had a fit i laughed imagining what sirius would have done likely he would have blushed then joked it off and probably been holding back the urge to cry in the end he probably would have crushed hermione to him with a large hug close enough to one thought i might have to resuscitate him not sure ron would have appreciated that there was a small smirk on her lips not sure i would have appreciated that either you re not going to tell me how you did it are you she was all seriousness once more no too much was at risk for her and hearing about her two children made me more adamant about following harry wishes well it my job to keep an eye on things so i wontgive up about this she narrowed her eyes at me and i knew quite well that she wasntexaggerating anything i ll let you know if anything else comes up about the break in she stood up to take her leave was anything stolen she paused at the doorway turning to look at me carefully one office looked like it had been turned upside down there was no need to ask whose office had been searched stolen from i racked my brain to try and remember if there had been anything in my office to warrant a search anything i would be worried about being found nothing came to mind be careful hermione you need to take care of your kids dontdig too deep in any of this copy cats can still be as dangerous as the original the smile she gave me was rather fond making me relieved that she wasnt holding a grudge against me for not telling her everything she left then and i sat back down thinking hard was there really any reason for voldemort and his followers to break into nyu to kill people or search my office sure i had brought sirius back to life but what could that matter to powerful wizards i could see them trying to kill sirius but the person who brought him back to life there was no reasoning there and searching my office i had nothing important there merely some papers old artifacts and my awards from the boys stating me as the sexiest teacher maybe voldemort wanted to feel sexy and stole those irma i know i ve pretty much gone through all the books in here but do you have any idea what else might work a week after hermione visit and i was trying desperately to break my connection to sirius his job was to find the horcrux and i had even managed to get him severus help as well my job though was to solve this problem after the visit from hermione i wanted to get out of here the break in had been deliberate and i was involved as little as i may have known the people who had died it had been my fault their families were now grieving despite matt shortcomings he must have parents somewhere crying over their loss so now i wanted to get out of this situation perhaps it was dangerous of me to want to go back home but i doubted that i would be involved once i was out of this place it was selfish enough but as far as i figured i had helped out enough i had brought sirius back to life the question i asked madam pince was almost a desperate one and the look the old librarian gave me suggested that she recognized it as such now while i had been looking to madam pince to help me i hadnt actually told her why i needed books on these subjects even though most of the students thought she was just a crazy old bat who hated them which was actually really rather spot on she wasnt stupid at all aine i dontthink the library has any books that will give you the solution to yours and mr black problem i stared at the woman for a few moments before giving a heavy sigh am i that obvious does everyone in this school know now i told severus and the headmistress but everyone else was supposed to not know i shook my head looking earnestly at the woman donttell sirius please he already annoyed with me for giving out secrets too much that was certainly true every once in a while he would bring up me telling severus all the secrets i didntneed him getting on my case for letting madam pince know she didntanswer just waved a hand at me giving a soft huff of annoyance i shouldnthave worried about her she wasntthe type to go telling people all her secrets she was far too private for any of that after a sigh of relief she waved me over to her desk and handed me a large brown leather book i thought you said you had no books that could help the library doesn t she huffed angrily i ve been trying to get mcgonagall to improve the library for years she patted the book in my hands a loving gesture this one is from my own personal library it the closest thing to a solution i think you shall find in any books that i know about good luck i eyed the library which was actually rather full of students studying and doing papers for their classes some of which i didntdoubt were doing papers for my own one fourth year boy gave me a particularly displeased look over the top of his dictionary i dont know why though i had only given his class an essay on pencils and pens and the differences between those and quills wanting detailed descriptions usages and kinds due to the rather sensitive research i was doing and not in small part because of the angry looks i was getting i chose to take the book that irma so thoughtfully had let me borrow back to my own room to look over professor my retreat to my room was halted by the sudden appearance of miss cooper running toward me down the hall her brow was covered in sweat indicating that she had been running for quite a bit apparently to catch up to me she looked almost excited miss cooper is everything all right she stopped in front of me taking a few minutes to breathe in deeply after a few deep breaths she stood up professor you wanted me to tell you if anything interesting happened she held out a paper to me which i took in my hand and unfolded it it was just a normal muggle paper the daily mirror and on the cover was an article on a break in at the british museum in london i looked up from perusing the article to raise an eyebrow at the red headed girl in front of me there are plenty of thieves in the world miss cooper i hate to say it about my kind but we muggles seem to like to steal well you wanted me to tell you anything odd i thought a theft like this would count as odd she blinked looking a little crestfallen at apparently jumping the gun i frowned slightly and looked down at the article again and my suspicious nature reared it ugly head she was right a break in at the british museum was something that was rather odd especially in conjunction with the break in at nyu rather shamefully i was actually hoping this break in was connected to voldemort it was with selfish reasons as well i had no connections to the museum so this had nothing to do with me which would indicate that the nyu break in was a coincidence thank you miss cooper can i keep this paper she nodded there was no indication that she was going to leave waiting for me to give her some praise for the good work miss cooper have you finished doing your potions homework i smirked slightly at the twitch that appeared in her eye i knew for a fact that severus had just laid a heavy load on top of his fifth year students what reason apparently one ravenclaw student had suggested that severus looked like an albino toad when he had mentioned it to me i had almost missed the punishment given over my own laughter immediately chauncey ran off down the hallway and i turned and made my way back to my room ready to try and figure out two problems the pesky connection issue and the possibility of serial break ins committed by death eaters a n well i intended to have this uploaded a few days ago but i was having a problem with the document manager sort of got it fixed so here we have a new chapter enjoy and i shouldnthave to say it every time but please review this story really it would make my christmas you dontwant to ruin christmas do you chapter 34 i absolutely love that kerstan kid my eyes flickered up from the book i was reading or more correctly with sirius in the room the book i was trying to read sirius had perched himself on the edge of the desk in my classroom and was twirling his wand rather lazily over his fingers i wondered briefly at the safety issues of doing that i didntwant to be on the wrong end of him accidentally setting it off were wands like guns if you dropped one did it go off and why do you love kerstan realizing that for the moment at least the book irma had given me would have to wait i shut it and placed it back on the desk smiling grey eyes met my own his lips slanted he just reminds me of someone as he shook his head dark hair flew into his eyes which he pushed back maybe it me imagine it a little me running around the place well luckily for the world you haventstarted to reproduce yet a dramatic sigh slipped past my lips the idea of a little sirius running around was actually frightening the child would cause enough trouble to bring the british to their knees only to have them thank him afterwards though when the image of a little sirius entered my head i couldnthelp but admit to myself that he would be absolutely adorable well we could always work on that the twirling of the wand had stopped and instead sirius had ducked his head in close to me the silver eyes heated it was rather obvious the direction his mind was wandering not to mention the direction his lips were going so you love kerstan because he reminds you of yourself i asked the question at the moment just before sirius lips touched my own causing him to pull away with a heavy sigh i chose to ignore the disappointed look in his eyes it flickered away from hurt to a smile and he was back twirling his wand and smiling at me that must be it he seems so familiar to me though i cantreally place it briefly i wondered if this was a problem with his memory if the boy was sparking some old memory that was slipping from his grasp or if it was just that the boy reminded him in some small way of himself or one of his old friends and he just couldntdecide who it was he does look like you it was true to a certain extent kerstan faust had black hair and his eyes were light at least though i couldntreally remember if they were grey or blue indeed if i were looking for similarities even his nose and chin bore a slight resemblance to sirius it was his happy manner though that really reminded me of sirius not as attractive as me though sirius snorted i chuckled softly as vain a comment as that was it was also true kerstan was a happy boy everyone got a long with him but he was in no way going to be a looker but that was of course not important maybe he your long lost cousin or something the comment had been intended as a joke but sirius eyes darkened considerably and the wand stilled in its motion inwardly i winced most of sirius family had been rather negative with the few exceptions of tonks her mother draco and some of the very distant family i dontthink so sirius slipped off the desk his back turned to me maybe he your son after all you had plenty of opportunity to get some poor woman pregnant i smiled as i said this but there was enough of a bitter sound to the question any sound of jealousy in my voice always immediately perked sirius up it was like proof that his flirtations were working on me when he turned around he was smiling brightly you should know well enough that there is no way that i could have produced an eleven year old boy when i was dead unless kerstan is almost twelve and then i would have had do have sirius looked confused staring at his fingers trying to count out the months on his hands to see if it was even possible frustrated he finally gave up dropping his hands down to his side it not important anyway since i didnthave sex with anyone after getting out of azkaban for that matter i hadntwith anyone since before going in i was rather amused that it took him that long to remember such an important factor for having a son you re not playing favourites in your classes are you of course not at my hard look sirius flushed considerably all right so maybe a little in my first year gryffindor class well that would explain how gryffindor was doing so well in the points total or why slytherin seemed to always drop after having sirius class though everything balanced out after a potions class that montgomery kid creeps me out as well he doesntspeak much but when he does it always sounds so obnoxious sirius muttered is he doing anything strange i asked eagerly sirius regarded me curiously why are you so concerned with that boy i pursed my lips thinking about the quiet well mannered boy i didnt want to tell sirius that i had suspicions about him or that his father had likely been a death eater telling him all that would have just resulted in sirius favouritism getting worse on the other hand he had every right to know about anything like this well sirius take into account that this is entirely based off rumours and such but cain well according to what i heard from kerstan it going around the school that cain father was a death eater a few moments passed by without sirius saying anything just regarding me quietly so i continued on not to mention it took a while for him to be sorted but that doesnt really mean much since it took a while for kerstan as well so i just tend to keep an eye on him well he obviously a spy i rolled my eyes at this simple conclusion sirius he an eleven year old boy i highly doubt he spying on anything other then possibly on the gryffindor quidditch team he suspicious even more so now that i told you about his father my brown eyes narrowed on him of course people always are exactly like their parents eh he didntreply to that but snorted so did you come here just to annoy me so i cantdo any reading while also telling me about your new adoration of certain students oh no i wanted to see if you wanted to come to hogsmeade with me this weekend it the students first trip of the year i tapped my fingers on the table thoughtfully watching as sirius shifted from foot to foot under my stare are you asking me on a date sirius no he muttered it just that you ve never been there and while we re there you can play good teacher and keep an eye on the students he paused in his explanation though it can be a date if you want it to be really sometimes the man could be rather adorable especially when he was so obviously nervous i stood up and leaned in to sirius and gave him a quick kiss on the cheek it ll be fun i sure i ve always wanted to see a wizard village but it is certainly not a date even at my refusal of it as a date the smile never left sirius face apparently just the acceptance of the offer was enough for the man not surprising really he probably had asked the question with the assumption that i would automatically turn him down since after all i always protested my liking of him but really i did want to see a wizarding village even though it was certainly not a date that didntmean i wanted anyone to get the wrong idea about it especially certain potion masters though the likelihood of the man caring at all was slim to none he would just be annoyed that it was sirius unluckily for me though the person i was going with happened to be sirius and he was just too proud of himself to keep his mouth shut for too long i hope it ll be a nice weather for our date aine where do you want to go first in hogsmeade we can share butterbeers at the three broomsticks you can feed me chocolate from honeydukes all of these comments from sirius were followed by a kick from me as well as a heated reminder that this was not a date it didnthelp matters either that every time he felt the urge to practically yell about our date it was when severus was nearby the man was really rubbing this in his face sevvie i grinned coming up to his desk in his classroom where he was busy scowling at the students latest attempts at making some sort of potion my greeting somehow managed to make the scowl deepen severus or professor snape not sevvie i waved off the reprimand still rather enjoying the fact that he let me call him severus at all do you want to come to hogsmeade with us today my offer stemmed from a particular need to make sure that the man did not think it was a date between sirius and me i wouldntwant to intrude on your date he sneered that last out it not a date as you are well enough aware of i muttered perching myself on top of one of the student desks you should come with us it would be fun particularly fun to watch black and me on the verge of killing each other is it i pursed my lips unhappily of course there was always that little problem to deal with after all it was entirely naive of me to ever think that the two of them could ever be within a five foot radius of each other and not want to maim and destroy the other well you should still come after all it really the only chance you ll ever get of coming to hogsmeade with me after all you know well enough that i cantgo there without sirius you re under the misconception that i want to go there with you severus kept his eyes down picking up a pile of papers and starting to shuffle through them making many scratches on each paper likely some poor students reports he seemed in a rather foul mood at the moment so their grades were likely going to suffer because of it you know i might have gotten that misconception after you kissed me i muttered now i was annoyed with the man he kept switching back and forth between like and dislike for me one of the good things about sirius is that he at least was open about his feelings he liked me and i knew that he didnttry and hide it or anything now severus on the other hand was completely opposite of that in fact i didntknow if he even liked me a little bit or if he was just humouring my presence i slipped off the hard desk i had been sitting on to make my way out of the classroom when your connection to black is broken you wonthave to have him around to go to hogsmeade i turned and regarded severus with great interest after that comment he wasntlooking at me or anything so i couldntsee the expression on his face he was still focusing entirely on the papers in front of him i smiled brightly though because that was such a severus thing to say never admitting to wanting to do something but getting it across after all sevvie it ll be a date then he looked up eyes widening slightly the only visual show of any shock at hearing what i had said i waved at him and dashed out of the room to go meet sirius he wouldntbe too thrilled if i was late because i had been talking to severus of all people you re late i sighed as i walked up to sirius who had a red and gold scarf wrapped around his neck a heavy black jacket keeping him warm the weather had turned rather cold for this trip with october almost over the weather was starting to frost a bit and as sirius admonished me for being late i could see his breath on the air sirius this is not a date so it shouldntmatter that i late and by the way i only two minutes late he snorted at this but of course didntdispute it since he knew well enough that i was right together the two of us walked down toward the hogsmeade station it was the first time in like two months i had been able to leave the castle really i couldnteven really go round much of the grounds because it pushed the limit of how far i could go away from sirius so how big is this village anyway i had stuffed my hands into the pockets of my jacket a scarf wound round my neck to try and keep the warmth in why exactly are you wearing a slytherin scarf he ignored my question and looked sideways at my scarf ahead of us hogwarts students were walking down to the village as well they all kept looking back at the two of us before whispering really there had to be so many rumours about us amongst the students i needed a scarf to wear it cold out personally i thought it was slightly obvious that it was cold after all the man was wearing a heavy jacket and a scarf of his own but i didntthink it was the fact i was wearing a scarf that had his hackles raised but more the colour of said scarf but slytherin i fingered the tassels on my scarf a slight tilt to my lips indicating my mood i happen to like green and silver you know well enough that it my adopted house anyway this little statement started up a typical argument between the two of us the joys of being in gryffindor versus the slimy nature of all slytherins of course this was an argument all in sirius head since he didntreally let me say anything against his precious house not that i had anything against his house either i just happened to prefer green and silver not to mention i dontthink that gryffindor really needed any more praising after having harry potter in it it had enough people praising it to the roof where did you get the scarf from anyway i considered telling him that i had borrowed it from severus that would have pissed him off to no end i asked mcgonagall for a scarf she gave it to me the first sight of hogsmeade buzzing with energy really made me smile halting our little argument immediately the first sight of the castle had surprised me giving me a sense of awe for this little village though there was no awe but it was filled with so much vigour that it just made me happy everyone else as well if the student bright grins and hurried movement was any judge so what do you think of the place it spectacular i grabbed sirius arm and for the next couple of hours proceeded to pull him along to places i wanted to see i basically acted like a little girl on her first trip into the big city pointing with excitement at things that sirius must have thought were normal enough finally we ended up in the three broomsticks two butterbeers in front of us i was busy humming to myself and playing with a cup that turned into a little bird when i tried to drink from it but then turned back into a cup when i put it down sirius had bought it for me at zonko since i had amused myself with it so much having fun the smile on sirius face was warm i just nodded enthusiastically as i sipped my butterbeer the drink really did grow on you it was something i would certainly miss once i went back home maybe i could arrange with harry to send me some on a regular basis this place is really great it hardly even like a village more like a tourist place never been to a place like this i tilted the bottle back swallowing more of the amber liquid this village was of course home to people like any village would be but walking through out it the feeling was more like an amusement park it was perhaps a little biased on my part since i was visiting on a school visit it couldnt help but feel exciting with the influx of students visiting on a normal day would be interesting so any luck the question asked was quiet but i still couldnthelp the glare that i directed in the gryffindor direction do you really think this is a suitable place to discuss this sirius he sighed dramatically not thinking too much about my cautious nature it fine we wontuse any large words have you figured anything about our problem i tipped the bottle back finishing my butterbeer well actually irma at my use of the librarian first name sirius couldnthelp the laugh that made it way past his lips though at my distinctly displeased look the laugh turned into a hacking cough irma was nice enough to lend me a book to read i haventhad enough time to finish it because you tend to like to interrupt me at this statement sirius had the decency to look a bit ashamed at least it looks promising though i ll likely finish it within the week i had wanted to finish reading the book long ago but work had actually started to pile up on me it was completely my fault of course despite the fact that this job was completely temporary i was giving out homework like it was my normal teaching job every week i had plenty of papers to grade and classes to plan really i perhaps should have lightened my own load to make it easier to do the other things that i had to do but i couldntdrop the ball really when you got right down to it i wanted to make sure that when i left the students at least knew a marginal amount more then when i first arrived the latent psychologist in the back of my head reared itself asking me a question that i had personally been doing a wonderful job of avoiding was i avoiding finishing the book because really i didntwant to break my connection to sirius black of course that entire idea was ridiculous i mentally killed the latent psychologist in my head and smiled reassuringly at sirius who was regarding me with curiousity since i had been quiet for quite awhile so any luck with you of course not sirius snorted softly i not going to find it it annoys me like always but it up to severus to find it despite sirius previous declaration at the safety of discussing such matters in a bar his voice dipped as he spoke so only i could hear what he had to say and even i had to lean forward a bit to do so clearly oh sirius does it really matter who finds it as long as it found sometimes it felt like i was dealing with a grade schooler he huffed crossing his arms over his chest poor little sirius i smirked snaking my arm out and stealing his butterbeer while he was busy sulking hey the mood was light but quicker then a blink of the eye it changed across from me sirius went from jokingly trying to grab back his drink to straightening suddenly his eyes widened with surprise his hand held still over the table he didntmove for quite a while and i was starting to feel rather uneasy sirius is something wrong he slowly straightened all the while his eyes started to dart around the room a sort of panic flowing through him do you do you not feel that his voice cracked as he finally spoke and it felt like i had been waiting an eternity to hear his voice so i jumped slightly as he said the words now that he mentioned it the room felt more enclosed the air seemed tighter and it appeared to have gotten much darker a quick glance at the other people in the room though suggested that we were the only two who felt any change before i could reply to his question sirius had jumped out of his chair and was now tearing out of the bar he slammed open the door and raced out in to the approaching night part of me wanted to stay seated in the warm bar safe from whatever it was that had panicked sirius so suddenly really when you got right down to it i am not exactly a brave person it was one of the reasons the hat didntthink he could sort me into gryffindor in the end though my own worry over the man pushed me out of my seat i quickly set out of the bar ignoring the questioning looks from the remaining people luckily there didntappear to be any students left while we had been drinking night had started to descend upon the village most of the students were back at the castle or were now heading back up i couldntsee sirius around which caused me to panic slightly my head was starting to throb painfully the wound on my arm matching the beat in my head it was the worst that it had hurt since we had arrived at the school the unnatural darkness was still swarming around me an unnatural effect since there was enough light around for me to see finally i saw the top of sirius head going around the corner and i chased after him finally catching up to him as he was now stalking back and forth in front of the shrieking shack he wasntchasing after whatever he had been chasing after sirius i approached him carefully since he looked like a stalking panther ready to attack he jumped slightly at the touch of my hand on his shoulder what happened there was that feeling i felt something i recognized he was frowning in concentration trying to remember where he knew the feeling from how he recognized it well judging by the fact that you look like you re ready to kill someone i shall assume it wasnta good thing you recognized i sighed unhappily my nice day out had taken a rather menacing turn sirius did you feel a peculiar darkness surrounding you at my question sirius finally turned to look at me shock and worry etched on his face at that moment he looked older and more worn then was normal this must have been close to how he had looked upon escaping from azkaban you felt that too sirius sounded almost overjoyed to hear that he hadntbeen the only one experiencing it for a moment there he must have felt an overwhelming amount of loneliness but i had lightened the load a bit but i was worried by my own experience no one else in the three broomsticks had felt what we had their faces would have shown some sign instead the only time they had looked startled was when sirius had ran out of the room the implications of that were profound since it meant i had been the only one to notice what sirius did sirius i held my right hand out and with my left quickly pinched my skin on my hand causing me to wince slightly ow sirius frowned and started to rub his right hand after a moment the gears started to turn in his raven haired head his eyes jumping to my face to satiate his curiousity he pinched his own hand making me yelp his eyes widened as if my own test hadntworked but he believed his own i sighed heavily and turned away from sirius starting to pace back and forth myself muttering to myself that i hadntnoticed this earlier not that i should have been too surprised without a large injury or being present for one there was no way for either of us to realize anything if sirius stubbed his toe all i would feel was a pain in my toe there would be no reason to associate that pain with sirius we re connected his voice was soft surprised we already knew that black i growled getting angry for no real reason except my own failure this new information drove out of our minds the earlier problem the terror that both of us had felt that familiar feeling so you feel anything i do sirius asked curious he looked ready to test that theory out again but my narrowed eyes staid his hand to a certain degree apparently my voice was tired i had dealt with having to stay within a certain area from the man quite well i thought now i was feeling his pain and fear it wasnta wonderful thought this could perhaps explain some of the strange dreams i had over the past two months of course with that thought my worry for sirius grew overshadowing my worry for my own safety my dreams quite frequently over the past months had taken dark turns i had felt enclosed scared at a complete loss as to what to do upon waking i had always assumed it was my own mind that had created the dreams after all i was in a singularly frightening position knowing off the dark lord reappearance having people i know being killed and looking for the one thing that could stop his return to power but if these dreams were sirius s then he was far more fragile then he was letting on more fragile then hermione could even have guessed sirius i think this goes to our dreams as well at least to strong ones my suggestion brought a panicked look to sirius eyes suggesting that he was remembering the dreams he had been having i think we should go back to the school his voice wavered slightly between his usual confidence and doubt it was like always a shock to the system to witness a vulnerable sirius when he started to walk away i quickly caught up to him striding next to him trying to match his long steps without another word i slipped my arm into his so we ended up walking up to the castle arm in arm sirius i finally broke the silence we were standing in the entryway to the castle it was the point where we would each go in different directions sirius to his room and me down to the dungeons to mine my voice stopped him from moving off to his rooms he seemed trapped at the sound caught between two different needs one to escape quickly the other to stay and try to fix something the hall was empty of students everyone was likely in the great hall having dinner i was happy at the silence in the hallway after all this was a personal moment one that needed to occur and one that needed to be free from ridicule from obnoxious students you re having those dreams every night i made this guess personally i hadnthad the dreams every night but that didntmean that our connection necessarily meant that it transmitted to me each night at his curt nod i let out a deep sigh i hadntrealized how deeply things had affected the man his death his friend deaths the regret over his brother it was all resulting with him feeling shut in enclosed in a horrible dark place that he had no chance of escaping even in his dreams he was trapped i remembered back to hermione words she had said that sirius had a wound that never healed that perhaps i could help with that at the time i had wanted nothing to do with it worried over my own ability to do anything now though faced with the problem head on i just wanted to help this broken man dontworry about it aine it not a big deal everyone has nightmares there was a forced cheer in his voice i snorted not the same one every night it nothing to worry about sirius voice grew hard not wanting to continue with this conversation anymore there nothing you can do about it anyway i pursed my lips regarding him carefully well there was something i could do but it was going to change things quite a bit moving up on my toes i slipped my hands over sirius cheeks there was a faint feel of stubble over the skin which was hot under my palms he was too surprised at my actions to react eyes widening at my actions i smiled slightly pulling his head closer to mine so my lips ghosted over his own hot breath mingling together the only thing i can do is make sure you re not alone when you have a nightmare when i pressed my lips firmly against his i felt his answering smile and whether it was the connection or not i felt calm radiate through me a n tada a new chapter now tell me how much you love me you know what that means reviews so i am at 98 reviews as a nice little present to the person who gives me that 100th review i shall do whatever you want in the next chapter you want a rave scene it there you want to see severus turned into a clown well somehow it ll get done i will be at your beck and call for a chapter well as long as it doesntchange the story dramatically we ll see no matter if people dontlike harry and draco i not going to split them up chapter 35 i was confused for a moment when i woke up the next morning to the sight of red and gold instead of my normal green and silver sitting up in the bed only made the confusion grow because i realized that other then the fact that i was in a different bedroom i was also naked in that room a shifting to my side caught my attention sirius was laying in the bed next to me on his stomach and as completely undressed as i was the sight reminded me exactly what had happened the previous night my offer to spend the night the acceptance and the obvious end results of that and other then the realization that this was going to change things there wasnttoo much regret at what had happened how could there be when sirius happened to be absolute perfection in bed my own lust for the man hadntbeen for naught but my own physical desires for the man hadntled to this happening it had been my own need to try to at last help fix some of the problems he was having emotionally and mentally hermione had been right in that regard it seemed i was the only one here he felt close to whether this was another side effect of our connection i dont know but it certainly meant i had a role to fulfill in his life in fact i felt rather responsible for his current mental state after all it had been me who had brought him back to life while i had been thinking all this through my eyes had not left sirius who by now had woken up and turned onto his back staring at me with adoration after a night of glorious lovemaking then i rolled my eyes pulling the sheet up around my body for no other reason then to deny him the right of seeing me naked again sort of reminds me of when i first met you at least the first time meeting you awake sirius sat up stretching out his long limbs completely comfortable in the fact that he was naked with nothing covering him my lips tilted into a smile of their own accord remembering that time i had been standing in the middle of his room naked gripping a sheet tightly around me seemed so inevitable at the time that we would end up naked together in bed sirius laughed as i smacked his shoulder why are you always such a smug bastard i tried to sound annoyed but instead i just had to laugh at him well i a smug bastard as you put it at the moment because i finally managed to get you to admit you like me by sleeping with me he had leaned into me while he said this his silver eyes moving down my body causing the familiar chills to go down my spine did i need to sleep with you for you to know i liked you i sighed but he just laughed pulling away for me to know you really liked me yes i had always known sirius was a physical being to be loved meant to love each other in the physical sense it was hard for him to realize that loving someone went beyond touching kissing and sex i had told him already that i liked him but until i jumped into the sack with him the words meant nothing this was likely nothing new either not a side effect of the resurrection but in fact just a part of his personality did you have a nightmare last night i decided the best choice was to change the subject before i moored myself in the depressing idea of what last night really meant the bright smile on the gryffindor face gave me all the answer i needed well other then fabulous sex the night had accomplished something it time for breakfast i said slipping off the bed the sheet still wrapped around me effectively shielding my body from view my clothes were strewn around the room suggesting the frenzy they had been taken off in last night cant miss that either sirius was grinning i didnteven have to see him to know he was after all we missed dinner last night i sure the rumours are flying some people are probably green with envy with my shirt over my head i stopped dressing a realization hitting me at that moment a thought that had me twirling around to glare at sirius who was still smiling brightly on the bed in no rush to get dressed you you i shook my head trying to get clear thoughts through it and into my mouth you re happy not because of what happened you re happy because you think you won a flicker passed behind his eyes before he controlled it i happy about last night because i wanted it to happen his voice was soft controlled that may be true my brows were furrowed but you re ecstatic now because you ve just won over severus you know damn well what everyone is going to think after we didntshow up last night to dinner after going to hogsmeade together even if you didnt realize it before you do now and you re happy about it i was rather disgusted with the man at the moment that he could be thinking of what had happened between the two of us as part of his little competition with severus never did it cross my mind that was the reason why it had happened but it was a happy little side effect in sirius mind it always when you re in the mood to throw something that you find nothing at hand to accomplish this goal it didntreally speak to my own annoyance at the man to bunch up the sheets that had only moments ago covered my body but i would say he understood well enough my feelings toward him at that moment my own anger stemmed also from my horror that severus would know about this really i am not a brave person so i almost decided to forgo breakfast completely that morning until i realized that my absence would cause further rumour speculation amongst the students and likely the staff the teacher who had such a good time she missed dinner and breakfast never sleep with someone if you re not ready to accept the implications of the act when i stepped through the doors into the great hall i thought that perhaps i had misjudged everyone there was no immediate silence when i walked in for breakfast no turning of heads no gasps of surprise perhaps my absence from dinner had apparently not been noticed i wish black eyes were colder then normal watching me as i took a seat at the table mcgonagall expression was disapproving tonks was grinning widely wiggling her eyebrows at me next to me irma nudged me in the side an amused expression on her face did you have a good time in hogsmeade groaning i put my head into my hands small mercies were that sirius couldnt make it to breakfast he had a few wounds to nurse after all dont worry dear no one really noticed at my sudden look the old lady shrugged well most of the students didntnotice i kept my eyes on my plate pushing the food around unhappily my choices were starting to seem like bad ones lately so spending the night with sirius had seemed like a good idea at the time but in the harsh light of the morning it was certainly anything but though granted there was no dispute about sirius abilities in bed soon after my entrance in the hall severus got up and headed out since i wasntexactly hungry or that desperate for the company of the other teachers i got up quickly and followed him out i chose to ignore the pointed looks i received as i did so severus i managed to catch up to him outside his classroom professor snape he drawled out icily oh he was annoyed severus i followed him into the dungeon classroom i sure you ve heard some things i have a class i sighed heavily pushing up onto a desk to sit and watch him as he moved behind his desk you re not actually angry with me for sleeping with him are you i tilted my head watching him behind his desk messing around with some papers at my question the shuffling paused and his hands scrunched up the papers you are angry with me if one didntknow better one would think you were jealous of what happened i am never jealous his voice cracked eyes staying fixed on the desk and away from me strange how your not jealous sounds jealous i muttered you know i am not going to get into this with you try not to get too depressed about this you slept with black his eyes shot up glaring at me before he seemed to recall that he was supposed to be calmer about this i not depressed that just disgusting if you re in love with the man or what i dontcare oh for crying out loud i dontlove him i just slept with him you really need to remember that in today day and age one doesntneed to love someone to have sex if you need to know the details though i did it because he was breaking up he was wounded and he wanted someone to be around when he woke up to make sure he wasntlosing it for a moment severus said nothing just watching me as i got angry do you think perhaps i might care that the man is falling apart or that anyone would believe that excuse i snorted in annoyance it wasntan excuse i crossed my arms narrowing my eyes at the hawk nosed potions master but truthfully enough it wasntthe only reason no sirius happens to be extremely talented in bed okay so now i was trying to annoy severus a little jealousy wasnttoo much to ask the teacher across from me was starting to get a tick above his left eye as he watched me are you through i slipped off the desk sighing as i did so there was probably no real chance that severus was going to show any signs of jealousy at the moment the only real emotion that he was going to show was that of disgust for me having the gall to sleep with black out of curiousity i made my way around his desk with determination keeping my eyes on him if i suggested that we had sex what would you do shocked at my question he had taken a few steps away from i smirked at the movement since it indicated his unease with my suggestion and my nearing presence well i think that answered my question i chuckled softly though there was a note of bitterness to the laugh at that comment his movement stopped seeming to try and appear calm and collected i actually had something to discuss with you i leaned back against his desk and here i thought you just wanted to rub sex with black in my face his face twisted unpleasantly likely at the mention of sirius and sex in the same sentence i laughed again completely amused at his discomfort with that whole subject matter no rubbing was intended i shook my head actually last night when his tick appeared again i hurried on while we were still in hogsmeade sirius and i discovered something apparently our connection isntjust a distance thing we can feel strong emotions and pain from each other in fact i ve been having nightmares frequently over the past two months and it turned out that they were sirius s that actually the reason i stayed the night with him severus regarded me with a slight amount of interest at the description of the problem it never occurred to you that this was possible his voice dripped with a certain sarcastic amusement my nose wrinkled up displeased with severus for pointing out my mistake and with myself for having missed the possibility most magical connections result in the people involved sharing emotional connections along with the physical though usually the people involved dontnecessarily have sexual relations upon finding this out you re starting to sound jealous again sevvie i frowned at the man i didntsleep with him because we share pain i apologize you slept with him because you re in love with him i am not i pushed away from the desk taking a step toward the dark haired man who was at that moment taking a step away from me just because he good in bed doesntmean i love him it is a modern time where women can sleep with guys for a purely physical reason right now i could sleep with you it wouldntnecessarily mean anything after all you dontgive a shit about me do you he opened his mouth at this last question to answer me but instead he closed it choosing to scowl at me instead mr montgomery hasntdone anything unusual he a normal eleven year old student he changed the subject on me i sighed leaning back against the desk again what had i really expected a fierce denial about him not giving a shit about me well actually i am very happy to hear that contrary to what you might think i actually like the kid sirius hates him he loves kerstan faust though of course one a slytherin the other a gryffindor personally it the other one i donttrust i blinked at him out of the two boys kerstan didntreally seem the one anyone would ever be distrustful of he was happy and open the fact was that if you asked him his deepest darkest secret he would likely tell you without a second thought it was a bit confusing for severus to not like him sirius dislike of cain was likely due to his house but for severus he didntusually mistrust based on house placement though no one would deny that he gave more benefit of the doubt to his own house what reason do you have to not trust the boy he frowned appearing to think hard about what he was going to say to answer the question he too happy a brief moment of time passed before i burst out laughing an act that was certain to gain me a scowl but i couldntcare at that moment i was too busy being bent over with the laughs racking my body you are not a happy person are you sevvie i sighed straightening up and calming down my laughter just as i thought the man was busy scowling at me are you dreadfully mad with me for sleeping with sirius no i furrowed my brows trying to figure out if he was telling me the truth or not you re lying to me i grinned finally figuring out the man only real tell when he lied his nose actually twitched slightly it wasnt really noticeable but i had been trying to figure it out for quite a while after all it was rather important to me your nose twitches when you lie did you know i pointed at the offending appendage severus pushed my hand away looking uncomfortable with the idea of someone having discovered something as important as his lie detector i am only mad because of who you slept with not that you slept with him right so i am just caught in the middle of the black snape feud then sirius is overjoyed at having had sex with me since he thinks it made him the winner and you are angry because you think it made him the winner as well one question he looked a little wary of me but nodded to accept the asking of the question have you found the horcrux yet no i still checking the slytherin common areas fine i walked back around the desk i think i am going to stay away from you and black you can find something else to include in your feud now i am going to spend as much time as possible solving my own problem so i can get away from both of you aine severus actually started to move around the desk looking almost contrite about things but anything else he might have said were cut off by the arrival of the students for his first class of the day not wanting to have them think anything amiss his face set itself into his usual mask of stony indifference pausing for only a moment i quickly retreated out of the potions classroom heading to my own rooms perhaps slamming the door hadntreally been necessary i had the best intentions the night before but apparently i had been the only one sirius had enjoyed himself yes but more important were the effects the act had on his feud with severus he had never been overjoyed that i liked the potions master and this was a quick and simple way of winning and as for severus himself well he didnthave me in his bed so that wasntgoing to be a notch on his belt the thing was that he wasntunhappy that i had slept with sirius he was unhappy that it was sirius that i had slept with if i had decided to jump into the sack with professor flitwick that would have been fine hell he wouldnthave even cared if it was voldemort in my bed but sirius well that just went against the grain both men were certainly off my christmas lists the entire event had decided me on the issue of work relationships after my class that evening i chose to avoid dinner after all it would have been entirely uncomfortable dealing with both sirius and severus the former preening the latter scowling for a brief moment i missed the obnoxious attitude of matt thinking about the man made me remember that he was dead a death for which i happened to be the cause it adequately managed to calm me down about the deadly triangle i had involved myself in instead it made me remember that there were bigger more important things to deal with like having a psychotic powerful dark wizard on the run who happened to enjoy killing poor defenseless muggles some of whom happened to share a relationship with me bringing to mind the possibility that he may or may not have been after me aine i winced hearing my name expecting to see sirius or severus waiting outside my rooms instead i relaxed seeing only hermione standing there apparently waiting for me i relaxed though until i remembered that she was friends with sirius so she could be there to berate me on my choice of sleeping with him or possibly congratulate me she might even expect further things from me in relation to the man if she thoughy one night one really fantastic night of sex was going to end in me marrying the man then she had some bats flying out of her belfry hermione as pleased as i am to see you it late i tired and no i am not going to marry sirius just because i slept with him you slept with sirius i sighed deciding that perhaps i shouldntalways blurt things outloud under assumptions because more often then not the assumptions are wrong and all you accomplish is what you were trying to avoid i was kidding i moved past her opening my door there was no surprise when the witch entered my room after me at least she was nice enough to close the door after herself as thrilled as i am to hear that and as worried as i am that you seem unhappy about it that not why i here have you heard about the theft at the london museum i spared a moment to be thrilled that she was here on business before remembering that the business was not one that anyone should be thrilled about yes i have a student who adores everything muggle she keeps up with the newspapers she told me about the theft since she thought it was odd she doesntknow much about muggles if she thinks stealing things is odd we do it all the time she smarter then you then i frowned at the witch never pleased when anyone insinuated that i wasntintelligent so i wasntsmart enough for ravenclaw but i wasntan idiot i was a professor at nyu for crying out loud did people in this country not understand that you had to be intelligent to work there you might have taken an interest if you knew what was stolen the article didntgive a list of things if it had been anything really important it would have been mentioned if it was something important to the wizards there would be a hell of a lot more aurors at the school now then just the one my foot was tapping now it had been a rather difficult day and i wasntreally in the mood for guess what the muggle stole well they dontknow what they re looking for i sure she pulled a piece of parchment out of a pocket in the jacket she was wearing you re supposed to be an expert in rituals and the such arentyou as much as a muggle can be of course do you think you could look at this and tell me if there anything odd i grabbed the parchment away from her more annoyed at her suggestion that a muggle would know less about rituals then a witch like her after all it had been a muggle who had resurrected sirius black she had never come out and said it but i knew well enough that hermione knew what had happened if not the exact hows or whys my eyes skimmed the paper quickly uncaring about what kind of artwork had been stolen from a museum i stared though at one of the things listed my breath catching in my throat is something wrong hermione moved closer placing a hand over my own holding the paper do you recognize something gaining my control i pushed the paper back into her hand smiling slightly i just shocked at the gall someone had to steal all of that it all worth a fair penny not surprisingly the brunette witch didntseem to buy my story watching me closely but i kept the smile on my face after a few more moment she sighed and put the parchment back in her pocket if you think of anything let me know is this even part of your job i need to make sure that this isntconnected to the nyu break in it my job to keep an eye on these sorts of things yes her eyes narrowed on me causing me to worry what the next thing she was going to ask all i could hope was that she wasntgoing to push me about the things that had been stolen you slept with sirius i groaned dropping onto my couch it was partly your fault you know all that talk about him being wounded and broken i tugged on a lock of my hair frowning up at her he looked depressed and he was having these nightmares so i offered to spend the night with him big mistake that was she sat down next to me her lips pursed you didnthave to sleep with him the look i gave her caused her to smile slightly sorry even though i am married i realize that it is sirius black highly unlikely he would let a girl sleep with him without other things happening she gave me an apologetic smile exactly the other things werentthe problem either it the after effect that is he all proud of himself it like he bagged himself the biggest fish i half expect him to dangle me upside down and take pictures with me the image caused hermione to laugh softly before covering her mouth at my heated glare then of course there the fact that he keeps rubbing it in severus face upon saying his name outloud my annoyance grew and that man he doesnteven seem to care that i slept with another man at all he just cares that it was sirius he cantstand the man i expect if sirius were to sleep with irma he would be outraged you haventslept with professor snape have you hermione eyes were wide and she couldnthide the disgust that crept into her voice no but i can tt really say i wouldn t my voice trailed off at the discomfort in the other woman face it was never easy to hear about one of your teachers and sex especially your least favourite one well not to sound biased but sirius is a better choice this comment made me huff softly no offense hermione but no he not i like sirius he a great guy and hopefully after i cool off after this we ll still be friends but he not really cut out for any serious relationship this didntseem to dissuade the girl since she was smiling at me granted it was hard to convince someone that you didntlike a man not after just admitting that you had sex with said man or that he was a great guy great guy great sex well it usually adds up to a relationship well i need to get back to ron never am sure if the house will still be standing or not she pushed off the couch being the dutiful hostess i got up as well and walked her over to the door really if you think of anything about any of those things that were stolen let me know she smiled and gave me a quick peck on the cheek and dontbe too harsh on sirius he not really sure how to show affection except through physical means you will have been the first girl he has had sex with since before azkaban that a very long time it means something i didntanswer and she left i knew well enough that i meant something to the man well i was going to forgive him though he deserved a few days of hanging in the breeze there were far more important things to deal with though far more important sirius i burst into the gryffindor room without so much as a knock part of me was half disappointed that he was calmly sitting on his couch reading a book instead of half naked playing twister it was really a ridiculous thought since who plays twister half naked on their own though frankly the idea of him reading for pleasure was slightly ridiculous as well i had an itching suspicion that the book was likely not a great work of literature aine are you finally speaking to me again you ve done a rather wonderful job of avoiding me all day i d hate to see you ruin it on purpose i waved off his bad humour i have to speak to harry now his head tilted as he looked at me before he stood up pushing some hair out of his face it was hard not to stare at the movement of his hair or his hand but i managed to look firm and in control you can use the fireplace after doing some things that i am completely incapable of doing harry face appeared in his fire looking a little tired not strange considering the time of night really sirius i was a bit busy i dontneed to know doing what sirius lips twisted unpleasantly there was no doubt as to what he was imagining in his perverted little brain aine said it was important so dont blame me i moved to the fireplace quickly dropping onto my knees in front of it speaking to a face in a fire is a very odd thing indeed unlike in the movie versions of the books it wasnta face in the coals but was actually more of a free floating head made out of the flames it sort of just floated in space bouncing about like flames tend to do now the fire head of harry was looking a little tired he had off his glasses his eyes in the flame drooping shut staying open only to wait for me to tell him what i had to tell hermione visited me tonight she had heard i knew something about rituals and artefacts i suppose so she wanted me to look at a list of things stolen from the london museum i assume you know about that i didnt tell her anything because frankly i wary of her involvement in all this i told her i didntrecognize anything but that not true there was something on that list i paused and took a deep breath the fire version of harry was now wide awake and now had on his glasses there was concern etched on his face mostly for hermione safely in all likelihood he had tried hard enough to keep her out of this and without any say in the matter she had jumped right in even if she didnthave a clue as to what was going on she was inching closer day by day suddenly harry head disappeared from the fire and a rather ruffled looking draco appeared his hair was mussed and there was a dark scowl on his face i somehow suspected that sirius suspicions had been correct as to what harry had been busy with would you just damn well tell us mackinnion it was a clag a bhais granted the museum apparently didntknow what to call it on the list it just said third century wooden cylinder covered in oghum alphabet but i positive that what it was who ever broke into that museum stole a death bell someone planning on resurrecting someone harry head had appeared back in the fire i wondered how draco liked being pushed out of the way but the serious look on the golden boy face wouldnthave brooked any argument on the matter werent there other things stolen sure but nothing important in all likelihood they were just stolen to cover up the intended target people would have cared if one thing was missing but a bunch just sounds like random theft and as i now know you wizards really have no clue what you re looking for the face in the flames grew quiet and thoughtful behind me sirius had seated himself glancing back at the man and he looked sick to his stomach whatever ideas were running through his head were not pleasant ones i had you resurrect sirius because you were the only one who could harry spoke softly therefore if voldemort had plans on bringing his body back to life he would need you i swallowed hard thinking of the break in at nyu apparently i had been the intended target they needed me and the clag a bhais with one thing now in their possession they only needed the second to achieve their goals i really hated being the one thing standing in the way of what they wanted it was a daunting position aine i blinked up now looking at the aristocratic features of draco if it was possible even he looked worried i hoped it was at least partially on my behalf are you sure no one else knows how to perform the ritual a moment thought brought me to nod in response it was certainly true that no one that voldemort would know of would be able to perform the ritual there might have been some people around the world who knew how but they werenttelling anyone the person i had learned from had been the owner of a small grocery store up in a little village in the highlands of scotland she was now dead this kind of information wasntsomething people boasted about unless voldemort decided to interview every person he was unlikely to find anyone not to mention why bother looking for someone when he already knew of a person to perform it he cantjust do what he did before to gain a body we destroyed all the bones of his fathers the floating head of draco seemed to shrug it looks like your it dontworry though hogwarts is perfectly safe i snorted at this comment if there had been one thing i had learnt while reading the books it was that no matter how safe anyone thought the school was it wasn t death eaters pretending to be teachers mean ministry officials all out fights in the hallways and even the appearance of voldemort himself in the school didnt speak too highly for it security it ll be fine sirius arms circled around my waist from behind pulling me back against his chest as panicked as i may have been i couldntdeny that there was a sense of security being held in his arms and i calmed down a bit in front of me in the fire draco was smirking glad to see you two are getting along quickly harry pushed his way back into view glaring off to the side to what i had to assume was draco just be careful i ll look into things and if you see hermione again make sure you keep her out of all this i rolled my eyes since our first meeting pretty much all i had been doing was trying to keep the witch out of things especially my things not surprisingly though hermione had her own idea about what she needed to know good night i sorry we interrupted anything harry smiled at this nothing important at this we could hear a mutter of indignation come from draco off on harry side dontworry everything really will be fine just find me that horcrux the flames flickered down now settling back into to a natural fire i really wontlet anyone hurt you sirius said with conviction behind me his breath warm on neck and i believed him i turned around in his arms kissing him soundly on the lips partly in gratitude for the reassurance and partly just because i wanted to a n well well well the story of three wells this chapter took longer to upload it was mainly due to the fact that with christmas so near work has been excuriatingly busy and i ve had shopping to do of course but finally i got around to finishing this and getting it up ah and one thing about this chapter well my 100th reviewer won a little prize i would do anything she wanted in the story i offered up three things but there was only one thing she wanted so for alexis aka crafty we have a segment of the chapter told from snape viewpoint i hope i did the lovely potion master justice but being inside his head can be a bit difficult so be kind i think after this chapter though i shall leave the poor man mind alone heh chapter 36 the second morning upon waking up with sirius was infinitely better then the first the man seemed to have learnt his lesson after the first time and he didntmention anything that might have reminded me about severus or feuds or what the students and teachers were likely going to think though his reticence on the issue didntstop my own brain from going into overdrive in the end though i chose to just give up on trying to sort everything out having a psychotic killer out to get you certainly does give you a new view on life a view that tends to include not giving a care about what others think it a very me centered view and as far as me went i enjoyed sleeping with sirius i didnt think past the moment it was just fun a girl can have fun cant she apparently severus didntagree with that opinion judging by the hard look i received from him as i entered the great hall for lunch i had missed breakfast perhaps i should have cared that the potions master was angry with me at the moment displeased with my choices but i was beyond that point while i had forgiven sirius severus was still on my black list it was a cold shoulder that i gave him as i took my own seat for lunch next to sirius who was trying rather hard to hide the smirk that was edging it way on to his face it never made it way completely onto his face though likely due to the annoyance that was radiating from me if nothing else sirius was smart enough not to push my buttons when it came to the role i played in his feud with severus so aine are you and sirius dating now tonks was none too quiet as she asked the question from a few chairs down some of the other teachers seemed interested in my answer while others shifted nervously a few grunted in displeasure and turned away pointedly my own eye was starting to twitch the only small pleasure i could take out of the question was that it hadntbeen asked loud enough for the students to hear tonks i dontknow what you ve heard but professor black and i are not dating but siri said she winced and then pouted at sirius who was giving her a dark look my lips tilted up slightly despite what sirius might have said on the matter my answer still stands now sirius dark look was aimed in my direction but i just grinned at him in response really he should have been thrilled that i hadnt killed him for telling tonks what had happened between us or assuming things for the two of us based off them well i personally think you would have made a cute couple tonks shrugged i had to wonder if anyone would think severus and i would make a cute couple people seemed to overwhelmingly prefer sirius when it came to relationships hell who was i kidding people just preferred sirius period some of us dontcare about miss mackinnion romantic entanglements professor sinistra was obvious about her dislike of me pretty much from the start whether this was because i was a muggle was something i wasntsure of right severus she had looked to severus beside her for agreement with her statement i gave the man a scathing look before focusing my attention on my lunch really i was still smarting over the fact that the man cared little enough about me to only really care that it had been sirius i had slept with not that i had slept with someone at all actually it rather interesting somehow i doubted that was the response that professor sinistra wanted i was really starting to dislike the woman as well and it had nothing to do with the fact that she thought she had the right to call him severus sirius was starting to bristle next to me and all severus had said was that it was interesting god help us if he followed that comment up with anything else it is not appropriate to discuss this in front of the children the headmistress had put a stop to the imminent argument with the one sentence and a firm look to all the teachers really i couldnt have been happier the last thing i wanted was for sirius to jump down the table and try and strangle severus even if i had been considering the same thing a few moments before with christmas coming soon my classes were sort of tapering down i had to say that i was right with the students when it came to the amount of work i wanted to do so my homework assignments were a little lenient i thought having the students read some traditional christmas stories was rather informative did it really matter that most of them were children books i shouldnthave been surprised when two students actually handed in papers on the books they had read even though they hadntbeen assigned miss cooper miss tsuroda i looked up at the two girls from behind my desk the two looked a little uneasy with each other apparently neither expecting someone else to bother doing a paper and certainly not expecting to show up at the same time to pass it in you know that there was no required paper i just thought that perhaps i could get some extra credit miss tsuroda said shrugging well i just thought you d like some feedback on the assignment i dont need extra credit chauncey smirked slightly at michi who was looking a little put out being upstaged like that personally i found it all rather amusing well the two of you destroyed my objective of not having work to grade i sighed dramatically trying to look put out by the two immediately they started to apologize but my laughter put a stop to them i was kidding it fine it great even i glad you two were so enthused you ll both get extra credit but please dontdo any extra work over the holidays i would hate to think of the two of you doing homework on christmas day i would never do that michi denied it but her face showed that she had indeed in the past worked over the holiday but she didntwant to admit to that now anyway have a happy christmas professor she headed out of the classroom leaving me with a rather fidgety fifth year gryffindor is there anything wrong i had stood up deciding to go out and spend the rest of the afternoon in the library my plan was paused at the sight of the young student still standing in front of my desk looking like she had something to say i i think something going on she rushed it out looking a little embarrassed after it was all said something going on my immediate concerns were those of the confusing relationship that sirius and i now had the dark mark and those fires and then the break ins i think it all connected is it bad that i almost sighed with relief miss cooper i think perhaps you would do well as a detective in the future i moved around the desk putting a hand on her shoulder steering her toward the door but in this case i just dontsee what you do i think perhaps the dark mark has you being a little paranoid two break ins cantbe connected one was in london the other was in new york i glad that you re keeping an eye on things really she looked a little depressed over my refusal of her accusations there was a slight twinge in my conscience about denying it all to the girl making her sound paranoid when she was completely right actually i was rather proud of the girl for having figured out a connection when most of the older wizards and witches hadntbeen able to see it she reminded me of hermione in those terms all right then professor really maybe you should stop reading the muggle papers just relax and have a nice christmas at home okay she made a face but reluctantly the young girl agreed and made her way out of the classroom i soon followed her out though i was on my way up to the library irma was of course there and even a few students could be found among the stacks despite the fact that the christmas break was starting tomorrow as a teacher of course i was rather happy that students were so dedicated to their studies but really my personal opinion was that they needed to lighten up and go and get into some trouble so you re staying here over the holidays i raised an eyebrow at irma who was scowling past me at some students who hurried along at the dark look of course i am there are students staying and as a teacher i have to stay and look out for them that was not true of course the real reason was the fact that sirius wasntleaving so i certainly couldn t add to that the continuing search for the horcrux and a psychotic dark wizard out to kill me and it didntreally spell out holiday at home did you finish that book i lent you yet the question was practically an accusation after all i had the book for almost a month and a half with no sign of returning it just yet i hope you dontmind irma i read it but i going over it again i almost positive there something there that i can use but it eluding my grasp sorry as long as it in perfect condition when i get it back i reassured her about my ability to take care of books and then made my way over to a table to do some reading actually at the moment i wasntresearching the connection actually right now i was reading some books on lord voldemort and what had happened all those years ago the man if one could really call him that was certainly a nasty piece of work he had killed and tortured so many people that the ministry had simply lost count there was just no way to be sure how many people he had been responsible for certainly not when you took into account the muggles he likely had a hand in killing as well no wonder the wizarding world counted harry as it most important hero he had vanquished it worst foe not just once either but twice granted the first time had been his mother doing but as far as the rest of the world saw it it had been little baby harry it was rather amazing that he hadntdyed his hair blonde and moved to the united states to get away from his likely fan base the books i had been reading had been almost reverent in their descriptions of the young man the fact of the matter was that he seemed to actually be almost like a god the way they went on about him even those books being written about him hadntchanged that matter of fact most of the wizarding world secretly had read them though none would admit it after all a squib had betrayed their entire existence but damned if it didntmake good reading the history catch up went well into the night and it was only irma shaking me awake that suggested that it was perhaps time i took my dozing off to my own bed the next day saw the departure of most of the students practically all of them really with the entire population on edge after the dark mark showing up and some suspicions about other attacks everyone was being extra careful and that meant keeping your children where you could see them especially over the holidays when all was said and done only about 6 children had decided to stay these lucky few included kerstan cain and chauncey an interesting combination i felt a little bad though about telling chauncey to have a good holiday at home since it appeared she had no home to go to since there were so few students and for their own safety headmistress mcgonagall had decided that they would all stay in one dorm together it was an interesting idea since they all came from different houses two gryffindors and slytherins and one each from ravenclaw and hufflepuff even more interesting was the fact that she had decided they would all stay in the slytherin dorms it was a choice that sirius was none too pleased with poor kerstan having to stay in those horrible dank disgusting cellars only snakes live down there all i had to do was cough not including you aine you re not a snake you re far to pretty to be a snake my look must have said it all since he decided to shut up after that comment after all i wasntoverly thrilled with his description of slytherins in general after all they were just children there was no need to be so mean to them all the time it for their protection sirius i was trying once again to read the book irma had leant me but it was proving difficult as usual in the lanky gryffindor presence his pacing was driving me up a wall the cellars are the easiest places to protect and both severus and i live down there even you are just on the first floor and since it just us mcgonagall hagrid and sinistra staying over the holidays it really did make the most sense so just shut up about it and please stop pacing not that my suggestion had been taken seriously he continued to go on and on about the poor gryffindors and really the poor ravenclaw boy and hufflepuff girl who had to suffer horrifically in the terrible dungeons it got so bad that i was seriously contemplating a death when we walked into the great hall for dinner the first of the christmas break it was either going to be my death or his though with our connection it was likely one would lead to the other so it wasntreally a viable solution the hall had been decked out in christmas cheer covered with magical lights and snow falling from the ceiling even dumbledore sat in his portrait a christmas tree now beside him and what looked like mistletoe hanging in front of him i had to wonder if anyone would actually kiss a picture happy christmas professor i stopped by his portrait greeting the former headmaster and to you too professor he smiled slightly nodding at me and then to sirius who had stopped next to me it should be rather an eventful break i should think with who is staying ah what that supposed to mean sirius asked a bit abruptly in my opinion but dumbledore wasntabout to answer he was off on a different tangent ah you re under the mistletoe my dear well that answered that question apparently i would kiss a picture with so few people in residence everyone sat at the same table for dinner teachers and students i dontthink sinistra or severus were overly pleased with sitting with children but then the two of them were hardly pleased with anything my own personal agitation with the potions master had continued on into the holiday vacation i hate to say it of myself but i do hold quite a grudge from time to time and this was one of those times one thing i can not get past is people who i try and care about not caring about me he could have at least faked a small ounce of jealousy over my relationship with sirius though the very thought itself was irrational there was no good reason for me to want severus to be jealous for that to be true then i would want something from the man and i didn t not to mention that would mean i was just using sirius which would be wrong my contact with the man had been severely limited as well i dislike saying that i avoided him but really that what it was my imagination had even worked up several attempts by the man to talk to me but i had ran out of the room and just convinced myself later that it had been my imagination my main concerns were cutting my connection with sirius teaching the students and trying not to think about the evil dark lord who wanted to find me make me resurrect his corpse and then likely tear apart my body into so many pieces that no one would even realize the pieces had belonged to a human being so it was always awkward at meals now it was just worse since there were so few people to hide behind i was actually surprised that so many teachers had gone home it was just odd to think of them as having families to spend the holidays with tonks had actually been invited to spend the time with weasley s mrs weasley realized that this was a hard time for the girl since after remus death she found the holidays particularly hard even irma had gone somewhere apparently she had a daughter in the south of wales thinking of that woman as ever having had children well everyone has a secret side dontthey hagrid of course stayed and mcgonagall well she was in charge of the student protection i had expected severus to stay as well he after all didnthave friends and family there was a slight twinge at the thought but i beat that little bit of pity back and as for sinistra well i didntdoubt that her staying the holidays had to do with severus strange as it perhaps was to anyone except me but the astronomy teacher has a bit of a crush on the potions master really my black looks to the woman did not concern that fact she just plain did not like me professor you kissed a portrait chauncey cooper was practically bent over laughing at the image i must have presented behind me dumbledore was laughing in good nature but that didntstop the blush that stole up my cheeks sirius nudged me in the side now laughing himself do i have to be worried are you going to leave me for a portrait i am not necessarily the most good natured person when it comes to teasing i cantleave you if we re not together sirius now shut up i muttered and practically stomped to the table and took a free seat which luckily or not happened to be next to severus the canine is going to reveal your relationship to the entire student body soon i stiffened at severus comment but a look at the students that were there showed that none had noticed chauncey was still busy laughing off my apparent make out with dumbledore and kerstan was chatting happily with two of the other students cain was of course practically dead not a sound coming out of the boy we donthave a relationship to reveal i grumbled once again it was getting rather tiresome to try and keep explaining this to everyone but whenever severus said anything i immediately had to try dreadfully sorry then he might reveal the fact that you re both shagging the man was practically livid which is saying a lot for him severus really never showed any emotion so for him to look so pissed off was something in fact if any event needed to marked down on a calendar this would be it day severus got pissed off i leaned in close to him making me rather happy that sirius had sat at the opposite end of the table and wasntpaying much attention to me he was far too busy laughing with kerstan about something apparently his mental age matched that of an eleven year old severus are you jealous i asked incredulous at my movement closer to him he had practically jumped back and now at my question there was a definite blush creeping up his oh so pale cheeks would it matter after all you haventspoken two words to me in weeks he huffed out softly ah but that was all i needed i grinned at him feeling a strange relief my grudge with severus had ended that easily all i had needed was a show of feeling from the man and his jealousy had finally broken it that is completely childish he looked incredulous at my complete change in demeanour ah but i wasntthe one who was jealous now was i he huffed noisily and turned away from me choosing to talk to sinistra on his other side i didntmiss the murderous look that woman was shooting out at me smiling at her i turned my attention to my dinner now my feelings on women are that they are generally insane it an opinion that i would not necessarily air to the public not that i necessarily fear what a certain headmistress would do to me but it just generally a safe idea it usually proves to be correct though and with miss mackinnion sudden turn from hating me to joking with me it had just been verified for weeks she had been sleeping with that with black a choice that was so nauseating that one couldntthink about it for too long without feeling the urgent need to empty the contents of one stomach it was a decision on her part that had immediately dropped her down a few levels practically every level with me really and yet the idea of her with that black it was a feeling that was best just ignored didntstop me from trying to talk to her though rectify the way things had been left between us not that i felt a bit of remorse over being sickened over anyone having no thinking about that anything to do with black tends to make me want to find a student and give them a detention for nothing more then walking near me but infuriatingly the woman had been avoiding me if anyone should have been avoiding anyone it should have been me avoiding her all i had intended to do was not apologize just talk her out of what she was mistakenly doing no feelings involved in that to make matters worse as well was the fact that her avoidance of me seemed to make professor sinistra once again think she had a chance now there is nothing wrong with that woman except for the fact that i personally find her repulsive and her attentions are anything if not wanted aine had proven herself useful in that she had kept that woman at bay really the most infuriating thing of all was the fact that black had to look so damned happy all the time now the two of them were probably shagging like rabbits every night so he probably had every reason to be happy i certainly had no feelings on that thought though except revulsion even though i was on the receiving end of a very firm avoidance i still kept my word to that woman i kept an eye on cain montgomery and as loathe as i was to admit it she had a reason to be a bit suspicious of the boy not that i thought he was a young death eater not based just on a rumour that his father had been one no instead i found him interesting based off his almost deathly silent nature my own childhood had been rather quiet i understood being silent this child though never spoke unless he was forced to usually by direct questions in the classroom even i as a student had spoken to people had answered questions in class even had friends of a kind cain montgomery was never seen speaking to anyone his own age no one from his house never answering questions an inquiry to some other teachers proved that it wasntjust my own class that brought about his silence his work in class wasnteven too stellar nor was it too bad he wasntas adept as that annoyingly happy gryffindor kerstan faust with potions but he wasntas bad as certain students i had in the past either but there was really nothing else to suggest he had anything going on in his head other then school work he didntwander off into strange areas of the school that i had ever noticed he never disappeared so my final educated opinion was that he was just an abnormally quiet boy but it was still enough to keep even more of a fixed eye on him i had also completely searched the slytherin common areas for that blasted horcrux why i was even doing something so daft was beyond me it was likely not in the castle not to mention it was such a dangerous thing to look for i am not frightened of you know who that would be something only an idiot would say any sane individual would be scared of him anyone with degree of logic would be i am a logical man no doubt if you went up to black and asked him the same question he would probably laugh and deny any fear i have always known he is rather short on intelligence fear is a normal reaction though not one i would let anyone see of me it is just that i had been a death eater who had turned on his supposed master helped to foil his plans on numerous occasions and in the end had helped to bring about his eventual downfall it was not a history that would stand me in good stead if he returned so why bring myself even further into his likely path of destruction all because that silly girl asked me to no not because she asked me to i just wanted to rid myself of this mark once and for all it was long ago time for severus snape to break free of everyone chains and yet after a month or so of searching nothing had been turned up if she was telling the truth which was likely the case then that dog had already searched the rest of the castle and hadntturned up a single thing either strange as it was for him he had almost trusted me to search where he couldn t occasionally he can have a shred of intelligence it seems it was almost going to be too wonderful to tell him that he had been completely wrong that there was no horcrux in the school almost after all that would mean there was no idea where this horcrux was and if so then no way to get rid of him completely as if those two promises hadntbeen bad enough then i had also promised to try and find a way to break the connection between miss mackinnion and that insufferable gryffindor of course that had only been due to blackmail not even truthful blackmail either i had been tricked by that woman i hadnteven gotten a chance to see her naked one has to admit though that it was such a perfectly slytherin thing to do that research hadntgone well either apparently things were not going well for me lately a boy in my house was being rather suspicious i couldntlocate the one thing to defeat a man who had considerable control over me and i couldntbreak one simple connection between a man i despise and a woman i well a woman i dontcompletely hate it should have been a simple matter but things were complicated by the fact that one of the two people involved was a muggle with no magical abilities and that the connection resulted from a muggle ritual she might not have had any magic but whatever she had used to raise that black from the dead certainly had they couldntbe too far from each other and could feel intense emotions from each other it was likely this connection that had led to their physical relationship as well after all aine had mentioned sharing dreams with him and wanting to help him out damn her and her feelings toward that man just because you bring a man back to life doesntmean you owe him anything not that i cared that the two are sleeping together it just disgusting honestly there is a bit of jealousy there and that was what led to her complete turn around with me apparently she had avoided me for over a month for some nonsensical reason and at the drop of a hat she turned completely and is talking to me again supposedly all because i showed a small amount of jealousy are all women mentally deficient just because my father had been a muggle it doesntmean i am starting to like them she is rather unique though it almost too bad that she isnta witch severus i waved my hand in front of his face you re drifting away arentyou the man had almost walked into a suit of armour it was really quite an odd thing for him to do normally he was so composed collected calm as ice really now though he seemed millions of miles away it was rather interesting to see sort of adorable even were you thinking about how much you love me again i teased him we had left the great hall together both heading to our sleeping chambers helping the students get settled in the slytherin rooms first there hadntbeen too much complaining nothing like what sirius had been saying was going to happen if anyone had listened to him it would have been expected that the students would have all ran away actually the only student who looked uncomfortable had been cain montgomery i might have imagined it but he seemed almost nervous around kerstan it was likely due to his nature being so opposite of the other boy s at my teasing severus blanched and then a decidedly bright red covered his face you re you re blushing another thing to mark on the calendar full fledged tomato coloured blush on one severus snape dont be ridiculous he muttered softly running a hand over his face when the hand had moved his skin had settled back to it usual pale colour have you been rather annoyed with me for sleeping with sirius i asked seriously really i wanted to take advantage of this crack in his mask it disgusting he huffed out his normal answer i know you think that because you hate him but what about the fact that it was me he slept with you would say it was disgusting of anyone sleeping with him silence met my question and i thought that the mask had probably been fixed firmly back into place i didntlike it if you re in love with him though it cantbe helped i almost laughed at that in love with sirius black it was impossible at the moment not that i didntcare about the man i did rather deeply but i didntthink that it was love more like a sense of responsibility toward the person i had raised from the dead and of course there was the fact that i was incredibly attracted to him and the sex was rather quite superior but all of that didntadd up to love i not in love with him i grinned at the surprised look on severus face you wizards really seem to be a bit old fashioned dont you having sex with someone doesntmean i love them i like him sure i find him attractive definitely and i care about him quite a lot i dontthink it love though we ll see what happens after all this business is over i shrugged my newly discovered outlook on life didnthave room for worries about relationships so who do you love then the question did rather catch me off guard from severus of all people you i smiled at him is that what you want me to say his expression had been priceless when i had said that he had fought quit hard to hide it but there had been a flash of joy behind those cold dark eyes i regretted what i had said almost instantly it had been a rather cruel thing to do even if i was grateful to have seen a glimpse of a man behind the mask of course i dontwant you to say that severus practically sneered i care about you as much as i care about sirius i rushed this out to make up for the earlier comment are you going to sleep with me then as well his lips were still twisted in that sneer expecting a negative answer the man confidence really wasntthat strong if you asked me yes i had to smile at the absolutely shell shocked expression on his face of all the possible answers he had been expecting none had been in the affirmative sense he hadntbeen prepared for a yes the mask was slipping so easily these days moments slipped by in complete silence and i cantsay what kind of thoughts were going through the potion master head at that time but if his expression was any judge it was something rather painful i dontwant sirius leftovers i should have been hurt by that comment instead i just laughed at severus i knew you wouldntask me it looks like it ll take a bit more time to get under your armour but it ll happen sevvie after all chinks keep appearing you haventeven slipped your mask on yet it was the truth he was still looking dumbfounded but at my reminder his face slipped back to its usual icy demeanour i was actually rather enjoying these moments the past month had been rather boring sirius was so easy to read he never tried to really hide anything it was a bit of a challenge with severus then he didntknow how to just lay things out in the open his past led itself to deceit and betrayal i know hermione wouldntagree with me but in certain ways he was just as vulnerable as sirius and again in terms of this man it appeared i had some part to play wasntan interesting triangle forming a n ah i really apologize that this chapter has taken me longer then normal but with things being crazy at work and with the holiday season i just haventhad as much time as i would like it also doesnthelp that i got kingdom hearts for christmas and that game is just so addictive but here is the chapter and try not to hate me for it being late i hope everyone had a happy christmas or whatever you choose to celebrate not to mention that your new year eve was fun and that 2006 started off well cheers chapter 37 christmas vacation wasnttoo bad once the problem with severus had been settled though it was rather unsettling for a muggle such as myself to be in a castle as large as hogwarts was with so few people living there though it didntseem that bad not with all the ghosts and the portraits still there but only having six students to watch out after was interesting enough it was actually over the break that i finally gained entrance into the slytherin common room being a teacher i of course always had the right to go in but i thought it was perhaps not the best idea in the world to just push my way into the rooms of people who perhaps werentso overly fond of muggles not that any of them seemed to really hate me but it was just good form to not push the issue i have to say my curiousity had been killing me so i was rather overjoyed when an excuse did come up for me to go in even if the excuse was one that some one should not have been happy about christmas eve of all nights something happened in the slytherin rooms where all the students were staying that had the remaining teachers worried well most of us were worried sirius on the other hand was livid little kerstan had apparently met the wrong end of someone fists or at least that was the obvious conclusion anyone would get just looking at him the boy though maintained that it hadntbeen fists that had hurt him instead his own clumsy nature he had supposedly tripped in the night going to the bathroom owing to the new surroundings it was certainly possible for a young boy to trip in the night the only problem with that excuse was that his face was a motley of blacks and purples his lip cut and his left eye swollen shut it was rather quite a feat for a boy of eleven to cause that much damage to himself only tripping not even falling down stairs and apparently his body had next to no injuries now the real problem with this issue was that there were few suspects to blame this on and it became apparent rather quickly that it had to have been another student the girls couldnthave done it setting aside any stereotypes about women beating up a man there were precautions set up making it impossible for boys to go in to the girl dorm and vice versa and that left only the three boys who were staying with kerstan in one of the dormitories a sixth year from hufflepuff a second year from ravenclaw and cain montgomery when all of us teachers arrived in the slytherin common room it was to find kerstan busy trying to reassure everyone that it had been an accident of his own making and judging by everyone looks it was an argument that was failing miserably all of the students looked concerned for the young boy with one exception cain looked moderately frightened it was the most extreme emotion i had ever seen on the pale slytherin face i hadntbeen the only one to notice it either sirius anger was immediately turned away from the unnamed perpetrator of the crime against his favourite student to the obvious criminal too bad it just happened to be a student in his least favourite house keep your assumptions to yourself professor severus had noticed the turn in sirius anger and was actually trying to stop him from doing something stupid though this had little to do with his fellow professor so much as it did his own concerns for a student in his house i was rather amused with the pause before severus addressed sirius as professor professor snape headmistress mcgonagall had finally made her way into the situation and was regarding it all with a cold regard in one glance she seemed to have assessed everything that she needed to know i am going to take young mr faust here and assure he is alright and i would like you to talk to each of the students i didntmiss the prolonged rest her eyes made on cain so even she thought he had something to do with the beating minds are made up in an instant adults as well as children and the wary looks the young slytherin was receiving from everyone really had already judged him as far as i was concerned i didntknow what was going on but he certainly was acting a bit odd for him which in itself was a bit incriminating i stayed for a little while looking around a bit myself what i expected to find i had no idea it not like there was going to have a large footprint left by an unknown assailant no tunnel to outside no wallet dropped to lead to a suspect it was sad but it was true the only person who could have gotten to kerstan had to be inside the castle so sirius there no possible way that perhaps someone could have gotten in i asked the question as we left the slytherin areas leaving professor sinistra to watch over the students until things had been worked out mcgonagall was still with kerstan and severus was slowly taking each student aside to talk to them it a useless question since we know who did it the statement was snorted out his entire body radiating the fury he felt as he stalked up the stairs well humour me then there was no amused smile on my face at his own statement fine he stopped at the top of the stairs suddenly causing me to run into his back he turned his hands gripping my shoulder to steady me there is a very small chance it could have been someone from outside but to get into the school without us teachers knowing it would have had to have been a powerful wizard are you suggesting that you know who crept into the school to attack a poor eleven year old boy well putting it like that made me sound stupid the frown on my face suggested my own displeasure at this so i like being right there nothing wrong with that there no need to be sarcastic about it i huffed the two of us checked the school despite the apparently small likelihood of someone getting in from the outside it was just something that was better to get out of the way since mcgonagall would likely have suggested it herself best to get these things out of the way part of me hoped to find some clue to an outside intruder partly because i wanted to prove sirius wrong since he had been rather an ass about it and also because i wanted to show that it hadntbeen cain who had attacked kerstan the boy was far too quiet for his own good it was a mark against him the fact that he had nothing to say about the matter that he didnt look particularly concerned for kerstan either was a problem and taking into account that there was really no chance of someone getting in he was the prime suspect after a fruitless search of the castle at least it was fruitless for me sirius on the other hand was practically ecstatic this proved he was right and that a slytherin had hurt a gryffindor pretty much an obvious case for expelling the boy you ve talked to all the boys severus was either waiting for us outside the entrance to the slytherin rooms or he was lounging since it was really next to impossible to imagine him lounging the former had to have been true it showed how important what severus had to say since sirius was actually quiet for once in severus presence he had nothing sarcastic obnoxious or pressuring to say in fact he stayed completely quiet appearing to be actually rather eager for whatever severus had to say though i didntdoubt he was skeptical as well after all he was expecting severus to stick up for his house members exactly the same way sirius did for his own strange that the two had something in common like that and neither of them would notice it or even admit it there is no evidence that any of them so much as touched mr faust i would like to say that i kept the triumphant grin off my face but that would be an obvious lie that that impossible sirius was not pleased with that result we checked the castle there is no indication that anyone else was in here it had to have been someone here which if not the students leaves the teachers are you suggesting it was one of us i cut off sirius before he could turn a problem into a catastrophe especially since i could see where he was heading with that since i thought it highly unlikely that severus would attack a student i didntsee the point of sirius accusing him and starting another fight between the two and anyway there was the look on severus face to deal with something was confusing him one thing that man disliked was not knowing the answer to something what wrong there no indication he paused the confused look getting more pronounce but he slipped back on the cool confident look when he noticed the smirk on sirius face most of the students are certainly not responsible there is one though that is a problem cain i sighed out the young boy name knowing without it being said that if there ever was a problem that he was at the center of it severus just nodded and beside me sirius gave a grunt of accomplishment i controlled the urge to stick my elbow in his side there was no indication that he touched kerstan the problem though is that his mind is too perfectly controlled the others were panicked confused scared which came across in their thoughts montgomery though was perfectly at ease and while i was given entry to his mind it seemed almost as if he was letting me in to see what i want my frown must have said it all i didntreally understand any of this that seems a little surprising for someone his age right extremely even harry the golden boy sirius growled at the obvious sarcasm in severus voice but severus just ignored him even potter was impossible with controlling his thoughts until his seventh year the idea of a first year having this much ability is beyond me he would have had to have either been taught it at a very early age or just have a innate talent for it his father was a death eater right sirius shrugged he was probably taught that along with all manners of curses from the moment he was born they re all like that my eye started to twitch and the movement was matched by one similar on severus forehead both of us were so close to just kicking the canine though it was likely different ideas running through the potions master head sirius first off that a rumour secondly if it true his father died when he was a child who exactly do you expect would have taught him there was a pause from him making me think that he had rethought his argument that perhaps he had accepted i was right that perhaps not all slytherins were automatically evil death eaters out to destroy the world and more importantly beat all the gryffindors my moment of triumph was quick though he a son of one of them likely another one took him in and trained him right there was no arguing with sirius when he was like this his arms crossed and a determined look on his face he had his ideas on things and there was no shaking them gryffindors good slytherins bad we should go see mcgonagall about all this then there another thing severus stopped us before we could move when kerstan was there it was the same thing with him his thoughts were a bit too controlled especially from a boy who had obviously just been attacked this made all of us take a pause including sirius who looked like he been hit on the head with an anvil the idea of a connection between kerstan and cain was unfathomable to him he was the one who was attacked what possible reason would he have to hide his memories my question was a good one one that neither of the men had an answer for maybe he was just covering for cain sirius shrugged deciding that the entire situation was unimportant to him now still doesnttell me how he knows how to do it think about it black severus muttered disgusted with the lack of attention he was getting from the canine you re just trying to put a cloud over the boy to cover for the fact that it was one of your students that attacked him sirius growled at his usual defense whenever severus so much as opened his mouth boys this was not exactly the time for a testosterone explosion i am going to go see the headmistress if you all want you can have your tomcat fight and i ll just explain it wasntsurprising that they hurried to follow me after i started to walk away after all any explanation i would have given to mcgonagall about where the men were would not have been flattering and likely would have ended with some severe words and the woman was not someone you wanted angry with you arriving at the headmistress office she was alone and had just seen kerstan off at the hospital wing a very concerned madam pomfrey had been sure to stay with him just in case yes she had seated herself at her desk i looked sidelong at the sorting hat on the corner of the desk still it really did look rather out of place in her office everything was so neat and tidy a ratty old hat just seemed wrong in the midst of such control severus relayed everything he had learned resulting in a matching expression on her face as had been on ours earlier it wasnttoo comforting that she had little idea of what was going on as we did my idea of a headmaster was someone who knew everything and had an answer for it all granted i was going on my readings of dumbledore back in his day so it wasntexactly fair to the woman no one could be as amazing in the position as that man it was just next to impossible aine i blinked out of my own thought processes since that was pretty much the first time that the woman had ever called me by my first name usually it was professor mackinnion it seemed strangely intimate for her to use my given name yes i want you to keep an eye on the two boys i kept blinking my eyes at her not really understanding what she was telling me you cantwant me to do it there nothing i can do in case anything happens if i thought it possible i would have said she just rolled her eyes at me but the strict looking woman would never do anything as crass as that i didntsuggest you try and solve anything or that in case anything happens that you jump right in i just want you to watch them severus and sirius will be the ones to deal with anything if things take a bad turn there was nothing to do but nod not that it was really such a big deal after all i pretty much was already doing it even though my own reasons were for concern for what harry wanted me to do you are going to listen to her arentyou sirius and i were walking alone down the stairs severus had stayed after us to discuss things with mcgonagall i not stupid you know i huffed at him a muggle versus a wizard what exactly would i do nothing except sometimes you seem to forget that you re just a muggle that comment was almost sevvie like i rolled my eyes such disregard for muggles like we re some subspecies i didntmean i like muggles yes i know you ve slept with tons of them i grinned at him pushing into him gently since he looked worried that i was actually angry with him i shall keep an eye on the two harry and draco already had me doing as much anyway just to be on the safe side the dark haired gryffindor had a little to say about that mainly that his godson should have had him doing the watching i didntsay what i really felt about the matter that it was obvious why i had been the one doing the watching out of the three people who knew what was going on i was the only one who had any degree of neutrality sirius always took the side of a gryffindor and while severus would deny it he did the same thing with slytherins personally i rather liked both of the boys did you want to come in we had stopped by sirius rooms and the suggestion wasntfor a drink or to discuss the students more i took a moment before shaking my head really when offering up something pleasant versus what i had in mind there should always be a pause not tonight sirius i want to talk to cain i ignored his annoyed snort i ll see you in the morning i gave him a quick kiss on the cheek as a small compensation for leaving him down in the slytherin common area sinistra was still watching the children and so obviously not enjoying herself at all the company of students was not high on her list of social interaction though i doubted she ever had too much social interaction for their part the students seemed rather awkward in her presence as well in fact i think they might have hugged me if i wasnta teacher when i told the older woman that i was taking over for her where is severus the tick appeared over my eye again professor snape is still in with the headmistress he likely going to be for most of the night good night professor i didntreally push her out but my hand on her back gently directing her to the door was just as good as really i wasnt trying to get rid of her after all she didntwant to be with the kids anymore so i was just doing her a favor calling him severus really that was not why i was annoyed and i certainly hadntlied it was entirely possible that he was going to be talking to mcgonagall for a good portion of the night well you can all relax now i flopped down on a couch myself once sinistra was gone the students did what i said pretty much they didntreally seem to count me too much as one of their teachers only chauncey had my class i would still easily punish them though hopefully they all remembered that part while it was nice to have a certain buddy buddy relationship with the students i needed to make sure i had a certain amount of control over them is everything all right professor chauncey had perched herself on the edge of the couch judging from the looks of the remaining students she had been elected as their little spokesperson for the question i noticed that cain wasntin the room since he couldnt have left he was most likely in the dormitory area but then why would he stay in here not with everyone obviously thinking the worst of him fine fine you re not going to tell us it was actually an accident an arrogant looking sixth year slytherin girl bit out the comment she had certainly gotten over her shyness around me probably remembering that i was just a muggle and not worth the concern are you an idiot my question threw her and she scowled at me snarling a negative answer at me not particularly thrilled at my suggestion of her mental state right then i didntthink you were of course it wasntan accident but just because we know that doesntmean we know who did it at this statement immediately all four students started up arguing with what i had said it was rather hard to hear exactly what they were saying not when they were all saying it at the same time but the one thing that i did seem to get out of it was that all of them were certain of one thing cain montgomery was the one at fault here even a member of his own house had suggested it showing that he really did not get along with a anyone in his house even is there a reason you think he did it other then the fact that he doesntspeak to anyone they were fighting professor chauncey was the one to elect the information we all heard them this may not have seemed odd to anyone else but to me it really was either one of them arguing loud enough for other people to hear was surprising cain barely even spoke and kerstan just didntseem the type to yell at anyone after all he wasnteven giving up the person who had pounded their fists in his face they were in the dormitory yelling i think we all were just in shock that cain even spoke much less could yell didntreally hear kerstan too much so that made at least a bit more sense did you hear what they were going on about cain was mentioning his father the hufflepuff boy whose name i think was trevor offered up the information he had obviously heard the rumour about cain father since he seemed really nervous about it not that it was surprising no one wanted to associate any death eaters with an attack like this and it seemed like that was becoming the likely scenario i want you all to go to bed now and tell cain to come down would you they all looked a bit skeptical but did what i agreed so i was left in the common room soon though cain came down the stairs no real expression on his face can i help you professor i pursed my lips sitting on the edge of the couch you know before i told you that you could talk to me right he nodded his head but didntseem to eager to share any information strange things have been happening haventthey he didntenter the conversation just staying standing where he was making no move to sit down you were fighting with kerstan would you mind telling me what about not really i wasntsurprised at this response it would have been the end of the world if he had told me anything at all it was about your father and yes i remember that you dontlike discussing him most of all you know i dontcare if he was a death eater or not it not even slightly important and frankly i dont think you so much as touched kerstan for once he looked rather surprised likely the idea of anyone believing him was right outside of his understanding i really didn t knew that i grinned at him the thing that i do think you know though is who did you know that professor snape has a rather skilled ability to read people thoughts right the young boy didntseem even slightly shocked or surprised at that piece of information any other student would be worried or outraged to know that of a student after all it meant that he could read their minds whenever he wanted since they really had no ability to stop a professor of his abilities cain though just stood there waiting for me to finish what i had to say you keep your thoughts too controlled it means you re hiding something and you know how to hide it i dontmake an accusation lightly but i really want to help you since you dontseem to be trying to help yourself rather you seem intent on destroying yourself there nothing i can tell you and the conversation ended rather simply there was no reason to push him after all that would just result in him digging in deeper and there was no real way for me to find anything out without him offering up the information professor thank you he said this and then hurried off to bed well hurried for him meaning walked off at a slightly quicker speed then normal i grinned to myself amused at his gratitude it just showed how everyone else seemed to be treating him the simple act of accepting his refusal of what he had supposedly done and understanding his reticence on certain issues had opened him up a bit not wanting to leave the students alone for an entire night i stretched out on the couch making ready to sleep there a few hours of some truly awful sleep and strange dreams of cows dancing in a field and i woke up to severus entering the room what are you doing here he seemed truly surprised to find me there i yawned sitting up and stretching my arms i wondered briefly how messed up my hair was but there was no point in worrying since of all people severus was the one to care the least making sure they re all okay of course i pulled my arms forward trying to get the kinks from the couch out of them sinistra didntseem too enthused to stay so i offered i grinned at him she really wanted to see you though he slightly winced at his taking a seat in the armchair i had a talk with cain he didntdo anything but he knows who did he told you that of course he didn t i scoffed at the very idea of it even severus had a slight smile on his lips the couch cantbe that comfortable i eyed the piece of furniture i was sitting on with a rather large amount of dislike for all they might say about slytherins i think i had found the root of some of their bad tempered behaviour their furniture was not the most comfortable no but i didntwant to invade the girls dormitory it rather awkward to have a teacher sleeping in the same room if you want to stay close you could stay in my room severus voice trailed off as he said this as if he had just realized that the words had come out of his mouth i just stared at him an amused tilt to my lips waiting for him to explain that away it nearer the students if you really want to stay and make sure they re all right and where would you be sleeping the amusement had made it into my voice and he had now noticed it making his embarrassment grow by leaps and bounds in my room of course he bit out before calming down a bit i should have taken his temper to mean i should stop being amused but instead it just had the opposite effect i am not going to sacrifice my own sleep for you the couch is perfectly suitable i snorted if the couch was anything like this own it wasntgoing to be too big of an improvement but just the chance of getting to annoy severus an entire night was too good to ever pass up and there was always the chance that i could sneak my way into a much comfier bed oh sevvie how gallant of you to tease him more i jumped up and latched onto his arm grinning up at him so you wontmind me sleeping in my all together will you his double take was priceless a n a new chapter sorry if it was a long wait ah damn you kingdom hearts not to mention i also was reminded of the approaching anime boston convention yes i am an anime geek need to finish things for that anyway new chapter hurray now people remember reviewing is good i like reviews lately i ve been getting more then normal and it nice i d love to see more though if everyone would review it would make my year chapter 38 my efforts to sneak my way into severus bed proved fruitless since the man was if nothing else stubborn until he made his way to his bed leaving me to the rather uncomfortable couch which was still better then the slytherin ones he had a rather definite blush covering his face now i say that my efforts to make it into his bed were pushed back at every turn that was true while he was awake at least i had every intention of sleeping on the couch but since it wasntexactly made to let a girl sleep comfortably through the night i couldnt help it that my back was crying out for somewhere a little better the first worry that came to mind was that severus being the worrier that he was would put up a protection on his room for what reason i wasntsure possibly the fear of sirius sneaking into his room to curse him it couldnthave been any fear of any women sneaking in or perhaps not after all i had seen the interest that sinistra showed in him as well as his own shrinking away from her interest so there was a possibility i could get turned into a newt and even if i got better it would still be an experience one does not want to go through but my back was aching and really that overtook my newt fears a tentative step over the threshold into his room revealed that there was no curse placed on it at all a soft sigh escaped past my lips really i had been truly worried about that what does one expect of the cold potions master bedroom i would have loved to have passed through those doors and seen fluffy pink pillows and stuffed teddy bears alas the room matched it owner dark furniture stone walls and floors dark fabric there were some things on the walls but in the dark i couldntreally see what they were likely lists of ingredients for potions or something along those lines things that would be suitably functional instead of pleasing to look at a wardrobe stood in the corner an idea that i found rather amusing since i had known the man he had only worn the same kind of robes an entire wardrobe filled with duplicate outfits i was awakened rather roughly in the morning by a tremendously put out looking man even the red on his face didnttake away from the anger everything else that followed i have to say was worth it just to be able to see him looking mussed in the morning what would you do to see the man hair sticking up every which way personally i risked death in his bed to see it and frankly the sight was amusing enough for me to say i d do it again why why are you in my bed after a quick examination of his appearance and his even quicker hair fixing i yawned and turned over on my side facing away from him you cantgo back to sleep not if you re yelling at me no my voice was partially muffled by the pillow i had stuffed over my head which was then rather annoyingly ripped away you were supposed to sleep on the couch and it was uncomfortable my back hurt i sat up stretching all complaints about the rest of his furniture aside his bed was actually rather soft since you werenta gentleman enough to let me stay in the bed i was being nevermind he threw the covers aside and started to get up off the bed you know i always imagined you wore a nice long nightgown to bed something traditional and frumpy never would have thought you d be a boxers man you donthappen to have a pair with hearts on it do you at my comment he sat back down immediately now a faint blush not only covering his face but also his body as well most of which i could see as well what time is it anyway i mumbled the question out having since put my face back into the pillow the only way to conceal the laughter at his expense 6 in the morning he muttered the answer out busy trying to get his clothes on in a way that showed the least amount of skin possible why am i awake then i groaned burying my head deeper into the pillow and shifting restlessly because i was a little surprised to find you in my bed he turned and eyed me with the covers over me a little warily what are you wearing under there i flipped back onto my back and smirked across the bed apparently the man was remembering my earlier joke about what i wore to bed interested to find out i started to pull the covers away he jumped away forgetting about his own lack of clothing though interestingly enough he didntbother closing his eyes at all grinning at him i pulled back the covers to show that i was still wearing my clothing from the night before you worry far too much sevvie deciding that sleep was a luxury at that point that i was not going to get i slipped out of the bed making sure to yawn loudly to show just how tired i was since i awake now a pointed look at severus i ll go look in on the students make sure no one is dead i started to make my way to the door before a sudden thought paused me where i stood ah we missed it missed what he didntlook up from his task of getting dressed it was rather amazing how quickly the man gained his composure though not all of it he was certainly having a rather hard time with those buttons not with his fingers shaking like that christmas yesterday was christmas and we all forgot about it i sure dumbledore is in the hall having a fit severus shrugged there no real purpose to the holiday anyway all useless presents and fake feelings i muttered to myself thinking of the package sitting on my desk in my room with the damn man name on it talk about making me feel like an idiot for getting him anything you really do need to get laid dontyou i huffed and didnt even flinch at the cold look that got me we give gifts to the people we care about you dolt useless i snorted stamping out of the room the students unlike me were all still asleep as any sensible individual would be during a holiday it didntfail my notice either that cain was sleeping as far as was possible from the other boys kerstan was still absent not surprising really madam pomfrey would have wanted to keep a close eye on him for a day at least not to mention not wanting to let him sleep in the same room as the supposed culprit after checking to make sure no heads were missing figuratively or not i trudged back to my own room with severus awake there was no real worry about the students and i might be able to acquire another hour or two of sleep it was a task that proved to be useless and within only thirty minutes i was up and about not stalking the hallways no that was severus territory after all i on the other hand was just looking around making sure everything was all right though of course if things werentall right what would i have done perhaps screamed and thrown a portrait at them not something i sure any of the portraits would have liked have happened to them being hauled off the wall and broken over someone head will severely impose upon your day it was during this walkabout that i came upon cain apparently he had woken up soon after i had looked in on him and was now walking around the dungeon normally i wouldnthave hesitated to call out to the boy see what he was doing check to see what was wrong if anything instead though i found myself hiding round a corner once again there was something in the way the fair haired boy was moving that lent itself to caution furtive glances that reminded me of the time i had caught him in the off limit area during classes this place though was nothing special just a normal bit of corridor in the dungeons there were not rooms nearby no portraits no suits of armour the only distinction to this area was a stone carving of a serpent in the wall one that could be found in almost all the hallways of the dungeon as i stood back and watched cain said something too quiet to hear from where i stood the snake seemed to respond to the half muttered phrase since it began to move like a real serpent it slid across the wall a few feet and stopped where it stopped the wall opened up a small enclosure i blinked in amazement no matter how long one spends around wizards and all this magic it still amazing sometimes watching a stone snake move was really something to see whether he was taking something out or putting something in i couldnt tell but his arm moved into the area and then out again from where i stood that was really all i could tell anything else was covered by the edge of the boy robes he looked around again making sure no one was there and said something else whatever it was caused the snake to slither back to it original position causing the hole to close again and as quick as it all happened it was over and cain was hurrying back in the direction of the slytherin common areas once he was gone i moved forward to investigate the snake there was nothing for me to see though it was a stone snake nothing spectacular about it not to a muggle such as myself at least it was a question to pose to severus deeming the matter too important for trivial rules of politeness i walked into his rooms without so much as knocking aine about earlier severus started to speak but i cut him off waving off whatever he had wanted to say i just saw cain he made some snake move and a hole to show up in the wall any idea in front of me severus face seemed to brighten up considerably like he had just remembered the answer to a riddle that had been eluding him for months he grabbed my hand and pulled me out of the room heading back to where i had just left it was another date to mark on the calendar severus practically running down the halls not like i need an actual explanation i yanked on his arm as he was still holding on to my hand there was no answer except for a small grunt whether this was from any pain the yanking might have caused or an answer to my comment i cantsay not until we reached the stone snake again you know about pensieves dontyou he asked suddenly i nodded mutely remembering from the books the way wizards could remove memories and then view them later on that anyone could view other people memories with such a device well there a slytherin tradition for the men at least to store one most deserving memory of your time at hogwarts i wontsay it necessarily fond memories but deserving ones i snickered at that the idea of slytherins being all cute and cozy leaving behind touching memories of their time at school was something i couldntimagine especially when taking the two slytherins that i knew quite well into account severus ignored my snickering judging probably rather accurately what i was thinking and continued on explaining i had forgotten about this as a hiding place he stepped in front of the snake and closed his eyes for a moment probably trying to remember the password after all it had been a few years since his own school days gryffindor is the worst house i blinked then i started to laugh uncontrollably that s that it i clutched my sides the great cunning slytherins that was the best you all could come up with a poke at your rival house couldnteven come up with anything a bit more poetic severus raised an eyebrow at me as the snake slithered down the wall i didntthink it up this has been here for a very long time as he said that the hole opened up and i saw inside it he was certainly right judging by the amount of vials sitting in the hole this tradition had been going for at least a hundred years strange to think of the slytherin men as being almost sentimental it would be interesting to know why this little tradition had been started what had been the first memory put in here and for what reason all good questions and the answers would be interesting but alas more important things took precedence does that mean you have one in there i peered in the hole at all the glowing vials wondering which one was sevvie s and more importantly what the man as a young boy had deemed was his most deserving memory of his time at hogwarts that also likely meant that draco had a vial in there somewhere just think of all the blackmail one could have over the young man with that kind of ammunition even harry i sure would have been curious to see what his darling slytherin thought was the most worthy memory never mind that the man barked that out apparently not pleased with what i was thinking or at least the worst that he was imagining i was thinking doubtlessly he was spot on luckily for him though none of the vials were marked with names he pushed vials out of the way looking around before pulling away from the hole with a sigh there nothing else in there regulus didnthide anything in here i had grabbed a vial and was mesmerized by the glowing substance captured within in the glass aesthetic beauty aside it was amazing to think that within the vessel in my hand there was a man memory not even just any memory but one that had held importance to him it was certainly a sobering idea i want to know which one is cain s i said softly that what he had been doing after all putting his own memory in here so i want to know which is his it might prove that he innocent after all my suggestion was met with rather a bit of resistance from severus who after all was a slytherin it seemed that searching through all these memories was almost like invading the privacy of those who had put them there we re both slytherins i rolled my eyes at the expression he gave me i practically one you know i wonttell anyone for crying out loud i dont know anyone to tell sirius wontbe allowed near any of these okay i placed the vial back where it came from we ll just keep it between the two of us all right he grudgingly accepted i knew well enough though that his argument hadntbeen for all the poor slytherin boys who were going to have their memories seen but for himself he was far more worried about me seeing his memory then anything else it therefore had to be suitably embarrassing and made me want to find it even more together we managed to collect all the vials out of the hole and bring them back to severus s a feat in itself since there were rather a lot of them it time for breakfast severus said that shortly probably still not pleased with the idea of me looking at people memories or more correctly looking at his the man was seriously touchy about his personal things yes yes i gave the pile of glowing memories a wistful glance and followed him out of his room we basically escorted the students up to the great hall no one was trusting them on their own just yet apparently i hadntbeen the only one to realize that we had managed to miss christmas with all the commotion this newly realized news didnt help the nasty looks cain was receiving instead they were worse since he was now to blame for the missed holiday in the great hall dumbledore was as severus suggested in a bit of a tiff about us having missed christmas i didntdoubt that he had somehow managed to be filled in on what had happened but that didnt change the fact that he felt that the holiday was one of the more important things to make his point he still had on a festive hat and was busy blowing his own horn in a truly physical sense the hall itself had kept it holiday decoration snow falling from the ceiling and great christmas trees lined along the wall if would ignored that yesterday had been the real date then one could just forget and think today was christmas sirius bounded into the hall wearing a rather odd looking sweater red with a large black dog on the front of it it was strange to think that molly weasley was still making sweaters after all these years but it certainly looked like one of her pieces the overly excited canine ignored the snickers he was receiving from the students or the too amused look from severus and bounced over to me christmas seemed to do wonders for the man this is from hermione he plucked at the sweater apparently the new at least newest weasley had learnt well from her mother in law he dropped a package into my lap and judging by the squishy feel of it i had been included in her knitting frenzy opening it revealed a green sweater with a silver snake curled on it my face lit up but i can easily say that sirius didntmatch my enthusiasm dont know why she gave you that he huffed and pulled off his own sweater leaving him wearing a rather worn t shirt he rather quickly pulled his sweater over my head you ll just wear that one instead i blinked a bit in surprise it all having happened to quickly for me to have argued and once over and done with i found i couldnt argue not with a sweater that smelt like sirius was surrounding me it was rather comforting the man was regarding the green sweater with a bit of disdain and i doubted he would put it on i grabbed it away from him a little worried as to what he planned on doing to something that i had been given as a gift i ll have to write to hermione and tell her thank you here my gift to you sirius grinned and without warning flicked his wand and suddenly a large box dumped itself onto my lap with no small amount of trepidation i opened the package after all the man was known for his jokes inside though seemed to be an entire selection from honeydukes from bertie bott every flavour bean to chocolate frogs and cockroach clusters the later making me squirm just a bit also inside was what sirius explained to me was a quick notes quill i thought it would make it easier for you to do corrections and writing you wrote books before didntyou i stared at him for a moment rather surprised that he had paid attention to what i had said before in passing placing the package aside i jumped up and gave the dark haired man a tight hug are you trying to get me fat i pulled back and grinned at him nodding my head at the box brimming with sweets by now the students had come closer and were staring in awe at the vast array of candy every child dream i would daresay perhaps though i dontthink i need to help you with that he poked my side and i swatted the hand away i think you probably have some other presents in your room hermione came packaged with mine not sure why didntyou see any others in your room last night i shrugged choosing not to respond to any of that i knew well enough why hermione had thought to put my present with sirius s she would have assumed that the two lovers would have opened presents together there would have been quite a surprise to find that i had spent the night in severus bed even if he hadntbeen aware at the time behind me i didntmiss the slight cough from severus he was likely amused by the situation i ll give you your present later there were two things that i didntmiss at that moment the rather excited look on sirius face at that comment or the rather annoyed look on severus cold face the day after christmas became christmas itself that year after all dumbledore would have been inconsolable if we had chosen to just forget about it not to mention the students themselves were rather put out at having been neglected in such a way kerstan had been released from the hospital wing and with the power of magic such as it was there wasnta mark on his face it was like nothing had happened excepting of course the distance they all put between themselves and cain when kerstan went to wish cain a happy christmas it seemed like the entire room froze perhaps it was because they were all worried about what cain would do but for me there was an even stranger tension to the greeting more then ever i was confused over what had happened either way one of these boys had to be lying about something it just happened that i didntbelieve that either of them would ever lie about this something had occurred in the boy dormitory on christmas eve and without a doubt cain had been involved i just didntbelieve he had beat kerstan after all even the victim denied his involvement though the victim also denied being touched at all he wasntthe best witness at the moment holidays are times of joy though so it was all ignored for the time being i sat back and watched as everyone ate their morning breakfast and then the house elves brought all the students presents into the great hall so everyone could open their gifts together under the watchful eyes of us teachers here aine mackinnion i was rather startled by the sudden appearance of dobby in front of me a small pile of gifts at his feet presumably for me thank you and after that the small house elf was gone among the presents for me was the ones i had gotten for sirius and severus there was no doubt i would give sirius his but severus on the other hand had showed a significant dislike for the entire endeavor that perhaps his gift would just stay unopened not to mention i doubted he would want to open it in front of anyone here you go sirius i handed him my own present for him and with more eagerness then all of the students he ripped into the package figuring that the man would want to do some catching up i had purchased a book on modern wizarding history not to be boring though i had also got him a full range of supplies from weasleys wizarding wheezes and some dog care products as a joke are you going to use the brush on me he held up the dog brush an eyebrow raised in humour sure i ll also give you a bath as well i sure you stink as a dog seeming to forget where we were sirius leaned forward and gave me a quick kiss at the rather surprised looks from the students he just grinned and shrugged mistletoe he pointed up at the plant which was indeed hanging over my head my face a little hotter i chose to focus on the presents that had been left for me one was from harry and draco a set of witches robes apparently the two of them had been filled in on the fact that i refused to wear the clothing i wasntsure if was meant as a joke or a suggestion the other package was from my parents by way of harry with a note attached from both aine your mother sent this for you so i send it on to you happy christmas i hope the search is going well but aside from that enjoy the holidays i cantforget the good things now can i i hope you and sirius are getting along well hermione has suggested that you are harry ps draco wishes you well it wasntreally verbal though i groaned at the mention of sirius and i it would of course have come to their attention by now aine i really do wish you were able to spend christmas at home with us but i understand that you can t since i doubt you can get some rather normal things where you are that what i chose to send on to you for christmas your father is well though he complains endlessly that he hasntseen you in over six months i wish you were back just to end the constant complaining we both love you and hope you re safe and well mom i wished the letter would have been longer but there was nothing to be said my mother was never too much of a gossip and without actual news she didntfeel the need to write too much opening the package did indeed reveal some rather normal everyday muggle things that i had been missing without even having realized it i didnt know how i had gone so long without some good pens or without my lucky charms cereal not to mention other things that any girl needed to have across the hall sinistra was busy accosting severus with a present of her own upon opening it with great duress i might add it revealed a set of what had to be potion supplies severus had to show his pleasure with the gift since if nothing else he liked having things he would use this opened up conversation between the two and severus seemed actually happy to have received the gift an idea that annoyed me since his earlier comments about presents this all made me push my own gift for him under my chair determined not to give it to him certainly not at that moment at least one never likes to play second fiddle especially not to a woman like sinistra with presents opened the students were allowed to leave though with the strictest of warnings to stay inside the castle it was something they werentoverly thrilled with but they rather timidly accepted if it had been me as a student i would have snuck out first chance but as a teacher i was happy to see none of the students were like me i gathered all my presents and the unopened one for severus and brought them back to my room after which i had a choice between starting to look through those memories with severus or not not was my choice after all severus was likely far too thrilled with his new potion set to want to be bothered probably had sinistra there to help him sirius my knock on his door got me no answer so i just went in after the change in our relationship it became rather common for me to enter his quarters unannounced though my own were still strictly off limits a girl has to have her privacy at least i found him dozing in the armchair by the fire the book i had given him open on his lap a leg was thrown over the side and his arm trailed over touching the ground i wasntsure how comfortable he was but then the man could likely sleep on a bed of nails if pressed sirius i started to move in closer when his arm snaked out and caught me around the mid section dragging me onto his lap soon after his lips closed over mine should have known you were awake i grinned against his lips the second you walked in i woke up my senses are too good you know how to apparate dontyou beneath me sirius shifted likely trying to get a bit more comfortable his look suggested that my line of question wasntwhere he had intended a conversation to go likely he hadntintended much conversation at all he nodded though waiting for me to fill in the gaps and explain why i had asked the question at all if we leave the grounds we could apparate to harry s i thought it would be nice to visit and i rather sick of staying at the school it was truly a rather irresponsible thing for me to even suggest i was a teacher and i had students to look after not to mention with something suspicious and dangerous just having happened this was not the time to play hooky but all in all i was bit annoyed severus was likely off playing with sinistra and the students werenttrusting me with the truth a slow grin appeared on sirius face a marvelous idea breaking the rules is my forte he jumped up from the chair still with me entangled in his arms luckily though he put me down i was half worried he would run with me in his arms all the way back to london no one will even know we re gone i said softly more to myself then anyone convincing myself of the validity of my actions with no more further discussion my hand was grabbed and i was pulled out of the room the second time in one day sneaking out of the castle proved easy for us teachers and soon we were tearing down the path off the grounds and once safely so apparating all the way to london harry was either going to hug us or hang us upside down to be eaten alive by crows granted there was that third option he could do both a n so i missed draco and harry the story shall take a small detour christmas with the potters or would it be the malfoys hmm oh well a n la la la another chapter and yes i missed draco and harry though mainly draco so i for no real reason whatsoever had them go there though i think i managed to pull out actual important things in the process enjoy and please remember to review reviews are sort of like the blood that i exist on if you dontreview then you re killing me yeah hear that you re basically a murderer can you live with that well can you chapter 39 what are you two doing here sirius and i had surprised draco by appearing on his doorstep with no warning just two large grins to present ourselves with who is it harry voice sounded from behind the blonde slytherin who was looking more then a little put out by our visit i dont doubt that he had a few plans for his day with harry that would be more then slightly put off by our presence well that just happened to amuse the hell out of me and judging by the size of sirius smile it only added to the positive reasons why we should visit the two harry dark haired head popped up over draco shoulder the hair still looking as messed up as the last time i saw him glasses propped precariously on his nose his green eyes glowed happily behind the glass at leas the looked happy to see us sirius aine not helping draco twitching harry basically pushed him out of the way and threw himself at his godfather giving him a large hug i was presented with the same thing only moments later almost getting bowled over by the energy of the greeting apparently he had missed us a bit the mood though changed in just an instant shouldnt you be at the school green eyes narrowed behind glass at the two of us and without even thinking about it we both started to shuffle a little nervously almost like two children who had been caught creeping to the kitchen in the middle of the night for some ice cream my live or die reflex okay in this situation is was more of a live or guilt reflex kicked in quick enough though well i just thought you might want to spend the holiday with your godfather you know with him having been dead for so long a dramatic sigh scuffing the ground with my shoe innocently next to me sirius seemed to have understood what i was doing since he was giving his best impression of an abandoned puppy a snort showed that draco was having none of it easily seeing through the facade his dearly beloved gryffindor lover though was rather susceptible to the guilt and was at that moment trying rather hard to apologize to his recently resurrected godfather i didntmean it like that sirius of course i glad to see you just come in you can have dinner with us the best way to get out of a bad situation guilt at least a situation for which you are at fault not that it particularly a nice thing to do after all one shouldntmake someone you care about feel guilty but i am after all rather terrible at times and i didnt want to get sent back to the school just yet wasntin the mood to deal with all those rather serious issues again right now that was rather sly draco walked next to me all of us on our way to the kitchen sirius was in front with harry who it appeared was still trying rather hard to make up for any perceived slights rather slytherin wasntit i nudged draco in the side i sorry if we re ruining any special plans you had with poor innocent harry going to corrupt him for christmas my answer from the aristocratic blonde was a knowing smirk my dear muggle harry was corrupted a very long time ago there was no real reason to follow up on that one after all some things are just generally best left up to the imagination or in this case left to be ignored and never thought of again as i ve always thought with this house the kitchen is the most liveable room in it really it the only place within the horrid walls that i really would want to spend anytime actually other then the time i had spent unconscious in sirius old bed it pretty much was the only place i had spent time in the two didntseem to worry about the rest of the house though i was sure that the two would have probably done something with their room as for the appearance of the rest of the place it was in disrepair dusty antiquated and just plain terrible it was as if the lives of the former owners permeated it causing one to feel really rather at unease in the place as i always felt being here i was amazed that anyone could live here and feel anywhere near comfortable how was your christmas harry had us sit down at the table going to prepare the tea ah well that was going to be an interesting and long question to answer sure the short answer was that we were celebrating christmas a day late but then that opened the door for the next question the reason why christmas had been missed is something wrong harry face was anxious as he poured the tea now i cantsay that i am a big fan of tea but when in rome she came here to get away from all of that sirius said calmly sipping his tea so let not talk about that right now really i had to stare at sirius after all he was being almost sensitive and it appeared that for the moment at least harry was letting the matter slide draco too even managed to keep his mouth shut though his expression said volumes about reopening the matter and he was basically going to get that after all what had happened could prove to be important the long and the short is that we re celebrating christmas today so where are our presents sirius was grinning at harry and draco one looked amused by his joking comment the other eye was starting to tick no presents but you can have dinner here might not really be christmas but at the least it is boxing day so still a holiday so we might be able to give you presents if you are our servants draco was smirking as he drank his tea really it rather a talent to be able to do that i ignored the glaring contest that was now occurring between the two cousins and instead focused my attention on harry who it appeared was doing the same as me so those robes ah those well hermione had told me you werentwearing the standard clothing i thought it was rather amusing they were nice too just in case you ever feel like wearing them i was just worried you might be hinting to me to actually wear them really there should have been a warning going off in my head at that moment when i saw a smirk inch it way up harry face well you could always wear it to your wedding you think a black witches robe would be suitable for that i laughed but my face froze what wait why are we discussing my marriage what marriage suddenly an arm draped itself across my shoulders sirius face suddenly in close to me he suggesting that since you ve besmirched my pure reputation that you must do the honourable thing you re going to have to make an honest man out of me next to me he was busy fluttering his eyes at me the idea of sirius as a virgin who needed to be made an honest man of was enough to make me laugh after all when asked what word you would equate with the man anything remotely similar to pure and innocent were immediately thrown out if anyone it should have been me who was being made an honest woman there is going to be no wedding i said it firmly just in case anyone actually thought there was a chance more importantly incase sirius got any ideas from this a flash of disappointment crossed harry face i didntmiss that his feelings were the same as hermione s both wanted the best for this man that they cared so much about it just happened that they both seemed to equate his happiness with me well we re working on that sirius shrugged seemingly uncaring about my statement so dinner i changed the subject deliberately yes yes you can both stay i think i even have some wizard crackers left until it was time for dinner all of us decided to spend some time playing cards even draco was prevailed upon to play those this could have been due to harry rather sly comment that perhaps his lover was afraid of losing to sirius i rather shamefully lost every single round of cards that we played not that i a bad player but apparently these boys were just better at it or more correctly harry comment had started up a world war like confrontation between sirius and draco that left no room for anyone else to win as harry suggested he did in fact have some wizard crackers left now being that my parents came from scotland i am fully versified in the art of crackers every christmas we had them and every christmas we had a picture taken with the rather silly looking paper crowns of varied colours on our heads but that experience did not prepare me for what someone with magic would make of such a simple thing they looked normal enough but then with so many things i was finding in this new universe looking normal didntnecessarily translate first off instead of a normal popping sound when they were pulled instead they left of harmless small sets of fireworks that alone would have made my day but the stuff that piled out of the little objects was enough to make me wonder once again in awe at magic instead of dinky little paper hats instead out popped normal hats one would wear to a fancy dress party harry had a jester hat sirius was rather proud of his cowboy hat mine was a policeman s and much to draco dismay he had a rather ostentatious girl bonnet since it was a tradition to wear the hat you got you could see draco predicament feeling the smallest amount of pity for the man i traded hats with him pity not to mention being able to use this against him in the future and then of course there was the prizes that came out normal crackers would have had a bottle opener or a set of pencils but these took that idea and multiplied it by a hundred mine for example had six pack of butterbeer with a bottle opener i want to have these every christmas i passed out the butterbeers to everyone do you think anyone would notice if i stole some not so much of an issue as what muggles would think of it harry was doling out the food to everyone plate my mind immediately associated this image with that of my mother doing the same on christmas it was a thought that was best left in my head no guy really likes to be called feminine even if meant in the best possible way dinner was delicious even disregarding sirius and draco frequent comments comparing harry cooking to my own i didntsee what they meant when they said that this meal at least was edible my cooking was nothing if not spectacular my thought on the matter just got me two amused looks and the response that it was spectacularly unedible i let it slide mainly due to the fact that it was one of the only times i ever witnessed the two of them agreeing about something so now what happened we were all still in the kitchen at the table which had been cleaned off of the plates the men all had a glass of firewhiskey but i just kept my butterbeer i didntpretend that i had no idea what harry was asking christmas eve someone attacked little kerstan faust he denies that it happened but his face says differently and the prime suspect is cain montgomery i just dontbelieve that it was him harry and draco were paying diligent attention while sirius was frowning and fingering his glass at the least he was at least staying quiet as i explained everything that had happened likely best for his welfare really he knew my feelings on the matter hence why we had run away to this house today well the interesting aspect of this is that their memories are both so well ordered to be what they wanted to be seen it not something a first year should be able to do yes according to sevvie i blinked as i said the name i dontthink the man would have been too pleased with me using that nickname in this company draco looked like he was filing that away likely going to use it on his older head of house at a laer date according to severus you didntget a handle on it until your seventh year my slip of the tongue got me a very odd look from harry who looked really less then pleased with my familiarity with his hated old professor for a change draco seemed to be rather pleased with the idea of me being close to the man and yes he was definately filing all of this away for later i on the other hand was annoyed with myself for having brought him up at all yes well i sure professor snape rarely has anything nice to say about me harry bit back a growl from his voice though it was easily recognized he happens to make the correct point though it suspicious for both kerstan probably just has a knack for it sirius finally voiced his opinion standing up for his favourite student and then the same could be said for cain i narrowed my eyes at him once again we were starting to have this same argument it would have gone on all night if harry hadntstepped in stop it suspicious for both or it could be nothing there was a strain to his voice suggesting that this last idea he wasntreally believing when the dark lord is gaining power people have been killed and a horcrux is missing then you dontreally ever believe in coincidences especially when dealing with something like this just keep an eye on the two of them draco started to speak but sirius cut him off dont worry cousin i ll keep a firm eye on the two i was talking to aine draco sneered completely disregarding his older cousin the blonde was taking the same approach as the headmistress had entrusting me with this it was rather pressuring once again harry and i blocked out the battle of wills going on the other side of the table i sorry that i putting more upon you then i intended really when all this started i just meant for you to teach since you cant leave sirius side but his green eyes darted to his godfather and he had a whimsical smile his prejudices are a bit hard to get over the same for all of us really you on the other hand really went in with a pretty much clean slate at the very least you liked slytherin as well as gryffindor though i do have a rather unhealthy disdain for hufflepuff i shrugged trying to joke with the situation well they have their good points even if the hat songs never really convey that too well you re not kidding and hufflepuff said she d take the rest makes them sound like the real picks of the litter doesntit harry just laughed this attack it worrisome but for now it doesntseem to be connected to our problem just keep an eye on the students those two in particular his eyes darted once again to his disreputable godfather who was at that moment threatening draco with a fork try looking after that kid as well my fingers started to tap over the table harry my voice dipped low wanting to make sure sirius didnthear what i was going to say about me and sirius i know you all seem to want something don t harry cut me off raising his hand to accentuate his point i wontlie about wanting it but that your business i like him i didntneed to continue but i wanted to get this off my chest with him i like someone else as well professor snape right harry looked like he had a bad taste in his mouth showing exactly what he thought about anyone liking his most hated professor i cantstand that man it true but it your deal he cantbe too bad if you like him now his eyes slid to draco warming as they did not to mention he loves the man even if he will never admit it just be careful as you go you might just end up hurting both men my lips pursed as i thought about this all really all too pressuring harry sirius called out to his godson seeming done with his little war with draco who was examining his nails aine thinks someone else broke into the school it obviously wasntvoldemort himself are there other death eaters around termites there was a distinct sneer on the young man face as he answered they never go away some escaped capture probably a lot we just didntknow about either it looked at that moment that there was something else that the young man wanted to say his mouth opened to say it but nothing came out his eyes darkened considerably a hooded look to them now i wasnt the only one who noticed harry tell me sirius voice was gentle but still firm the main one that got away i looked for her for years but never got anywhere immediately with harry pained look draco was out of his chair and by his lover side whispering in his ear likely telling him he didnthave to tell this but the gryffindor was adamant to finish sirius bellatrix is still out there my eyes flashed to sirius immediately his jaw had tightened with just the mention of his cousin name undoubtedly the pained look on his face was due to memories flashing in front of his mind eye memories of his death by her hand never having met the woman i still wanted to rip her throat out nothing too horrible i think it about time we got back to the school sirius got up from his chair i thought stayed still staring up at him my heart on my sleeve as they say really i was worried how this news was going to affect him he just shrugged and pulled me up out of the chair pleased to see you worried about me but it fine seeing as how there was really nothing to argue and the fact that the man is singularly one of the most stubborn men i know pretty much all the men i know are like that i just quietly agreed with him we both said our goodbyes to the two but harry eyes didntlose that worried look even as he closed the door behind us i could feel his worry for his godfather sirius he had apparated the two of us back to hogsmeade and we were making our way back to the school normally i am perfectly fine with quiet but now it was just rather oppressive and my mind was thinking back to when i had read those books about sirius death about the horrible woman who had done the deed i couldntthink why this piece of information had slipped my mind fallen through the cracks as it were i had read the books i knew that she had escaped at the end of the last one but since it hadntbeen brought up before i had not remembered it i said not to worry well i worry about you i huffed quietly is that a problem he stopped and before i had a chance to so much as glare at him he had pulled me into his arms holding me tightly it was rather surprising really there was no heated kiss no sly movement of his hands to inappropriate areas this was really rather a desperate gesture that had an effect on me right then and there he was like a lost child one that no matter what i had to protect everything will be all right my hands stroked his back even as i said the empty words telling someone that everything is okay fine is useless it never true and it almost never actually makes the person feel better but i had nothing else to say so falling back on old cliches was my best option while we were in this silent position him desperately clinging to me while i whispered meaningless but reassuring words to him a thought strayed through my mind a rather disturbing little nugget of information that if proved correct would certainly not help matters at all instead only making things much much worse sirius i pulled away from him gently keeping my hands on him though knowing that he needed to feel me to be sure i was still here i fine he took a deep breath wavering though it was and stepped out of the reach of my hands looking firm on his feet and not the broken child he had just been i had a rather disturbing thought i took a deep breath wondering if this was really best to mention to him but deeming it ultimately necessary that visit we had to hogsmeade you i mean we both felt something odd a presence it was the same one we had felt in london before coming to hogwart wasntit sirius looked perplexed for a moment before nodding his dark locks shaking you had said it had felt familiar i left this sentence hanging not really wanting to finish it but the man was more astute the most people myself included gave him credit for once i had said this immediately he understood my meaning his forehead bunched up in thought like he was trying to remember something her that what it was he had found that missing link in his memories i would have said he was happy if it wasntthe material we were dealing with that presence that felt familiar was it bellatrix it felt like her he said this last quietly mostly speaking to himself trying to figure it all out likely there was a sense of anger with himself for not having realized this earlier she was in hogsmeade she could have gotten into the castle on christmas eve i had merely suggested this to finally stop the suspicion for the attack from lying on cain but it had a unwarranted result aside from that the silver eyes opened wide he looked like he had been hit by a ton of bricks in his mind the guilt was striking him over and over again if this was right if she had been the one to attack kerstan then it was his fault if he had made the connection earlier sirius i reached out desperate to break this before it got worse then i could handle depressed the man was almost impossible to handle and impossible to be around i always found myself doing everything for him when that happened you didnteven know she was still alive how could you have made the connection then it certainly not your fault i almost bit my tongue for what i said next i could be wrong as well it might not have been anyone on the outside this was just to allay his guilt but i was basically suggesting that he had been right and that cain had been responsible it was something that i didntfeel at all no this brings doubt on all that i could tell it took a lot for him to admit a mistake even if his words were careful to say that it was a possibility he certainly hadntaccepted for a fact that cain was innocent that would be impossible he was a slytherin after all they are always up to no good which granted had a slight ring of truth to it up to no good though didntmean attacking anyone let get back to the school i smiled trying to lighten the mood grabbing his hand together we walked the rest of the way to the school our entry though was met with a potions master that looked like he was practically going to set fire to the building and upon seeing our linked hands the likelihood turned to us being the ones set on fire next to him was a less then pleased headmistress at least she though didntlook like she was going to turn our insides out on to the floor her eyes merely flickered to our entwined fingers before staying hard on our faces you abandoned your positions for most of the day without telling anyone for some reason when mcgonagall said it it sounded far worse then it looked in my head we went to see harry i wanted to visit my godson and aine of course had to go sirius normal smooth smile way on his face and when he said my name he squeezed my hand his smile becoming almost predatory my own expression was slightly annoyed since i had seen his eyes flicker to severus before the statement as usual this was part of his little show for the man though for my own part i still had memories of severus being so enthused about that present from sinistra so i was fine going along this time the result was that i smiled up at sirius rather adoringly which i think rather threw him for a loop that was fine but you need to tell me mcgonagall i dontthink would ever admit that she was affected by sirius smile but she certainly turned from being angry to acceptance rather fast headmistress is that all you re going to do they left the students and went off on their own to to have a little lover tryst severus eye was seriously ticking as he practically yelled this i say practically since the man didntreally yell but for him it was damn near close professor snape the matter is in my hands they have been warned and that that she ignored any further admonishments from severus i hope harry is all right he great headmistress sirius smile broadened good good with no other word she walked back into the great hall left alone with two competing males was not a fun circumstance luckily or not though severus spared one more disgusted look for me an angry glare for sirius and hurriedly walked off to the dungeons it brought to mind a child stomping off after not getting what he wanted certainly amusing enough to file away for a later date just in case severus needed to be reminded of the time he stomped off sulking time for bed i started to pull away from the dark haired gryffindor but his grip tightened on my hand he pulled my hand up to his mouth kissing my fingers softly such a simple gesture and it was still managing to send shots of electricity up my arm with each touch of his lips stay the night with me and there was that look again that broken look that really is impossible to deny the one that had gotten me in trouble in the first place that need to stay and protect the man was bringing me forward was pushing me up on my tiptoes was brushing my lips over his for better or worse my touch seemed the only thing to be able to heal him i spent the night putting back the missing pieces among other things of course a n well thank you to everyone who is still reading this remember if you like it or hate it please review also i still want to hear who people want harry to end up with so far the top two are ginny and draco such a tense race heh i am also trying very hard to keep my chapters a bit shorter then they have been for some it just hard to find a suitable break point this chapter was supposed to be much longer but i broke it in half i ll try and keep the chapters at 3 000 words at most enjoy chapter 4 black would be a good colour to paint my ceiling then i could get some of those little glow in the dark stars and place them all over make them into the constellations it was an idea i had when i was a child but my parents had never let me do it now staring up at my ceiling in my own bedroom in my own flat trying very hard to not think about other things that was the first thing that popped into my head i could do the entire room like i had wanted as a child granted my tastes had changed since i was eleven years old i didnt want murals of unicorns all over anymore but the ceiling thing i think is still a good idea it would undoubtedly be a very calming thing to look up and see stars on your ceiling of course if i were a witch i could probably enchant the ceiling to actually show the night sky there was something like that at hogwarts according to the books damn it that was exactly what i was trying not to think about i sat up angrily swinging my feet over the side of the bed running my hands over my face trying to wipe away the thoughts with the motion it wasntworking of course now that my mind had latched onto the magic idea my brain was going with that and all the things i had been trying to push back were coming to the front again harry potter was a reality the books had been real at least to a certain degree and their author was in reality a squib she didnthave any magical ability herself but she had grown up surrounded by those that did as well as the story of the greatest wizard of her time the great harry potter things hadntbeen going too well for the reporter and she chose to use the events surrounding her to write a series of books to sell to the muggles no muggle would believe any of it was true and that was what had happened the harry potter book series had been an instant bestseller a classic children series that had crossed over all sorts of barriers old people loved them children males females every race imaginable it was truly astounding the books had spawned movies video games hundred of thousands of fanfictions on the internet and all because of the true story of one boy life i had met harry potter two months ago and that was when i had learnt about the greatest trick pulled on mankind ever us muggles had no idea that we were reading about a reality it was disturbing to think that we hadnteven realized how close we might have been to a horrible reality of voldemort in charge it would not have been a pleasant world but he had been defeated that was how the books had ended truth happened to be a bit different the young genius wizard had informed me of the truth of the situation lord voldemort had left behind one more horcrux that was hidden and only one man could help find it sirius black too bad for the good side that he had been dead for quite a while which was where i came in my field of expertise is the occult and all that deals with it especially relics and rituals so i have been asked to bring one sirius black back to life so that he can hopefully remember where his evil dead brother hid a horcrux a horcrux we donteven know the shape of or if sirius black would even know where it is i buried my face in my hands once again this was the thought that kept me from sleeping well over the last two months none of this made me very confident i trusted harry well enough after all he had done great things in his seven years at hogwarts but now he was trusting too much in luck but i suppose he didnthave too much of a choice i got up from my bed stretching wearing only a pair of black silk shorts and a tank top it was august in new york and the weather was too hot to wear real pajamas if i wasntafraid of random people showing up in my fireplace i might have been tempted to just wear nothing at night the thought of cairn finding me naked in bed though had killed that thought quickly enough i liked the weasel eyed man but i didntthink we were close enough for that sort of situation i padded quietly to the kitchen realizing that i wasntgoing to get any more sleep that night once again i would find myself awake half the night a glass of water firmly in hand i went over to my kitchen table and plopped down in a chair there tugging at the messy ponytail i had put my brown hair up when i left the bed i was sipping my head and staring at the things that were on the table i found that i did this most nights when i couldntsleep so in other words i did this every night i sat here at my kitchen table and stared with a great deal of concentration at the supplies for a horrific ritual sitting there rather calmly on my mundane kitchen table piled on the table were all the things i needed for the ritual to bring sirius black minus one the clag a bh is and it was that other thought that helped to keep me from sleeping somewhere in england harry potter had that other object it was good that i didnthave it as scared as i was of it my fingers still sometimes itched to feel the wood over my skin it was not a safe object in the slightest if you believe in dark magic then that would be a good example of a relic of such magic but i dontthink it really is that but it purpose is not right i dontagree with bringing back the dead but i had been hired by the boy that lived and i couldntdeny that his purpose was righteous enough i also had gotten a firm idea of him from our couple hours together if i didntdo this ritual he would do something else and i certainly didntwant that on my conscience not if he got desperate tried to attack voldemort and ended up dead that tragedy aside it wouldntbode well for me either or any one else for hat matter so i had agreed sometimes i still feel a bit sick about that it hard not to with what i ve seen over the years resurrection of the dead never brings back what you want it to but being honest with myself all the rituals i had seen were basic and very primitive i had the clag a bh is to help in this according the legend it was a supreme object of mystical power when it was filled with human blood any one could be brought back to life no doubt you could bring jesus back if you wanted there though was a large problem with this artifact this ritual it required blood human blood enough to fill a cylinder about a foot long i was grateful at least that it didntrequire death just a lot of blood it also required quite a few other things things that i had spent two months preparing and searching for and now two months later they sat here quite innocently on my table there was a ritual dagger of course i had bought it in a little magic shop on a back street in the city that had been simple enough the dagger itself wasntoverly important as long as it was made of silver the real problem had been the preparation that had to be made to it it had the be cleansed in a clear lake in the moonlight of a full moon and left there for a month this had been one of the main reasons why i had to put off the ritual for two months i had only just retrieved the dagger a few weeks ago it hadnteven been the hardest of the ingredients ground bones of a human had been a problem i am sure that the original users of this spell probably killed people to retrieve their ingredients but i didn t and in today day and age one simply doesnthave to go that far all i did was purchase a teaching skeleton i am a teacher after all that hadntbeen too suspicious it was just greatly disconcerting to sit at this very table a pestle and mortar in hand grinding a human finger into dust then there was the chalk i needed couldnthave normal sidewalk chalk of course no everything in this ritual had to be special purified i had to actually find a pure piece of calcite without human touch that part had been fun i had spent a rather dirty day mucking about in a quarry up in the north of the state trying to find the purest piece of white calcite i could and making sure that it had never been touched by another human it was fine for me to touch it since i would be performing the ritual but the worst really had been the dirt i had to fly down to hawaii an expense i didntmind due to the money i was getting from harry and go to one of the volcanoes i had to find soil with a specific composition of carbon in it it hadntbeen really hard work just extremely tedious i had a lab taste a vast amount of samples looking for one with the exact composition i needed it had taken three weeks of testing though a vacation in hawaii had been nice and now all four things sat on my table in the quiet of the night i could hear the drumming of my fingers over the oak the only three things i needed was the clag a bh is the words for the ritual and the location of the body of one sirius black harry had the first i firmly had memorized the words and the location would come later a rather loud bang brought me streaming to my feet and i rushed into my living room to stare at the large cloud of dust billowing into the room from the fireplace i waved my hand to try and clear it and when most of it had settled cairn stood in the middle of it looking surprised to see me before he blushed and looked away i looked down and noticed that perhaps my shorts and tank top were a bit skimpy for someone like cairn he got embarrassed quite easy apparently i apologized and quickly ran into my room sliding on my bathrobe even as i realized that it was too warm for it but it was better to save cairn a few blushes then to be hot for a short while when i reentered the room he seemed relieved my lips twitched until i remembered the time cairn it only three in the morning sorry it the time difference he looked around almost to check and make sure nothing else was in the room with them it was like he was expecting a dementor to come round the corner when this wasntthe case he relaxed and exited the fireplace it the beginning of the month and harry wanted to start as soon as possible you said it was okay didntyou i sighed but had to nod my head of course in england it was a suitable hour in the morning and it wasntsurprising that the boy wonder wanted to get started immediately maybe i should have reminded him of the time difference i knew i should have been worried about strange men showing up in the middle of the night cairn certainly qualified as strange though at least this time he was at least wearing a normal wizard robe even if he was a squib thank god i had decided against sleeping in the nude it a good thing i not tired i led him into the table and gestured for him to sit down all those things on the table are for the ritual i perfectly set to perform it when he reached to touch the dagger i slapped his hand away he looked a bit like a child caught with his hand in the cookie jar so i smiled at him sorry but they re purified and cantbe touched by anyone other then me sorry he mumbled under his breath and i couldntreally quite control the urge to pat his head he reminded me of a dog i used to own when i was a child it had been a small schnauzer that always had it nose in places it wasntsupposed to be at the pat on his head he looked up at me a surprised grin on his face i had to wonder if he ever was shown much affection it was a little odd to me though since he was still quite a bit older then me but in terms of personality i couldntshake the idea that he was much younger then me i looked around stay here i going to have a quick shower get changed and then we can leave all right try not to get your nose stuck in anything he looked a bit confused not surprising it was just that earlier impression of my old dog coming to the surface again i walked out of the room shaking my head when i came back in it was to see cairn staring into the fridge amazed at all the foods staying cool in there he really was like my dog i pulled him out of it and sat him down at the table once again i dropped a backpack on the table i didntexpect to be in england for more then a day or two the ritual itself would only take one night so i had only packed a few clothes and i now used them to carefully wrap the items on the table and pack them into the bag once that was done i smiled slightly at cairn who was fidgeting where he sat what do wizards use to keep food in i asked a bit curious he obviously hadntseen anything like a fridge before so that was out of the question our food is kept in a room it magically enhanced to keep certain foods in it cold he tilted his head it actually a lot like your white box there it a fridge cairn i chuckled softly us muggles do have to get by somehow he looked a little lost at that point i suppose i basically a muggle after all i donthave any magic i pretty much useless i sat down across from him and looked at him seriously his hair was hidden under a baseball cap again and his narrow features were looking a little worn things must have been hard in his life to look this tired perhaps he wasnteven as old as i had assumed cairn how old are you 25 i doubled over coughing hard at the sound of surprise that had tried to escape from my throat instantly cairn was up and patting me on the back as he had done in london i looked up at him my eyes wide in shock he was younger then i was but he looked so old i surprised myself by reaching out to hold one of his hands noticing now the unlined skin on it narrowing my eyes on his face this close it was easier to tell that what i had assumed was his age was due to deep stress lines on his face and the wearied expression in his eyes what happened to you it was blurted out before i thought it through blushing instantly i shook my head sorry nevermind anger or embarrassment would have been expected but cairn was actually smiling at me back when i was 15 i was kidnapped by lord voldemort or more exactly his cronies there was no rhyme or reason for it it was just the death eaters wanting some amusement i was kept in a dark room for what i was later told was a month they tested certain ideas out on me i was saved by harry when he finally came to stop voldemort and that is why i would do anything for that man while talking about it cairn got a distant look in his eyes but there was also a degree of determination to it i didntdoubt he would do anything for harry potter part of me wanted to ask what they had done to him but that would have been unkind of me making him relive something that was obviously extremely painful of course it wouldnthave been pleasant to hear about either but it was sometimes hard to control my researcher instincts it was a part of the story that woman never got a hold of not that it would have made good reading for a children book the torture of a young boy i really suspect that harry actually had a hand in keeping that part out of the story i found myself squeezing his hand trying to offer a small amount of affection for the person i now realized was younger then i was the story made me want to protect him i didntdoubt this was exactly what harry felt as well you remind me of an older sister cairn said softly his face flushed from the touch of my hand on his i grinned brightly up at him i never had a younger brother if you want the job you re welcome to it though i have to say i shall expect extravagant christmas presents he laughed and i felt for a moment there that it might have been the first real laugh that had made it past his lips in a very long time it warmed me to be able to do that for him i jumped up and on impulse gave him a sisterly hug so little brother should we head back to london then i dontwant to cause harry to have a hissy fit he snickered slightly at the idea of his saviour having a fit but he hugged me back before pulling away well it is important to get this ritual done soon he tried to sound serious but his lips were still smiling and for once cairn wasnt fidgeting needlessly i tilted my head at him all set to go then i shouldered the bag and marched purposefully into my own living room cairn following after me i stood by my fireplace and waited for him to pull the envelope out of his robe pockets he held it out to me and reaching in i grabbed a handful of the dark powder are we going to the leaky cauldron then no 12 grimmauld place that where harry is living that is where you ll be staying as well that didntsound too pleasing from what i remembered of that house in the books it was old dirty and filled with nasty house elves and screaming portraits but i didntintend to be there more then one night i took the powder and threw it down winking at cairn before stating the name of my intended location and then in a flash i was gone a n new chapter well i have to say i a little saddened at the lack of reviews again but oh well i could stop writing this but it my obsession so that unlikely to happen thank you to everyone who been reading this chapter 40 professor chauncey caught me coming out of sirius rooms not that it worried me i was cool and composed a ready lie on my lips i did not just come out of sirius rooms well there was a ready lie it just wasnta good lie the look she gave me was rather surprised a quick glance at the door made me groan softly before i had said anything the girl had been completely in the dark as to where i was anyway what can i do for you i coughed softly distracting here from my stupid mistake well i saw you and i was wondering she tugged a lock of her red hair whatever she was thinking made her at least a bit nervous self consciously i tugged on the sleeves of my blouse it was a little uncomfortable since it was the same shirt i had worn the night before and generally i wasntoverly thrilled wearing a piece of clothing two days in a row i started to head down to my room positive that chauncey was going to follow me are you still reading those muggle papers is there something odd again before i had basically told her off for reading muggle papers and connecting the dots even though i had been well aware that she was right well she was nervous about it again fidgeting as she walked next to me look i sorry about basically telling you off about reading the papers it fine i just didntwant you to get too involved with anything i hadntrealized you were staying here for christmas either that fine she laughed softly i not staying here because i donthave a family or anything like that i staying because i had wanted to look into this stuff with the muggles her voice dropped slightly my parents arentoverly enthused with things muggle related a shrug was all i got after that comment truly lovely it would likely be hard for a die hard muggle supporter like chauncey to have parents who seemed to think of us as sub species so did you want to talk to me about what happened between kerstan and cain yes did you see something i stopped immediately looking at the girl expectant no sorry i sighed and continued to walk again we re all a bit worried about it though you all dontseem to be doing anything about it stopping again i looked at her hard we are doing something about it as much as we can kerstan denies anything happened the rest of you seem to think cain did it personally i dontbelieve that there is no indication that anyone broke into the castle so what are we supposed to do next to me the red headed gryffindor was pouting tugging again on her hair probably thinking about what i had said well thank you for telling me that much professor sinistra basically told us to shut up when we asked as if it wasntour business she huffed next to me couldntsay i blamed her after all sinistra was hard to deal with and certainly not forthcoming about really anything so there nothing else that wrong no strange burglaries or anything really i hoped that there wasn t i dontthink i could deal with anything else at the moment no still looking into the other ones though the newspaper occasionally updates on the search for the missing items but it looks like nothing really important was stolen which is why it was really weird well nothing important unless you knew what a plain wooden object was for that good then the red haired girl nodded still following beside me miss cooper yes when i stopped she looked at me expectantly if possible could you try and get the other students to lay off cain i know it likely they ll all still believe he did it but he didn t okay she looked a little uncomfortable with my request probably because she was one of the people to believe that he had committed the crime after a long pause though she agreed to try ah hello professor we had made it to the dungeons stopping as severus appeared in front of us chauncey had tried to be nice polite to the potions master but it wasntsurprising that the man barely even grunted a greeting in response i was still remembering his giddy joy about getting a present from sinistra and it appeared that he wasnttoo thrilled with me either sensing a particularly unhappy vibe chauncey made her exit so did you have fun with black last night there was no masking the sarcasm in his voice did you have fun with sinistra of course there was no masking the sarcasm in mine either the two of us had walked down to severus office our problems aside we had a lot of memories to go through it was a task important enough to put aside out differences and work together toward a positive finish but that didntmean we couldntharass the other and generally make their lives a living hell you should probably see poppy being in your company isntgoing to kill me severus i was referring to the likely need of rabies shots he bristled i bristled back in general there was rather a lot of bristling i didntspend any more time then was necessary with sinistra severus muttered certainly liked her present right after telling me that you didntlike presents it was potion supplies i the potions master he huffed like that explained everything while he was talking he was setting up two small pensieves for us both to go through the memories you re sounding jealous what did you have a present to give me he laughed at this apparently making a joke my stony silence though stopped the laughter you did he asked a bit incredulous well you made it rather clear you didntwant one so never mind i was busying myself by splitting up the vials of memories into two piles for each of us if you apologize maybe i ll give it to you severus is not one for apologies i apologize now that was a surprise though i didntdo something wrong now that was a bit more like the man but it had been an apology as insincere as it was and that was making quite a bit of headway on it own and after all i hadntreally specified what kind of apology i wanted i ll give it to you later we really need to make some headway on these memories it would be best to finish before the students return so we have about a week and this is a lot of memories i gestured to the table which was practically overflowing with the damned things and all i wanted was one silly boy memory right for whatever reason he didntlook as glum as when the day had started the idea of looking through slytherin memories likely appealed to him just pick a vial empty it into the pensieve you can watch the memory play out from above wait cantyou jump into the memory as well my knowledge was all from the books which certainly showed harry getting into people memories and watching it from the inside yes but that too involved for what we re doing we want to do this as fast as possible so preferably when you see that it not cain stop the memory just put the vial in and the memory will go back in i huffed softly disappointed that the man was killing all my fun with this my only comfort was that somewhere in those piles there were the memories of draco and severus i really hoped i would find theirs it would definitely give insight into their character not to mention wonderful blackmail opportunities with no more delay we both picked up a vial and started in on our day of memory viewing my very first choice was not cain not that i had expected it to be him that would have been far too easy no my first choice was a dark haired boy a few freckles doting his face likely in his fourth or fifth year i should have stopped the memory at that point knowing that it wasntcain but i couldntreally help myself after all this was the first time i had watched someone else memory and i was a little curious what a young slytherin boy would choose as his most important memory this young boy led me around the school as a viewer the halls looked the same as they did now i wasntsure if that meant it was a recent memory or if the school just hadntchanged much over the years i didntdoubt that it likely looked the same fifty years ago probably the same 100 years ago the memory ended sitting with one of his teachers being told that he had been chosen for the quidditch team the professor was no one that i recognized showing that the time period was nowhere near recent well that was boring i sighed bottling the memory again and placing it in a box on the ground for the already viewed hmm severus glanced up from his pensieve by his side there were already five vials in his box versus my one he was following his own rules not cain dontwatch nothing i kicked the box closer to my side so he couldntsee what was in it i didntneed him getting on my case try and at least listen to me once severus attention was back on his own pensieve but i didntdoubt that he was fully aware that i had only looked at one memory to avoid him getting too miffed i only basically browsed through the next memories the second i saw that the person wasntcain i stopped and moved onto the next one but i cantexactly say i did what he said perfectly every so often i had to watch a couple that seemed like they would be interesting my excuse was that it was purely educational for research if you would it was interesting to see what slytherins chose after all the general consensus on this house is that it filled with backstabbers who take pleasure in other pain and that they re all evil personally i just couldntbelieve that after watching rather a lot of the memories my general belief seemed to be proven correct most of the memories were the normal things a student would remember fondly the first time meeting their best friend their first kiss being chosen as prefect or head boy or getting all o on your owls but every school has it darker parts this particular memory seemed to be that of a boy brunette and older looking so he was likely in his last year of school his favourite memory was the rape of a fellow female student people like to slow down on roads to see accidents it a morbid fascination in our characters we dontwant to see dead people but if there a chance there is one we have to look it rather sick and in my life i have to say i never did it but in this case i couldntstop watching not for the morbid reasons but to make sure that these werentstudents that were currently in the school at the finish i pulled back with a jerk from the pensieve taking deep breaths and looking sick what the matter severus looked a bit concerned when i didntanswer him instead trying to calm my erratic breathing down he looked into my pensieve and watched the memory replay itself his reaction wasntas bad as mine but when he pulled away there was a sneer on his face disgusted with what he had just seen that not a student i ever had it must have been before i even went to school here he sighed before turning to me placing a hand on my shoulder every school has the things no one wants to see but i took a deep breath my breathing finally falling back to it usual rhythm isntthere a way to track him make him pay for what he did severus eyebrow rose at the question we dontknow when this happened likely the man dead i sorry but there nothing we can do we donthave the time to worry about this problem as well it likely going to happen again not all these memories can be happy and fluffy people arentall made that way he gave my shoulder a comforting squeeze we should take a break now anyway time for lunch any luck with your memories i thought a change of subject would help me forget about what i had seen the response to my question was a shake of his head as he covered the pensieves with a cloth nothing as bad as yours a lot of sappy moments he sighed rolling his eyes i didntrealize my house had such romantics in it rather disturbing almost as bad as the gryffindors i gasped giving an expression of mock shock the potions master gave me a cold glare before making his way to the door i had to double step to keep up with his long strides i cantwait to see your memory sevvie i wonder if it will be as nice and fluffy as some of those others you see mine you had better not watch it he growled this warning out but i took no heed of it just laughing it was rather surprising that i was almost positive that severus memory was going to be something good and likely surprisingly sappy there was no worry in my head that his was going to be bad at all like beating anyone up or watching anyone suffer it was surprising since i knew well enough how much he disliked sirius and the rest of the marauders it was entirely plausible that his memory could deal with something bad happening to one or all of them but not possible in my mind it was a feeling woman intuition if you will and once i saw that nice fluffy memory i was going to make his life hell for it what are you smirking about next to me severus was looking a little worried as we made our way to the great hall for lunch not surprising really he must have realized that if i saw his memory that i was going to take the mickey out of him absolutely nothing sevvie dear i reached up and patted his cheek rather condescendingly before hurry out of his reach through the doors and bounding over to the table to sit next to a miffed sirius where have you been i ve been working on some things with severus you know to do with our connection the boys my voice dropped automatically even though there was no one else sitting next to me since severus had taken his usual place as far from sirius as possible that horcrux we re looking for my explanation for my disappearance for the morning didntreally seem to improve sirius mood not really that surprising that he wasnt too happy after all with the majority of the student gone no classes to teach and only sinistra and mcgonagall here he would have had nothing really to do i had to read a book my hand covered my heart and i gasped in horror do your eyes hurt i grinned at him you re being cheeky really what else was i supposed to do you could have kept the students company i shrugged searched the castle some more for you know what been in the library looking for a solution to our problem been working on lesson plans for your class taking up a new hobby been planning a practical joke to play on severus i ticked off all the ideas on my fingers showing the man that there were plenty of things that didntinvolve me that he could have been utilizing his time for you could have been writing a letter to harry or hermione looking into the robberies at the museum finding out more about bellatrix making a fort in the snow all right all right i get it there are plenty of things for me to do he rolled his eyes but none are nearly as much fun as you i patted his cheek pinching it gently you are just so adorable sometimes how sweet during lunch i made sure to keep sirius as amused at possible after all i wasntgoing to be spending too much time with him not if i had all those memories to look through it was really too bad since time with sirius was actually a lot of fun he might be obnoxious at times a child most of the time and a flirt all of the time but that didntmean he didntknow how to make the most of the time whether that had been part of his personality before his death or not i didntknow when do i get my present severus caught up to me after lunch on my way to his office well catching up might not have been right since after all we were both going to the same place after leaving the same place before you didntseem to care about presents and now you seem eager enough for mine my eyes rolled automatically but fine it in my room we diverted our course from his office to my rooms instead it was something sirius wasntgoing to like too much since i didnt even really like him being in my rooms i handed severus the package and immediately started to ramble an explanation as he started to open it i didntwant to get you something useful really as a present that doesntseem too much fun so this isntgoing to be as good as sinistra s nothing like potion ingredients that didntseem to imaginative or caring at all i could have done that easily enough then i know you would have liked it but i saw this and thought well i stopped my rambling when severus had finished unwrapping and was now holding a stuffed snake he experimentally squeezed it causing it to hiss and a rather lifelike tongue to come out of it mouth i sighed at the less then enthusiastic look he gave me i thought it was cute okay i could have gotten you useful stuff but that not fun at all he still hadntsaid anything and was still looking at the snake with a blank expression okay you dontlike it that fine you donthave to keep it i ll take it back when i made to reach out and grab it back severus pulled it out of my reach i keeping it i blinked at him not really understanding why he would want to keep something that he didntseem to even like as i was blinking in confusion i missed the closing of space between us as severus moved in closer i only came out of the state i was in when i felt his cold hand on my cheek bringing my head up to look up at him i stared into his black eyes before closing my own when his smooth lips covered mine the kiss was deep long and above everything else it was passionate up until now severus kisses had been rather well rather held in check this one though by the time he pulled away my hands were clutching his robes since my legs were not doing the job that they should have what what was that for i licked my lips my forehead resting against his chest trying to once again do something about my breathing i didntget you anything it took a few moments but i soon started to laugh not knowing why i was laughing severus pulled away from me holding his snake and looking more then a little put out sorry but it is rather amusing that you think a kiss from you makes a good christmas present doesnt it he huffed sounding a little injured this time i closed the gap between us to give severus some credit he didnttake any steps away even though he looked more then usually worried at my expression i didntdoubt that i must have looked a bit like a predator stalking her prey well i think after giving you something as adorable as that snake i think i need something a bit more then just a kiss he seemed to have regained his usual expression a bit an eyebrow lifting at my suggestion though the snake seemed to be held in a death grip what are you suggesting his voice held rather well but his eyes kept flickering down to my lips a good enough sign that i pushed on sevvie my bedroom is right there with a hand on his chest i pushed him in the direction of my bedroom door aine i severus was still putting up a token resistance i dont want black seconds i already said that you re not playing anyone seconds i waved this argument off briefly i wondered when i became as brazen as i was being and for want of a better word when i had become rather a slut after all i was sleeping with one guy and now trying my hardest to get another one in the sack but that part of my brain was forcefully shut off by the part that really wanted this sevvie severus the typical argument came up without pause on reflex i grinned at him once again closing the gap fine severus you re going to regret this yes but only if you keep talking it time for dinner i buried my head into severus chest moaning about not wanting to get out of bed too ashamed to go down to the hall after this worried the canine is going to smell us severus sneered out pushing me off him sitting up actually i grabbed his arm pulling him back down on the bed a rather bright grin on my face i was rather hoping to just stay in bed with you that eyebrow was in it usual place arched in question though his tongue was licking his lips if we both miss dinner you know that will start rumours apparently severus logical side was too strong to kill i groaned and rolled away from the man an arm slung over my eyes sevvie you need to worry less about what others think and you need to worry more there are already rumours about you and sirius do you want more well they are true after all i muttered you just dontwant to spend anymore time in bed with me already regretting this arent you i found myself pinned under a rather displeased looking potions master are you going to continue sleeping with black i dontknow i frowned it was a thought that honestly i hadnt given much thought it was wrong to sleep with two men at the same time even if i didnthave any commitments to either it wasnt like either of them liked the situation they hated each other even the thought of sirius finding out about this was a bit frightening he would likely blame severus and try and cut off his head this is not going to happen again severus pushed away from me getting off the bed and angrily putting his clothes back on i am not in a relationship with you or sirius i sat up for modesty sake holding the covers over me i donthave to explain myself to either of you i like you both my guilt was driving me to explain myself but my stubbornness was making me avoid actually apologizing not accepting that this was anything wrong fine it still not happening again he paused by the door it time for dinner i snorted as he walked out the door a little too late to throw a pillow at the man with the man now gone it was time to honestly think about what had happened and more importantly what i was going to do about it i had slept with sirius and now i had slept with severus one knew about it all the other was in the dark it was preferably to keep sirius in the dark after all the two of them hated each other and out of the two of them the gryffindor was the more volatile but that wasntthe problem the real issue was that i still liked both men rather equally as it was and it wasntfair to either severus was right to say that it shouldnthappen again not just with severus either i was going to have to stop with sirius as well granted the man wasntgoing too pleased about being cut off but he would survive no more sex for anyone until this got solved as it was i was going to have to deal with severus being cold to me because of what happened and sirius whigning because of what wasntgoing to happen after having a shower i made my entrance for dinner taking my normal seat next to sirius and avoiding the death glare severus was giving me despite my disagreeing earlier about sirius smelling me the shower had been mainly to make sure that didnthappen i wasntsure exactly how good his sense of smell was or if it was only when he was in his dog shape are you going to spend time with me tonight sirius practically pouted as he asked the question sorry sirius i ve decided that i need to focus on the problems at hand mainly our connection the problem with cain and kerstan and the horcrux i patted his hand so no more spending the night sirius opened his mouth to complain when he was interrupted professor can you pass the potatoes chauncey asked from a few seats down i smiled at the girl and complied happy for the interruption as long as the reason is just that you want to concentrate sirius eyes flicked down the table to the more then usually grumpy potions master of course the week before the students came back was abnormally busy for me even if it was the sort of busy that was brain numbingly boring after all browsing the memories of generations of slytherins wasntexactly compelling granted it could have been more fun if grumpy sevvie hadntbeen watching to make sure i wasntactually watching any ever since the incident he had been unhappier colder and just generally far more untalkative since he wasntexactly effervescent before now it was like standing next to a glacier chills and all even my sparkling personality wasntfixing this i wasntregretting what had happened but he was certainly making me regret it if this was going to be normal to make this even better all i needed to have happen was for sirius to find out that i had slept with his arch nemesis even as voldemort burst through the doors and cooked us all alive that would make my day the piles were whittling down and still there was no sign of cain memory it was as usual the thing you look for is always the last place you look the way we were going the very last vial was going to be the boy s and even more annoyingly i hadntseen draco or severus s my luck stood with those two having been in his pile i made a lucky glance next to me to see that at that moment severus face was a bright red i couldntcontrol the smirk that appeared on my face apparently sevvie had just gotten hold of rather an embarrassing memory trying to catch a glimpse all i saw was a familiar blonde head before he stopped the memory that was draco my chance at blackmail was at hand well not blackmail so much as a chance to make the usually cool slytherin tremble let me see it no severus face still hadntlost the blush only making me even more curious to see what kind of memory had been in that glass but no i pouted basically giving up on any chance of seeing that one especially not with the vial having been tucked safely into his robes the only chance to get that was to get into the robes and he had made it absolutely clear that wasntgoing to happen again is the reason you dontwant me to see a purely philosophical reason or did dear draco do something bad nothing illegal no severus ground out apparently not too comfortable with this topic but at least he was speaking to me but you didntsay no to it being bad so that means you thinks it bad but not illegal i grinned wickedly coming to a natural conclusion does this include the gryffindor golden boy whom draco happens to be living with right now a cold glare told me that was all i was going to get on the subject i was curious yes but i knew when a mission was hopeless and with sevvie already annoyed with me i wasntgoing to get details the viewing of memories continued until i to coin a phrase hit the mother load swirling in front of me was the treasured memory of severus snape a n sorry i really really sorry that it has been so long since my last update i had my birthday normal work had a strange addiction to korean dramas damn you rain and then to top it all off i was really rather sick but that still not a good enough excuse but the story isntdead never was i will finish it i promise life though occasionally interrupts it shouldntbe too long though from now actually the end is coming duh duh duuuuh anyway once again i sorry that it been so long and thank you to everyone who reviewed the last chapter and to those that showed concern over the future of the story this chapter though is rather long and plenty of stuff happens in it so hopefully that makes up for the time it took to get it up chapter 41 a younger far more awkward severus was in front of me he hadnt learnt the cool composure yet that got him through his everyday life that let him deal with all the problems that his personality seemed to caused my guess would have been that he was in his first year during this memory of course that could have been wrong since i wasntnecessarily the best at judging age but it seemed likely when taking in his size and the size of the other students that streamed past him as he walked down a hallway of course it was possible that he was just tiny for his age after all severus snape was not exactly athletic the hallway he was heading down if things were the same then as they were now then he was heading to the potions classroom i glanced quickly from the pensieve to look at the modern day severus snape just to make sure he hadntnoticed yet that i was still on one memory he was studiously ignoring me still which at this point worked in my favor even if in the back of my brain plans were forming to deal with the irksome individual at least for the moment his stubborn behaviour was rather useful back to the memory which was still progressing showed the rather awkward student sitting at a desk in the potions classroom no one else as yet sitting next to the boy as much as i might rather like the man now excepting when he was mocking me or ignoring me as a boy he was rather well even i would have been hard pressed not to make fun of the boy a good haircut would have solved a lot of problems now i could continue watching this memory from where i was on the outside looking in but the problem with that was that there was no sound and for a memory like this one i wanted all the information i could get so taking my life in my hands since after all severus wouldntbe happy i jumped right into that memory being sucked into a memory is a bit like falling without that frightening fear for your life it more like a soft drop more like when alice fell into wonderland floating down gently than being pushed off a tall building it a surreal situation though to go from your own surroundings to the world of someone else mind especially a person you knew and cared about i landed next to severus and half expected him to look up at me and rather snarkily ask me what the hell i was doing there but as was to be expected it was like i wasnteven there of course i wasnt there but that was aside from the point the classroom itself was amazingly different now that severus himself was in charge of it now it was a place that severus had really changed quite a bit during his control of the place it was considerably darker quite a feat since it was in a dungeon after all not a window in sight in this memory though there were enough lights around the room to really lighten it up there were even some flowers in a vase on the teacher desk rather remarkable what lighting and greenery does to a place the only plants to find their way into professor snape classroom were generally dead already and more often the not letting off a noxious fume not that little severus would have noticed the classroom that was around him since his nose was in a book his eyes never once straying up from the page curiousity brought me to get closer to the young boy peering over his shoulder to see what exactly was so interesting should have known potions textbook and lovingly marked as well the entire page was practically written on alread y reading a bit of it showed that it was still pretty much the same text wonderful to know that if anything the wizarding world was rather stuck in it ways when it came to textbooks so very like the muggle world i remembered my own tenth grade history book which was missing anything after the eighties my teacher could have given us supplemental reading but as she told us frequently nothing of merit happened after the eighties she was never fond of me though i think that was of my frequent picking apart of her theory can anyone say berlin wall a small commotion at the back of the room drew my attention away from this littler snape entering the classroom were a bunch of gryffindor students showing that it seemed to be a trend to put first year slytherin and gryffindor potion students together trend or torture after being a teacher at this school i would say it was likely that the teachers did it on purpose at the sight of slytherins already in the room the gryffindors stopped loud groans emanating from them apparently even though it was probably their first year they had already been instilled with the good old rivalry as sirius would call it it was almost too bad to see these young children dislike each other even though there was no good reason for it after all aside from which houses they were in there was no communication between them as of yet they had no reasons to hate each other yet it all just backed up my whole mind set when it came to feuds useless bloody useless and the people involved were sodding fools well i had basically just insulted everyone who was in or had ever been in gryffindor and slytherin the hawk nosed slytherin next to me fidgeted at the racket the gryffindors made as they came in but his eyes never made it above the top of his book their entrance was unimportant to him if anyone wondered why severus didntreally have too many friends well i think this might have given them a clue you need to speak to people to start up a relationship but then what better relationship was there then a boy and his books i wonder if he realizes how similar he was to hermione at the same age i mused aloud not worried since no one could hear me in this world in this place i didnteven really exist rather surreal since the boy didntappear to be doing anything even remotely interesting i focused my attention on the rest of the classroom mainly on the gryffindors really since one bore a rather striking resemblance to harry oh the marauders were the same year as sevvie immediately my eyes searched out the wee sirius wanting to know what the playboy looked like when he was only eleven years old once looking it wasnt hard to find him either not at all since he was so similar it was the confident smile that gave him away not to mention the way people seemed to be circled around him him and james potter the two seemed to have rather a singular energy that pooled people around them even i not part of this memory wanted to just wander over and be a part of their group but i stayed perched on sevvie desk since after all i was here to see his precious memory though it was singularly a tempting experience severus was not the most intoxicating individual to be around sevvie this memory is rather boring i sighed since after what seemed like ten minutes nothing had happened his pointed nose hadnt moved from the book in fact his lack of movement seemed to have just gained him the unwanted attention from the rather rambunctious gryffindors hey that must be the best book in the world sirius had sauntered over plucking the potions textbook out from the small hands of severus pale hands clutched at air but he wasntfast enough and he lost his book black eyes glared up at the taller boy which only resulted in a sharp laugh reflexes caused me to smack at sirius arm annoyed with the boy for picking on other that were smaller then him this reflex of mine just ended with me tumbling to the floor my hand passing right through sirius arm relief flooded through me that no one could see that particularly embarrassing fall standing up and brushing myself off i could see that the teasing was continuing unabashed sirius was keeping the book over severus head while the smaller boy tried to get it back it was rather fruitless really he should have just given up instead of just ending up looking like an idiot harry father james was standing behind sirius laughing and encouraging the behaviour james potter was uncannily similar to his son it was something everyone knew but seeing it was something else glasses unkempt hair even the laugh but the eyes were the differing point while harry had that almond shape his father were larger and a dark blue they also held more confidence for a boy his age sitting at a desk a bit back looking wholly uncomfortable with the whole mess was a sandy haired boy who if i was going to make any guesses as to his identity would be remus lupin at this point there didnt seem to be as close a bond between the three boys as would occur later if there had been perhaps this one who seemed a bit more sensible would have stopped this foolish teasing though judging by the overpowering aura that these two gryffindors exuded it was doubtful that anyone even a close friend could have stopped this from happening and the slytherins werenthelping matters apparently comradery amongst house mates didntcross over to all houses they just sat back talking amongst themselves as if nothing was happening to one of their own a shock of white blonde hair in the back brought to mind draco likely his father i frowned wholly displeased with this whole display and more then a little confused this memory was supposed to be the memory that snape treasured the most of his time here at hogwarts after viewing my fair share of other slytherin memories this one was odd there had been plenty of instances of memories of first love winning awards beating an old enemy things that made sense why would the first time he was teased by the people he would grow to hate the most be important maybe it was just something that set him on his path or this could just have been a off shoot of his love of his feud after all this had started his own personal feud sirius black stop it this instant rather out of the blue a girl flew to the front of the room and grabbed the book from a surprised looking sirius no one had apparently expected something like this to have happened most certainly not from a fellow gryffindor honestly evans we were just having some fun you know what that is dont you a dramatic sigh hissed past his lips little snivellus here understood didntyou a dark look was shot at the pale boy i looked back and forth between these two it really was uncanny to stand here looking at their eleven year old selves and see the same look on their faces as would be there for years to come uncanny and rather depressing really even with the adoration i had for sirius it was without a doubt his fault this problem had started leave him alone there no problem with reading the textbook maybe you should try it then you wouldntbe having such a problem with the class well then not the first class but near enough my attention focused now instead on the girl who was so commendably standing up to the self proclaimed king of gryffindor bright red hair almond shaped green eyes confidence flowing from her very posture the surname evans harry mother was really a formidable woman even at such a young age taking on sirius certainly showed that not to mention it proved her unshakeable morals standing up for someone you barely knew was important the teacher in me applauded here she held out the textbook to severus who was studiously avoiding looking at her his eyes stuck to a particular part of the floor behind her sirius and the other gryffindors had settled down blowing off what had happened to whatever problems women had and that they had actually intended for that to happen not that anyone was particularly convinced i didntneed your help my eyes shot back to the fidgety young slytherin once again the teacher in me reared it head highly displeased at the behaviour i was seeing one thanks someone after they help not acts like an ass his eyes though had lifted from the floor and was looking at miss evans with a thoroughly disgusted look gryffindors should keep their noses out of my business also speaking well of her personality at this basic insult she didnt even bat an eyelash instead shrugging and moving back to take her seat with another gryffindor girl i watched an amused expression on my face after all even this early on i couldntmiss the glances james potter was giving his future wife love starts early sometimes a smile on my face i looked back at severus and the expression faltered for a moment there was an interesting emotion behind those black eyes unfathomable to most even to me if i hadntjust seen the same look on potter face well sevvie that is interesting at the back of the classroom the doors opened and in trudged the potions master of this time short with a large belly trudged seemed really the only correct word for how he walked maybe waddled would have worked as well his head was significantly bald shining so much that i didntdoubt that he could have alerted planes to descend to the runway with it and that moustache well my opinion on those were entirely negative but his was just silly and ridiculous this had to be professor slughorn welcome back to the greatest class you shall ever take snickers erupted from most of the class not even just from one side of the room this was something that actually transcended the lines of rivalry between gryffindor and slytherin both houses thought the man was ridiculous and he was even the slytherin head of house now as for your first assignment two people did it perfectly miss evans and mister snape you two will have bright futures in potions i believe his smile was bright for both the students i glanced at lily evans and saw her face tinged pink a pleased look there on the other hand severus just looked put out about being included in the same sentence as the girl at least i say he looked that way but really there was that twitching of his nose and the quick glances he was sending the girl way it was actually starting to annoy me my annoyance was cut to an end though when a reversal of what happened before occurred instead of falling in it was like falling out things almost seemed to go into reverse as long as it took me to close my eyes and open them again and i was back sitting at the desk the penseive swirling with severus memory in front of me i didntneed to look to my side to see the murderous look i was getting from the man i could feel the heat of it on the side of my face it was rather my hope that voiceless magic was not something that came too easily to the man after all it has already been established the being turned into a newt was not something i looked forward to turning to look at him proved i was rather correct in my assumption the look was a death glare the black orbs glittering likely with plenty of horrendous ideas on how to make me suffer plenty of ideas that i wasntoverly excited to find out about well there was either the option of running or heading him off at the pass you were in love with her i have never seen anyone do a double take as perfectly as severus did at that moment his face went from dangerous death glares to wide eyed surprise if the subject matter had been better then i would have said getting one up on sevvie was tremendous fun but truthfully the idea of him having been in love with someone was a tad bit irking not to mention the problems that would be associated with the fact that it had been harry mother he had loved not to mention this explained quite a bit why he hated them all what you heard me you were in love with her my arms had crossed over my chest in an effort to accentuate the point i was trying to make her despite the proof swirling in front of me his voice seemed to hold some genuine confusion i rolled my eyes annoyed that i was even having to play this game with the man he should just have been a man and admitted this when confronted with it after all it wasnt that bad everyone falls in love and more often then not it with people who are wholly unsuited to you not to mention probably people who would never look twice at you i d had more then my share of unrequited crushes throughout my school years and as for unsuited matches well at the moment i happened to be involved with two such individuals one of whom was giving me a glare that i swear was actually starting to make my hair smoke lily evans you were in love with her you had the hots for her any of this ringing any little bells red headed gryffindor married one of your arch nemeses and bore another one a real man would have resigned his fate at this point not laughed in my face tell me the truth miss mackinnion the use of my surname caused my eye to twitch did you hit your head when you entered my memory my thoughts flew to the moment when i had put my hand through younger sirius arm causing me to stumble to the ground but that moment couldnthave been witnessed by anyone so he must have been making a joke in itself that was a singular event but when being used to throw me off the scent it wasntappreciated i saw the look you gave her after she came to your rescue a rather predatory smile enveloped my face having dirt on severus snape was like having the cure for cancer well perhaps not something so shining and good more like finding out that the person who bullied you throughout school still wets their bed being rescued by a girl and even worse a gryffindor his left eye was twitching so did you fall in love with her at that exact instant red hair shining as she flew to your rescue could an eyeball fall out of it socket from enough movement since that eye twitching was getting rather worse i was not nor have i ever been in love with anyone from gryffindor steel laced through every word that he said disgust at even the thought not that it dissuaded me from what i thought to be the truth that look had been a telling sign the look you gave her was practically smoking i laughed admittedly it was rather bitter sounding as you so kindly reminded me i had been saved by a girl a gryffindor do you really think that the heat coming from me had to do with love and perhaps not i dontknow hatred damn and there was the inkling of doubt raising it ugly head but damned it i was going to let him win this at all you were in love with her i was not were too were not yes no then what was so memorable in that memory cause i got nothing else i threw up my arms that personal severus crossed his own arms this time fine then my theory is the only one so we ll just go with that a staring contest commenced with me being proud to state that i came out of it as the winner a disgruntled severus looking to the side fine i wonder how harry would take to the idea of his hated teacher having been in love with his mother of course draco will know then then i sure harry would tell sirius the chain of events unfolded in front of severus mind eye clear as day he could see harry confiding in his godfather about his potions teacher being in love with his mother and the subsequent ammunition that this was going to give the canine animagus even i could see the carnivorous smile that would never leave sirius face whenever the slytherin was in view i was not in love with her then what well well what i was praised he mumbled it out so softly that i had to lean in closer to him to hear sevvie please you know better please speak up i was praised okay slughorn said i had a future in this okay there was a blush on the dear potion master face at what he saw as an indignantly embarrassing moment now i perhaps should have been a little more understanding but aside from the fact that it was really a silly thing to be embarrassed about i was also somewhat thrilled to hear that the man hadntbeen in love with lily evans only because of the problems that would have caused of course laughing at severus snape should be right up there with telling lord voldemort that he looks like an ugly transexual drag queen or telling one parents that you re getting married to a biker named thrasher at least on the ways to get maimed really quick list sorry sorry i stopped laughing soon enough my spider sense warning me quickly enough that this was dangerous territory but honestly we all like to be praised by a teacher like slughorn or in the same breath as a gryffindor there was going to be no convincing the man of the merits of praise at this point in time so you werentin love with lily evans anyone could hear the small fragment of jealousy penetrating that question severus gave me a look that certainly showed that he had noticed but apparently didntthink it worth mentioning he just nodded to answer my question now didnti tell you before that you werentsupposed to watch my memory if you found it oh right now sevvie dear you knew i wasntgoing to be able to stop myself i fluttered my eyelashes look at the time i glanced at my watch to actually back up my change of subject i then actually looked back at it before raising my arm so the watch was in his face no really we just worked through dinner how is that going to look i mean really i need to go do sirius damage control what the worst he can think happened that we slept together this last was sneered out you can be a singularly immature individual you know i had no problem with what happened you need to deal with your own issues this was not going to be an argument i was going to get into again we ll stop then we re almost done i glanced at the considerably smaller piles on the desk should be able to finish this tomorrow no more words were exchanged instead i just got up and left the classroom and severus snape behind another day of memory viewing had ended without finding what i had been looking for but i had come away with something else a closer insight into the man not to mention rather delicious blackmail anxiety panic and fear woke me up that night not my own no instead it was sirius feelings calling to me as easily as if he was right next to me shouting it was hard to sleep when you felt like death was creeping up on you granted it was also hard to sleep through what sounded like blasts and screaming and these werentcoming from sirius something was wrong something in the castle was deadly wrong when hurrying about in the dark it amazing how your foot finds the corner of every possible piece of furniture before you finish what you need to do finally dressed my foot was on fire from hitting everything it could in the dark i sort of felt sorry for sirius he was going to have no idea why his foot was twice the size then before caution was called for since well there was loud screaming and what sounded like dynamite being let off somewhere above us in the castle so i was decidedly careful when looking out of my room seeing no real danger to myself i ran out and made my way to the students to be sure that they were okay granted if they weren t well there was nothing that i could do upon entering the slytherin common rooms the sight that greeted me was of the few students that were in the school looking like deers caught in the headlights well perhaps i should have said who i was before bursting through the door the second i walked into the room i was practically knocked over by the sudden appearance of arms around my midsection as both the girls collided with me professor what going on chauncey looked up at me teary eyed and scared the normally so together girl looked like she was going to fall apart even the slytherin girl who was generally so disparaging toward me looked the same i have no idea at that moment headmistress voice came out of nowhere all students will stay in the dormitories under no exceptions is anyone allowed out okay i need to go realizing that was going to be slightly hard with two sets of arms tightening around me as i said it i had to pry them off i need to see what going on you re all safe in here right now i want you all to stay in here if anyone i mean anyone comes in hit them with a curse before they have a chance to speak what about you professors kerstan asked his face was practically as good as new now only a faint purplish ring around his left eye and a scab on his lip suggesting any foul play had befallen him this christmastime we ll announce ourselves as if a death eater couldntsay he was you cain sighed annoying me since he sounded like he was dealing with a child at the mere mention of death eaters the other students gasped softly apparently none of them associating screaming and explosions with guys in masks right thank you cain i ll yell exploding snaps okay now i really need to see if everyone was okay my stomach was tightening with worry for sirius and severus mainly for severus since i would have known instantly if something had happened to the other man remember curse anyone and try for something damaging no unforgiveables though with that last warning i ran out of there where do you think you re going the entire castle was in an uproar all that could be heard were the sounds of screaming blasts since it was right before the entire student population was to come back their werentstudents running in the halls scared screaming instead the sounds were coming from the portraits who it seemed despite their lack of physical bodies were still rather rightly afraid of the death eaters i had left the six remaining students safe in the slytherin dorm i glared at sirius as he asked the question controlling the instantaneous urge to hug both him and severus who happened to appear next to him both him and severus were on their way up to the great hall where it appeared the bulk of the fighting was going on no one knew how the death eaters had managed to get into the building but they were here now at least i was assuming it was death eaters who else would want to attack hogwarts death eaters i asked choosing to ignore sirius question it would appear so sirius sighed i slipped past them to see how you and the students were doing my annoyance at his original question evaporated at his concern for me and the students of course shouldnt you be with the students severus asked his normal sneer gone instead he looked slightly worried i didntfool myself thinking that any of that worry was for me i d say it was most likely for himself after all he was the former death eater who betrayed their master it was certainly a precarious position to be in and what good would i do there not like i could protect the students if anything happened i snorted softly running quite quickly to keep up with the two men so what exactly do you expect to do down in the hall with a group of death eaters trying to kill you then yell at them granted that normally works for you sirius had stopped in his tracks his silver eyes piercing beside him severus had stopped as well though his black eyes werentas angry as they looked at me but he still looked skeptical of my ability to do anything i ll have you both know that i took karate it like a fighting art my eye was starting to twitch from the overpowering condescension coming from the men i wasntsurprised to see the skepticism increase and next you shall tell us that you re a master in this kahratea severus didntsound too sure when he said the word but he obviously doubted me i avoided looking either of them in the eye well no actually i sort of flunked out of the class i heard the sound of a foot tapping and realized that for once it wasntmine but instead was sirius the tall dark haired dark arts teacher looked ready to strangle me but it was severus who spoke to me so how exactly do you expect to do anything wizards are susceptible to physical attacks as well i muttered but i smiled slightly at severus and i know enough to be able to kick someone in the groin that works on wizards too doesntit he paled slightly not doubting that i would test the theory on him we donthave time for this sirius growled just keep out of the way and try not to get killed yes try not to get in our way at all either severus sighed unpleased with having to still be standing here well if you two can stop your budding friendship we could get down to the hall not that i not thrilled you re getting along that disgusting sirius and severus both said at once we have nothing in common sirius continued i started to run ahead of them but paused at a staircase well you both have seen me naked i winked and quickly ran ahead the two men were stuck in place looking at each other in surprise for a moment she that not they both frowned before shaking their heads and starting to run as well catching up with me deciding for now to forget that last comment just remember dontdo anything stupid sirius admonished me like it matters anyway you get injured and i will as well i sighed softly trying to keep my voice quiet but the sudden tension in sirius shoulders as he ran indicated he had heard me he kept quiet though the sight that greeted us as we arrived into the great hall wasntas bad really as we had all been expecting with all the noise i had expected to see twenty or more black hooded creatures sending curses everywhere things exploding instead all that greeted us was the sight of the headmistress and professor sinistra keeping back only a few so called death eaters with his usual eagerness sirius jumped into the fray and perhaps a little more cautious severus joined him the two would want to kill me if i told them this later but they actually worked rather well with each other unbeknownst to the two of them at the time but they were actually pretty much watching each other backs at the time now that i was here i could see what they had meant by asking me what i expected to do sure if one of the death eaters got close enough to me without killing me of course then sure i could kick him but i didntexactly want to test that theory out so instead i stayed at the edge of everything watching what was transpiring watching as people that i cared about and sinistra so narrowly avoided being hit by curses green lights were being thrown across the room worrying me that all my work bringing sirius back to life would be destroyed in just a momentary flash of green light it seemed a little cheap for a death scene really no great fight or chase just a phrase a flash and you were dead it really wouldntwork too well in a movie this realization kept me behind a suit of armor near the door feeling rather worried the worry grew when my left leg started to throb painfully looking for sirius though just showed that he had tripped over a chair that had fallen in front of him luckily for him though severus happened to be nearby to deflect the curse that had been heading his way my position didntreally lend itself to helping out at all but if i hadntbeen where i was i would have missed the flash of black out of the corner of my eye i would have missed the black cloak disappearing through the doorway sparing a quick glance at the battle that was occurring that i couldntdo anything about i ducked between stray curses and flew out the door my first concern was that the person who had disappeared out of the great hall was going to do something to the students everything that was happening tonight lent itself to my theory that whatever had happened to kerstan had been the fault of an extraneous party and this thought caused my heart to tighten in panic that perhaps the person responsible had come back to finish the job i ducked just in time to miss being hit by a stream of curses exploding snaps i yelled in panic covering my head hoping that they remembered the password even if i had almost forgotten professor chauncey flew to my side sorry but you said no no that was good i forgot sorry i got up brushing myself off and trying to not appear like i had almost been killed by my own students is everyone all right anyone else try to get in here they all shook their heads no guys in black hoods i think we would have told you kerstan had a small smile right yes you would have wouldntyou my lips were pursed as i tried to think about this there was no other reason for a death eater to head down here the only thing of any value were the students one of whom had just recently been beaten up a warning blast went off in the back of my head i need to go check something you all stay here and do what i said before a quick jog to the potions classroom proved that my worries had been correct on the desk where the vials of memories had been up until that day there was now nothing every single one had been stolen by the person who had so carefully slipped down here aine frayed nerves and instinct caused me to practically fall behind the desk at the sudden screaming of my name peering over the edge of the wood though showed that sirius and severus were in the doorway the potions master though seemed to be dragging a rather large left arm thank you for telling us the password severus black eyes were narrowed dangerously on me as he showed his gratitude with that sarcastic comment i had to try rather hard not to laugh at the image that presented itself to my imagination of six very frightened students sending curses at their teachers and managing to hit one likely the one they all would have liked to have cursed before as well not that any of them would have aimed well there wasntexactly time i sighed getting up from behind the desk but all that aside severus we have a problem i pointed at the desk and more importantly the lack of anything on the desk the vials severus lumbered to the desk his extra long arm causing him some trouble at any other time i would have been surprised and would have said something at what happened next sirius actually used the counter curse to help out the potions master even better was the mumbled thanks that came from behind the thinned lips but now wasnt the time to tease the two of them whatever had happened tonight had apparently had a purpose and it wasntto scare any of us or kill anyone somehow the forces of evil had played the oldest trick in the book distract everyone over here while on the other side of the table you steal what you really want vials sirius looked back and forth between severus and i his expression going from confused to annoyed to just plain mad severus and i found some old memories of slytherin students we were going through them all to see if any were important something that might have to do with what happened to kerstan or that might help find the horcrux and they re gone sirius seemed to connect the dots in his head because he suddenly looked rather triumphant that would explain why they left suddenly they had gotten what they came for the real question though is what would a bunch of dangerous criminals want with the sappy memories of a bunch of young slytherins my question was met with silence since neither of the two men had an answer for me and i hadnteven found cain memory yet either professors the students were okay even if a little worn for wear after the events of the night if nothing else they had proved that they were perfectly capable of sending curses flying at their least favourite teacher what are you doing out severus turned on the appearing students in the doorway probably angrier then normal after having his arm grown four times its normal size by the lot of them we were worried they had apparently forgotten that they had just sent curses flying at the man though his dark glare reminded them quickly enough worried or not you should be in your dorms no one said it was safe to be out sirius sighed his leg still a little sore at least i assumed as much since my own leg was still throbbing a bit are you all okay i blinked at their young anxious faces the teacher in me immediately started counting the heads and i just came up short chauncey where are the other boys my count had only come up with three which was half of what i needed missing were kerstan cain and that second year from ravenclaw they were curious she fidgeted obviously sensing that perhaps she should have done a little more to stop the boys from running off there wasntany danger after all the professors said that the threat was done all three of us teachers in the room were less then thrilled with the students but we all controlled the urge to barrage them with important life lessons after all they had been through a rather stressful night but then so had the rest of us back to the dorms now severus pushed them out of the classroom and together we all headed back to the relative safety of the slytherin common rooms greeting us upon our arrival were professor sinistra and the headmistress together with the missing three boys who seemed to be rather embarrassed at being caught is everything okay headmistress she was tired rightfully so and she sat down on the couch with a heavy sigh everyone to their rooms right now none of the students were going to argue not after tonight and certainly not with an exhausted headmistress so they all rather eagerly headed up to their bedrooms to try at least to get some sleep we need to tell you something headmistress i was a little worried telling her worried that she was going to be angry that we had kept this from her not that i was going to fill her in on everything even with the attack on the school there was no reason to make it worse by telling anyone else about the horcrux though it was becoming far more apparent that something was amiss as of late the appearance of death eaters was certainly lending itself to the theory that voldemort wasntnecessarily dead harry though had made it clear that no one else was to know you re not the only one sinistra was for once rather subdued well severus and i found a stash of old slytherin memories yes the hiding place behind the snake correct mcgonagall nodded with clear understanding severus eyes widened slightly but the headmistress just shrugged slightly you didntthink i wouldnt know about one of the oldest slytherin traditions what about it well one of the death eaters sneaked out of the great hall and i followed him worried he was going for the students but he didn t he stole all the memories this seemed to give mcgonagall reason to pause along with the rest of us there seemed to be no reason to steal old memories all of the ones that severus and i had viewed certainly had not contained anything of merit so the reason must have lain within one of the vials that we hadntmade it to yet perhaps a memory of an old death eater perhaps one with a memory of where the horcrux could have been hidden the idea that we had been so close to an answer set my teeth on edge you said we werentthe only ones who had something to tell did something else happen severus recalled what sinistra had said a deep furrow between his brows his arms crossed as he waited young mr faust found it and the other two got us i could feel the doom in the air it was suffocating really whatever the boys had found i knew it wasntgoing to be good at all would you just spit it out sirius snarled getting rather fed up with how things were going tonight someone slashed professor dumbledore a n as long as some people read this i shall continue bravely on so thank you to all of you but i have to say though that i am obsessive about this storyline now so i would write no matter what it taken a life of it own i hope you are enjoying it i also still wonder who people would like to see harry with it a tie between ginny and draco so it seems to be down to the simple question straight or slash interesting this chapter was quite hard for me a lot of rewrites so i hope it came out okay please enjoy and review chapter 5 i stepped out of a strange fireplace into what could only be described as an archaic living room all the furnishings in the room looked as they had come from the eighteenth century in design and in the care that had been given them a fine layer of dust had settled over all the pieces under the dust though it was obvious that they were al fine pieces probably worth a pretty penny but apparently harry didntshare that opinion i dusted myself and exited the living room not waiting for cairn to follow me i came out into the hall way it all shared the same state as the room i had just been in though the dust hadntbeen able to settle everywhere in hall way likely due to the fact that people walked through here on a regular basis the dust had no chance to settle my sense of curiosity got the best of me when i noticed a cloth hanging from a wall my hands started to part it when a horrible wailing came from behind it which preceded the horrific shouting that then occurred disgusting a muggle in the black home i parted the curtain a little and stared in horrified shock at th moving portrait of an old woman regal in her appearance but who was glaring at me with a ferocity that actually shocked me i dropped the curtain back into place but she kept shouting at me thankfully i didntknow most of the words at that point harry came out of a room across from the one i had exited before and looked rather amused at me i see you met sirius mother she not too fond of people who aren t well blacks he smirked up at me as i quickly ran down to join him luckily for me sirius was never a real black i nodded dumbly even as i sneaked a look at the covered portrait without even knowing sirius black i felt tremendous pity for his childhood the portrait was bad enough imagine living with the real thing for once i doubted the ability of a mother to show love that one i doubted knew the meaning of the word everything is set then harry looked at me expectation shining in his eye there was a flash of relief when i nodded i thought he probably had expected me to back out after all this time i had thought of it but i had promised as well where is cairn he looked immediately concerned i blinked and walked back into the living room harry trailing behind me looking around hoping to see him in the room but he wasnt there he was right behind me at my flat he should have come through right after me confusion was audible in my voice and i couldntstop a small spark of panic run through me at the fear i saw in harry face he knew something that i didn t immediately i started to worry about the young man who i had basically adopted he might just be playing with my fridge i said but i didnt sound very convinced and harry certainly wasn t he ignored my comment and headed to the fireplace grabbing a handful of floo powder held in a cauldron next to it stay here i ll be right back with cairn he said a fierce determination in his voice i nodded at him and watched as he called out my address and was gone in a flash pacing didnthelp calm me down or lessen the worry and after a couple of minutes which i thought were an eternity i decided to stop waiting i couldntstop my mind remembering what cairn had told me before about his torture by the hands of the death eaters and it wasnthelping me stop worrying waiting is something that i intensely dislike i not very patient and apparently i not very cautious either since i was now grabbing a handful of the floo powder and just like harry moments before was using it to go back to my apartment my knees buckled and i collapsed to the floor in my fireplace uncaring at the dirt covering me now my hand gripped at the stones on the fireplace trying to desperately dig myself out of what i was seeing stones stayed where they were and i stayed where i was staring horrified at what was in front of me during a trip to africa i had seen a few simple rituals to bring someone back from the dead all that had occurred was a few simple twitches of the corpse before it laid back dead once again the locals called it a resurrection i just called it gross i didntsee the point but then with so many rituals the point has been lost over the years i was amazed though at the temporary movement that was until a professor at nyu who taught about aboriginal rites and rituals informed me what was really going on they used some strange mixture in these rituals and apparently the chemicals that they used caused certain tremors reflexes to appear in the corpse i didntreally know what he had been saying it was all too scientific and technical for me to truly get either way it was nothing to be amazed over there was no person in the dead corpse making it move instead it was just a chemical causing a temporary and fleeting appearance of movement it never lasted more then a few minutes but it was enough for those small tribes to think they were accomplishing something after i learnt the truth about what was actually going on i was positive that real resurrections didntoccur nothing i had seen would lend itself to proof of that certainly not a twitching dead person but i did have a change of thought last summer i went to china to do some research for a book i was writing i didntknow exactly what i wanted to do it on but then that was typical of my writing endeavors i would choose a location go there get to know the place and see what was interesting then i would take that interesting idea and build a book around it in the distant supposed uninhabited area of china near the mongolia border i witnessed something that i suppose was interesting but i think perhaps interesting isntthe proper word it doesnthave the emphasis i would need for what i saw i mentioned to my translator that i had witnessed a few resurrections in africa and south america and that obviously none of them were real my translator agreed but then decided to change my perception he brought me to a little village where a girl had just died the cause had been some disease that i am sure would have been curable anywhere other then there but that wasntthe point the point was that this village had what i can assume you could call a witch doctor they were going to try and raise her body i not sure how my translator managed to do it but he got me the privilege of seeing the ritual and i did indeed witness it it was like nothing i had ever seen certainly not the mumbo jumbo that had occurred in africa with their resurrections instead this one seemed more official i suppose you could say the girl lifeless body was centered on a design that had been etched into the floor by the witch doctor the design was nothing i had seen some circles chinese words i dontknow she was placed there and then they threw something in the air and started chanting something blood was given and then and then my nightmares started the girl started to move not the twitches i had seen before but actual movements nothing natural her body looked like what she was a corpse flesh hanging off her the stench of death reaching my nose i was amazed though by what i saw and in fact i thought it was a miracle until she made the noise low in her throat a guttural groan came out a noise that made my body still in an instant so much pain and anger was in that one noise added to the slow jerking motions of the rotting corpse in front of me and i couldnthandle it anymore i ran out of that room and lost my lunch due to that i was banned from that village resurrected corpses apparently cantlive for too long my translator explained to me that right after i left the body stopped moving all noise stopped this was part of the reason i was banned for the ritual apparently my abrupt departure had disturbed something so i was blamed for the lack of success if you can call a moving moaning dead girl a success i couldntfind out what they had done but in truth i didntwant to know perhaps in that moment i lost my ability to calmly dissect facts witness the strange and unusual from then on i put myself completely into my teaching job my occult interests stayed on what i already knew the safe subjects this was something i wanted to forget but i never forgot it was the most horrible thing i had ever witnessed until now my throat was dry numb clogged by something i heard dimly an echoing scream fill the room my throat wasntclogged anymore the person screaming was me harry heard me and turned running over to the fireplace putting himself between me and the sight that was on my floor pulverized meat the left overs from a deli that was what lay ahead of me on my living room floor it was an unrecognizable disease on my home even as i recognized a leg and an arm in the flesh lying there a baseball cap lying toppled over to the side god aine i told you to stay at the house he said it gently even as his hands dug painfully into my shoulders the nails biting in deep letting me know that despite the calmness in his voice his body was anything but aine he shook me slightly and my eyes drifted away from the quivering corpse of what i had to assume had once been cairn murkhart memories of the failed resurrection i had seen last summer entered my head added with this i turned my head and lost whatever contents i had in my stomach all over the fireplace harry ran his hand up and down my back as i continued to heave nothing left though to come up finally i stopped resting my forehead against the cool stone i sent him here this early because i was worried that voldemort had gotten wind of my plan that he might have heard about you coming to see me i didntwant to waste anytime past what i had promised there were tears in harry eyes one blink and they were running down his face but i didntthink he d come here risk being found out too soon so i sent cairn a squib i sent him to his death he shook his head as if too erase the memories in his head turn back time perhaps take back what he believed he had done to cairn a hand reached out and grabbed harry arm tightly i realized it was my own a moment later harry you had better not blame yourself for this i whispered my voice still a little raw from being sick i didntlike voldemort before this but this was getting too close to home this was my home i had liked cairn he might have been too fidgety and a looked a bit like a weasel but he had been so sweet he had looked like a child when he had been looking into my fridge i knew his childhood had been destroyed by voldemort but he still had tried so hard to live on with all that had happened to him i had been surprised with what i had been told but his presence had helped calm me with it cairn was four years younger then i but he was still a child who i had wanted to protect today i hadntknown him for very long but i had adopted him as my little brother even if at the time we hadnt been too serious it was serious now i was only now realizing the reality of this situation my situation i was in the middle of a fight with a dark wizard who would kill anyone in his way he hadntjust killed cairn no he had decimated his body leaving nothing to even recognize the small man by only the torn remains of a hand and leg a bloody baseball cap even identified that bloody mass of flesh as what once was a human we need to bring sirius black back to life i croaked out pulling myself up from the cold floor of the fireplace i avoided looking at the destruction that was my living room and instead stared determinedly into harry emerald eyes looking frail and childlike the tears had stopped running leaving tracks on his face i was only two years older then him but i reached down and pulled him up wrapping my arms around him like i would have for a child today i was acting like the older sister some sister i was though i couldnteven protect one of my little brothers i ll definitely bring sirius black back to life and he ll know where the horcrux is you can destroy it and voldemort permanently this time he sniffed but stayed quiet in my arms for a few moments before pulling away and the fragile child was gone he smiled at me once again the young man who had already defeated the dark lord a number of times of course i will he turned back to the remains of cairn and pulled out his wand with a small movement the body was gone the blood everything i swallowed a bit painfully thankful to not see a reminder of death anymore let get back to england then we need to finish this neither of us had bared the forethought to bring extra floo powder worry about our friend had cancelled out sensible thought i suppose we could take a plane back to england i said softly still avoiding looking at even the place where the body had been this caused a small laugh to erupt past harry lips it wasnta happy sound hold on to me i apologize for this but we have no other choice i do not have the time to spare on a plane he wrapped his arms around me which i quickly did as well closing my eyes as well i had no idea what he was talking about but right now i was not in the mood to argue time seemed to pull around us and when i dared open my eyes again it was to see the old furnishings of 12 grimmauld place my eyes were open but all of a sudden the room started to spin nothing staying in the same place i dug my fingers into harry to keep my balance but i couldntstop myself from turning away from him my stomach once again tumultuous i started to gag again whether this was from what had happened or the trip back i was unsure i sorry about that harry led me over to the couch dropping me onto it gently dust rose up from it where i sat the first time one apparates causes quite a lot of discomfort he pulled a piece of chocolate out of his robes giving me a weak smile remus taught me to always carry some chocolate it works wonders on most things chocolate melted on my tongue and caused the swirling room to stop and even my stomach to stop it upheaval better at my nod harry stood up determination set on his features good then we ll get started just a few hours i might have been angry at being pushed like this when i was so obviously not okay now though i bared no ill will toward the young man in front of me a few hours ago i didntknow exactly what i was getting myself into now i stood up firmly aware of what i was going to do what i had to do and why it had to be done harry reasons might have been vast to save the entire world i just wanted revenge for one tortured young man who had become my little brother a n okay well here the latest chapter enjoy i a little saddened that no one commented on me killing cairn off it was really very emotional for me but i suppose no one else found it so heh oh well enjoy this chapter the next one might take a few days since i will be busy but i shall try and make sure it goes up before the end of the week chapter 6 harry and i sat in the kitchen of this old building it was in fact the most lived in part of the house that i had seen so far it looked liked it was used regularly and that someone actually took care of it kitchens are always the one room in any place that gives the feeling of comfort of family even in this antiquated building the room gave some comfort we sat there my bag open on the table all the contents spread out for harry to see i was now explaining what everything was for what had to happen harry had removed the clag a bh is from his robes placing it upon the table with the rest of the ingredients for the ritual you know the final thing i need is his body i whispered staring at the wooden object on the table i fully knew this last obstacle was the hardest after all sirius black body was out of our reach behind a veil a veil which hid a place no one could ever imagine it wasnteven certain if this old man body was going to be there if this ritual was going to work at all we ll be going to the ministry tonight harry looked tired worn completely through there was no tears in his eyes anymore but there was a broken edge to them now i wondered briefly how many times he had that look in his eyes it was only eleven in the morning so we still had quite a long time before anything would be started then i had explained to harry everything that i needed to do what everything was for he listened calmly nodding as i continued on if this doesntwork it had to be said again after all without his actual body there was no guarantee that this ritual was going to bring sirius black back to life i didntlike reminding harry about the chance of failure if it doesntwork then believe me i will help you come up with something else i smiled slightly at the black haired man sitting across from me his head came up a bit in surprise but he smiled in return harry are you here a voice called from the entryway and suddenly a young man appeared in the doorway to the kitchen he had pale blonde hair that framed his face curling slightly at the nape of his neck his features were pointed but aristocratic regal and he walked into the room bearing evidence to his background his walk confident the clothes he wore fit him perfectly the robes made of expensive fabric he was probably the most attractive man i had seen before judging from a purely objective view point after all i wasnt overly fond of blondes i didntdoubt that if he came to nyu matt caulder would instantly lose his title harry might have been good looking but next to this adonis he was just cute draco harry whispered looking up at draco and i instantly panicked the tears were back this time pouring freely from his eyes without wasting a moment the man who i now knew as draco malfoy was tearing across the room to kneel by harry chair i was slightly amazed to see a man who had looked so elegant taking no care to how he looked as he rushed to the black haired man side surprise over his actions had shocked me a bit so that i hadnteven noticed that draco had harry head resting on his shoulder while he gently stroked his hand through the raven locks whispering words into his ear harry had started to sob wrapping his arms around his blonde protector draco looked up and caught my eye looking at me suspiciously before he obviously decided it wasntme who had caused the pain and tears he rose an eyebrow at me and i instantly started to explain what had happened at the news of cairn death without the exact details since i still couldntbring myself to explain what had happened to his body draco looked shocked sick even his attention was brought back to the man in his arms who had stopped crying but who hadntmoved his head from draco chest the look on the blonde man face was so devastated that i had to look away well a gay hero in a children book would probably have been a hard sell not surprising that this little bit had been left out of the books i didntdoubt that i was right not from the look on the slytherin face as he held harry nor the way the gryffindor was clutching at the other young man it really was a sweet scene even if it was heartbreaking as well finally harry pulled away from draco giving him a watery smile which the other young man tried to return worry though caused his smile to falter slightly draco this is aine i told you about her before he nodded to me and i looked at the now standing slytherin who was giving me a look that wasntexactly the most friendly i going to avenge cairn i said firmly ignoring the hard look i was now getting being a muggle makes me basically useless but i will bring your sirius black to life again if tonight doesntwork then i will find something else i promise you that i wasntsure why i felt the need to make these promises to the blonde man in front of me staring at me with such a discerning look but i did need to explain maybe because i knew he was harry real protector or maybe it was the fact that i wanted him to stop glaring at me since i too wasntin the best moods right now perhaps it was also the fact that i bore something in common with this man the feeling of protection for the boy sitting across from me at my vehement promise the draco eyes softened a bit toward me he still appeared a bit wary but i thought he likely understood my need to make good on my reason for being there while his eyes didnt glare at me anymore his face was still hard no emotion appearing on it i didntwant to ever be on the wrong side of this one draco harry tugged gently on the blonde sleeve bringing his attention away from me and back to the man seated by him i was amazed at how quickly the hard emotionless facade was gone he was immediately open sympathetic to harry be nice to aine this caused draco eyes to flicker back to me narrowing a bit before harry continued speaking brought them away from me i released the breath i wasntaware i had been holding we need her tonight she helped so much already anything for you love draco smiled at harry even not directed at me it was dazzling i didntthink i wanted to be on the other end of that smile either it would likely wipe away any chance of original thought it appeared to have that effect on it intended target since harry was now looking up at draco adoration in his eyes i smiled at them both you re both so cute together i said it but then blushed when they both looked at me draco looked a bit amused but harry was matching the colour in my face sorry i just happy to see that things arentall bad a smirk appeared on the pale blonde face reminding me again which house he had been in with me around nothing can be all bad supreme confidence flowed from him in any other circumstances i might have found him arrogant but right now we needed all the confidence we could get harry hand was grasped by draco holding tightly to him and i knew he too needed the feeling coming from the man good i stood up glad my shaking knees didntcause me to falter for some reason i did not want to appear weak in front of this young malfoy i had my pride after all and i was older then him if you two dontmind i going to avail myself of one of the showers upstairs it been a long day and we haventeven really started it yet i pushed some of my dark brown hair out of my eyes there was a dirty feeling clinging to me needing to be washed off as soon as possible if things went well tonight i d likely be having more showers to rid myself of the dirt i ll show you harry started to get up but both draco and i quickly disabused him of that idea i dontthink so potter i shook my head you look ready to fall over get some coffee or whatever wizard drink you like stay there cuddle with your cute little man there i winked at the two of them ignoring the look i was getting just relax for a moment all i need is general directions i sure i cantget too lost in a house like this draco detached his hand from harry and walked toward me i ll show her harry i ll be right back he opened the kitchen door for me and led me through closing it quietly behind the two of us thank you for that if someone doesnttell him to stop he just keeps going i could tell that this gratitude was something i shouldnt expect too often from this man so i grinned brightly at him i realized that soon after meeting him he does have a bit of a saviour complex it rather cute actually at draco measuring look i shook my head dontworry mr malfoy i am in no way interested in your man he sort of become like a younger brother to me he walked me over to the stairs and spoke quietly this was likely to avoid waking up mrs black again i never worry about harry in that regard but i appreciate what you re going to do for him for all of us even if i was and perhaps still am completely against using a muggle for the job instead of being affronted at his words i laughed softly i was worried for a minute that the draco from the books was a complete fake i glad to see you ve still got that hard ass bastard in you dontworry though this muggle is the best at the job you ve given her you should be able to understand this at least being the best i will get it done and you wanted the best didntyou the bathroom is at the top of the stairs turn right and it the last room on the left he pointed up the stairs a small smile was all that told me how he had felt about my last comment when i finally came back down the stairs it was feeling the freshness one feels after a nice long shower i had let the water wash away my anxiety the worry i felt over what i was doing finally i entered the kitchen my usual confidence exuding from my body i didntrealize you were actually attractive draco said drily sipping at something in the cup in his hands earlier you looked like a banshee maybe our shower is enchanted he mused this out loud oblivious to the mirthless expression i was giving him i ll have you know that i am nyu sexiest female teacher three years running i huffed at him even as i thanked harry with a smile for the coffee he placed in my hand if i had any idea what that was i might care draco continued to drink his coffee unaffected by the glare i was giving him i suppose that something like the best smile award that lockhart used to go on about pointless and stupid harry was watching all this with a rather amused expression on his face which alone made me not get angry at the blonde across from me ah the statements from someone who has never won an award for best smile or for being sexy i nodded sagely trying very hard to keep the smile from slipping onto my face my statement had the desired effect and now there was a decided glower on the blonde pointed face now harry was laughing quietly but both of us noticed and turned to look at him i winked at draco who sighed but looked rather glad for the distraction we had given harry it was obvious that if nothing else the one thing that this slytherin cared about was the bespectacled black haired boy laughing at us i was wondering something i seated myself at the kitchen table and ignored the pointed look i was now receiving from draco apparently he didntwant me to ruin harry mood how are we going to get into the ministry tonight this question seemed to pass draco approval since he looked back to harry the young man was leaning against the counter looking less fragile then you would expect from his overly protective boyfriend there was no broken look in his eyes in fact they looked quite bright behind his glasses bright and determined we ll simply walk in he grinned at the confused look on my head i the man who defeated lord voldemort i got whatever job i wanted so i actually work at the ministry in fact i work in the department of mysteries his eyes became a little clouded then i thought i might be able to find a way myself to get sirius out but that damned veil is a mystery to everyone he growled this out showing his hatred for the gateway that had swallowed up the body of his godfather they certainly wontquestion draco what he trying to say is they wontquestion me since everyone is well aware of the fact that we re shagging like bunnies he smirked at me but if he had been hoping to get a blush out of me he was mistaken i just laughed at that anyway harry muttered his face was certainly a shade of red and as for you i ll just announce you as a guest of mine no one should be there late at night anyway we shouldntbe there late at night draco muttered but smiled at the glare he received from his dark haired lover but of course no one will care if the almighty potter was in the building after hours after all he would never do anything wrong there was a definite roll of the eyes at this and i covered my mouth to stop the laugh that was threatening to come out anyway his voice carried an edge of authority to it this time causing draco to keep his mouth shut but he still had an amused look in his eyes why is it just us three i asked questioning why there was going to be no one else coming along all i could think of though was that from reading the seven books about this man the two people that always accompanied him on his little adventures had been hermione granger and ron weasley and there didntappear to be hide nor hair of them it didntsit well with me that the friendship between the three had just been an invention for the book i haventtold anyone else what i was planning shame laced harry voice draco wouldnteven know if he hadntfigured it out the look on the man face showed that he hadntbeen happy about being left out of harry plan his slightly dangerous plan i certainly didntwant to involve ron or hermione i felt actually relieved to hear their names so that friendship hadnt been made up for the books the two of them got married about five years back hermione just had her second child actually i knew he was explaining this to me since i didntknow what had happened after the books and he must have figured out that my question had pertained to why those two werent coming tonight it her second boy there was no way i was going to risk their lives no way i was going to leave my godchildren without parents they will stay out of all of this this time around there was that determined set to his face again and i certainly wasntgoing to argue with it nor it appeared was draco we dontneed anyone else anyway draco drawled out his wand now in his hand twirling deftly between his fingers the muggle here aine i said firmly whatever aine here does the ritual harry watches over her and i watch over the lot of you his shoulders shrugged and even that movement had a graceful quality to it glad we have such a strong protector i said sarcasm dripping from my words draco gave me a hard look but i just smiled prettily at the man across from me i hope you re ready to help me stagger out of the ministry as well after all i going to be giving a lot of blood tonight at this statement harry pushed away from the counter surprise on his face no aine i know you need blood but i ve already decided that it going to be mine at this draco was now standing looking like a lion about to be let loose you are not going to give any blood at all i absolutely forbid it harry was now staring down draco who wasntbacking down at all emerald met grey in a battle of the wills you cantstop me it needs to be done i at least am not going to let a woman do the dirty work for me he growled at draco who wasnt affected at all dig at his ethical standards concerning me giving blood forgive me for caring more about your well being then a muggle woman i met only an hour ago i stood up suddenly drawing the attention of both the men sorry to ruin your lovely lover squabble but i will be giving the blood when harry opened his mouth to argue i put my hand up sorry mr potter this one time your complex will have to be put on hold you cantgive the blood unless you can also do the ritual his mouth closed and i continued on confident in his understanding the person doing the ritual has to be the one to give the blood my words my actions my blood all right the dark hair shook as he nodded draco looked immensely relieved but the cold mask dropped down quickly enough when he noticed that i had seen the relief come over him he really was cute when it came to harry if you had told me only a day ago that harry potter was involved romantically with draco malfoy i would have been completely against it granted the boy had redeemed himself in the last book of the series even becoming tentative friends with the gryffindor boy wonder but that didntmean i would have thought him suitable he was still a pureblooded wizard who considered himself above everyone else that hadntchanged after i met him but his concern and devotion where harry was concerned had tipped the scales in his favor the story of how the two of them had gotten together was one i would love to hear but i didntthink this was the time to ask that question one would probably blush and the other would smirk at me neither would likely tell me i so glad we got that dealt with now as i said i might be a little dizzy after the ritual so i hope it wontbe underneath you to help me out draco dear i fluttered my eyelashes at him he just rolled his eyes aine dear you do this successfully and i ll carry you out with a bloody parade elephants included can i also have a marching band i smiled benignly at him he just snorted deciding there was no point continuing on with this little word match cairn really liked elephants harry said smiling but the instant the words left his lips the smile disappeared even with the light atmosphere there was no forgetting what had happened only hours earlier who doesntlove elephants i smiled calmly at harry the last few hours before nightfall were spent quietly everyone thinking of what had to be done and what had been done to them already there was no forgetting cairn his ghost lingered in all of our thoughts even as we prepared to raise the dead a n so i hope no one hates me now or decides not to read this anymore purely based on who i put harry with it really isntgoing to be a big deal to the story it like a background deal in the end i chose draco since i happen to think he isntthat bad after book six after all he didntgo through with it and i really think he ll turn out to be good in the end after all this story takes place quite a long time after the books end and people change well sort of not to mention draco is just far more fun to write after all he never going to be sparklingly good dontget me wrong i adore ginny in the books and i like her with harry but draco and harry is an interesting idea to write but like i said it really a background issue so please dontjudge the story based on just that but of course feel free to review and tell me you hate the match i prepared for it just keep the flames to a minimum please thank you a n well no one has flamed me about draco and harry so that a good sign thank you all for your continued interest in the story inu angelz thank you for the reassurance i truly hope people wouldntdislike the story based on a couple but you never know i appreciate the mention of cairn too anyway please continue to read and tell me what you think i always appreciate it and to everyone else please r r you know i live or die for the reviews enjoy this chapter it was my favourite to write chapter 7 the badge that now was pinned to my shirt said guest of harry potter on a mission to bring sirius black back to life it was rather amusing how correct these badges were but i had to wonder if this was going to be logged for future viewing then anyone would know what we had been doing there that night harry and draco seemed unconcerned though so i suppose i had no reason to be worried i shifted my bag on my shoulder and followed the two men through the darkened hallways of the ministry of magic trying not to look too amazed at my surroundings it was just hard when i had read about this place so often would you hurry up draco called out to me shortly there was a tick at his temple a warning that he wasntin the best mood at the moment i didntdoubt that he was carrying the worry for all of us or at least he was carrying the worry for harry his eyes glanced furtively around the room looking for anyone that could be hiding lord voldemort i think would have set off some sort of alarm but then he likely could get past any paltry alarm system and he likely wouldntbe alone this caused me to pick up my speed far faster then draco annoyance either way he was just glad that i was moving again instead of gaping at the fountain or the portraits slumbering on the walls the long walk down a simple corridor opened into a circular room which once we closed the door started to spin making me dizzy the water like floor not helping my head at all harry though didntbear this any attention calmly walking to a door and opening it with confidence it spoke of years of working in the department of mysteries that without any doubt he had opened the door to the death room we entered and i stared at the veiled archway standing on the other side of the room when we finally made it to our destination and he had a quick look around draco finally seemed to let out the breath he had been holding since we had entered this building i wasntconcerned with him though all my attention laid on that crumbling archway it black curtain still in the cold room both harry and draco looked uncomfortable being around it it was then that the voices started to whisper in my head nothing intelligible nothing i could understand it was like the chatter you hear in a crowded room the low mumble of too many people surrounding you i knew now why the two men were so uncomfortable around this archway i pushed the voices out of my head though concentrating on my task for the night i still hear the voices harry said quietly draco took his hand squeezing it so do i but they re just voices he sounded sure but even i noticed the discomfort in his eyes he smiled confidently at harry before releasing his hand good luck muggle he didntbother smiling at me just nodding in my direction i nodded back and then draco left the room going to stand guard for us i didntenvy him standing in that revolving room i unpacked everything i needed as harry shuffled nervously standing as far from the archway that he could manage i could still hear the voices for whatever reason that was but at the moment i was focusing on the ritual the black tattered curtain covering i knew not what was strange enough without adding voices do they say anything to you i couldnthelp asking wondering if i was going to start hearing someone speaking directly to me sometimes harry left it at that his eyes going unfocused letting the questioning go i brought out the chalk and started to draw a protective circle on the floor using oghum letters around it stating the intention of the ritual to draw forth someone from beyond the grave or in this case from beyond the veil once done i held the clag a bh is in my hands but paused before continuing harry remember what you promised me two months ago my voice was quiet but echoed off the empty stone walls i ll do what i have to do he nodded a grim expression set on his face good luck thanks i took a deep breath holding the silver dagger in my other hand with a quick motion i sliced into the flesh of my left arm blood dripping from the wound to my credit nothing more then a hiss passed my lips quickly i held the hollow wooden object under the dripping blood and after what seemed like an age passed it filled my head was spinning though the room moving uncertainly in front of me as i swayed i noticed harry move forward to help me don t i fine you cantstep into the circle i tried to smile reassurance at him but the loss of blood was doing strange things to my head and all i could manage was a grimace but harry stayed where he was not risking the failure of this ritual somehow i managed to take the bones and dirt and mix them with my own blood before shutting the cap on the clag a bh is if i wasntimagining things then the wood was starting to grow warm in my hands a slight glow covering it i swallowed thickly wondering for the millionth time what i was doing cairn face flashed in my mind eye and i started to chant the words my mind focusing hard on who i had to bring back from the dead caisil chr aaruggyr airidh amhas beatha rong saoghal the gaelic words passed my lips and i chanted them repeatedly flowing into a rhythm the words dancing in the air around me even as the clag a bh is clutched tightly in my hand began to grow hotter almost too much for me too hold as i continued to chant the wooden cylinder in my hand began to emit a bright light drowning out everything else in the room dimly i could hear harry gasp of surprise but i paid no heed to it my tongue was starting to grow heavy the words still coming easily though but my body was weakening from the blood loss the continued blood loss since the deep knife wound on my arm was still dripping blood into the stone floor i didntknow how long i was going to have to continue this i had no idea how long this was going to take i didntknow if i was going to make it harry draco pushed open the door i dontknow who but there are people com his speech was cut short surprised at what he was seeing a hand went up to his eyes to protect them from the light that the object in my hand was emitting the light i was emitting i was focused on what i had to say giving all my attention on the words paying no heed to what was going on around me ignoring draco entrance harry surprise my mouth was going dry my limbs felt heavy and finally i felt my body give out on me darkness starting to surround me the last thing i saw was a flutter pass through the veil as if an unseen hand had disturbed the black fabric the last thing i heard was harry agonized scream and with that scream the last thought i had before sleep over took me was what horror had descended upon us from beyond the veil sirius black or something else entirely and then there was just silence and the comfort of darkness a n the gaelic words she says arentreally a sentence or anything they re just random words that i thought sort of went like resurrection life bad death that sort of stuff i hope everyone liked this chapter since it was one of my favourites to write please r r a n well a complete and resounding thank you goes to everyone who has been reading this and who have reviewed it really is fun to write this i hope people dontmind that it taking some time to actually get to important points but i ve never been one to cut corners in stories i dontlike to just jump from major plot point to plot point unless i writing fluff heh anyway i hope you enjoy this chapter and as always please read and review rabailey ah you were my first reviewer and now you re my first flamer i know you dontlike harry and draco but i sorry that it has decreased your like of the story but it not going to change i try not to make such a big deal of them though but if you dislike malfoy well there nothing to do about that though it depresses me to hear you say the story has spiraled down into the depths of whatever is it really that bad but i shall agree with you on one thing i do love sirius and he is the reason i am writing this story rheniel thank you i glad you like the relationship between draco and aine i try quite hard on that after all they re both strong characters and draco is never going to be nice inu angelz and as always i adore your reviews thank you as always for the positive feedback c m aeris queen of insanity what a long name love it though severus and harry eh cantsay i completely behind that but it an interesting idea not sure whether i shall bring the good old potions master into this story we shall see i thrilled you like the story though leeloo77 thank you for all the reviews happy some people donthate the harry and draco thing heh the ritual was an interesting idea to come up with but i just took what i knew of other rituals and used that as for cairn well i had to kill him off purely because in this story voldemort isntdead yet and i had to make sure people realized that it not all fun and games but i was sad to kill him he was cute and squirrely and i do like the idea of rowling as a squib the poor wizards having their lives be made into a book i know i wouldnt be happy about it especially if i got no royalties or nothing chapter 8 i woke up a scream just dying on my lips as i looked around me eyes flitting wildly around the room trying to identify everything in it the old disused furniture tattered heavy brocade curtains blocking out the sun an overwhelmingly large armchair in the corner the bed i was sitting in covered in the only new thing in the entire room a modern cotton comforter with different shades of blue on it it all took a moment to register after the horrors in my own mind the endless stream of creatures in my head that had descended upon me from beyond the veil the veil which had hid in fact a horrifying world of half alive half dead people all shuffling toward me as the clag a bh is broke into a million pieces hearing harry scream and i fell backwards into darkness a dream it had all been a nightmare a nightmare created by my feverish mind after the ritual my imagination had gone full speed preparing me for the worst even as my body defeated me i knew i had been sick my body felt heavy there was a soft thumping behind my eyes and the sheets under me were wet from the sweat pouring off my naked body my left arm was bandaged tightly but i could still feel the wound beating under the wrappings reminding me what i had done oh god i covered my face with my hands hoping to block out the realization that something might have gone wrong something probably had gone wrong i had used blood magic a ritual that involved blood was never safe but to avenge cairn i had gone blindly on to help harry i had thrown all my caution to the wind to bring sirius black back to life i had turned my back on the horrible memories of what resurrections were had harry killed what had come out killing his own godfather whatever shape or form he had come through as would have been hell for the poor boy and it would have been my fault all i could think was that if it had gone wrong then it would have been my fault my blood wasntgood enough the ingredients i had found werentthe best the words hadntbeen said right i hadntlasted long enough i just wasntgood enough it was a debt i would owe harry i had promised to bring his godfather back and it was something i was going to have to try and do even as my throbbing arm and weak body reminded me of the end game of a blood ritual the opening of the door reminded me sharply that i was sitting in this old bed naked and my feminine pride brought my hand up quickly grasping the sheet tightly over my nudity i didntwonder at why i was naked not with the sheets still wet from the sweat clothes would have just been impractical and uncomfortable the only question was who had done the stripping strange that even after horrifying nightmares i could still be worried about who had seen me naked grey eyes looked over me with relief before quickly being replaced with amusement at the tight clutch i was making at the sheets dont be a prude little muggle draco smirked as his eyes traveled all the way across my form i didntthink he was looking in the way a normal man would instead checking to make sure all of me was still there still working it was very clinical but the blush still crossed my skin someone had to take your clothes off so i ve seen it all believe me it did nothing for me even knowing he played for the other team it didnthelp to hear he didntfind me attractive once again it amazed me that i could worry about such a silly thing after what had happened i didnt care that the cold draco didntfind me attractive but really why did he have to be the one to undress me i just had a feeling that he was going to remind me of it constantly he entered the room and walked over to the bed placing the back of his hand over my forehead telling my temperature satisfied that it was normal he grabbed my left arm leaving my right one still holding the sheet up and checked the bandage to make sure the wound hadnt opened you ve been asleep for three weeks it was the answer to my silent question it was said in such an offhand matter i almost didntbelieve the man but there was a small worry line between his brows and his eyes were serious as they looked into mine he wasntplaying around now harry has been worried sick about you he said that crossly as if it had been my fault that i had slept for almost a month that perhaps next time i did a blood ritual i would have the decency to wake up quickly afterward the nerve of some people i opened my mouth to rebut that look but my mouth was dry my tongue heavy and no sound could get past my throat draco looked too amused by half to see my floundering to speak i think i prefer you quiet like this if only all muggles would just learn to shut up he sighed longingly i wondered briefly if the death look i was giving him was working at all he still lived pointed aristocratic features pale blonde hair amused grey eyes so apparently i lacked that skill there must have been a small flash of pity for me though because the cold adonis sitting next to me on the bed brought out his wand and conjured up a glass of water for me drink this your throat is just sore after disuse he pushed the glass into my hands keeping them on mine for a moment to be sure that i didntdrop it i tilted the glass back the cold liquid sliding down my throat in only a matter of seconds the water was gone quickly enough draco conjured more water into the glass and i drank that just as quickly you d make an interesting doctor i croaked out the throat still a little sore but at least i could speak now amazingly enough a small real smile slid onto draco lips at my comment not his usual smirk at all but a rather pleased expression actually i am a mediwizard i eyed him for a moment trying to tell if he was just joking but there was no mocking expression in his eyes and the genuine smile alone was proof of his honesty a mediwizard was in the books a wizard equivalent to a doctor so my comment had been spot on the new information about the icy slytherin put him into a new light it was a profession that would likely have been beneath a malfoy i could imagine daddy thoughts on that matter but then again when your son is shacked up with bloody potter can becoming a doctor really make matters worse other then the familial issues surrounding the career choice it was something i dontthink i would have chosen for the draco malfoy that i had read about in the books excepting that last book he had been far too fond of hurting people surprised the smirk was back on his lips likely amused at my expression not really from you it just that the draco malfoy in the book didnt seem particularly inclined to help people especially as something so mundane as a doctor the look i was being given would have shriveled any plant but i just tried to smile in apology my dear muggle here is another lesson in not believing everything you read that woman made me out to be far worse then i was she did the same thing for my entire house he drew himself up looking every inch the lord he was i of course have not been the nicest person the way his eyes were looking at me now suggested he still wasntthe nicest person but i was not nearly as vindictive or as evil as i was made out you ll notice the sudden change i make in the last book to the other side rowling couldntkeep me evil not when i was integral to bringing voldemort down i snorted at that of course he would consider himself to be an all important factor to destroying the dark lord just ignore harry involvement completely rather calmly he ignored my little amused outburst anyway i was the best student at potions and one thing that woman never got a hold of was the information that i spent a large amount of my free time up with madame pomfrey getting lessons it was a secret the lessons and my desire to learn so she didntfind out about it even with the extensive sources she had he muttered this angry once again at the woman who had made money off his harry he shook his head shaking the anger for the squib from his mind going back to his original conversation being a mediwizard was a natural choice and i quite enjoy having people owe their lives to me now that sounded like the draco i knew and loved well as i said you make a good doctor i twisted and turned my left arm appreciating the good job he had done on the bandage though i do have to wonder you re a wizard why use muggle means to stop the bleeding a frown had settled between the pale brows and a heated look was in his eyes not directed at me but instead at the wound i tried actually the damned thing wouldnttake there was disgust in his voice whether it was for me the bandaged arm or his own skills i wasntsure but he certainly didntlook pleased that my injury had been beyond his abilities as a mediwizard using muggle means to stop the bleeding probably hadntsat well with him either be careful of that it still not completely healed i dontknow why though rituals could likely have side effects perhaps this was one of them that the wound that had brought about the end result didntheal naturally the caster perhaps had to keep the pain as a reminder of what had occurred the thought settled well in my brain i liked the idea of holding a constant reminder of what i had done it was too easy to forget sometimes what we dontlike what we want to put behind us well if i had to look forward to being unconscious for three weeks and having a hard to heal wound then i wasntgoing to be performing any more blood rituals in the near future in any future if i could help it three weeks had gone by almost a month i had been asleep for most of august which meant that it was almost septemeber and that meant school was starting soon i had a class to teach students to help lesson plans to finalize an aggressive department head to avoid not to mention people might have started to wonder where i had disappeared to i d love to stay here in bed for the rest of the month another month besides but as much as i would love to just sleep and let my body recover there was no way i could do that sigh sometimes i really hate responsibility a n normally i d put a little more time between chapters but i ve actually got a good headstart on this story and have a few chapters all locked and set so here another i had two new reviews inuangelz well really you re just a sweetheart i glad you like aine ilikechicken i think perhaps i see why anonymous reviews get disabled heh this review made no sense to me marysue and her entire name is spelt correctly this brings up a little point that i think some people are getting confused by aine isnta made up name it celtic it means joy i shall be the first to admit i love odd names which is one reason i adore harry potter because jk rowling comes up with such nice names from astronomy mythology and history and they all have meanings for their characters sirius is my all time favourite perhaps i ll make my kids life hell and name him sirius anyway please as always review i sometimes feel like a beggar asking maybe a bribe would work i ll give you a cookie or maybe not chapter 9 i swung my legs over the side of the bed quickly wincing at the immediate negative response my body gave me being quite the doctor i was used to draco shook his head at the sudden movements trying to push me back into bed you re certainly not fit enough to get out of bed at my angry glare and my insistence to get up he gave up that was the draco i was used to if you were going to be stupid enough to ignore him he wasntabout to stop you normally i would be more then happy to stay in bed i enjoyed my sleep and i was perfectly aware of the pain my body was in at this moment in time the problem was that i had been out for three weeks meaning that it was now almost september and i had classes to teach my family was likely panicked wondering where i was just what i didntneed to come home to a police search for my dead body i tried to stand up but my legs proved to be mutinous against my thoughts because they buckled under me sending me back onto the bed i ignored draco triumphant look and tried again with the same results a growl started low in my throat at the blonde continued gloating no need to get angry i told you that you werenthealthy enough yet he tried to push me back to lie down but i shook off his hands there was no amusement in his eyes now personally i wouldnt care if you got up and collapsed opening your wound and bleeding to death but i cantlet that happen because harry would care so i have to care he sounded almost petulant like a child who just found out his beloved parent was getting remarried to a harridan and would have to pretend to like the woman the thought made me smirk at his predicament the poor malfoy probably had to put up with quite a lot being involved with potter the saint it brought a renewed wonder about their relationship to my eyes the thought of asking how they had got together came to my lips again but the annoyance in draco eyes stated quite clearly he was unlikely to answer any question from me especially any on a personal level of course there was also the issue of having to get home to my responsibilities my family i tried once again to stand up again but a voice from the door stopped me short aine you re awake i looked up seeing an overjoyed harry flying into the room his shaggy bangs flying into his eyes only to be pushed back with out a thought the sight of the scar on his forehead made my own arm burn slightly his joyous expression though turned to concern when he noticed me trying to get up and draco looking like hell frozen over you cantleave this little statement didntsit well with me i was two years older then both these men granted they were wizards and could likely do anything they wanted to me and in draco case at least i didnt doubt he would love to do something particularly nasty to me at this moment in time but i still didntlike being told what i could and could not do i was a modern woman even if i was a muggle and we didntlet men tell us what to do i started to open my mouth to say just this when my brain registered the worry that had underlined harry voice something wasntright and instantly the memories of my nightmares poured into my vision the fluttering veil and harry agonized voice causing my right hand to clutch at the sheets around me tighter even as my left hand dug into draco arm causing him to wince slightly had i failed after all glad to see the hand still has the rudimentary functions his voice was cold but i could hear a small tremor of concern under the surface as he pried my hand off his arm what happened at the ministry i asked my voice quiet waiting to hear the horrors that had unfolded after i had blacked out the two men looked at each other their eyes speaking even while they were not they were deciding without voice what i should be told and how in the end it looked like harry had won the silent argument because draco looked away a small displeased grimace on his features we got interrupted at the end you had already blacked out though so perhaps it wasntan interruption either way we had no chance to think about who it was we had to get out immediately when draco came running in and you collapsed i was so certain that the ritual had failed that sirius was still lost to me behind the veil his voice spoke the exhaustion he must have felt the feelings of failure my face must have mirrored those feelings of failure because there was a sudden change in harry demeanor a bright smile burst out you did a good job aine it worked i blinked at him in confusion all i could think of were the failed resurrections i had witnessed harry agonized scream the heaviness of my body the interruption none of that came together for a positive end result in my mind all i could think of was that they were lying to me hiding the truth but you screamed i thought it was because i had failed or that i had brought something else back he looked slightly amused like he was looking at a child who didnt know better that was when i thought that your collapse was worse then just blacking out and that the ritual had failed or that voldemort was at the door but only a moment later that veil fluttered slightly and sirius fell through there was a genuinely amazed expression on harry face like he was still expecting to wake from a dream to find that this had all failed that sirius was still dead because we didntknow who was coming draco and i quickly apparated the two of you out and you ve been out ever since i ve been worried so i ve been told i looked sideways at draco who was sitting unconcerned on the edge of the bed i pushed myself off the bed and finally my legs stayed underneath me if perhaps a bit too shaky for my liking harry took a step forward frowning at my standing the other one though stayed seated beside me obviously letting harry do the concerned thing he had tried to get me to stay in bed and wasntabout to miss me fall flat on my face when i tried to walk aine you really cantleave now i was starting to get annoyed with the black haired man standing in front of me looking ready to catch me if i decided i couldntstay up just because he was harry potter didntmean he could dictate to me whether i could leave or not i had made a promise to the two men that i would conduct a successful resurrection and if they were to be believed i had done just that that was the promise i had made my promise to help avenge cairn with that out of the way there was nothing that was keeping me here in england on the other hand i was needed back in america i had a job at a university to teach students i didntdelude myself into thinking that my classes were the most important ones they were going to take or even the most enjoyable but i did remember what my parents had always taught me that one should always live up to one responsibilities so across the ocean were a lot of kids who were waiting for me teach them about proper japanese funeral rites about celtic warriors and everything else in between not to mention my job was on the line and of course there was my family who would have started to panic by now while they were used to me going out of the country over the summer i always told them where i was going i had of course left a message that i was going to england but that was only for a few days it was possible they had assumed i had stayed longer but with the start of school and my continued absence they were going to start to worry if they hadntalready you just said it worked your sirius black is alive and since you looked pleased i shall assume he healthy and fine or is there something wrong with him i tried to look at him with all the pride and authority i could muster it was slightly difficult though my legs were visibly shaking i was dressed only in a sheet that was being clutched by a precariously weak hand i was pale from the effort of just standing no sirius is fine and his statement was interrupted though by a new voice coming from the doorway low and amused causing shivers to go down my spine like fingers caressing he is fine and wondering why you have a sick and naked woman standing in the middle of my bedroom my hand clenched the sheet even tighter around me shielding my nudity from the stranger standing in the doorway his eyes looked me over with concern noting the uncertainty of my stance though he looked amused at my desperate hold on the sheets unlike draco course over my body this wasntin the least bit clinical i felt my whole body get hotter a blush likely spreading over every inch of skin this was sirius black this was the man i had read about the one i had risked my questionably existing soul for the one who i know bore a scar in testament i had thought draco was an adonis complete perfection come to life his face sharp planes and sculpted features but the older man lounging in the doorway giving the aforementioned adonis a sharp look for letting a sick girl out of bed he was all my personal sexual fantasies come to life there was raven black hair long clubbed back at his neck giving the appearance of a short cut only a small amount of gray at his temples his eyes were flashing steel at this moment a look of anger crossing the room to the blonde mediwizard who was shrugging unconcerned with the look he was getting when they turned back on me though the eyes softened a silver as they looked at me the face they were set it was strong the cheeks high the nose proud it was a very good face one i expected to see in movies even if he looked a little worse for wear but after being dead that was to be expected he carried himself with confidence like his cousin except instead of the elegant bearing it was a lazy comfortable feeling that he exuded resting against the door jam i didntdoubt that the clothes he was wearing werenthis to begin with but he seemed completely comfortable in them unlike draco who used clothing for the appearance of confidence this man instead made the clothes fit him instead but it wasntthe second hand material that drew my eye instead it was the promise of what was under them i flushed at my train of thought this was sirius black and i was attracted to him a groan passed my throat this was not what i wanted at all
