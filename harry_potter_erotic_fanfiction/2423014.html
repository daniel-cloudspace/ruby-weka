you love them in this thanks for the compliment i ll try and keep it at a high standard so without further ado xxxxx sorry i know i a lot later than you expected but i was caught up with draco said harry apologetically as he entered the potions room that night arguing severus asked with a quirk of his eyebrow not exactly harry replied trying very hard to suppress a smirk we ve actually been getting on a lot better lately he said the sheer effort required to keep from grinning making his facial muscles twinge severus gave him an appraising look before gesturing for him to take a seat harry smile dwindled he couldnthelp but remember all the other meetings he had with this man and how they had usually been somewhat less than pleasant he knew this time was different now he was there willingly and snape wasntlooking at him with loathing and disgust quite the opposite in fact the man looked almost nervous apprehensive as if he was worried that a wrong word would send harry from the room and out of his life for good i um i was wondering if perhaps you d show me another memory harry asked carefully he didntwant to push the man too far with something that was obviously very painful for him severus looked a little troubled for a moment but he gave an almost imperceptible nod and moved towards a door at the end of the room this leads to my quarters come with me he instructed and harry did so following the man through into a kind of living room once there severus moved to a small cabinet in the corner of the room and extracted the pensieve placing it on a large mahogany table i removed this before you came i thought you might want to see something and this seemed perhaps the most the fitting i suppose it easier than explaining it all to you anyway i dontthink words would really be adequate harry nodded in agreement he was sure that there were no words that could fully describe and explain what had happened in that first year of his life or what severus had gone through some things transcended language so completely there really was no other option he gave a sideways glance to the other man severus silently nodding his permission for harry to step forward and begin learning of his own past he landed gently on the floor of the memory and felt severus do the same beside him he looked over at the man surprised to find his teeth clenched a deep furrow marring the pale forehead harry had half a mind to tell him that it was ok they needntsee the memory if it would be too much but he found that he just couldn t he needed to know he needed to understand all the events and details that had led him to this point in his life but also he needed to see a time when he was loved truly loved even if it was by severus snape he looked around and saw that he was in dumbledore office not much had changed save a different coloured chintz chair and a few knick knacks darkness surrounded the chamber palpable through the paned windows recessed in the wall behind the desk but a few candles were burning and harry could make out the figure of the potions master hunched over in his chair his hands clasped before him so tightly his knuckles had turned white he slowly lifted his head and once again harry saw a much younger version of the man though this one was nowhere near as happy the lines of worry etched into his face were plainly evident and he looked as though he might be sick at any moment when the door opened he almost shot out of his seat his face drawn with anxiety well he asked shakily his voice barely a whisper merlin knows how severus but he survived he escaped with nothing more than a scar said dumbledore softly and harry saw that he was cradling something tightly to his chest james and lily were killed severus sirius found them and harry said the old man handing the fraught looking man the baby in his arms harry severus choked out pulling the tiny infant close to him oh god i thought i d lost you again he breathed looking down into the brilliant emerald spheres that gazed up at him what this he asked as his long fingers traced over the lightening bolt scar a memento from tom said dumbledore gravely severus he tried to perform the killing curse on harry he said and severus clenched his jaw tightly pulling harry even more closely to him somehow the boy managed to repel it it backfired on tom finished him and harry was left with no more than that scar it truly is remarkable i think you have your proof that he is indeed one of the chosen dumbledore said with a sad smile is it the end of voldemort severus asked his voice slightly shaky unable to take his eyes of the small form in his arms i fear not my boy replied dumbledore his face grave and serious i am certain that he will have taken great lengths to ensure his immortality he will be waiting somewhere biding his time gathering his strength and preparing to strike again in the name of merlin why is this happening severus asked his face a mask of torment there are times i almost regret bringing him into the world albus he was born for a purpose to be used used for other people own ends oh i know the circle are merely supposed to produce offspring and have done with them no love or emotion involved heaven knows that how my father was with me but dammit i do love him i cantstand the thought that it my fault he going through all this now his life is in danger because i was obliged to produce an heir to provide the world with their saviour no thought was ever given to him only that he should be brought into existence to serve the purpose of others the whole thing is so utterly intolerable i can barely stomach it severus raged an intense fire burning in his eyes i love him so much albus how can i bear it when i am the one who has placed this burden on his shoulders when i am responsible for the danger he now finds himself in he asked and harry had never heard anyone sound so utterly broken in his entire life you cannot blame yourself for this situation severus dumbledore said gently you did not dictate the circumstances you could not have prevented what happened this is not your fault he said a little more firmly severus let out an exhausted sigh and asked what going to happen now the wizarding world will think that voldemort has been defeated and that we have young harry here to thank for it i want to take him back severus said softly i just want him to be with me i just want to love and protect him dammit all he my son severus surely you see that you cannot take him back although i know you wish with all your heart that you could dumbledore responded compassionately voldemort is still very much a threat to harry he needs to placed where he ll be safe he ll be safe with me severus growled i his father do you think i wouldntdo anything to protect him i know you would but i fear it not enough not only that the whole wizarding world thinks that he is james and lily son that they died tonight and left him behind you couldntjust go in and take him everyone would know then everyone would know the truth severus and that is something you cannot afford to happen both yours and harry safety depend upon it i think i think it would be best if we were to send the boy to lily sister i feel sure he would be safe there dumbledore said calmly he not safe anywhere though is he he asked bitterly and will they love him care for him will they provide him with all the things i would will they too treat my son as if he were their own getting the privilege of seeing him grow and learn and become the man he will become will they too rob me of my last thread of happiness severus asked sheer despair in his voice you wish to take him tonight dontyou i can see it in your eyes you wonteven grant me one last night with him it must be tonight my boy we can take no chances i will leave you to say your goodbyes said the old man his brow crinkled with sadness as he discreetly left the room leaving the broken man alone with his son harry was sure he heard severus choke back a sob as he shifted the baby round to sit on his knee a slightly shaky hand supporting the small back he took a moment taking a few deep breaths in a futile attempt to calm his fraught nerves and looked down at harry looking very much as though the situation was entirely too much for him to bear i cantbelieve you re being taken away from me again he said in a voice that was barely audible i would have done anything to have kept you with me he whispered but the old man is right i have to put your safety and well being above my own wishes i just cantbear the thought that i wontget to see you grow i wontget to watch you as you take your first steps say your first word his voice broke and he bit his lip hard to stop himself from breaking down completely i want you to know though that i love you very much and i always will not a day will pass when i wontthink about you wonder what you re doing and how you re getting on i ll do all that i can to protect you even if that means giving you up yet again i hope that one day you might understand that i doing this all for you believe me it gives me no pleasure he said quietly holding the little boy close to him the door opened and once again dumbledore came in a kind cheerless expression on his face i afraid it time severus are you ready of course not he responded harshly would you be dumbledore simply remained calm and kept his eye contact with the distraught man please make sure he safe severus implored softly and dumbledore nodded severus gave harry one last tight hug and handed him gently over to the headmaster turning away as dumbledore left the room silently the only noise a soft little whimper from harry forgive me severus said quietly into the darkness before he sank to his knees and released pained aggrieved sobs his will and heart now utterly shattered harry felt a slight tug and he was back in severus quarters trying very hard to stop his own tears from falling after what he had just seen severus looked grave and paler than usual and harry rested a tentative arm on his shoulder thank you for showing me i know it canthave been easy he said quietly severus gave a small nod and turned his head to face harry that night was probably the hardest of my life he said softly i knew that i would likely not be able to see you again until your arrival here and that would be eleven years down the line harry whatever you think of me whatever opinions i have forced you to form through my behaviour towards you you must understand that what i did i did for you i did it thinking that it was for the best all i ever tried to do was be a good father i never wanted to be anything else it was harry turn to nod in understanding still fighting back the tears that had been threatening to fall ever since he heard severus last few words to him you were he said in a whispered voice i just wish i d have known sooner i wish you could have told me the second i arrived here rather than let me hate you all these years so much time just wasted lost he said sadly i know but i couldnttell you the laws of the circle forbade it believe me i wished i could but well we all have rules we must abide by no matter how hard we find them i hope i hope that you might one day be able to forgive me he said suddenly unable to meet harry eyes there nothing to forgive harry insisted gently i understand why you did what you did i really do you cantkeep torturing yourself over the past believe me it does no good he said in such a firm tone that severus couldnthelp but look back into his son eyes can i um can i ask you something harry asked carefully within reason he replied with a slight smirk what was it with slytherins and that expression could i maybe call you by your first name i mean only when we re not in public it just seems silly and rather awkward to go on calling you professor now i know who you are said harry in rush trying desperately to justify his reason for his request in case the man thought him silly or inappropriate for asking harry severus said the smirk changing more to something vaguely resembling a smile that would be fine i glad you asked he said and harry couldnthelp but return the smile thanks he said i should probably get back i said i wouldntbe long he said heading for the door severus close behind you re rushing back to be with draco asked severus amusedly harry fought a blush as he answered like i said we re getting on much better now and he still recovering from his injuries so i guess it hard to feel any animosity towards him he replied praying fervently that severus wouldntread anymore into the situation things have been different between us all term i d noticed i hope the alliance lasts it will do you both good all harry could do was nod he really didnttrust his mouth at that point not to give him away his burning cheeks were doing a good enough job of that as it was i ll see you then he said with a nod and a smile then made his way out of the potions dungeons and back up to the warmth of gryffindor tower and the blond who was waiting for him xxxxx if that your idea of not being gone long we need to have a serious discussion about your grasp of time were the words he was greeted with as he stepped through the portrait hole in the common room aw did you miss me he teased as he sat down on the sofa next to the pouting blond you wish he returned with an evil smirk i was just bored i needed some entertainment entertainment what kind of entertainment did you have in mind harry asked leaning in closely to draco a predatory smile on his lips one hand winding its way to rest at the base of draco neck fingers gently stroking the beautiful pale skin underneath the soft blond hair oh you know maybe charades cards perhaps even some studying if we draco innocent speech was cut short by harry crushing his lips in a long awaited kiss tease harry murmured against draco lips though he was soon silenced by draco unbelievably skilled tongue snaking its way into his mouth he moaned a low deep sound in the back of his throat as draco pressed himself up against him hooking one leg round harry waist his hands wound themselves through draco hair pulling the blond as closely to him as physically possible and draco responded by pulling himself up so he was straddling harry one hand at harry neck the other on harry chest as he continued his exploration of harry mouth so you re not in as much pain as you make out then harry asked with a smirk as draco lips left his and began to trail a path across his well defined jaw oh no i am draco replied in between kisses but i ve discovered this is rather good therapy i ll be back to my old self in no time he said his tongue darting out to tease the small patch of skin by harry ear that draco had learnt elicited a rather delightful sound from the raven haired boy who was now writhing beneath him heaven forbid harry replied rather impressed with himself that he could still remember what sarcasm was even with draco tongue behaving like it had a life of its own cheeky the blond murmured nipping at harry earlobe pressing himself right up against him the contact almost painfully pleasurable i guess you re right though dontwant to overexert myself too much what was it you said no strenuous activity he said with a smirk finally removing his lips from harry skin though retaining his rather comfortable position straddled across harry lap yes but i think this kind of activity should be just fine harry replied his hands settling on draco waist i sure you do come on it late we re tired and i still covered in puncture wounds besides i can see you want to tell me about what happened with severus tonight he said softly brushing a few strands of hair out of harry eyes how did you i can just tell come on bed he said shifting off harry pulling him up with him and dragging him up the stairs to harry room ooh i love it when you get all dominant draco only responded by looking over his shoulder at harry and quirking an eyebrow in an incredibly suggestive way xxxxx that harsh i mean i knew that he hadnthad the best life i knew he d had some difficulties but that a lot for any man to go through said draco lying on his side in harry bed propped up by his right elbow while his left hand slowly traced patterns across harry exposed chest inducing a pleasant shiver now and then i know it definitely made me see him differently made me think that it might be possible to have some kind of relationship with him but do you think he trailed off do i think what draco inquired softly do you think it possible to just forget everything that happened between us is it possible to forget all that been done and said over the years can people really start again he asked looking up through the darkness into draco storm grey eyes harry he said with a slightly amused expression look at us he said leaning down to place a soft chaste kiss on harry lips now go to sleep and stop worrying about everything he said shifting down in the bed and settling his head on harry shoulder an arm thrown round his waist i didnthave you pegged for the snuggling type said harry with a smirk his arm around draco shoulders i not it cold draco growled whatever you say xxxxx harry harry harry the aforementioned harry was making a valiant attempt to ignore the blond nuisance who had his legs draped over harry lap while relentlessly prodding him in the arm trying to get his attention outwardly he was making no progress whatsoever harry had simply continued to study the book on animagus transformation not batting an eyelid calmly turning page after page inwardly harry was distracted on two very different levels on the first he was about ready to kill his blond companion and wrench off the finger that was persistently poking his arm on the second he was about ready to jump said blond companion and do things to him that would make a harlot blush he was sitting as close to harry as physically possible and harry was beginning to like draco close physical presence quite a lot come on you ve been studying all morning it christmas eve no one studies on christmas eve draco insisted i really want to be able to do this transformation i ll only be able to do that if i study dontyou have anything to do he asked finally taking his eyes of the book to glance at draco plenty but none that i plan to even attempt on christmas eve you dontneed to study this hard you can do it all anyway draco said resting his head on the back of the sofa i can only do some things and they re all down to mere fluke something like this requires a lot of hard work on my part believe me i donthave the natural aptitude that hermione or even you have i determined to do this he said seriously you will but you cantoverload your brain in the process you were studying and working like a man possessed all last term i know but i need to know things draco i cantafford to make mistakes now this is it the final hurdle i need to know all that i possibly can i need to be what infallible it a wonderful aspiration but harry you re only human draco said gently but firmly i know that but before he could go any further a tapping at the window stopped the conversation making both boys turn to see what the source of the disruption was a dignified looking eagle owl was hovering outside tapping the glass with its beak now and then a highly impatient look on its regal face harry glanced across at draco and was surprised to see that whilst before the blond had been looking much better a healthy pink tinge to his cheek he had now paled considerably and was looking quite ill draco what is it what wrong he inquired giving him a gentle shake it s it lucius owl draco replied softly his eyes not leaving the suspended creature you donthave to harry began as draco rose from the sofa and walked gingerly over to the window i need to he replied letting the owl in and removing the letter from his leg with slightly shaky hands he slowly unfolded the parchment and his serious grey eyes scanned the words he found written upon it harry saw him visibly tense then brace himself taking one deep breath wordlessly he handed it to harry for him to read but remained standing his eyes looking ahead to the distance solemn and steady harry looked down at the letter in his hands and saw the small precise writing of lucius malfoy draco the events of this holiday have filled me with the bitterest regret and deepest disappointment all your life you have been provided with the best and been given a life of luxury you have always been taught that family loyalty above all else is of the utmost importance and with that family loyalty must come the adoption of any political affiliations from the moment of your birth i have always intended for you to take the path that i myself have chosen to follow in my own worthy footsteps and to take my place in the service of the great dark lord it is a position which many have killed to acquire yet when offered to you it was cast it aside without thought or regret i had always credited you with a high level of intelligence now i see what a grave mistake in investing my time and faith in you has been i am writing this letter to inform you that you have been disinherited and disowned henceforth i am ceasing all contact between us and from here on in i have no son you are a disgrace to your name and your class and will be forever known as a blood traitor and an embarrassment i am thoroughly disgusted with you lucius malfoy and that that said draco quietly as harry lowered the letter looking back up at him i sorry he replied though a part of him couldnthelp but be glad that all draco ties with lucius malfoy had now been severed draco gave a small humourless laugh slightly ironic dontyou think that just as you find a father i lose one he said and harry could see that he was trying almost desperately to keep his composure he rose from his seat and pulled the slightly shaking blond into his arms holding him tightly one hand cradling the blond head against his shoulder the other rubbing his back soothingly draco arms wrapped themselves tightly around harry waist clinging to him drawing strength from his silent comfort it wasntthat he was heartbroken to be free of his father it just felt like a small part of himself had been irrevocably lost somehow i was expecting it he said softly into harry shoulder doesntmake it any easier though does it harry asked gently his fingers twining through draco soft hair what will you do now re evaluate my future i suppose xxxxx harry held draco for a good long while before finally releasing him giving him a warm encouraging smile draco had gone from looking slightly shaken to resolutely determined and when harry questioned the change in him he had simply responded by saying i think it time to go to dumbledore that was why they were now sat in the headmaster office the old man eyeing them curiously though with an expression that welcomed confidence they both politely refused the offered lemon drop and harry sat back in his chair watching draco carefully giving him his silent but strong support the blond laced and unlaced his hands a couple of times before finally stilling himself and looking dumbledore straight in the eye taking a deep breath he said i ve been disowned and disinherited sir i no longer have any connection with lucius malfoy or lord voldemort certain events over this holiday have seen to that and might i ask what these events were dumbledore asked carefully looking over his glasses at the boy at the man before him would i be correct in assuming that they are linked with the bruising and cuts i see on your face draco gave a small nod i see may i ask how they were acquired i i mean my father he there was draco trailed off the memory obviously distressing him harry placed a soothing steadying hand on his shoulder and picked up where he had left off draco was meant to be initiated over the holidays sir harry said and if dumbledore was surprised by harry treatment of the blond he didntshow it however when it came down to it he couldntgo through with it and his father and the other death eaters beat him almost to death he escaped and came here and i helped him he refused voldemort and is now known among the death eaters as a traitor he needs your protection sir harry said gravely hogwarts always has been and always will be a sanctuary for those who seek help and it will be so for mr malfoy our doors will open to you as long as you need us draco surely you know that dumbledore said softly draco nodded slowly it not just protection that i want though he said quietly i ve come to talk to you about joining you fighting for the light i have no place among the dark he said quietly dumbledore cleared his throat and carefully removed his spectacles folding them and placing them on the desk in front of him he then rose gracefully from his seat and crossed to look out of the window his hands folding behind his back this is a very serious decision mr malfoy i want you to be sure before you commit yourself to anything he said solemnly i am sure i ve given it due consideration and i ve discussed it with sever with professor snape he thinks i d be doing the right thing obviously i cantwork as a spy i ve publicly denied voldemort but with my extensive knowledge of the dark arts and the other death eaters i could be of some help i dontdoubt that draco but this is a big step and it likely that a great deal of responsibility will be placed on your shoulders there are already a number of 7th year students who have assignments and tasks from the order it is regrettable that people of such young ages much carry such burdens but these are the times we live in you are certain this is what you want i am sir draco said determinedly rather grateful for harry steadying hand on his shoulder very well we re very pleased to have you dumbledore said returning to his seat once more smiling kindly at the blond and harry how are things with you how is the situation with professor snape he asked glancing surreptitiously at draco it alright draco knows said harry with a smile removing his hand from the blond shoulder well things are a little strange between us now but we ve been spending some time together and i guess we re just finding out where we stand with each other it a lot to get used to and it really spun me out at first now i just want to get to know him he is my father after all he said with a crooked smile finally beginning to reconcile that idea in his mind splendid said dumbledore cheerily i was worried that you might not be able to see past your previous differences with him but i see i should have credited you with more maturity thank you sir thank you for your time he said getting to his feet draco following suit not at all this has been a most productive meeting xxxxx happy christmas said three pairs of voices as three glasses of firewhisky clinked on the stroke of midnight severus harry and draco sat in severus quarters lazily stretched out on the sofa that was positioned in front of the fire whose flames had been charmed red and green in an uncharacteristic show of festivity the two boys had been sitting with severus all night and harry had found himself incredibly comfortable enjoying the atmosphere and the chance to see the two slytherins show sides that he never knew existed what are we drinking to then asked draco harry glanced between them a smile making its way across his lips how about new starts he suggested raising his glass sounds good to me said draco returning the smile indeed to new starts then said severus and once again they clinked their glasses together all starting to feel the effects slightly of the potent liquid they downed in one just donttell dumbledore i ve had you boys drinking i sure it against some sort of policy or ethical regulation he said rolling his eyes well if you think about it as you re my father you re responsible for me you can have me drinking as much as you like and dumbledore cantreally do a thing about it said harry with a grin saluting severus with his glass methinks he had enough said draco smirking at severus we should be getting back now anyway come on you up he said rising from the sofa and kicking harry gently i am in no fit state to carry or support you in any way so move yourself now he said with a laugh giving him another nudge merry christmas sev it been an interesting one he said shaking hands with his almost cheerful looking potions master merry christmas draco interesting or not i dontthink i can cope with another one like it harry stay a minute he said to the brunette who was about to make his way out of the potions dungeon draco seeing that severus obviously wanted a private moment with his son told them he would wait outside then proceeded to do so leaving the two alone do you want to sit down for a moment severus i only just managed to stand i dontthink sitting down again would be the best idea said harry with a smirk that was beginning to resemble both draco and severus very well he replied with a rich laugh a sound harry had never heard from the man i have something that i was going to give you at new year s when i was going to tell you everything but well as it christmas i thought now would be a rather appropriate time he said and removed something from his robes placing it in harry hand on inspection harry found that it was a beautifully ornate pendant at the centre of which were two stones one of onyx the other of bloodstone they were positioned in the centre of a delicate and intricately woven piece of silver that was shaped like a gaelic pendant harry had once seen having been told that the fianna originated in ireland he made the guess that it had something to do with the circle the onyx represents self mastery and control and it protects from negative forces the bloodstone is the hero stone and instils courage in dangerous situations it was your mother s she wanted to give it to you when we told you of the prophecy it an emblem of the circle and a rather powerful tool i suppose you could also call it a family heirloom of such you ll probably find blaise has one much like it severus said thank you this this means a lot said harry his mind suddenly not as fuzzy as it had been i really appreciate the gesture he said having realised that the gift itself wasntthe most important thing it was the meaning behind it and the representation that carried the most weight severus gave a slightly awkward nod and extended his hand harry rolled his eyes and grinned pulling severus into strange somewhat clumsy hug that took the older man entirely by surprise he uncertainly brought his arms around the teen and actually couldntstop a small smile from making its way onto his lips as he realised that his son had just willingly embraced him no more shaking hands it ridiculously formal said harry as they broke apart especially for a father and son he said gently making them both smile an expression that harry was sure he would never see from severus snape for as long as he lived merry christmas merry christmas harry xxxxx christmas came and went rather uneventfully and before severus knew it the new year eve was upon him he had been dreading it voldemort always seemed uncommonly happy and optimistic with the birth of a new year and severus was almost certain that this one was not going to go unmarked his holiday so far had actually been surprisingly pleasant for the most part a large part of it had been spent with harry and occasionally draco and severus had really enjoyed the time he had spent getting to know his son he had never truly believed that the boy was arrogant or cocky as he had continually painted him to be in all his insults but then he had never really known him either and it was nice to finally be allowed the opportunity to do so he was sitting in his office marking a few of the essays he still had left over appalled that his own students could produce such dreadful work his mind was torn between considering the past events of the holiday and worrying about the ones that might possibly take place that night he was abruptly shaken from his reverie by a knock at the door swiftly followed by ginny weasley entrance miss weasley what are you doing here he asked trying to keep the surprise from his voice well i said i d be back before term starts and i became bored with the new year festivities so i thought i d just slip away come and visit you she said with a small smile settling herself in the chair opposite his desk i honoured he said with a raised eyebrow and she merely smiled at him leaning back in the chair i hear congratulations are in order on what would i not be correct in the understanding that you ve been moved up into the 7th year he asked hoping that she knew already and he had not just put his foot in it oh that thank you it came as a surprise at first but i sure i ll be able to cope i have no doubt of that he said resisting the urge to roll his eyes there was no way in hell that girl couldntcope with anything so i shall have to endure your presence in my advanced potions class next term then now donttell me you re not jumping with joy at the mere thought she said with a smirk i can see it in your eyes you cantwait she teased and actually thought she managed to elicit a strange half smirk from him how well you know me he said in a mock flat voice well i suppose i should be grateful for the fact that i will have at least one student who will be able to even read the material assigned professor said ginny pretending to be highly shocked you are aware that that sounded dangerously like a compliment arentyou if you re not careful you ll start losing your touch she joked i can safely assure you that will never happen he said half seriously though he had to catch himself for a moment as he realised that he was in serious danger of slipping into easy relaxed and almost friendly conversation with the girl she laughed and graced him with another bright smile well i should get round to some research i suppose we ll never find a cure sitting here talking all night she said rising from her seat and taking up her usual one in the corner of the room examining her notes and scribblings she wasntentirely sure why she had come true she had been bored at grimmauld place and she d actually found herself wishing she was back at hogwarts back with her professor she was looking forward to returning to the lessons as well especially now she was going to be a 7th year she was surprised when she received the letter from dumbledore but she d also been extremely pleased she had been going out of her mind with the 6th year work it was all so easy and provided her with no challenge whatsoever she needed that challenge she needed the stimulation and drive she had just settled in to the familiar routine of her research when she heard a sharp hiss from snape end of the room she looked up and saw him clutching his left arm his face twisted in pain their eyes met and she knew exactly what was happening he was being summoned she felt a chill sweep through her as the realisation made full impact what if this time he didntreturn miss weasley he said having recovered himself i have some business to attend to please finish your work here then you may return to grimmauld place he said heading for the door yes professor she replied quietly as he swept out the expression on his face unreadable she raised an eyebrow she had absolutely no intention of going anywhere she went to the storeroom and gathered all the ingredients for the auxilium potion and thanked the heavens she already had a batch of the auxiliamata from her practices a few weeks prior she had a feeling that before the night was out she would need it xxxxx severus had quickly informed the headmaster that he had been summoned then walked swiftly to hogsmeade where he could apparate to voldemort side his insides were twisted in fearful anticipation though his features as always displayed no outward sign of emotion his apparation took him to one of the many underground dungeons of malfoy manor a setting he was all too familiar with there were already ten or so death eaters present gathered around a figure in the centre it had the appearance of a snake whose skin had been slowly and torturously burned off leaving some twisted parody of the creature it had previously been and this severus thought with disdainful disgust was the all powerful dark lord it made his skin crawl ah severus he rasped his voice broken and harsh my lord said severus moving through the circle to kneel as low as physically possible at the dark lord feet do you know why you have been summoned severus he asked his eyes flashing dangerously malice and cruelty the only things present in them i cannot account for the honour my lord he replied his head still bowed low he could tell by the tone of voice that whatever the reason this was not going to be a pleasant visit he steeled himself preparing himself for what his body would have to endure knowing the pain that was to come the potion you supplied me in replace of the imperius curse was not adequate the effects last no longer than a few hours you understand of course that you must be punished for this failure came the silky reply every word dripping in sadistic enjoyment i would ask it of you my lord i beg of you to do so in order that i may serve you better he forced himself to say you might all learn from this voldemort told his circle of death eaters see how true a servant exists in the man before you crucio he said without warning almost lazily it wasntpain he was unfamiliar with he knew all too well the white hot knives that took over his body but it didntmatter whether it was the first or fifty first time the pain was always the most excruciating and unbearable sensation he could ever experience his body cried out against it begging for release and all his thoughts were obliterated from his mind as the agony took control luckily for him voldemort was not at his full strength and could only maintain the curse for a minute or so before he broke off leaving snape broken and drained lying on the floor gasping for breath take him and do what you will with him but make sure he is able to return to the old fool voldemort commanded with a wave of his hand severus felt himself grabbed roughly and yanked away to another part of the dungeons the second part of his punishment about to begin he wasntsure exactly how many curses were thrown at him or how many blows he received before he finally lost consciousness xxxxx ginny wiped the perspiration from her brow as she finished the auxilium spooning it out into a small vial she had also made a few of her mother home remedies of which there were many after all with six rambunctious boys running around one needed to be prepared her initial plan had been to simply make the potions and leave them there for him to use on his return but she found she couldntleave at least not without making sure he was alright he d been gone hours anything could have happened to him she didnteven want to consider the possibilities she gathered the rest of the ingredients together and put them back in the storeroom her heart almost stopping when she heard a noise from the classroom steeling herself for whatever awaited her she emerged from the storeroom to find professor snape bruised bloodied and battered leaning against the doorframe barely conscious professor she breathed at his side in seconds don t he said harshly as she went to help him if you think i leaving you like this then you ve got another thing coming she said steadying her voice she couldntlet him see that she was both shocked and deeply concerned by his state i told you to leave he said as loudly as he could in his broken state just get out this is none of your business go no she said firmly and moved in front of him looking directly up into his eyes gathering every ounce of courage she possessed you helped me now i going to return the favour and if you believe for one minute that you can bully me out of it you really dontknow me very well now stop being such a bloody fool and let me help you she said fiercely quite forgetting it was a teacher to whom she was speaking he seemed to tense but simply gave her a defeated nod and allowed himself to be led further into the room no my quarters he breathed shakily as she was about to set him down at his desk having briefly visited them once before she helped him limp off to another door out of sight to all but those who were actually looking for it shouldering it open she helped him through and set him down in one of the armchairs allowing herself to fully appraise his damaged figure his robes were soaked in blood his face was covered in cuts and bruises all angry looking and painful and the man looked exhausted barely retaining consciousness professor she said softly kneeling in front him looking up into the black pits of his eyes i need you tell me how severe your injuries are they didntuse the new curse on you did they she asked praying fervently that the answer was no he gave a small shake of his head and ginny allowed herself to breathe a sigh of relief what happened professor she asked gently her hand searching out his wrapping her small delicate fingers around his long ones cruciatus beatings disabling hexes various torture hexes he rasped out his lungs hurting from the strain of breathing ok i ll be right back she said moving swiftly back to the classroom and retrieving the potions and solutions she had brewed earlier that evening had he been in his right frame of mind he might have commented on the fact that she had these all prepared for his return as it was he simply watched as she laid them on the table in front of him preparing to help him sir she began tentatively i going to have to remove some of your clothing i need to see the extent of your wounds and treat them she informed him he merely nodded the effort of speech too much in his state he felt gentle small hands carefully loosen the robes and slip them off discarding them on the floor next came his shirt and she bit back a gasp as she saw what lay beneath his clothing his chest was littered with gashes some cruelly deep and his stomach was covered in angry deep bruising oh professor she breathed hardly able to believe what was in front of her own eyes how could anyone do this to another human being least of all someone who you were supposed to be in league with she would never understand people not for as long as she lived knowing how he would despise her pity she carefully schooled her features into concerned professionalism and fetched the solution she had made earlier that was one of her mother famous concoctions may i she asked and he nodded his permission again she kneeled in front of him and dipped a cloth into the mixture she brought it to his face and gently began to wipe away the blood and dirt that were smeared across his features tenderly bathing the cuts to rid them of any infection and to soothe the pain away when his face was cleared she handed him the vial of the auxilium potion and the auxiliamata here she said i had a feeling you might be needing this drink it she instructed and he did so without argument handing the empty vials back to her and trying not to retch at the disgusting taste they both left behind those cuts are deep and the auxilium will take some time to work i going to try something else that should help she said and he watched as she raised her wand to her left hand and muttered curatio recipero as she did so she moved closer to him so that she could feel his breath on her cheek she could feel the heat radiating off him slowly and carefully she raised the wand to a deep cut across the left side of his chest murmuring the same words she pointed the wand at it and then brushed across it with her fingertips instantly the pain notably lessened and he began to feel some of the life return to his battered body she felt his breath sharp and ragged and was aware that her own was becoming deeper as she continued with the healing process her hands moving over his bare wounded skin the contact so intimate it could be mistaken for a lover caress were it not for the circumstances with every touch of her hand he could feel he was coming back to himself the feeling returning to his body and his mind clearing of the pain all the time his eyes on her watching the look on her face as she touched him restored him her face was so soft full of concern and careful concentration all mixed together with something that he couldntquite read as she leant in to his collarbone he realised just how close she was to him and he was finally able to really appreciate the fact that her hands were on his body bare skin on bare skin part of him screamed that there was no way in hell or out of it for that matter that this should be happening she was his student 16 years of age touching him in this intimate way even though she was only healing him it felt like something very different especially as much of the pain had now subsided and yet he couldntbring himself to tell her to stop he couldntlose the feel of her hands soothing him enlivening him he couldntstop himself from letting a small shiver make its way down his spine when her hands found his neck warmly brushing the cruel marks left behind from the night events she withdrew slightly and their met eyes for the first time that night and he was greatly relieved to see there was no pity in hers what was there however was something unreadable something confused i i ve done what i can she said quietly aware that she was still incredibly close to him and that he had an odd look in his eyes i no medi witch but you should be ok now can you walk he nodded and she helped him up moving steadily through into his bedchambers she eased him down onto the bed then stood in front of him pleased to see that he now looked as he were not at death door or even in the neighbourhood though he still looked shattered exhausted without invitation she sat down next to him and clasped her hands in her lap searching for the right words but finding none why dontyou ask me miss weasley he said his voice still harsh and broken the first he had spoken since telling her to leave ask you what she asked softly the question that burning through your mind at this very moment he replied turning to look at her his black eyes though weary still as sharp and piercing as ever she let a small laugh escape her parted lips damn but he could read people well how can you do it professor where do you find the strength she asked her voice so light it was almost a whisper as if she was asking in some great wonder bewildered by the concept of what she had seen before her but there was something more in her tone that made him deepen the gaze he was holding with her respect there was the utmost respect and admiration in her voice and for some reason for the first time in such an age he actually felt pride in himself rather than the bitter self loathing that seemed to have taken up permanent residence in his soul i do what i must he replied hardly able to gather his thoughts together to form a coherent sentence how could he let a simple question albeit with that tone of voice throw him so we all must in these times but you risk more than anyone and on a regular basis too you put your life on the line time after time and yet you still manage to carry on i dontknow many people that could claim that and you canteven claim recognition for it you have to make people believe you re evil a great servant to world most horrible psychopath you cantlet people see what a truly good person you are how in merlin name do you manage it i think you re giving me a little too much credit miss weasley he said a little uncomfortable at her heroic portrayal of him he was so far removed from the role of hero it wasnteven funny i don t she replied faintly her eyes moving over his scared body the marks of nights long since when he had endured the same if not worse treatment reminders of what he was her eyes continued until they reached his left arm and they saw the abomination that had been burned into his flesh angry and black a grotesque symbol of his servitude and loyalty when he noticed her looking she averted her eyes mumbling a whispered sorry she knew he would hate her to see it are the potions beginning to take effect she asked yes you made them well he replied obviously not well enough you re nowhere near your old self or you wouldnthave given a compliment so freely she teased pleased to see that she evoked at least a ghost of his familiar smirk wait until tomorrow and we ll see how many compliments i give he said his voice still gritty and harsh a silence fell between them as both wordlessly contemplated the other evaluating the events of the night the earlier fear ginny had felt upon first seeing her professor had subsided somewhat but she still held the feelings of disgust that anyone could do this to another human being she wasntan idiot she knew how the world worked she knew of the dark deeds and dark thoughts that took place in shadowed corners but she would never understand it she would never understand how people could be consumed by such evil to the point where they even began to lose their very identities any sense of who they were she glanced across at him again thankful she had been able to help she hated to think of him alone after such a night having to heal himself in the cold isolated dungeon she knew he would have probably wished it so rather than having her see him weak and in such a condition but her conscience would not have rested easy if she had left when he had told her to he now found himself somewhat glad that she had not done so as she had healed him far more effectively than his rushed and unsatisfactory methods would have done still it had not been ideal he never wished for anyone to see him in such a state he always avoided the hospital wing for that very reason it didntmatter that his wounds would often re open and he would be in pain for sometimes a week after at least he still had his pride but he found he couldntbe angry with her for what she had done although she had seen him in the worst state he could have possibly been in she had actually helped he had been surprised to say the least when he had returned to the dungeons to find she had waited for him she had even prepared the healing potions knowing where he had been and what could possibly happen he had been even more surprised though he supposed knowing what he did of this young woman he shouldnthave been when she had flatly refused to leave fixing him with a glare that could rival his own and then she had healed him he could still remember the feel of her small hands on his battered and injured body though he was trying to push the memory away he couldntthink like that it was far too dangerous i should probably be getting back she said her voice interrupting his thoughts will you be alright i sure i ll manage he replied as she stood oh i um took the liberty she said nodding to a vial at his bedside dreamless sleep potion just in case she said a little awkwardly you have been busy tonight miss weasley he said with a raised eyebrow yeah well i had some time to kill she said with a smile goodnight professor she said and before she realised what she was doing she gave him a small kiss on the cheek and swiftly left her robes billowing in a very snape like fashion goodnight miss weasley he said a little while after his hand unconsciously going to the spot on his cheek that was now practically burning an back again obviously a little sad at the lack of feedback but hopefully this chapter will get a bit more huge thanks to my wonderfully dedicated beta xxroguexheartxx who beta ed this for me after having eye surgery and not actually being fully able to see the keyboard how that for dedication anyway she made me see some gaping flaws in the chapter and for that she deserves a huge amount of credit thanks hun couldntdo it without you review responses arica princess of rivendell i have done as you commanded and will continue to do so shinoa yuuki actually i was going to ask if anyone knew where the chapter titles were from any ideas yep i being very vague about the details but rest assured i do know the answers to all the questions i not just buying time at the moment i can really only update once a week as i working full time throughout the summer but it might become more frequent in the future for all of you wanting more harry draco fear not it will be here in the very next chapter hope you like this one and hope you find it in your hearts to review a month passed and draco was still struggling with his situation he hated to admit it but he had changed and people were beginning to notice there were some who didntcare some to whom it mattered little but then there were others to whom it mattered a great deal if the great malfoy was vulnerable he could be defeated he could be destroyed opening the way for them he knew he was being stupid the sooner or later word of his behaviour would reach his father but somehow he just couldntbring himself to be the boy he d been in previous years then there were others who saw and cared for different reasons they cared because he was a boy almost a man who was letting himself be seen defenceless who was allowing others the privilege of seeing him weakened far too dangerous a thing to do when one resided in the house of slytherin he was sitting in the library a place he had taken to retreating to when he felt he wasntyet ready to return to the lair he found it had a rather soothing effect on him it was peaceful and still and there were plenty of dark corners for him to disappear into to enshroud him from the world it was in one of these dark corners that blaise zabini found him hunched over a book concentrating deeply he glided over to the boy and without a second warning smacked him sharply round the head what in the bloody hell draco trailed off looking up into the vastness of blaise completely unfazed eyes just what in the name of salazaar do you think you re doing he hissed as the brunette took a seat opposite him you were unguarded werentyou draco you didntexpect it you were far too busy wrapped up in whatever it was you were doing to be aware that there was someone intending you harm that is extremely unwise unfortunately it is also exactly what you have been doing ever since the start of term and if you re not careful it ll earn you far worse than a smack round the head blaise said smoothly looking levelly at the blond get lost zabini i am most seriously not in the mood draco informed him going back to his book oh but i am said blaise swiping the book from draco hands and placing it out of his reach i dontthink i have to remind you how the house of slytherin works if i do then the problem is far more severe than i had originally anticipated you know the rules draco you know the game now it fine if you dontwant to play anymore but you must know how to refuse in the proper way or else you wonthave a choice in the matter blaise informed him calmly seeing the blond visibly tense just exactly what is the point in this oh so enjoyable conversation draco asked his old sneer placing itself on his face open your eyes draco said blaise leaning in close to the other boy your behaviour whatever the reason behind it is putting you in very real and very serious danger i suggest you remedy the situation before it too late this can go either way draco it up to you to decide which are you quite finished draco asked sounding incredibly bored with the conversation he wouldntlet his companion know that it had done more than touch a nerve for now blaise said standing and returning the book to him he paused for the moment his dark eyes scrutinising the other boy carefully i ll be watching draco he slowly informed him and i have no doubt others will be too just keep that in mind he said before gliding out of the library on the way to his next destination his godfather it was a little known fact at hogwarts that the two had a relationship of any kind neither acknowledged it openly but severus was a large part of the boy life and acted as something of a mentor to the boy there was a deeper link between severus and the zabini family but neither side talked of it some things were better left buried severus blaise said walking into the potions classroom scanning the empty room there is such a thing as knocking you know came the terse reply as the man emerged from the side door that led to his private quarters carrying several vials of potions i prefer to have the element of surprise something you taught me i believe came the smooth reply i also taught you that manners are a virtue then why is it you never employ them the boy asked lazing idly in one of the chairs smirking up at his godfather was there something in particular you wanted blaise or are you just here to annoy me asked severus glaring down at his godson as much as that is a favourite pastime of mine there is a reason for my gracing you with my presence he replied to which severus raised an eyebrow but waited for him to continue it about a certain member of your house whom i sure you have noticed a change in blaise said his tone becoming serious indeed said severus with a sigh have you managed to discover what has brought about this change he asked he wouldnttell me if i asked much as he has changed he still hold things extremely closely and guards his secrets well nevertheless for whatever reason he has changed and many besides myself have noticed it will not be long before they try and take advantage of the situation and you know as well as i it will not be pleasant for him if they do severus nodded slowly he knew all too well how the member of his house moved how they played the game do you think he has perhaps had a change of heart he asked i couldntsay but something has happened something which has made him retreat into himself and hardly pay any attention to the world around him he hasnteven been insulting potter though mind you potter seems to be refraining from the insults also they both seem to be walking around like forlorn spectres with no interest in life well we re not here to discuss potter we ll leave that to dumbledore and the rest of his fan club severus said rolling his eyes i dontknow what is to be done about mr malfoy just keep an eye on him make sure his behaviour does not become too extreme and if you can try and keep the serpents at bay for as long as possible either way he will have to make a stand and soon or he ll regret it he said his expression serious and thoughtful excuse me professor he heard a voice from the doorway and looked up to see ginny standing there her eyes going from him to blaise am i interrupting i can come back later if you prefer she offered no need i was going anyway said blaise rising from his seat thank you for your time professor i shall do as you suggested he said moving gracefully from the room stopping to bow slightly and acknowledge ginny miss weasley snape had to suppress a smirk his godson was if nothing a complete gentleman good evening miss weasley he said as she moved further into the room she was surprised as his politeness but merely responded with a professor taking a seat in front of his desk suppressing a shudder at the chill that encircled her would it kill him to light a fire every once in a while he steepled his fingers and fixed her with his eyes yet she never faltered not once had he seen her flinch under his gaze however he noticed that tonight she looked somewhat tired a little on edge her normally calm composure slightly ruffled miss weasley i have a proposition for you he began if it had been any other teacher she might have joked about not yet being ready for marriage as it was she simply waited for him to continue her curiosity piqued i sure i needntinform you of the work i perform outside my capacity as potions professor of hogwarts he began carefully her expression said that he didn t but also that she was interested in why he was discussing it with her my position has allowed me access to knowledge of a new curse that has unfortunately been discovered by voldemort he told her noticing how she didntflinch at the name this curse devastates the body making it appear as though the victim has been brutally attacked beaten stabbed when in reality no such thing has happened it is incredibly powerful and in most cases the victim will die from it neither the auxilium or the auxiliumata has any effect on it whatsoever and as of yet there is no known cure as of yet she asked her astuteness picking that out through the awful information he had just given her this is the matter i wish to discuss with you professor dumbledore has issued me with the task of finding a cure however it is difficult work and i already have a multitude of tasks that all require careful attention that being so i thought i would ask for your services in the matter sir she asked confused surprised and not a little flattered i have presented the idea to the headmaster and he has approved it you would be helping with research gathering ingredients and assisting with brewing the trial potions he told her assessing her reaction will you accept ginny paused for a moment gathering her thoughts together professor snape was actually admitting not directly mind but still admitting that she had the intelligence and skill to aid him in creating a potion to counter the effects of a curse coined by voldemort himself there was no way in hell she would be likely to pass up that opportunity i would be deciding he would sneer at the word flattered she went with honoured are you sure i capable she asked i would not have suggested the idea if i thought otherwise he replied telling her that she should not be questioning his judgement then i accept did you mean to start tonight i did i have acquired certain texts mostly from the restricted section that i wish you to peruse to ascertain what you can about the properties of dragon scale poison mostly related to its use in healing of course the books are over there he said indicating to a table upon which a pile of books were stacked waiting to be examined she nodded and moved over to them settling herself down in one of the chairs preparing herself for some heavy reading and concentration if she was going to do this she was going to do it properly she picked the book from the top of the pile and set it down in front of her finding her quill and her parchment in case she wished to make notes she could have done without having to scan thick voluminous books this night from all others the previous night had not been a particularly enjoyable one she had been plagued with old nightmares ones she had foolishly believed to be gone and once she had woken in a cold sweat at half three in the morning she had found it impossible to return to the comforting folds of sleep she was paying dearly for that now as she struggled to keep her eyes properly focused on the words on the pages and her mind fully concentrated on their meaning but she was determined there was no way she would let that foul excuse for a wizard ruin her life her chances she wouldntlet him affect her work and her professionalism he didntdeserve that but it wasnteasy it was so very far from easy sometimes she almost wondered whether it was worth the fight then she reminded herself that she was stronger than that she wouldntlet herself be beaten so easily she wouldntbe controlled by him again he watched as she methodically went through the book occasionally jotting the odd note though he couldnthelp but notice that she seemed somewhat distracted as if something undesirable was plaguing her mind he had discussed the idea of her helping at length with dumbledore after he had remembered to return to the elderly wizard with the topic he had originally meant to discuss miss granger name was raised as a suggestion but both had decided against it as she had enough to think on with her head girl duties and other duties from the order regarding various pieces of research there were no other 7th years deemed clever or trustworthy enough for the task and severus had put forward ginny name which was readily approved by the headmaster he hoped she would rise to the challenge she was doing just that but with some difficulty as her mind and body were exhausted but her willpower and sheer stubbornness of nature refused to let her give up and so the evening passed with snape making a close examination of the reports of the curse but also now and then of the girl before him while said girl battled desperately with all that was going on inside her and the wish the need to succeed at this miss weasley would you please pass me the vial of the blood from the shelf behind you he asked breaking the silence that had filled the room for the past hour and a half hm oh yes of course she replied shaking herself back into reality realising she was being spoken to she retrieved the vial and moved over to his desk going to hand it to him but not quite calculating when to properly release it sending it shattering to the floor at their feet professor i sorry she said kneeling down to clear up the mess carelessly picking up a piece of broken glass and slicing her finger on it she dropped it involuntarily and placed her finger to her lips looking at the shattered remains of the vial it was almost too much one little accident like that almost broke her she sat back on her heals tears threatening to invade her eyes as she realised just how tired she was tired of everything it not the end of the world miss weasley it only one vial he said looking down at her and seeing the forlorn look on her face oh it not the vial she replied almost in exasperation before realising it was her professor to whom she was speaking it just i haventbeen sleeping well i suppose i just a little on edge she finished lamely he sighed and muttered scourgify the broken glass and blood disappearing immediately and she saw he had extended a hand to help her up she took it rising to full height looking up into his black eyes trying greatly to force down the torrent of emotions threatening to overpower her she wouldntlet him see her cry she wouldn t miss weasley as i sure you know i am not in the habit of coddling my students however in my capacity as a professor it is my responsibility to enquire as to the reason behind your present state he informed her calmly she couldnthelp but be slightly affronted by his tone he was treating her as though she were merely an over angsty teenager with whom he had to go through the proper procedures of pastoral care and to whom he had an unwanted responsibility it nothing professor nothing i sure you wish to be troubled with she said rather more coldly than she had intended releasing her hand from the grasp she had only just realised it was still in kindly refrain from using that tone of voice with me miss weasley he said sternly i simply wish to know whether there is any serious problem that needs attention to be brought to it she hated that tone so professional so cold and removed was the man capable of feeling anything as i said professor it nothing no need for you to trouble yourself she replied having difficultly not using the tone he had reprimanded her for she was sick of being treated like a child she d lost that right that innocence when she was eleven and she was in no mood to be patronised she stared levelly at him for a few moments before returning to her seat and the pile of books she had yet to plough through she didntwant to talk about it and she was damned if she was going to let him make her she had just immersed herself in the book once more when his voice cut the somewhat tense silence you cantrun from the nightmares you know it only makes them more potent her head snapped up sharply who said anything about nightmares she asked defensively you did just now with your reaction he told her smoothly and she realised he had crossed the room and was now standing above her his black eyes scrutinising her carefully thoughtfully how long have they plagued you he asked she wanted to tell him to mind his own business that he had no right to bring it up and pry into her affairs but she knew that resistance would be a futile attempt as much as she wasntafraid of him it still didntmean he didnthave an incredibly persuasive manner and he wasnta person easily refused she gave in and offered a small shrug saying ever since it happened i suppose it only to be expected when someone invades you like he did there bound to be some sort of a mark left behind she said trying to sound professional and removed from it but knowing she never could be i thought i d escaped them she continued quietly not caring that she was letting her guard down and making herself vulnerable it was actually a welcome relief from the constant pretence i thought maybe i d be able to get on with things without his memory always hanging over me i could forget and let it all belong to the past but it doesntwork like that does it she asked looking up into his deep eyes ones that still showed no sign of any emotion or feeling some things you re just not allowed to forget she finished her voice now almost a whisper her eyes swimming with tears ones that she prayed fervently would not make their way down her cheeks she couldntbare for him to see her cry or think her weak no need for tears he told her his voice still firm but without its usual hardness i not crying she informed him fiercely lifting her face to prove it to him though she knew that her glistening eyes told otherwise good he said i believe i have another proposition for you miss weasley he told her an idea forming in his mind two in one night you ll be getting a reputation professor she said trying to get back to herself he raised an eyebrow not only at her sudden change but also at the implied innuendo within her remark what is this proposition she prompted i can help you block the nightmares perhaps even erase them completely but it will not be easy and it may well involve facing your demons in more ways than one i cantpromise anything but if it works then you may well find yourself getting a better night sleep he said with a smirk why would you do that she asked confused at his sudden generosity because i need an assistant who will be alert and clear minded for the work she has to do she should have guessed and i think it about time someone paid closer to attention to what you have had to face he said shocking her completely so that she looked up at him with confusion plainly evident on her face i thank you sir she said after a while a frown still on her face at this uncharacteristic gesture of her potions master i think that enough for one night we ll meet again at the same time next week he said moving away from her back to his desk she gathered her things together and headed for the door wondering whether or not she was pleased with the transformation she had just witnessed after all it wasntevery day one saw a greasy old snake become a man it had been subtle but it had been there but maybe that was only because she was trying her hardest to see it goodnight miss weasley goodnight professor
