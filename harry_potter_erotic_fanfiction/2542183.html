snarkyroxy you wonthave to suffer too much so be nice in the reviews chapter 1 the wizarding letter hermione granger was seated at the table appreciating breakfast in a sunday morning when an owl came through the left window of her apartment even living in the muggle world for more than eleven years she was still in contact with some of her friends from the wizarding world but this wasntan owl she recognized not from harry and ginny nor from ron or any other weasley she took the letter from the bird and offered it a piece of toast the owl accepted the treat and left through the same window it had arrived from hermione looked to the parchment in her hands and saw the symbol on the sealing wax it was a letter from hogwarts she eyed letter for several minutes hypnotized by it a letter from hogwarts who is sending letters from hogwarts i was very careful to avoid contact with anyone from there since it an official letter hermione she admonished mentally gathering her courage she turned the letter over in her hands read the name on it and closed her eyes she had been expecting this day but deep inside she had held some hope that it would never come he had displayed magical abilities since he was one year old and she still had hoped against all logical thoughts that this day wouldntcome even when she knew her hopes were unfounded and illogical she had still hoped this letter would never arrive she placed the dreaded letter on the table and sipped some tea from her cup opening her eyes the letter was still there she stared at the yellowish parchment resting in front of her trying to think it was a lost battle she knew she had thought about it since he was born and never got an answer that would solve this problem she sighed lifting her eyes from the letter and met deep black ones staring at her good morning mum her son saluted and took the chair in front of her is there something wrong no nothing she answered with a light shake of head returning her attention to the eggs on her plate why would there be you ve been staring at that wizarding letter since i came to the room took at least a minute for you to notice my presence he said with a smirk is it from uncle harry or uncle ron why does he have to smirk like that she thought and sighed again he is a remarkable reminder of his father when he smirks or grimaces or she was brought back from her mind ramble by her son voice mum stop staring at me he admonished with his strong voice and a grimace are you feeling all right you seem a little lost this morning is it the wizarding letter he asked and before his mother could predict his actions he took the letter from the table she tried to take it from him but it was too late he had already grabbed it he eyed the letter but couldntfind the sender name or recognize the seal symbol so in an instinctive move he turned the letter over his eyes widening at the same time his mother brought her hands to her face mr nathan granger wingfield court e14 2dr virginia quay london mum it for me who would send me a wizarding letter it not from uncle harry or uncle ron and i dontknow any other wizard he said still staring at the parchment in his hands he flipped the letter and broke the seal hearing another sigh from his mother unfolding the papers he read hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry headmistress minerva mcgonagall member of the wizengamot dear mr granger we are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry please find enclosed a list of all the necessary books and equipment term begins on september 1 we await your owl by no later than july 31 yours sincerely filius flitwick deputy headmaster hermione lowered her hands from her face when she heard him unfolding the letter she knew exactly what words were written there she observed how his expression changed from the frown he put in his face when he was unfolding the parchment to one of surprise when he read that it was from hogwarts and finally to a wide smile when he finished the last line and looked back at his mother i a wizard he declared with self satisfaction in his voice she couldntavoid the surge of pride and happiness rising inside her his wide grin was contagious and she found herself smiling back at him ignoring the tears rolling down her cheeks she was crying from despair and loss when he was breaking the letter seal but now she couldntfigure out her feelings am i happy or sad about it she caught herself thinking i definitely proud for him he seems really happy to find out he is a wizard too but no buts hermione she admonished mentally let him decide just like your parents let you mum have you listened to anything i just said nathan asked i sorry son what were you saying she said returning her full attention to him i was asking when you ll have some time for us to go buy the books and equipment i ll need and we also need to send an owl confirming i going to hogwarts as soon as possible he said with the same enthusiasm his mother recognized from herself when facing the expectations behind an exciting new challenge it discarded the need to voice the question she was forming in her head it more than clear from his reactions and words that he prefers a wizarding education to a muggle one he is going to hogwarts oh god he is going to hogwarts she thought and the smile faded from her face at the same instant that she remembered her problem she had to ask him anyway so hoping for a miracle she said are you sure you want to attend a wizarding school nathan it really different from your actual school and your friends wontbe going to hogwarts with you she pointed out to him with a hopeful face he eyed her for a moment before asking dontyou want me to go i thought you would be proud of me for being a wizard he said quietly i really proud of you nathan i just asking you if that what you want do you want to be a wizard nathan she hoped against all odds for a negative answer but didntexpect the reaction her words had nathan was on his feet the moment she finished her last question a pained expression on his face you dontwant me to be a wizard why you re a witch and my father was a wizard right you donttalk about him but i know he was and i bloody will be a wizard too i going to hogwarts and with that he left the kitchen leaving his distressed mother staring at the door to the living room she sighed gravely and buried her face on her hands once more why did he have to bring his father in on the matter i never said he was a wizard where did he get that idea from she had never revealed the identity of nathan father not to him not even to his father it was a decision she had made before his birth it wasntthat people never asked nathan asked once a year on his birthday her answer was always the same your father name is not important nathan we have each other and that what important of course he wasnthappy with her answer and the question became a birthday tradition nathan was so stubborn and determined that it was difficult to know from whom he had inherited those features his mother or his father most probably from both of them hermione never changed the answer though she defended her secret with all her might even if it led to a fight on his eighth birthday nathan was so determined to discover his father identity that he didnteat anything during the whole day and refused to open a single gift he gave up his stand after a week but hermione was really disturbed by his actions at the time she suffered with every meal he refused every hatred filled gaze he directed at her even harry who visited her on special dates such as birthdays and holidays was distressed that year and came back to check on them the next day why dontyou end this damn mystery once and for all hermione it okay mione i wontjudge you or be angry with you not after eight years not even if it snape harry said that year it was a long time since he brought up the subject between them sure enough harry had noticed the evident physical similarities between severus snape and nathan but never questioned hermione directly and she never denied or confirmed his suspicions i wontask you hermione but i want you to know that i here if you ever feel like talking about it and i really think nathan should know who his father is and that was the last time they talked about it she knew from harry and ron that severus snape was back teaching potions at hogwarts after the war was over his name was cleared with all the evidences albus dumbledore had left proving his innocence and loyalty well he was still hated by many for his actions the night the late headmaster died and for his association with voldemort he never denied the avada kedavra he used on dumbledore but he was absolved by the wizengamot after their analysis of dumbledore memories and letters describing his conversations and reasons leading to professor snape actions that night hermione was one of the few who kept her hopes up on the spy loyalty after the headmaster death she refused to believe that the great albus dumbledore could be mistaken for that long and kept trying to find evidence that snape was loyal to the order even after what she heard harry say he did and from the many theories she came across one was right and they found the letters and memories dumbledore had left for them proving professor snape had killed him by his command after that severus snape was back as a spy for the order and was essential for their victory in the war he saved many lives including her own when she was captured during a confrontation between the death eaters and the order of the phoenix there was only one horcrux left and they were very close to the end of the war when she was taken by the death eaters she stayed in their power for the nine days it took harry to destroy the artifact and voldemort himself practically unharmed thanks to snape he protected her from the other death eaters the best he could without instigating suspicions that could blow his disguise and she was grateful for that that was one of the main motives why she didnttell anyone he was nathan father she couldntdo that to him not after the pain she knew he felt for what he had to do to heep her safe no she would never tell anyone that severus snape was her son father not even nathan or severus on the other hand nathan was leaving for hogwarts in september she couldntdeny him that she couldntprohibit nathan to attend hogwarts when she knew very well how it felt to receive that letter no she couldn t she would deal with the consequences the best she could she hadntbeen a gryffindor for nothing right she left the table with another sigh and went to find nathan she found his bedroom door closed and knocked lightly three times when she was turning to leave for the living room and wait until he was ready to talk to her the door flew open with a bang and nathan was back in his bed clutching his letter with his chin up and a defiant glare in his eyes she sighed and entered the room nathan i very proud you were invited to study at hogwarts i am i just sad because it means you re leaving home leaving me and meeting your father she added mentally it was true part of her sadness was because she d have to let her little baby go i dontlike the idea of you living so far away from me nathan got up from his bed and enveloped his mother in a tight hug she couldntavoid the tears that threatened to fall from her eyes again her son was really a special young man she knew he was ready for hogwarts eventually they broke the hug and she forced a smile on her face she looked at nathan and said we are going to diagon alley next weekend for your books and supplies we can send an owl to hogwarts from there oh mum thank you i wontdisappoint you you ll see i ll be the best wizard to ever set foot in hogwarts he said hugging her again she laughed at his pretentious words so confident and passionate determined to do his best to make her proud so much like her at his age she petted his shiny coal black hair and teased him you re a very ambitious young man if you think you re going to be the best wizard hogwarts have ever seen you know harry potter studied there dontyou nathan had always been fascinated by the stories ron harry and his mother used to tell him every time they met he smirked at her and said vanquishing that voldemort guy wasntthat big of a deal and it was ten years ago she chuckled and retorted with amusement you think it nothing do you oh i want to see you argue with him about that some day or ron for that matter uncle ron would never win an argument with me he said dismissively before adding and uncle harry doesntthink it was that big of a deal either well i have to agree with you that one of harry most noble qualities is his modesty he would never admit that what he did was extraordinary she said nostalgically and then looked down her nose to nathan you should learn from him you arrogant prat and they laughed together so is it really okay for me to go to hogwarts mum at her nod of confirmation he added i ll send you an owl every day i promise beaming at his mother he took her hand and urged her to follow him to the bed do you want to see the list of books i ll be using mum yes let see the books you ll be using nathan she said cleaning the last tears from her face with the back of her free hand they sat on his bed to read the assigned book list together and talk about hogwarts something she only did when harry ginny or ron came to visit her baby has grown up and was time for him to experience all the fascinating and worrisome things the wizarding world could offer including his father a n so that it i finally got the courage and published it now review disclaimer not mine it all j k rowling s warning this story takes place in the future and contains hbp spoilers be warned beta reader snarkyroxy thank you very much a n chapter ten wow 0 an unaware nathan is in for a month of detentions with his now very aware father oh boy chapter 10 acquaintance nathan left professor snape office frowning in thought he had noticed the strange expression on snape face after he had asked him of his mother past he knows something he concluded just like uncle harry everybody who knew something that could help him find out his father identity chose not to tell him anything why he caught himself thinking is he such a horrible person that everyone feels the need to protect me from him it wasntthe first time his mind led him to that idea he walked back to gryffindor tower trying to figure out what might be so horrible about his father is he dead no he had already thought about that possibility and had discarded it if his father was dead his identity wouldntbe of such importance would it he didntthink so he must be a horrible dangerous man that would more likely be the case his father was a monster is he in azkaban then that could be it because of one thing he was sure his father was a wizard but then again why would it be so important for him not to know his identity nathan shook his head at the lack of answers he had been through this so many times and was yet to find out something that would really lead to his father name and again snape knew something this was new uncle harry was his mother best friend so nathan could only expect that he would know something on the matter but snape that was completely unexpected nathan had never thought about snape as one of his mother acquaintances he had asked the potions master about her relationships only on an impulse and now he realized that snape knew something what does he know does he know who my father is he sighed nathan entered the common room still lost in thoughts kevin spotted him by the portrait hole and called on andy who was working on his transfiguration essay both boys observed their distracted friend walking aimlessly across the room kevin brought him back from his musings hey nathan nathan looked their way as if surprised to see them there he walked the space that separated him from his friends hey guys he said without a trace of enthusiasm lowering himself into the armchair facing the table where they were working he was tired both from the day activities that now wore on his weakened body and from his overexerting mind andy noticing nathan unusual behavior asked are you feeling all right nathan sighed yeah i fine just a little tired that all does it have to do with snape asked kevin i ve never seen him as scary as he was today after a pause he added did he offer you something to drink you didnttake it did you he eyed nathan with concern do you think i that stupid nathan shook his head in disbelief i might be stupid enough to enter the forbidden forest but i would never drink anything professor snape offered me in his office he added that would be stupid agreed andy everybody knows snape is an evil wizard and the way he was today professor snape is not evil he saved my life yesterday remember nathan admonished i just wouldntdrink anything he offered me because he a slytherin that is a good reason too agreed kevin nodding in agreement so how was the meeting then fifty points and a month of detentions nathan stated simply a month that awful how is one supposed to survive a month of detentions with snape asked andy in disbelief nathan sighed i ll manage he assured his friends i ve survived one day i can survive the rest a whole month though i dontknow andy said uncertainly you should go to the headmistress and ask her to do something about it i dontthink she would want anyone with snape for that long i ll be fine nathan assured his friends once more he was now contemplating a month of detentions with professor snape in a totally different light but his friends didntknow that the potions master knew something about his father and it wouldntbe so bad to spend some time with him he would have more opportunities to inquire further this could be his chance to finally find out who his father was nathan had never talked about it with his friends they hadntasked and he hadntvolunteered the information either that suited nathan quite well since he didntwant his friends looking at him as the bastard he was no he wouldntsay anything he would keep it to himself of course when andy started to tell stories of his father how he had taught him quidditch maneuvers and all manner of other fun things nathan longed for a father too he had missed so many things that only a father could give he tried to picture his father doing all those things andy spoke of but he couldntget the image exactly right it was missing something he couldntpicture his father face deciding he hadntthe strength to even start with the readings he had scheduled for that evening nathan bid his goodnights and headed for the dormitory he had his first detention tomorrow and was still thinking what to do with the information he had acquired today snape knew something about his father severus had managed to calm himself somewhat after that outburst of rage he was now pacing the living room in his quarters thinking of what to do with every other thing that came to his mind was a way to hurt hermione granger and that was when he stopped in his pacing and took a deep breath only to start pacing again for one mad instant he thought about killing miss granger then about killing himself but had managed enough control to realize that that was not the answer this was all happening because he had wanted her to live in the first place the thought of killing himself still lingered within his mind between a bad and a worse idea but his slytherin self preservation instincts soon denied him the option and he was back to nothing he had not even a single feeble idea of what to do tired of pacing he sat in the armchair facing the cracking fire that lit the room how could she do this to me he growled in frustration for not knowing the answer how could she do this to herself he sighed he couldntimagine the reasons a woman like hermione would do such thing keep a rape child it was perfectly acceptable to abort under such circumstances and he was sure she knew that then why why continue with a pregnancy that was started in such a manner he couldntcome up with a reasonable explanation for her actions yet another mystery to add to the collection of miss granger mysteries she knew he was my child he had no doubt of that and it just confused him further the fact that she knew she was having his child and had continued with it anyway was disconcerting why would she want to keep a child with my blood he grimaced at the thought he wasntready to deal with it he had a child he could deal only with feelings he understood and right now he was feeling too much he wanted to blame someone for this vortex of feelings he couldntblame nathan because the boy didnthave a choice on the matter he would blame his mother his thoughts shifted to nathan even if unwillingly no he couldntblame the boy but he didnthave to like him either the boy was as annoying as his mother and as intelligent as his mother too he had to admit the boy skill with potions that was his he remembered how marveled he had been with nathan work during his classes he could now acknowledge it because he knew the boy had inherited these skills from him severus shook his head then he didntwant to go there he didntwant to think about the boy he stood and left the small living room and went to the bathroom maybe a bath would help him think things through he needed to be thinking straight if he were to deal with this and he felt as tired as if he had confronted a dozen dementors he opened the water faucet and it started filling the bathtub he turned and found his reflection staring back at him from the mirror he stayed there staring at himself and listening to the water falling and to his thoughts he closed his eyes and rubbed at his nape throwing his head back to meet his hand then he opened his eyes again you re a disaster he said to his reflection you re always messing with people lives he kept staring at himself until the water reached the perfect level he undressed and submersed his sore body in the warm water i should confront miss granger he thought and tell her what she did was her worst mistake he sighed he wouldntaccomplish anything with such foolish act what was done was done i ll make her regret what she did though he thought clenching his jaw in anger if he couldntgo back and change the fact that he had a son he would make the woman responsible for this mistake pay he closed his eyes again trying to take benefit from the relaxing bath he didntwant a child he never had another snape just what the world needs he thought sarcastically family was never part of his plans for life it wasnteven among the top ten things he most wanted but if he started thinking about all the things she ever desired in life he would come to realize he had devoted all these years to the wrong things all the mistakes he had made in his youth all the mistakes he had made in his adulthood do i really know what i want he caught himself thinking all i want now is to be left in peace of that he was sure peace seemed little distant to accomplish now he was in the middle of things again consequences of his actions that persisted to haunt him no peace just uncertainties and choices to be made yet more chances to make more mistakes i ll have a solution by morning he thought with conviction all he needed was to relax clear his mind and get some sleep he finished his bath and changed into his nightgown he lowered his tired body to the soft bed and tried to sleep but try as he might he couldntrelax he rolled from one side to another his mind on the events that changed his life once again he wouldntsleep this night he didntthink he would sleep for many nights when the morning came snape prepared himself to attend breakfast in the great hall he had decided that he wouldntchange his life just because a child had some of his blood running through their veins he left his quarters and met very few students on his way to the great hall it was still early and he was one of the first to arrive which suited him perfectly he wasntin the best mood to handle annoying students or engage in idle chit chat with his colleagues snape took his usual seat and served himself his usual cup of coffee an owl brought his copy of the daily prophet as usual and he read the unimportant news of the wizarding world while sipping his coffee he buttered some toast and ate some eggs and sausages as usual then he perused the student tables and the entrance door in yet another every day habit saw a group of gryffindor first years entering the great hall and realized that nothing would be usual anymore nathan granger and his friends headed for the gryffindor table oblivious to the potions master struggle for normalcy nathan had slept very late the night before thinking about yesterday events but now he had his mind on other things when he went down the stairs connecting the boy dormitories to the common room this morning he had found a great concentration of students gathering around a sign on the board he didnthave to fight the crowd to see what it was all about because kevin was already coming in his direction with a wide grin on his face there will be a halloween feast he had said enthusiastically and that was the only subject of discussion since then nathan was excited with the idea of halloween in the wizarding world even growing up and living most of his life in the muggle world he knew this was a big holiday for wizards he had heard stories of the feasts at hogwarts and if everything was like what he had heard this would be the greatest party ever nathan had celebrated halloween the muggle way while growing up he and some friends from the building in which he lived wearing costumes walked the streets nearby going from door to door and asking for candy his mother didntlike this idea very much she always confiscated half of the sweets he collected nathan was trying to explain all of that to kevin and andy so you wear a costume to run from door to door and ask for candy asked andy exactly you knock at the door of a house and say trick or treat if they donthave candy you can play a prank on their house nathan tried to explain and they cantdo anything i mean they just watch you do whatever you want with their house and do nothing asked a confused andy only if they donthave candy but they always do assured nathan do they have carved pumpkins too inquired kevin some people carve pumpkins but not everyone you can buy fake ones you just plug to the energy it much easier nathan explained which only added to his friends confusion they looked at each other and shrugged nathan rolled his eyes the conversation shifted to their charms essay and then to quidditch nathan was eating cereal from a bowl when he started to feel uncomfortable it felt as if someone was observing him he glanced around the hall finally locking eyes with professor snape who was staring at him he stared back as he always did and was surprised when the potions master didntfrown in disapproval as he usually did nathan narrowed his eyes and still there was no response it was as if professor snape was looking at him but not seeing him what wrong with him thought nathan he stared a little longer in curiosity and then went back to his breakfast weird professor snape had lost the battle he was fighting to pretend nothing had changed his son was in the same room as him eating breakfast with his gryffindor friends he looked at the boy lost in thoughts he hadnteven noticed that nathan had been staring at him a few moments ago he had failed to ignore the boy presence he shook his head and lowered his eyes to his plate he played with its content for a while until a voice coming from behind him interrupted his struggle with the food i ve been looking for you harry said what do you want potter snape asked stopping tracing unrecognizable patterns in the food with his fork but not taking his eyes from the plate why did i ever think i would have some peace he mused well friday is my last day here so i was thinking we should have our duel then harry said every year since voldemort demise harry challenged snape to a duel at first harry had just wanted to fight snape and at ron suggestion had called snape for a duel after being called coward again snape had accepted the invitation and from there on it had become some kind of annual tradition it was mostly good natured but they would never completely bury the animosity that had existed between them for so long harry was yet to win too which only added to his desire to continue the tradition snape thought for a while considering the request and after some deliberation he lifted his eyes to meet harry s do you still think you can beat me potter even after all these years of failure he mocked the hero with a smirk you know what i think are you ready for me this time harry mocked back i always ready for you potter snape said taking his attention back to his breakfast you re the one who never ready for me we ll see about that on friday with that harry took his place at the table and served himself from the house elves cooking snape had much more important things on his mind right now but he welcomed the distraction he rather think about dueling potter than dealing with the grangers at the moment in fact this was one of the things he looked forward to every year showing harry bloody potter his place he relished every opportunity to show potter that he hasntlearned his lessons even after all these years snape ate what he felt he could and left the head table to go back to the dungeons only glancing at the boys chatting animatedly at the gryffindor table when he passed by them he berated himself for even this small gesture and left the hall cursing under his breath nathan was oblivious to the potions master storming out of the great hall he had his attention on the conversation rolling around him they were having a heated discussion about flying broomsticks since their flying lessons had started last week josephina who was terrified of brooms had been questioning the effectiveness of said lessons i think we should have the right to choose if we want to have flying lessons or not i hate flying she protested i dontknow what there is to hate about flying it the best sensation i ve ever felt the wind the freedom said a dreamy andy he was passionate for brooms and quidditch just like his father i understand what you re saying jose my mother never flew a broom since her flying lessons i like flying though nathan stated i think flying is awesome i think they should allow first years to have their own brooms i know harry potter did and he played quidditch in his first year as well added kevin looking at harry who was talking with mcgonagall near the head table yeah that would be awesome agreed andy i would want to play keeper or chaser what position would you play nathan i dontknow uncle harry says i probably too tall to play seeker and uncle ron says i could be a good keeper but nathan was cut off by a mocking voice coming from behind him i dontthink you would play well in any position granger what if the bludger flees to the forest would you call harry potter to get it for you devon malfoy was standing there flanked by two other slytherin first years nathan seemed unaffected by the mocking he just turned in his seat to better look at malfoy as if defying him to say more when nothing else came he turned back to the table and said if that the best you can do malfoy i suggest you take your group back to the slytherin table that irritated devon visibly you think you re so smart but you lose so many points from gryffindor that not even all the stupid answers you give in class will be enough to compensate we donteven have to worry about the house cup was it fifty points you lost yesterday malfoy said then and the slytherins laughed all the students around them seemed to be very interested in the interaction they had all stopped eating and chatting to watch nathan and devon exchange insults that was better nice try nathan said in retort and turning once again to face devon he added but i think i can recover those fifty points if i have to which is more than i can say about you nathan didntturn back this time he stared at malfoy who stared back the tension between them could be felt by the murmuring expectants before anything bad could happen mcgonagall followed by harry was breaking through the gathering that was forming around the boys what is the meaning of this the headmistress asked when she got no response from the boys on the verge of hexing each other she approached the slytherins i ll ask you to go back to your table mr malfoy she said and then added and that goes for the rest of you too they continued to glare at each other for a moment and then the slytherins left for their table without another word professor mcgonagall was glaring at the remaining onlookers and they all went back to their meals in an instant can someone explain what was going on here she asked looking at nathan but it was kevin who answered malfoy started it headmistress he came here just to provoke nathan he said what did he say asked harry quite interested on what nathan had to say they were just mocking me said nathan dismissively it was nothing important neither harry nor mcgonagall were satisfied with that explanation but didntinquire further harry eyed nathan speculatively the boy had a blank countenance that betrayed nothing nathan didntwant harry trying to protect him he had heard every word of what malfoy had said and it would only worsen the situation no nathan would take care of it by himself harry and mcgonagall walked back to the head table and the level of noise went back to normal in the great hall nathan sighed and turned back to his friends nobody seemed willing to ask him anything good he thought because he didntwant to discuss it right now i ll expect this assignment by next week not a day longer hermione was saying to her class of inorganic chemistry when the bell rang signaling the end of the morning class the noise in the quiet classroom rose as the students gathered their things discussing their plans for the rest of the day and left for lunch hermione retreated to her desk to pack away her things as well a few minutes after the last students had left she heard a tap at the classroom door she turned her head at the sound and found her colleague crossing the room toward her care to join me for lunch professor granger he invited with a smile professor william brice also a teacher and researcher in the chemistry department was always very nice to hermione he was considerably new at the university and didnthave many friends in the faculty yet sure what do you have in mind hermione agreed he approached the desk and took the books she had just packed into a pile hermione seemed on the verge of protesting but decided not to i think it your time to choose he answered smiling at her italian food then she said and they left the classroom and walked the corridors together to her office she opened the door and left her class notes and students assignments over her desk professor brice followed her and placed the books he was carrying next to those papers eyeing the amount of them on her desk he said you sure like homework you must have tons of essays to correct here hermione smiled i just think they help in the learning process and taking her purse and coat she stated i ready let go they left the building and walked the few blocks that separated the university from the nice italian restaurant hermione sometimes ate at immersed in animated conversation they took a table by the window and a waiter came to them to take their order while waiting for the food they talked about several things related to their classes and research they ate their meals and the conversation shifted to more personal topics i ve heard your son is studying in a boarding school brice said in a tone that displayed his curiosity it the same school i went when i was his age it a very respectful institution hermione commented hoping it was enough to change his interest to other subjects you must be feeling a little lonely without him here he said then hermione was a little taken aback by the course this conversation seemed to be taking i miss him of course but i knew this time would come eventually it always comes she admitted so they say if you need anything you know you can come to me dontyou he said looking into her eyes reaching for her hand resting on the table top he added you donthave to be alone hermione she didntflinch from his touch but didntfeel comfortable with it either i ll have that in mind william she managed withdrawing her hand from under his they paid the bill and left the restaurant that exchange had left an awkward tension between them hermione couldntunderstand why she had shut him out like that he is a great man intelligent gentle funny handsome so why donti give him a chance they had made all the way back to the university in this uncomfortable silence she could see she had hurt his feelings i guess i ll see you around he said in farewell see you william she said and he moved away from where she stood in front of her office door she observed him until he turned right and disappeared from her view she sighed that was awful she thought entering her office she didnthave classes this afternoon only assignments to grade so she sat at her desk she couldntunderstand why she didntfeel interested by a man like william what is wrong with me she reflected isntwilliam worth at least a change why not she didntknow she took the first pile of papers to grade and started to read the top one she didntreach the middle of the page though her mind was on what had happened during lunch is it because he is a muggle she snorted at the thought that was ridiculous of course she didntmind if he was magical or not she was a muggle born living in the muggle world why then she thought all she knew was that it didntfeel right she didntwant him who do i want then she questioned herself and from nowhere the image of severus snape came to her mind and a light smile played on her lips at least until she realized what that meant and then she gasped what the snape entered the great hall for lunch he wouldntlet the boy get to him boy that was already there he noted and then frowned in disgust with himself for even noticing he was managing to ignore nathan perfectly well until almost the end of the meal when the boy approached the head table professor snape nathan called snape closed his eyes hidden by the curtain of hair before acknowledging him what do you want granger he spat i want to know the time of today detention sir detention severus had forgotten that he had given nathan detention with all that had followed the statement of the punishment but now everything came back a month of detentions he remembered frowning at the boy meet me at seven in the classroom he stated simply yes sir nathan answered and left to meet his friends by the door of the great hall snape was left with the realization that he couldntavoid nathan any longer he had forgotten about the detentions but by seven he would be prepared to face the boy this little chat at lunch could be held responsible for many students leaving his afternoon classes in tears and also for the lowering of the gemstone level in all the houses hourglasses by dinnertime by the end of the day snape didnthave a solution for the upcoming detention he decided to skip dinner and retreated to his office at seven already back at the potions classroom snape heard a knock on the door enter he said nathan entered the room and started to advance to where the potions master was only to be interrupted by snape stay where you are mr granger he heard the professor say we are leaving for the headmistress office to discuss your situation nathan frowned with the news why sir he asked must you question everything snape said between gritted teeth and without another word he stormed past nathan leaving the classroom nathan hurried to keep up with the long steps of the potions master they climbed the stairs that separated the dungeons from the tower where the headmistress office was in silence by the gargoyles snape offered the password and they were lifted by the rotating staircase snape knocked and waited for the headmistress to answer when he heard mcgonagall voice call enter he opened the door what can i do for you severus she asked i here to discuss mr granger punishment for breaking the school rules and entering the forbidden forest i ve already deducted fifty points from his house and deliberated for a month of detentions he said to the headmistress as if nathan wasntthere all i need is someone to supervise these detentions why cantyou supervise them severus mcgonagall asked eyeing snape with some surprise you are usually too eager to help in these matters especially when the student is a gryffindor it not my place to discipline gryffindors minerva he stated in annoyance that lupin job nathan wasntmissing any word of that discussion he was listening curiously as snape tried to get rid of him of all manners nathan wasntthe only one observing the potions master intently a pair of blue eyes was also on the man since his arrival you know quite well that lupin is unavailable at the moment mcgonagall said losing some of her patience with severus then maybe you should take over granger punishment personally snape dared to say showing how desperate he was mcgonagall looked at snape in disbelief i the headmistress and i donthave time to supervise detentions as remus is unavailable you ll have to supervise his detentions yourself severus there was no room for discussion snape let out a breath in a gesture of defeat back to the dungeons mr granger he said without looking at nathan nathan hesitated before turning to leave it was the first time he had entered the headmistress office and he was looking at everything with interest while listening to the professors discussion there were many portraits hanging on the wall behind professor mcgonagall desk and all of them had their eyes on the two teachers all but one at first he was observing snape just like the others but after a while his blue eyes shifted to look at nathan the portrait had smiled when nathan was ordered to leave he walked back to the dungeons reflecting on what was happening professor snape doesntwant to supervise my detentions why is it because of the conversation we had yesterday nathan recalled the odd look on snape face the other day he is avoiding me and it because he knows something once he reached the dungeons instead of waiting by the door he decided it was better to go in the classroom was barely lit he seated himself by the workbench nearest to professor snape desk looking for some distraction while waiting for the professor he didnthave to wait long though snape entered the room visibly irritated he walked to his desk and without looking at nathan said parchment and quill out boy you re doing lines nathan looked at the potions master for a moment before obeying when he had the appointed material out of his bookbag professor snape spoke again take your things to the last workbench and write a hundred inches of i must not break school rules nathan didntquestion the order but he did think it odd why is he sending me to the end of the room taking his materials he sat at the last workbench and started his task snape had sent the boy to the back of the room he didntwant to be near him but his mind had a different opinion from time to time he was convinced to lift his head and observe nathan working on the lines a gesture that was followed by the thoughts of hurting hermione granger as soon as he realized what he was doing he didntleave his chair for the remaining of the detention though one hour later nathan approached snape rolled parchment in hand i ve finished sir snape took the proffered roll get out nathan fidgeted a little like if wanting to say something but left without a word snape opened the parchment and read the line that repeated itself down the page i must not break school rules his eyes perused the whole one hundred inches and stopped to read a different line at the very end he narrowed his eyes it read i must not break school rules i disappointed you professor snape i promise not to be this stupid again i sorry he crushed the parchment by the same time the next day nathan and the others were hanging around in the entrance hall kevin and andy had decided to keep nathan company while he waited for the time of his detention do you think he ll make you write lines again asked andy i dontknow i hope not it too boring to just sit there in that dark room writing stupid lines nathan complained would you prefer to clean cauldrons like the last time asked kevin i guess i would at least it more productive than lines nathan answered they waited a little longer until seven o clock arrived kevin and andy wished nathan luck and left for gryffindor tower while nathan headed to the dungeons he knocked at the potions classroom door and waited enter he heard good evening professor snape nathan greeted and got no answer as usual he looked at the workbench he had used the day before and saw a cauldron there he hesitated not knowing if snape wanted him to go to his desk or just stay at the last workbench as the professor said nothing nathan advanced stopping in front of the potions master what is my task today first of all what were you thinking when you disobeyed me yesterday snape didntwait for an answer i thought i had been clear in your assignment mr granger but again you proved you re not as smart as you think you are what lines did i instruct you should write i must not break the school rules sir nathan answered and was that what you wrote snape asked then nathan went quiet he had written the lines but then had added something else at the end when he realized that snape was going to berate him again he spoke i wrote the required length of the lines as you demanded sir and i only added the other line after i had finished snape was rendered speechless nathan had surprised him once again it was turning into a habit the boy is cunning he thought frowning for recognizing yet another admirable quality in the boy he ordered clean that cauldron until it as shiny as a mirror do you think you can do that yes sir nathan answered lowering his head and he walked back to the end of the room he cleaned the cauldron while professor snape graded some papers or tried to the same as the day before from time to time snape found himself observing nathan what he didntknow was that he was being observed by the boy as well why the fuss about a simple apology nathan thought i thought he would like to know that i sorry he is spending all this time with me resting his tired arms between long bouts of scrubbing nathan took a short moment to watch snape as a good observer nathan realized that snape wasntreally grading the papers but just feigning it maybe this was the time to ask him professor snape nathan called i hope you re interrupting me to say you ve finished i dontthink i interrupting you sir nathan said and without leaving space for a reprimand he added i want to know if you re all right sir i was better when i didnthave to deal with you granger snape said between gritted teeth spitting the name and it was the absolute truth so he is angry with me nathan decided i sorry you re stuck with me sir i didntmean for it to happen didntyou are you sure you didntplan this whole thing snape voice was rising with each question he rose from his seat i know what you were doing in the forest boy and i honestly dontthink you did it out of generosity were you looking for detentions did you want to be stuck with me in this dungeon severus was by nathan side now i dontknow what you want from me boy but i want you to know that this little game yours and your mother ends here he was face to face with his son i dontknow what you re talking about sir nathan said confused i went to the forest to get the unicorn hair which was stupid i admitted but i did it to make you proud of me and not to get detentions i didntwant to get stuck with you sir and i dontknow what game you re talking about my mother and i are doing nothing nathan was angered at the mention of his mother who does he think he is to talk about my mother like that so you know nothing about your mother snape stated or me i know very little about you sir but you cantsay i dontknow my own mother nathan answered between gritted teeth then tell me who your father is snape growled nathan just stared at the man in front of him fuming he wanted to scream he wanted to hurt him snape broke the staring contest first he had been sure the boy knew the truth and was just playing with him but now he wasntso convinced he heard nathan take a deep breath and say i should ve known you would use this information against me that what you do right that what slytherins do you use the knowledge of someone else weakness to your advantage his voice was low and hurt i ll finish cleaning the cauldron and be out of your dungeon sir and he

still upset when the next morning arrived the way professor snape had used the fact that he didntknow who his father was had hurt him deeply he had trusted snape because of his mother all the things she had said about the potions master had been enough for him he had trusted snape only to have his trust used yes he was really disappointed with professor snape he was also mad at himself for letting his guard down that was how he felt when he entered the potions classroom for yet another detention he didntgreet the man by the desk as he usually did he didntadvance across the room to talk to him he simply went to the workbench at the end of the room determined to wait for professor snape to make the first move it never came though because resting there on the workbench was a parchment with instructions for the evening task one hour had passed by the time he finished another hundred inches of lines nathan hadntsaid a word since he had arrived and neither had professor snape he rolled the parchment and left it on the table where he had been working rose from his seat and gathered his things without a look to the professor who was reading at his desk across the room nathan left the same thing happened the following day he entered sat by the last workbench and found a parchment with instructions to write yet more lines nathan read the task and rolled his eyes but didntexpress his contempt in any other way he completed the task and left the dungeons after spending more than an hour in silent company with the potions master who had been grading essays snape looked up from the sixth year essays as soon as the door snapped closed and he sighed in relief another detention had passed in absolute silence not a word exchanged between nathan and himself leaving his desk he went to the workbench the boy had just vacated and retrieved the rolled parchment he opened the scroll and confirmed its contents again only a repetition of the line he had assigned what was i expecting more notes at the end of the parchment he snorted at the thought the boy knew better taking the roll with him back to his desk snape went back to grading at least he tried he had been thinking about the confrontation with nathan ever since the event at first he had been glad to put the boy on his place to show him he wasntthe nice honorable man they claimed him to be but now after two silent evenings he was wondering what the boy was thinking he remembered the hurt look on nathan face and his accusations of using his weakness against him and that bothered snape the moment he had asked nathan to tell him his father name he had expected the boy to admit his knowledge and his manipulating game but he was wrong nathan didntknow anything and had been hurt by him snape dropped the quill and raised his fingers to pinch the bridge of his nose he didntwant to be bothered by what the boy thought of him he didntwant to think of the boy he was fighting it but he knew he was losing and he didntlike it one bit the following day was friday the day of the halloween feast nathan was brought out of his melancholy mood captivated by the excitement around him he was determined to forget about snape and have a good time with his friends it was halloween it was just after lunch and the first years didnthave classes on friday afternoons the common room was buzzing when nathan and the others arrived back from lunch in the great hall they found a free table and started a game of exploding snap and even nathan who hardly had time to play because of the homework and of course the detentions had joined this time they were in the middle of the fun when a boy ran into the common room panting as if he had run a marathon it starting he shouted and added after he had taken some much needed breaths they re out by the quidditch pitch there was a ripple of excitement through the room and everybody was suddenly rushing to leave the first years were looking at each other in confusion arentyou coming a third year asked where are you going kevin retorted to the quidditch pitch didntyou hear the duel is starting the third year said as if it was the most natural reaction to what was happening a duel asked a wide eyed andy yeah let go or we ll miss it the boy answered and headed for the exit andy was on his feet in the moment and kevin was following suit but nathan was still confused wait a minute who dueling he asked i dontknow but if a real duel is happening down there i not missing it andy said already at the fat lady portrait nathan curiosity wouldntlet him stay behind he rose and followed the other gryffindors out to the castle grounds he caught up with his friends by the magical stairs it looked like the whole school was heading for the same place by the time he arrived at the quidditch pitch a great number of students were already there mostly slytherins they were cheering while the gryffindors were looking apprehensive that wasntvery reassuring but it was nothing compared with the scene nathan found when he finally broke through the crowd professor snape and harry potter were aiming their wands at each other nathan paled a bright blue light was coming from harry wand but it was intercepted by an invisible barrier before reaching its target snape wand was moving with amazing speed and a red light burst from its tip heading for harry who flicked his own wand screaming protego and the red light dissipated with a bang both wizards were too intent on watching each other to see nathan standing nearby becoming more distressed with each hex someone has to stop it he said looking around no one seemed to care though why arentyou doing anything he asked the other students around him in exasperation there nothing to be done they do it every year an older girl answered nathan gasped every year but he got no answer this time every eye was on the dueling wizards another flash of bright light caught nathan eyes bringing his attention back to the duel too stupefy he heard harry cry with a wave of his wand snape deflected the stunning hex harry flicked his wand then saying inanimatus conjurus and rocks were suddenly appearing from thin air in front of him as soon as they were fully formed he cried oppugno and the rocks hurtled towards snape he was apparently expecting this though and with a single wave of his wand and a bored expression on his face made the rocks disintegrate before they reached him are you done with these children hexes snape said with a smirk harry only answers were the narrowing of his eyes and another hex which snape once more deflected with ease still smirking snape didntwait for another attack and flicked his wand saying serpensortia the snake slithered lazily in harry direction who seemed more irritated than worried about it even though snape was still smirking if you want to play with those first year hexes i may as well join you snape mocked nathan seemed worried but harry just hissed at the conjured snake probably asking it to go back to snape who then blasted the animal with a flick of his wand the whole school seemed to be watching now there was a big circle of people around the dueling wizards and yet more people up in the stands nathan could even see some of his professors but they didntseem keen to stop the fight either that made nathan uncomfortable a couple more hexes were exchanged and things were getting worse they seemed to be having more trouble deflecting each other attacks especially harry the slytherins were particularly pleased nathan could see the satisfaction on their faces malfoy looked like he was having the time of his life the blasting sounds and intensity of the lights were increasing harry seemed to have got a hex past snape protection but it wasntenough to take the older wizard out of the duel snape expression seemed more determined than ever his eyes were fixed on harry when he flicked his wand without uttering a word a line of light escaped his wand tip in the direction of harry who seemed confident until the movement he made with his own wand failed to stop the light advancing nathan could see the expression of surprise on harry face and his heart skipped a beat ropes appeared from thin air restraining harry body and immobilizing him on the spot he fell to the ground bound nathan opened his eyes wide and then looked at the sneering professor snape who was approaching harry slytherins were cheering gryffindors and the other students were looking disappointed but none seemed worried by harry position on the ground nathan ran to his godfather and heard professor snape says you still dontget it potter that one was tricky harry admitted a modified incarcerous that looked like a levicorpus when cast very slytherin snape raised an eyebrow at that maybe you are learning something after all and then added with another smirk but it still apparently not enough harry narrowed his eyes and fought the ropes that bound him nathan seeing that said in a commanding tone release uncle harry both older wizards suddenly noticed nathan standing there harry spoke first stay out of it nathan but he didntcare what harry had to say he was staring at professor snape in a commanding way waiting to be obeyed snape was staring back first with surprise and irritation but now he seemed amused he didntsay anything though harry seemed worried leave him alone snape he said that caught snape attention he looked at harry and retorted or what apparently satisfied with harry lack of response snape walked away passing by nathan as if he wasnteven there nathan didntseem the least worried with what professor snape could do to him i said release my godfather he called to snape retreating back that made snape stop in his tracks he stood still for a moment not turning to look at nathan and then without a word retrieved his wand and in a movement the ropes binding harry were gone without a glance back snape strode quickly across the grounds and down to the dungeons harry was on his feet as soon as he was released rubbing at his left arm nathan turned to him are you all right uncle harry i fine i fine harry answered visibly irritated i remember asking you to stay out of it yeah you did nathan agreed but you were also lying on the ground bound he added with a shrug as much as i appreciate your concern nathan i dontwant snape to have reasons to be nasty to you and i really dontneed you between the two of us harry said in a very serious tone why were you dueling nathan asked we duel every year harry answered vaguely so i ve heard but why nathan didntgive up it has to do with the war nathan it not something you should be concerned about harry finished nathan shook his head one day someone will have to tell me what really happened during this war as much as you say it doesntconcern me it like i part of it somehow and i the only one who doesntunderstand why he protested he felt left out sometimes they took the path to the castle some students were still lingering about but most of them were back inside a gryffindor probably a sixth year approached them you ll get him next year mr potter yeah of course harry answered nonchalantly other students made similar comments and harry responded the same way mcgonagall approached them when is this going to stop she asked visibly annoyed harry ignored her and she added this is getting more dangerous every year you should know better mr potter you know it would be even worse if we didntknow better than to really hurt each other harry answered and i ll get him next year maybe when i win he ll learn his place and stop being the bastard he is mr potter mcgonagall chastised nathan had a surprised expression on his face not for the swearing but at learning harry never won before you re saying you never beaten professor snape in a duel harry didntanswer right away he seemed a little uncomfortable with the situation even ashamed i ll win next year he said firmly the headmistress narrowed her eyes nathan was gaping he knew but knowing that his godfather who was said to be the greatest wizard of his age had been losing duels to professor snape for years was too much he couldntavoid his admiration for the potions master growing even more despite the actual thoughts of his dubious character professor snape was really a great wizard he admitted they reached the entrance hall professor mcgonagall and harry went to her office nathan found his friends there and they went back to the common room there was still some time until the halloween feast severus snape was back in his office after winning another duel against harry potter normally it was enough to make his week but not this year this year he had granger to turn every moment that would otherwise be great into something miserable particularly in this case nathan was the responsible for his distress he couldnterase a word from his mind godfather harry bloody potter he muttered it could have been any other person but no it had to be potter he couldntstay still even though his body needed some rest after the exertion of the duel he started pacing the room his son godfather was harry potter he tried to calm down he didnthave to bother with any of this right he didnthave anything to do with the boy if his godfather is harry potter or neville longbottom i couldntcare less he forced himself to think but he couldntforce himself to mean it he cared and it was consuming him his mind was so used to analyzing the various sides of a situation that he couldntrefrain from wondering if harry potter was nathan godfather and he severus snape the father of the boy wasntplaying his intended role then it meant that potter was filling his space in nathan life his space by right it didntmatter if he didntwant to actually be the boy father it was all about potter being the one substituting for him that wouldntdo he paced some more and then sighed he had to calm himself potter has been his son godfather for more than eleven years that was nothing a couple of hours would change he forced himself to sit down why do i care he mused trying once again to deny he cared but failing he growled in annoyance hermione granger knew i would never accept it he thought why did she do it his hands were in fists like every time he thought of hermione these days she ll be lucky to live the next time i meet her he hissed between gritted teeth then closed his eyes trying to regain his control how many more surprises does she have for me he mused he wanted to stop thinking about that he opened a book read the same paragraph three times and closed it annoyed he reached for a stack of parchments on the left side of his desk essays he started grading them and that seemed to divert his attention for a while one hour had passed and he was almost finished with the stack of essays when he heard someone at his door he took a deep breath and said enter harry potter entered his office just the man i wanted to meet he thought sarcastically he was preparing to dismiss him but potter was quicker before you start your lecture on how i dontknow anything and how you re so much better than me you should know that i not here to talk about myself or the duel i here to talk about nathan harry said sitting in the chair across from snape even without an invitation and giving the other man a look that dared snape to disagree snape reclined in his chair and crossed his arms in front of him inside he was wondering how worse his evening could possibly become out loud he merely said be brief i a busy man potter harry snorted okay to the point then leave nathan alone he said with a pointed look snape looked at potter for a moment in silence he was trying to suppress the urge to tell him that he had no right to ask that of the boy father i dontthink i understand what you mean potter he said instead wishing his son godfather would give him a legitimate excuse to hex him i meant exactly what i said snape dontgive him detentions for nothing donttake points from him because he breathed at the wrong time and dontgive him grades below the slytherins who did worse work just because he hermione son or my godson harry said leave him alone snape narrowed his eyes are you insinuating that i being unfair with him because he your godson he said yes that exactly what i saying harry confirmed i didnteven know he was your damned godson until this afternoon and if he had detentions and points taken from precious gryffindor it because he as careless and mischievous as you were snape said leaning to stare at potter green eyes from across the desk donttry to teach me how to discipline my students potter well you ve been warned harry said dismissively and left the chair he had been sitting in if i have to talk to you about this again you wontlike it try to remember that nathan has someone to look out for him unlike myself he pointed out and left the room snape growled the nerve he thought he took a deep breath and left his office with long strides towards his quarters he still had the stupid halloween feast to attend and another detention with his little nemesis before this day would be over nathan entered the great hall with his friends and was amazed at what he saw headmistress mcgonagall had maintained dumbledore tradition of decorating the room with live bats candles and carved pumpkins it was really impressive most of the teachers were already at the head table including professor snape harry had left hogwarts before the feast nathan knew that because his godfather had come to say goodbye in the common room causing something of a furor it seemed that harry defeat at the duel earlier hadntchanged his hero image he glanced at the slytherins then their humor seemed to have improved after the duel they were much more animated than normal and from time to time they looked in professor snape direction and commented on something nathan sat at the table across from kevin andy took the spot to his left they were really excited about the feast it great dontyou think kevin asked looking in astonishment at the enchanted ceiling covered with bats yeah it is nathan agreed even though i ve heard of it before i didntimagine it would look like this look at the size of that pumpkin andy said pointing at a particularly gigantic one it really big kevin agreed their attention focused on the table when dinner was served they ate a little of everything and drank a lot of pumpkin juice when they were waiting for pudding nathan saw kevin narrow his eyes at something behind him he turned and found devon malfoy smirking face he rolled his eyes and said why i am not surprised nice duel today didntyou think granger malfoy asked yeah it was he answered that seemed to throw malfoy at bit he recovered though i always knew your dear godfather wasntall he claimed to be he said i dontremember him claiming to be anything but then you donteven know him nathan said evenly i know professor snape though and he could beat harry potter with his eyes closed anytime he wanted malfoy said then apparently not used to losing an argument before nathan could come up with a retort the very object of their discussion professor snape interrupted them i thank you mr malfoy now back to your seat snape said with a smirk and then looking at nathan he said mr granger we still have a detention after dinner with or without halloween nathan left right after dessert walking down to the dungeons he entered the classroom as he had done for the last two detentions heading straight to the last workbench of the room there it was a parchment with instructions he took the piece of paper and read it more lines he whined in a low voice what did you say mr granger snape asked not expecting the boy to respond nathan was tired of these boring detentions so feeling bold enough he repeated more lines sir snape let go of his quill and clasped his hands in front of him resting them on the table top are you complaining mr granger he asked and arched an eyebrow daring him to answer yes well yes sir i thought we could use this time for something more productive than lines that was it he had said it i have some rather dirty cauldrons around here would you prefer to clean them instead snape asked with a smirk in fact i would sir nathan answered simply if snape was surprised he didntshow it he retrieved his wand and flicked it saying accio cauldrons two filthy cauldrons floated from the shelf and landed on the workbench in front of snape desk there you go mr granger he said smirking nathan didntsay anything just went to the cauldrons and started to scrub them snape observed the boy from time to time with curiosity the boy had the talent to intrigue him he had to admit tired of fighting against his curiosity and sick of pretending he was grading essays snape rose from his chair and walked to the front of his desk leaning there with his arms crossed over his chest facing nathan the boy looked up startled by the sudden movement he stopped scrubbing for a moment but as professor snape didntsay anything he went back to his task a few minutes later though professor snape broke the silence tell me mr granger why did you confront me today at the quidditch pitch nathan stopped scrubbing but didntlook up i didntmean to confront you sir i just wanted you to free my godfather i see snape said and moved from his reclined position to pace in front of his desk so the great harry potter is your godfather that should make things easier for you i sure i grew up in the muggle world sir it didntmake any difference then and nothing has changed now nathan said now looking at snape snape eyed the boy for a moment i sure things have changed you must be quite respected in gryffindor tower for your association with heroes like him he pushed nathan didntknow where professor snape was going with the conversation people knew me before i knew them but that all i dontknow how it changes anything he said in response and shrugged before going back to scrubbing the cauldron snape moved closer to the boy you must be really fond of him to disrespect me like that nathan stopped his task again i never meant to disrespect you sir i sorry if you felt that i did he was starting to fell uneasy with professor snape unusual behavior would you like mr potter to be your father snape asked unable to hold his tongue and berating himself the moment the words left his mouth nathan looked up sharply professor snape had turned his back to him he watched that back for a long time he isn t nathan said quietly looking back down he is not is he he thought uncertainly snape could barely hear him no he isn t but that was not my question he turned to face the boy again any boy would want to have a hero like harry potter for a father and i dontthink you re any different nathan was getting ever so confused with this crazy conversation why is he telling me this what does he mean he thought does he know who my father is he must know else why would he have been so clear in his affirmation that harry isnt my father snape was back at his desk when nathan decided to look up whatever he wanted to say wouldntcome out he finished cleaning the cauldrons in silence professor snape knew who his father was nathan now knew it for sure when he turned from the workbench to approach the potions master desk to say he was finished professor snape spoke if you finished just leave and so he did hermione granger was back home from a day of work later on she was to attend a halloween party hosted by one of the professors at the university he and his wife hosted this party every year and every year she refused their invitation with the excuse of taking nathan trick or treating or to a party at a friend house this year though nathan was at hogwarts and she had no excuse to avoid the event william had offered to pick her up so they could go together she couldntcome up with an excuse to refuse him so she was now waiting for him to arrive she had dressed up as juliet since william was going as romeo at first she had rolled her eyes at the clich d idea but he had seemed happy with it so she had agreed she didntwant to have to come up with something else anyway so there she sat dressed up in her transfigured dress waiting and thinking since her visit to hogwarts severus snape had been invading her dreams again this time though they werentnightmares from the night she had been captured by the death eaters they were dreams of those skillful hands touching her face her hair it was troubling her she respected him yes she admired him of course but this was different this was new severus snape had always been part of her life since her first day at hogwarts first she had respected him for his knowledge and skills as a potions master later she had admired him for his vision and power as a spy for the order then for his honor and courage in fulfilling his promise to albus finally she had admired him for saving her life that night since then he had been part of her life through nathan even if not physically present and now now she didntknow she had met him again and suddenly he was appearing in her dreams not as her personal hero either but as something else something more what did that mean she thought to herself was she having fantasies of her ideal man in the form of the father of her son was it about the figure severus represented or was it the man severus really was maybe she was overanalyzing those dreams and they represented nothing after all interpreting dreams was something trelawney would do not me she mentally chastised herself trying not to analyze those dreams though was proving to be very difficult she tried to think about other things like her work and her friends but try as she might she always came back to severus hands in her dreams until a more solid distraction arrived william was at the door she met him downstairs he was gaping at the sight of her and she blushed in embarrassment he seemed to recover enough to bow theatrically and say for i ne er saw true beauty till this night my juliet you re as beautiful as the most brilliant star in the sky he smiled she couldntrefrain from rolling her eyes at the silly courtship but blushed nonetheless well thank you romeo you look rather handsome yourself she said then and accepted his outstretched hand he guided her to his car and they left for the party arriving at the appointed location they were greeted by the hosts of the night the house was cautiously decorated with carved pumpkins fake cobwebs and cauldrons filled with smoke from dry ice she sighed irritated with the memories they brought the house was full she knew most of the people from the university the music filled the rooms and there were couples dancing animatedly william offered her a drink which she accepted it was a nice party and a nice distraction for her mind the night went well she chatted with some colleagues she laughed at some pranks and she had danced with william who was being really nice to her he was a good distraction it was getting late and she was feeling tired she called on william to take her home and he promptly abided they said their goodbyes and he drove her home he stopped the car near the door to the building i enjoyed the evening immensely he said i had a good time too thank you for convincing me to go hermione answered my pleasure dear juliet he said reaching for her hand and placing a light kiss on the back of it he held her hand a little longer while staring into her brown eyes an awkward silence fell upon them hermione broke the eye contact first and looked at their united hands withdrawing hers i ll see you on monday she said then he seemed a little disappointed when he answered of course hermione good night then she offered and entered her building good night he answered to her back and left hermione

to say and guess what more detentions 0 chapter 12 wisdom hermione woke up late that saturday to the sound of an owl tapping at her bedroom window she opened it for the bird which had a letter attached to its feet a letter from nathan she had been expecting anxiously to hear from him since the day she had left hogwarts after their night in the infirmary she took the parchment and sat on the corner of the bed to read it it said dear mum i perfectly fine i know you must be thinking about me since the day you went back home i feeling perfectly healthy and i eating all the vegetables i swear that was a relief she had been worried about nathan recovery and hearing he was fine was exactly what she needed i attending a month of detentions with professor snape for entering the forbidden forest he also took fifty points from me i guess it only fair a month alone with severus she said to herself using a hand to cover her open mouth while the other held the letter oh my god she rose from the bed and started pacing beside it forgetting the letter she was holding it was highly improbable that her secret would survive a month of such intense daily contact she was certain of it what am i going to do she thought he ll find out and he ll kill me she went to the kitchen she needed some water to calm herself her hands were shaking when she lifted the glass to her mouth he ll never understand she admitted mentally she sat in a chair by the kitchen table put an elbow on the top of it and held her forehead in her hand she sighed what am i going to do she thought again not having an answer what is severus going to do she thought then the thought of what he could do if he found out was concerning would he look for her right away would he tell nathan she didntknow if he tells nathan before talking with me he ll regret it she silently promised she took several breaths to calm herself it didnthelp to feel this way right now all she knew was that they would spend a month together in detention this month could end without them discovering anything another deep breath and she went back to her room and retrieved the forgotten letter how was halloween did you distribute a lot of candy i didntget any this year as you already know there was a feast in the great hall and it was just like you uncle ron and uncle harry had said all the live bats were awesome she smiled then there was also uncle harry duel with professor snape what she exclaimed and kept reading to find out what was this duel all about i didnteven know there were so many hexes did you know uncle harry has never won yes that surprised me too when he told me but he said he ll win next year when they duel again they do it every year harry duels severus every year she said in astonishment shaking her head in disbelief that unbelievable when will they grow up she though then trying not to be mad with harry for never telling her this next weekend there will be the first quidditch match of the year gryffindor will play against slytherin that all people are talking about since the feast yesterday andy says our team is much better than theirs but i dontknow enough about quidditch yet to be sure i miss you very much i cantwait for the christmas break so we can be together again love nathan she finished reading the letter with a sigh she was looking forward christmas too would her secret survive until then there was nothing she could do now but wait well maybe she could do more than that she left for her study and started to write a letter to her son the last detention left nathan with a lot to think about he was now sure professor snape knew more about his father than he had predicted and since his departure from the dungeons the day before he was trying to find a way to get to this knowledge he had missed breakfast preferring to lay thinking in the quiet dormitory and had done so by dismissing his best friends who had called him several times before giving up by dinner time nathan had a plan outlined he would indulge in professor snape little game he would stick with what the older wizard said regardless of its lack of sense if his train of thoughts was right it would make sense eventually and he would find out whatever professor snape knew so with that in mind nathan entered the potions classroom that evening and headed straight to professor snape desk where the man sat good evening professor snape he said not waiting for an answer he knew wasntcoming i have the answer to your question that statement took the potions master attention from the book he was pretending to read he narrowed his eyes and looked at his son speculatively the boy couldntbe referring to what he had asked the day before could he severus had chastised himself for what remained of the previous evening for his weakness in even bringing up that subject during their last detention asking if nathan would like potter to be his father and severus was now convinced of his mistake did he say he has an answer he thought trying to raise a doubt he knew was unfounded that was exactly what the boy had said that he had an answer to his question his thoughts were interrupted by nathan i would like it if uncle harry were my father but we both know he isn t nathan said evenly so i think what you meant to ask was whether i would want my father to be like harry potter he paused searching those narrowed black eyes for a confirmation and taking the potions master lack of reaction as an affirmation he continued and the answer is yes who wouldntwant his father to be an honorable and powerful wizard like him he is courageous and intelligent he said then with a touch of humor he added although i doubt that sometimes severus relaxed his eyes with that last statement does that answer your question sir nathan asked the potions master gave a short nod in response not having anything safe to say in response he proceeded to a safer subject and said i have some frogs that need to be prepared they are in the box he gestured to the object and saw nathan follow his move with his head you ll separate every useful part on the different recipients legs eyes brain and skin he detailed nathan looked back at him smiling lightly is he happy with the assignment severus asked himself trying to understand what that odd reaction to dissecting frogs was his doubts were emended by the boy next words how do i do it properly i would love to learn how to extract all those ingredients from a single frog nathan said enthusiastically severus rolled his eyes the boy was just like his mother where new knowledge was concerned and like myself he added mentally he stood from his desk and went to the workbench with nathan right behind him he took a sharp knife and a dead frog from the box and lectured to the boy who was attentively watching his every move first you cut the legs on their joints like this he said demonstrating the next step is opening the frog and taking its insides out leaving only the head untouched the skin must be intact he showed every move with precision nathan watched fascinated you must then remove its eyes without perforating them and only then you may remove the brain he added finishing the first frog ever so cautiously my turn offered nathan with enthusiasm stretching his hands to take the knife from professor snape who flicked his eyes to the boy hand and arched an eyebrow taking only a moment to disguise his amusement he delivered the sharp tool he was turning to leave the boy to the task when he heard watch to see if i doing it right sir he turned back and watched his son handle the knife just as he had done and cut off the frog legs with amazing steadiness nathan had cleaned the amphibious body and was starting with the extraction of the first eye when he hesitated for the first time trying to find the right angle for the knife when he had finally decided on the wrong one severus said you ll damage the eye angle the knife more nathan did just that and looked up to his professor for confirmation severus moved his right hand over nathan and repositioned it to the right angle nathan finished the first frog without further difficulties how was that nathan asked anticipation in his shiny black eyes acceptable severus answered do the same with the remaining frogs nathan nodded still smiling madly more than an hour passed while nathan went about his work severus read a book at his desk but after every other paragraph his mind got lost in an uproar of thoughts he had enjoyed showing his son how to perform the task properly he had been proud of the boy skill and rapid learning and he had been stunned by the boy behavior when he had first addressed him today he hadntbeen expecting an answer to the question he had let slip of all things he had been expecting a brooding boy with hatred for him written in his eyes and not this smiling enthusiastic version now preparing ingredients damn the boy he cursed mentally nathan was unpredictable and it was not a good thing he didntknow what was on the boy mind and it was killing him tired of that mental torture he closed the book and addressed his son you can finish the task tomorrow you re dismissed nathan stopped in his motion startled by the sound of professor snape voice i ll finish this one before i go he said i said you can finish tomorrow now go the potions master said more forcefully nathan raised his eyebrows at that and slowly released the knife and the half mutilated frog on the workbench it was impossible to understand professor snape behavior one moment he was teaching him how to extract frog eyes the next he was shooing him from his classroom without room for questioning remembering his plan to play along nathan didntcomplain and left the classroom with a muttered good night the following day sunday an owl dropped a letter on nathan plate of eggs he smiled seeing it was from his mother dear nathan i glad to hear you re completely recovered keep eating your vegetables and dontgo to sleep very late you need to rest full nights you deserved the points you lost and also the detentions why is professor snape supervising them he is the head of slytherin not gryffindor you should go to the headmistress and ask if professor lupin couldnttake over now that he back why is everybody trying to get professor snape from supervising my detentions nathan thought remembering what andy had said when he had found out about it too even professor snape had tried to get rid of him but nathan wasntinterested on changing his supervisor not now that he knew professor snape had important information about his father halloween wasntthe same without you i went to a party but there werentreal bats there only fake skeletons and cauldrons and it wouldntdo to conjure any right no nathan thought smiling i should have known that harry would do something as stupid as dueling professor snape they never got along very well it doesntsurprise me that harry had never won either professor snape is a very powerful wizard and i dontthink he ll lose anytime soon in fact if it depends on me there wontbe another time oops nathan exclaimed what is it kevin asked i think uncle harry is in trouble i told my mum about the annual duel and she said she ll stop them if i know my mum she wontrest until uncle harry promises her he ll never duel professor snape again nathan explained and do you think he ll listen to her kevin asked then i dontknow he normally does but he seemed really determined to win the next duel i hope he wontlisten i want to see another duel like that andy said nathan continued to read the letter after taking a sip of pumpkin juice are you excited for the quidditch match then you d make ron proud i miss you so much i looking forward to the christmas break too i ll start to make the arrangements for a great holiday love mum nathan smiled christmas was his favorite holiday and he was looking forward to what his mother would be preparing this year the day passed without any unusual events nathan worked on his homework and played with his friends in the common room since the rain wasntencouraging any outdoor activity when evening arrived the detention resumed as if nothing had happened nathan went back to the box of frogs and professor snape to his potions texts nathan worked like the day before in silence although he had many questions he d like to ask the man reading at the desk across the room from him he narrowed his eyes trying to read the title of professor snape book but couldntdecipher it from that distance nathan prepared some more frogs but he was getting bored with the task once the newness of the knowledge learned had worn off dissecting frogs wasntthat fascinating anymore there were a few more to go though he sighed taking a rest from the task nathan thought it was a good time to start a conversation with the potions master another part of his big plan was to make professor snape talk no matter the subject he had admitted that he would never get anything from his professor if he couldntmake the man speak to him what are you reading sir nathan asked snape looked from over the top of his book watching the boy intently go back to work mr granger yes sir nathan said disappointed with his failure to engage his professor in conversation not wanting to give up yet nathan tried again a couple of frogs later do you read other books sir i mean not related to potions why mr granger the frogs are not interesting anymore snape asked showing his annoyance with the questions nathan could sense the annoyance in the potions master tone but he didntcare he had achieved what he had intended professor snape was talking not really he answered then keeping to his plan professor snape lowered the book keeping a finger marking the page he had been reading and looked at nathan that why this is a task for a detention mr granger he said simply and kept staring at the boy defying him to say something else right nathan said we can always go back to lines if that what you want snape offered smirking no i fine with the frogs sir nathan answered quickly i was just curious to what you re always reading sir that all keep your curiosity to yourself mr granger and go back to work snape snarled but nathan wasntready to end up the conversation yet i like reading all kinds of books he said after some silence snape was back pretending to read and didntacknowledge nathan words the boy persisted the potions books are among my favorites there are so many in the library i d like to read them all nathan said in a dreamy voice the tone on his son voice caught severus attention and he looked up from his book again the boy had an expression of longing that lasted only a moment before it changed back to one of concentration as nathan went back to work severus felt his lips curving at the edges of his mouth at this demonstration of passion for books the moment was short lived as he twisted his mouth in disgust at himself when he realized what was happening he didntcare if the boy was intelligent he didntcare if the boy was talented in potions he didntcare if the boy was intriguing he didntcare if this boy was his son he didntwant to care he couldntcare less right wrong he cared and he knew it he cared and that was paining him he cared but he didntwant to care and he wouldn t that was it these detentions had to end he would have to end them he rose abruptly startling nathan he went to where the boy was standing and addressed him that enough for today mr granger nathan was surprised by professor snape reaction he couldntunderstand what was wrong now and there were still a few frogs to prepare but there are the ingredients you prepared are sufficient for the school needs you can leave now professor snape anticipated nathan just looked at professor snape searching for the motivations behind such behavior but found none believing in his plan he kept his questions to himself and prepared to leave while the potions master observed him from near the edge of the workbench he took his things and headed for the door with professor snape on his heels he thought it odd but tried to keep in mind that he would understand everything sooner or later the potions master left the classroom with him but didntfollow him after that leaving nathan behind with his long strides the boy narrowed his eyes in confusion then shrugged and made his way to gryffindor tower severus strode quickly through the corridors ignoring the students ducking out of his way he was going straight to the headmistress office to end these disturbing detentions he gave the password to the gargoyle and climbed the rotating stairs he knocked and waited to be admitted by minerva as soon as she acknowledged his presence severus entered the circular room and walked directly to stand in front of the headmistress desk where she sat professor mcgonagall abandoned her quill and intercrossed her fingers resting them on the desktop and looked at the man towering over her have a seat severus she said would you like some tea severus lowered his slim body into one of the armchairs facing the desk minerva i here to discuss mr granger detention arrangements i cantsupervise them any longer and now that lupin is back i sure he ll comply with his duty and discipline his gryffindors professor mcgonagall sighed i cantunderstand you severus i cantremember a single detention you ve declined to supervise and yet it the second time you ve tried to refuse to supervise mr granger s she said observing the potions master with narrowed eyes what is going on between the two of you there is nothing going on between myself and any student he retorted in annoyance i have other things i d rather be doing instead of supervising a gryffindor detentions it lupin job he stated mcgonagall wasntconvinced give me a good reason to transfer his detentions to another professor he had many reasons for wanting to get rid of those detentions the boy annoying presence was one his impertinent questions and comments were another nathan resemblance of his mother was a good reason too but mainly because his son was bringing about strange feelings which severus didntwant to deal with he couldntsay any of those things though i have my reasons he said instead i sure you have said an annoyed minerva i want to know what they might be minerva i he started to answer when the door opened and admitted a seventh year the head girl headmistress the girl said breathing frantically as if she had run all the way up there peeves has inundated the sixth floor corridor with that bluish liquid again and he was heading to the stairs with another bucket of it when i left oh i would kill him if he wasntalready dead mcgonagall muttered under her breath she crossed the room and left with her students totally forgetting about the potions master for the moment severus didntfollow the headmistress he was tired of peeves pranks and could use the time to think of a reason to end his suffering a reason he could tell minerva without exposing his position as the boy father ten minutes had passed in the silence of the round office and mcgonagall hadntcome back yet another ten minutes and there was still no sign that the headmistress was returning snape was getting tired of waiting and thinking he hadntcome up with a single plausible excuse to end the detentions the snoring of the snoozing portraits was irritating him further he stood from the armchair and walked to the door when he heard a voice from behind him severus snape hesitated just a second before ignoring the call and he continued his way out of the office until he heard that well known voice again dontpush your son away frozen in place severus closed his eyes he turned to meet the blue ones of the figure in the portrait albus dumbledore i dontknow what you re talking about i have no son and i dontlisten to portraits severus said quietly he reminds me remarkably of you when you were his age the late headmaster said ignoring severus comments but i ve noticed that he a gryffindor unlike you must be his mother doing then the portrait added in amusement eyes twinkling i donthave to keep listening to a confunded old portrait snape muttered but couldntbring himself to walk out the cylindrical room if he anything like his parents he must be an extraordinary boy the combination of his parents could only result in a great wizard i sure the picture hanging behind the desk continued he must be an excellent student is he talented in potions severus sighed he very talented and intelligent he admitted his voice only slightly higher than a whisper as he averted his eyes from the figure squared by the gold frames the portrait smiled at his friend shy admission and then sobered why are you pushing him away severus there was silence in the circular office severus was feeling very uncomfortable with the conversation he rarely talked with albus portrait and this wasnta subject he would pick i dontthink that is any concern for a portrait severus said it the second time you ve tried to pass off his detentions if i right based on my observations he doesntknow you re his father am i right albus said ignoring severus rude comments i not his father severus snarled severus you cantdeny it forever you have a son and you should be using the time you spend with him in detentions to get to know him better portrait dumbledore said have you talked with hermione about it severus returned to the armchair he had sat in whilst talking to the headmistress i dontwant to kill her after all the trouble i had to save her he said then his sarcastic tone not enough to disguise his real anger shown by his fisting hands then don t severus looked to the portrait i cantignore what she did she betrayed me and hid him from me she shouldnthave done that he snarled ah so that the problem albus said hermione must have had her reasons to act the way she did and you ll only find out what they were when you talk to her but it still doesntexplain why you re pushing your boy away severus he not my boy severus said in disgust i dontwant a son i never did if she thought she could have one without my consent that her problem i don t want a son he emphasized word by word you re losing the fight arentyou the portrait said his eyes twinkling severus gave him a look of contempt at these words that why you re trying to push him away let me tell you something severus it wontwork you ll still want to know what he likes who his friends are what he does when he not in classes what books he reads even if you re not supervising his detentions it ll work it has to work because i dontwant anything to do with him i dontwant a son that is not an option anymore my boy you already have a son albus said and smiled severus was showing his disgust for portrait albus words the damned drawing was right proving it was an accurate copy of his long lost mentor he sighed i cantbe the father he deserves albus he said shaking his head in denial he dreams of a different father how do you know what kind of father he wants because he told me severus pointed out what exactly did he say dumbledore asked that he would like to have potter as his father severus spat the name of his son godfather he dreams of a hero albus not a criminal murderer like me i know what i am and he better off without me you re not a criminal murderer severus albus said in reprimand that why i donttalk to you severus said in exasperation you re only a shadow of the man you were created to represent the real albus would know who i really am a man who did too much and is beyond redemption that not how i picture a father the figure in the portrait shook his head so many years have passed my boy and you still dontbelieve you re worthy of being respected and loved i dontknow the nature of your relationship with hermione but i believe that if she had a son of yours she must have had good reason there is no relationship severus snarled and she the only one to be blamed for her wrong choices she ruined her life and now she is ruining mine too stupid witch he cursed now severus it cantbe that bad albus chastised i sure hermione made the right choice your boy nathan doesntseem a mistake to me you dontknow what you re talking about you re just a meddling old portrait who should keep your opinions to yourself severus said raising himself from the armchair and heading for the door this time he didntlook back as he left the room almost knocking back a surprised minerva who was on the verge of opening the door from the outside nathan approached the table where his friends were gathered in the common room after being shooed from his detention as they noticed his presence they stopped talking abruptly that didntpast unnoticed by nathan but he said nothing he sat in the free armchair there was silence between them for an awkward moment until he decided to break the ice what were you talking about he asked the two boys looked at each other andy said we were discussing the quidditch match nathan looked from andy to kevin something wasntright but he couldnttell what it was what about it he asked then oh the same things we were discussing earlier you know andy said waving a hand dismissively i dontthink the slytherins have a chance against us exactly agreed kevin nathan looked at them once again before letting it go i hope we win he said he wasntsure but he could have sworn he heard kevin sigh they talked more about quidditch then a little about homework a subject extremely annoying in andy opinion nathan was getting sleepy in spite of the animated conversation after his third consecutive yawn he announced i a little tired i think i going to sleep he stood up good night his friends answered with their good nights and nathan climbed the stairs from the top step he turned back to the common room and saw andy and kevin muttering something to each other he narrowed his eyes odd he thought his friends were hiding something from him he could feel it but he wasntgoing to discover anything right now he was too tired for that he would find out tomorrow he d keep an eye on them in the morning they acted as if nothing was going on they went to breakfast together and then to the dungeons for their potions class half of the students were already in the classroom when they arrived they walked to their usual seats waiting for professor snape they didnthave to wait too long the potions master stormed the room already taking points from gryffindor because josie wasntin her seat at that exactly moment that left everyone quiet for the remainder of the class nathan was taken aback by professor snape behavior what wrong with him he thought observing the brooding man working on essays by his desk in the front of the room nathan had finished his potion earlier than his classmates as usual and was using the remainder of the class to observe the potions master andy looked up from his cauldron and noticed nathan observing snape he elbowed kevin who was working by his side and almost made him drop a whole piece of daisy root on his cauldron instead of the required slice what wrong with you kevin asked in a hissed mutter annoyed with the interruption andy only pointed at nathan with a jerk of his head and kevin followed his gaze and nodded the class finished with a total loss of twenty points from gryffindor nathan commented on it while he headed to the defense classroom with his friends what was professor snape so annoyed about kevin and andy looked at each other in that weird way again i dontknow andy answered if you dontknow how would we said kevin with a shrug what was that supposed to mean nathan thought his friends were getting weirder and weirder and he still didntknow why he ignored the odd response and entered professor lupin classroom that class went smoothly now with professor lupin teaching again the class was back to its normal pace at the end of the lesson nathan heard his professor say nathan a word if you please nathan looked at his friends they nodded that they would wait for him in the corridor and left the room with the others nathan approached professor lupin desk yes sir i ve heard you got yourself into trouble while i was away lupin said nathan lowered his head i went to the forest when i wasntsupposed to i having detentions with professor snape sir so i ve heard the werewolf said i also heard you went to the forest in search of unicorns and that you did so just to impress professor snape and get some house points from him is that right yes sir kind of nathan admitted are you mad at me no i not mad at you a little disappointed maybe but not mad we talked about professor snape before and i thought you understood that he didntrecognize hard work the same way other teachers do i understood i ve learned the lesson sir nathan said i not doing anything that stupid again i glad to hear that lupin nodded in satisfaction that was all i wanted to hear from you i think your friends are waiting outside he gripped nathan shoulder in a show of affection and accompanied him to the door if there anything bothering you i want you to come to me and try to keep out of trouble during the full moon he added with a smile nathan nodded and left the classroom he met with his friends at the end of the corridor they were again muttering at each other and stopped as soon as they saw nathan approaching they went to lunch and nathan didntpress the matter during the afternoon classes the three of them were distracted by the practical work required for herbology but that distraction was gone when they entered the history of magic classroom it was impossible to not get bored during that class and while most of the students slept nathan wondered about everything that was going on specifically his friends and professor snape odd behavior the classes were finished for the day dinner was good and at the end of the meal the trio separated by the entrance hall kevin and andy went up to the library while nathan went down the stairs leading to the dungeons for yet another detention scrub those cauldrons professor snape said as soon as nathan entered his classroom nathan sighed at the retrocession of the detention task he was looking forward to more ingredient preparation or something of the sorts but was back to cleaning filthy cauldrons instead he tried to engage professor snape in conversation later in the evening but decided against it after a couple of very nasty remarks from his teacher the potions master wasntin one of his best moods as nathan had suspected since the potions class that morning as it was he left the dungeon after a couple of hours of hard work and headed for gryffindor tower where he met his friends they didntask about his detention maybe it was because of the amount of homework they had due tomorrow the next day everything seemed normal breakfast charms flying lessons which was turning out to be a fun class lunch transfiguration homework dinner and detention with professor snape that evening professor snape had assigned him to work in the storage room alone he had spent only the necessary time to explain the task and then had left for the classroom nathan had managed to make the inventory of half of the potions ingredients by the time he had heard professor snape voice call his detention off for the night from where he was sitting at his desk in the potions classroom he walked back into the classroom with his many parchments of notes in hand and stood by the potions master desk i in the middle of the inventory i guess i ll finish it tomorrow he said handing the professor his notes professor snape read through the notes and was impressed by the amount of detailed information it contained although his countenance showed no emotion yes he said simply nathan turned to leave but hesitated would you mind if i ask you something sir didntyou just ask anyway professor snape retorted nathan smirked i guess i did he admitted what that greenish unlabeled potion that inside that wooden box on the highest shelf in the storage room he asked then the potions master expression darkened as he stood up and came around the desk to stand in front of nathan have you touched it he asked his professor urgency startled nathan i touched the vial it was sticky he answered give me your hands snape urged and as nathan extended his hands towards his professor he grabbed them and examined his palms that motion surprised nathan even more what in the vial he asked did you open it professor snape asked ignoring nathan inquiry yes the boy answered simply snape looked up the moment he heard the affirmative answer he released the hand occupying his right one and held his son chin between two fingers tilting nathan head up to examine his eyes did you inhale it not directly nathan said professor snape narrowed his eyes letting go of the other hand he was still holding he used his now free fingers to rub the skin under the boy eyes looking for signs of irritation but found none you shouldntopen vials if you dontknow what they contain he snarled then freeing nathan from his grip rather rudely and turning away from the boy in visible irritation his change from concerned to tempestuous left nathan not knowing what to say i i didn t he faltered five points from gryffindor mr granger for your lack of common sense and caution when dealing with unknown substances the potions master snapped you could have poisoned yourself nathan was gapping at professor snape what the he thought frowning it wasntmy fault it was unlabeled and i was making an inventory what was i supposed to do he asked in exasperation now irritated with his professor for the loss of house points leave it show me or ask me snape said turning to face his son but never open it never open a vial of potion if you dontknow its content do you understand me the intensity in professor snape eyes was unsettling yes sir nathan answered quietly and then averted his eyes from his professor s severus turned his back to nathan go back to gryffindor tower mr granger he said quietly when he heard the door click shut he closed his eyes raised his fingers to rub at his temple a n sorry it took me forever to put this chapter up i had to attend a conference last week and the week before that i was busy preparing a presentation for this conference so no time for

snarkyroxy thank you very much a n chapter thirteen 0 the quidditch match and detentions oh and so much more than that 0 chapter 13 edge nathan was dismayed by professor snape reaction to him opening the vial of green potion does he really think i d be careless enough to smell it directly nathan thought shaking his head of course not my mother thought me better than that he had used the technique hermione had taught him for identifying unlabeled substances he had opened the vial and waved a hand over it trying to identify the substance by its odor he hadnthad the time to explain that to his professor though he had been shooed out of the dungeons again he sighed the man was impossible nothing was ever good enough for him there was always something nathan was doing wrong no matter how hard he tried and he was trying very hard maybe too hard nathan mused he was getting tired of these detentions and of dealing with professor snape maybe he should look for the headmistress and ask to serve his detention with another teacher like his mother had suggested but he thought of what professor snape knew the identity of his father and resigned himself to his fate with another sigh if he was going to gain any information from the potions master he would have to continue the detentions with him and try harder to get professor snape to talk he reached the fat lady portrait after deciding he wouldntlook for professor mcgonagall the common room was warmer than the corridors and much warmer than the dungeons his eyes traveled around the room and found kevin and andy in a corner bent over parchments of homework he d finished days ago he approached the table from behind them ever so cautiously and said in a slightly high tone i back both boys jumped from their seats startled for merlin sake andy spluttered out good grief nathan why did you do that for kevin asked indignantly nathan smirking in his amusement took a seat across from them you were just so absorbed in your work i couldntresist he said simply and his smile broadened not funny andy mumbled and went back to his homework kevin was still looking angrily at nathan who smiled even more but his smile faltered when he realized that kevin was now studying him questioningly what nathan asked nothing just stop acting like that kevin answered his eyes already back on the parchment holding his transfiguration essay nathan frowned like what like s kevin was saying but was cut off like a stupid child andy said glaring at kevin nathan observed their behavior attentively what were you going to say kevin he asked seriously exactly what andy said stop being a stupid brat nathan sighed he thought he could lighten up a little in the company of his friends but he was obviously mistaken this mystery they were keeping from him these strange looks nathan stood up abruptly and left the common room annoyed he would be better off alone severus was lying on his bed thinking about the events of these past days damn boy damn portrait when his son had asked about the green potion he had felt uneasy when the boy had said the vial was sticky he d been concerned and on his feet without even thinking and when the reckless gryffindor had said he d inhaled it his heart had skipped a beat nothing had happened though and he felt relieved and all these feelings annoyed him immensely but more annoying than what he had felt back in the classroom was how he was feeling right now he wanted to check on nathan to see if he was really fine damn boy he roared how could this gryffindor change his life so he refused to go to him though severus left his bed he wouldntsleep anytime soon so he might just as well make rounds of the castle taking points from unfortunate students he changed back into his black robes and left his quarters he walked through the corridors looking in every known mischief spot he was on the top floor turning back to descend to the dungeons when he heard footsteps he backed away into a shadowy corner and waited smirking for the unlucky student to pass by where he stood but as soon as he saw who was coming his smirk disappeared nathan had just turned the corner apparently alone he seemed distracted severus noticed the professor didntintercept him but followed instead they walked through a few corridors nathan never realizing a dark figure was stalking him the boy stopped in front of a window with a view to the lake that reflected the weak moonlight severus stood a few steps behind observing his son he watched the boy sit by the window sill and frowned what is he doing here and after curfew no less he thought when nathan didntshow any indication that he was moving back to his dormitory anytime soon severus showed himself startled nathan stood up awkwardly it after curfew mr granger what are you doing outside gryffindor severus asked i was just going back sir nathan answered five points from gryffindor nathan sighed and lowered his head i ll accompany you to your common room now snape said after a few moments of silence nathan said nothing just followed his professor a few corridors later nathan gathered his gryffindor courage and asked are you going to assign me more detentions sir nathan voice was dull severus noticed you still have several detentions ahead and they ll be used as a punishment for this transgression too he watched the boy sigh but then nod in acceptance he kept watching nathan seemed to realize his professor scrutiny and he began to feel uncomfortable he was also feeling sad at the moment it seemed that his plans to become the best student to make a difference at hogwarts were mere illusions his friends were keeping secrets from him he was always getting himself into trouble and he couldntmake professor snape recognize his efforts severus was watching his son brooding figure what is going on here he wondered he d never seen the boy like this he started to worry why were you walking around the castle after curfew mr granger professor snape asked nathan hesitation didntpast unnoticed by severus i didnthave any homework and all my friends were busy with their own so i decided to take a walk i lost track of time i sorry nathan managed to reply the boy was a convincing liar but he needed more than that to convince severus who narrowed his eyes he said nothing but his worries didntdiminished in front of the next torch that flared to light when they advanced through the corridor severus stopped nathan and commanded look at me and took his son face between his long hands professor snape looked into nathan eyes for signs of effects of the green potion and found only the normal blackness he recognized from his own eyes he was tempted to look past those eyes to access nathan thoughts but refrained himself it wasntpast nathan being hermione son to know what he was doing if he legilimized him so he let go of his son face and started walking again nathan followed him in silence for a moment he was mystified by professor snape actions is he still concerned about the green potion he thought as much as it sounded impossible that was exactly what it was professor snape was concerned for him that green substance must be very dangerous is the green potion that dangerous sir nathan asked showing curiosity was part of his nature severus spent only a glance at him yes it is he said simply and silence fell upon them again as they walked arriving at the fat lady portrait professor snape stopped and waited for nathan to give the password the portrait leading to the gryffindor common room swung open and nathan was one step from it when he half turned and said thank you professor snape you re always taking care of us i glad to have you as a teacher here and entered the room the fat lady was the only one that saw the dumbfounded snape the following morning andy and kevin were waiting for nathan in the common room before breakfast they saw him going down the stairs that came from the dormitories and when he was in hearing range andy started teasing him for being late then he lowered his voice and stopped speaking altogether nathan had just passed by them without acknowledging their presence at all nathan ignored their disbelieved stares and kept walking to the exit of the common room he had had enough if they wanted to keep things from him fine just dontexpect him to be all friendly with them he was better off alone he entered the great hall and took a seat on the opposite side of the table from where they usually sat there was no one beside or across from him he was alone nathan sighed before starting his breakfast some minutes later he heard rather than saw the two boys approaching the table they were looking at him he could feel it but he had resolved his feelings on the matter last night if they were speaking about him behind his back and making pointed comments he didntunderstand to his face then he didntneed them severus was listening to minerva and observing the great hall while sipping his coffee when he saw nathan come in the boy was alone and determinedly walking to the gryffindor table he continued to observe nathan serving himself as if through obligation and not hunger and he narrowed his eyes he knew the boy couldntbe affected by the potion he had checked twice and found no visible effect what was it then he thought severus turned to answer something the headmistress enquired of him for a moment and when he turned his attention back to the students he saw kevin and andy entering the great hall severus watched as they looked over to where nathan was and saw them turn to their usual place at the table looking at nathan and whispering to one another he observed nathan for his reaction to it but there wasntany his son was deliberately ignoring his friends he rose an eyebrow at that but why he mused severus fought to focus back on his breakfast it wasnthis place to see if the boy had friends or not checking on his health he felt was his obligation but see to his social life was not if he turned out to be a loner and decided to pass seven years alone it wasnthis problem he ate a handful of scrambled eggs using more force than necessary on his fork severus didntseem able to focus on anything else when his son was in the same room as himself the boy became the center of his interests damn the boy he berated in silence he managed to avoid looking at nathan for the remainder of his meal he stood from his chair and in a rustle of black robes left the great hall but not before glaring at andy and kevin upon passing by the gryffindor table nathan didntnotice the potions master his attentions were directed at a pair of boys sitting a few chairs from him he studied them without giving away his actions their eyes never meeting he finished his breakfast and quickly walked towards the door again ignoring kevin call of his name during classes nathan sat as far as he could from the two this behavior was starting to be noticed by some other students he knew but he was making his stand and he didntcare if people noticed he felt eyes studying him from his right and saw devon malfoy seemed to have more interest in him than in what professor flitwick was saying nathan glared impassively at him until the slytherin turned his attention back to the lecture it was like that for the whole day people were looking at him as if seeing him for the first time and they were also looking at kevin and andy the same way they had tried to speak with him during lunch but he had ignored them again refusing to listen to their excuses now they would learn not to keep things from him if they wanted to be his friends they would have to understand that at the end of the day classes he didntwant to go back to gryffindor to do his homework preferring the quietude of the library he worked on the assigned essay for charms re read the chapter on winter seasonal magical plants for herbology and had nothing else to do he would normally spend this time with his friends but now he had to find something else to do before dinner and the upcoming detention he remembered then about the green potion he was still intrigued by it what was in that vial he thought again since he was in the library he could use his time to search for clues as to what that substance could be nathan stood from the table at the back of the library and walked to the potions section there were an immense number of books on that subject he mused on where to start deciding that green potion was definitely a poison he started picking books from the shelves that had anything to do with it on their titles absorbed by the interesting reading nathan missed dinner and just had time to check out some of the books he had selected and move quickly to the dungeons he was five minutes late you re late mr granger five points from gryffindor he heard as soon as he opened the door professor snape hadnteven bothered to look at him while taking the points i sorry sir i was in the library and lost track of the time nathan excused himself professor snape looked at him then and studied nathan for a brief moment before returning to whatever work he was doing you can finish what you started yesterday professor snape said and dont open any vials this time he emphasized looking at him again i dontwant to have to inform your mother of your death he added visibly annoyed at the thought you could always inform my father instead nathan mumbled under his breath walking to the storage room to continue the inventory professor snape seemed to have heard though what did you say he asked nathan stopped and turned to look at professor snape i said he hesitated thinking this could be his opportunity to ask the potions master was now frowning at him expecting an answer i said you could inform my father instead sir nathan was a gryffindor after all he held professor snape gaze an uncomfortable silence fell upon them another five points from gryffindor mr granger nathan didnttake his eyes of snape s expecting his professor to say more professor snape narrowed his eyes i think you have a detention to fulfill mr granger what are you waiting for the potions master said visibly annoyed nathan bit at his lower lip should i ask him he mused he could see professor snape was on the edge of his patience he took a deep breath but thinking twice decided not to ask nothing sir he said instead and turned to the storage room it not the right moment he thought severus watched the boy entering the storage room with narrowed eyes what is he playing at he tried to understand what had just happened there does he know something he knew the boy didntknow anything about his father right he looked back to the book he d been reading not really seeing the words on the page his mind was full of questions with no answers and he hated when he didntfully understand what was going on severus wanted to grab the boy by the arms and demand to know what was on his mind he ground his teeth in frustration this situation was becoming unbearable after much mulling on the matter severus stood from his desk and entered the storage room nathan was counting and recounting ingredients and taking notes on a parchment the boy noticed his presence but just looked at him arching an eyebrow in expectance must he do this severus thought i can see you haventkilled yourself yet severus said nathan rolled his eyes and went back to counting salamander tails it would be extremely annoying to see your mother crying when i told her snape said observing nathan hesitate on his task for only a moment i would prefer to tell your father but then i would have to know who he is nathan had stopped his task altogether but he didnttake his eyes from the salamander tails can you tell me where to find him snape asked then nathan looked his way with a frown you know i can t he answered cantyou are you sure of that i sure nathan said but you can he affirmed conviction in his shiny black eyes so that what this is all about severus silently concluded i cantsee you working mr granger he snapped and saw the frustration written on nathan face the boy resumed his work but without the grace and caution he had been employing before severus noticed the potions master turned his back to him in a rustle of robes to leave the room but heard is it that bad he faced his son again there was something in that tone desperation maybe frustration nathan wasntfinished he must have done something horrible is he in azkaban is that why nobody tells me who he is he a monster isnthe severus didntexpect that he hadntspent too much time considering possible reasons hermione had kept his identity from the boy but now she doesntwant the likes of me near him he concluded and a stab of sorrow hit his heart could he condemn her choice he thought not and anger washed over him at what he was and what he d been severus clenched his hands into fists and said finish your damn task boy so i can get rid of you the next day the frustration of the past evening was compounded by the frustration of that morning nathan didntget what he wanted from professor snape and even worse than that the potions master now knew of his intentions he wanted to talk to his friends but he wasntthe kind of person that gave up on a stand he sighed and entered the great hall for breakfast alone he was playing with the food on his plate when something blocked the already scarce light due to the ugly weather he looked up to find kevin face why are you ignoring us the boy asked why do you care you were ignoring me first nathan retorted we were not protested andy by kevin side you re keeping secrets from me do you think you re masters of disguise news flash you re not nathan said discounting all his frustration on the boys they watched nathan kevin with an expression of surprise but andy seemed to be sorry nathan pulled his things together and left them there rendered silent by his accusations nathan was glad it was friday already he was now counting the days to be free of professor snape detentions after that wednesday evening he was certain the potions master wouldnttell him a thing about his father and saw no further reason to want to spend time with the sour man his friends were acting even stranger after that morning of their argument nathan had caught them perusing his books the evening before the books he d been reading about poisons andy seemed frightened when he d entered the dormitory after that nathan had seen them coming out of professor lupin office earlier today suspicious indeed he lay down on his bed after another evening of scrubbing cauldrons and took another book from his nightstand he was reading about another interesting green poison when he heard a shout and then a spell hit him what is the meaning of this he said jumping from his bed and advancing towards the caster kevin hold him andy he heard kevin say stay away from me andy nathan said now holding his wand at the ready what did you do to me you dontunderstand nathan you were under the imperius curse andy exclaimed his hands in front of him as if for protection but dontworry professor lupin taught us the counter curse how do you feel kevin asked observing him with caution imperius curse are you mad nathan said outraged that confused the pair of gryffindors listen nathan professor snape cursed you we ve noticed your change but it all right now you re free kevin said as if he was talking to a five year old oh come on was that what you were whispering about nathan shook his head i not under any curse you re not asked andy not anymore said a smug kevin i ve never been what made you think such an absurd thing nathan asked eyeing both of them in turn you ve been acting kind of weird since you started those detentions with snape andy explained yeah and it got worse you even started to act like him kevin completed and then you started to ignore us and we found these poison books it was scary andy said a fearful expression on his face once more nathan narrowed his eyes i trying to find the name of a green potion that was unlabeled in professor snape storage room i think it a poison that why i reading these books did you think i wanted to poison someone well yeah we thought snape was commanding you to do that wasnthe kevin asked of course not how many times do i have to tell you professor snape is not an evil wizard nathan was annoyed that he constantly had to repeat himself if you werentcursed then why have you been acting so weird asked kevin not yet convinced nathan sighed he would have to explain why he had been so focused on the detentions listen guys there something i have to tell you he said softly professor snape has information about something i ve been trying to discover for a long time information about what asked andy curious nathan sighed again this was his least favorite part of the tale i dontknow who my father is you never told us that kevin said sitting on the nearest bed that because i dontlike to talk about it nathan admitted that sad said andy sitting next to kevin professor snape seems to know his identity nathan went on but he wonttell me nathan paced in front of his friends everybody seems to know my mum knows of course and i think uncle harry knows too now i sure professor snape knows as well but no one will tell me he finished in exasperation his friends didntknow what to say nathan sat on his bed frustrated andy broke the silence did you ask him yes nathan answered simply and prompted kevin he got annoyed and has been treating me like a dunderhead ever since i sorry nathan said andy reaching out a hand to comfort his friend snape observed nathan entering the great hall with his friends in tow apparently they were back together as if nothing had happened nathan still seemed a little paler than normal he noticed but he would be fine now that he had friends again he had decided he wouldnthave anything to do with nathan after that night stark realization had hit home hermione had kept the boy from him because she didntwant nathan to know his father was a cold blood murderer and ex death eater he didntblame her severus didntfeel like attending the quidditch match but knew he had to slytherin was playing against gryffindor and as head of house he needed to show up and pretend to be interested arriving at the quidditch pitch severus found his usual place in the stands where the teachers always sat he was early as usual just to avoid bumping into overexcited students he observed the stands fill with green silver red and gold when a small group caught his eyes lupin was approaching with a red headed man ronald weasley that was no surprise weasley always attended the quidditch matches annoying as it was but this time they werentalone they had a group of excited gryffindors with them severus watched his son talking animatedly with his friends following weasley and lupin to where he sat good morning severus lupin greeted severus nodded hey snape how your team this year without frein and maison they were carrying the slytherins on their backs last year it a shame they graduated dontyou think teased ron gryffindor wontwin even if we substitute them with brooms alone severus said smirking at the now angered weasley we ll see said ron nathan arentyou sitting with us nathan hesitated looking at professor snape come over here ron said grabbing him by the robes and pulling nathan down to sit by his side you too boys if you re friends with nathan you re my friends too andy seemed eager to stay since ron was one of his favorites quidditch players but kevin wasntthat comfortable i dontknow he said oh come on kevin andy begged all right kevin agreed nathan smiled the match started and gryffindor scored first much to ron excitement and severus annoyance that only the beginning snape ron teased severus didntbother answering but observed nathan from the corner of his eyes he was smirking the game progressed and slytherin took the lead on the scoreboard it seems you were putting the carriage ahead the threstrals again weasley severus mocked let see who catches the snitch snape ron retorted severus flicked his eyes to where nathan was seated again the boy didntseem very interested on the game but had his attention on weasley instead nathan seemed fascinated with the red headed man excitement over the match his son was having a good time with weasley no less he added mentally on the pitch both seekers were flying after the snitch the small winged ball had been seen by the players near to where they sat weasley scream when he saw it had made snape cringe he watched his son openly now that everybody had their attention on the match the boy had an expression of what severus could only describe as disguised amusement and he changed his own to a cold expressionless one nathan amusement wasntdirected to the flying broomsticks but to an excited weasley and that bothered him gryffindor seeker had caught the golden snitch weasley was cheering nathan smiled watching his mother friend until he turned his attention to the other side and found professor snape staring at him he smirked then enjoy the game sir nathan asked still smirking did you professor snape retorted gryffindor won nathan answered did they severus asked arching his eyebrows nathan looked at the scoreboard then it showed two hundred and fifty to gryffindor against one hundred and seventy to slytherin he looked back at his professor and rolled his eyes at the smirking man professor snape had caught him try to actually watch the next game mr granger the potions master said leaving his seat and retreating to the castle neither of them noticed the frowning defense against the dark arts professor hermione was resting by the hearth watching the flickering flames her mind was replaying her last conversation with harry yesterday afternoon the auror had looked for her at the university asking for a favor hermione i wouldntbe here if i didntneed your help harry had said harry i a chemist not a potions mistress you should look for someone more qualified she had told him pointedly i not looking for snape hermione forget about it harry had said narrowing his eyes at hermione implied suggestion oh grow up harry she had reprimanded cantyou put this childish quarrel aside he the best potions master i know he could help you better than me harry had looked like as if she had offended him with the worst of offences harry she had said more calmly you cantcarry this grudge forever he d helped us he d saved us uncountable times and what do you do you duel him every year this is not about me and snape hermione are you going to help me or not harry had asked extremely annoyed with the turn of the conversation hermione had sighed fine but dontexpect any miracle from me i haventworked with potions this complex since our graduation she had said and i ll need supplies and a laboratory as well as books to consult she had added in an after thought harry had grinned at her i knew you wouldntresist i ve spoken with minerva and she agreed to concede you unlimited access to hogwarts library and facilities hogwarts she had exclaimed in surprise i thought i would be using the ministry laboratories and you are hogwarts is just that besides harry had added before hermione had had the time to protest you ll find all the best books on the subject there and that was how she found herself in this dilemma of conducting potions research at hogwarts they d agreed that she wouldntleave her work at the university therefore she would be spending fridays and weekends at hogwarts her musings of what would become of her life now were interrupted by a strong tap at her door startling her the unexpected visitor knocked again more insistently she rose from the sofa opened the door and froze wide eyed it was

chapter fourteen 0 the confrontation everybody has been waiting for i wontkeep you any longer chapter 14 confrontations hermione grasped the door knob tightly frozen in front of the man who stood there scowling at her what have you done he growled dangerously at that moment she knew he wasntthere as hogwarts potions master severus snape was by her door as her son father he knows a pain shot through her heart at the realization and it was suddenly hard to breathe she looked with apprehension at the narrowed black eyes pinning her where she stood snape started to advance on her the door closing behind him he never took his eyes from hers and she took a step back but he continued forward what have you done he hissed his nostrils flaring showing his barely contained rage she continued to back up in a vain attempt to escape she reached a wall and found herself cornered by the enraged man he grabbed her by one arm squeezing it in a vicious crush and shook her as he demanded why did you do this to me she gasped you re hurting me he merely stared at her breathing hard and still gripping her arm she stared back he released her with force the jostle shaking her arm and body severus turned from her demanding in a dangerously low voice answer me she wrapped her arms around herself rubbing the sensitive spot where he d grabbed her trying to ease the burning pain what do i do now how do i explain she thought staring at the back of the angry man he suddenly turned back startling her from her thoughts i ll ask you one more time granger why his eyes flashed in the light under those pinched brows she took a shaky breath i didntdo anything to you she answered barely hesitating she had to know for sure what he was talking about how much he knew her stomach was starting to churn the moment of truth had arrived i donthave patience for this he growled tell me now she closed her eyes and lowered her head severus i she started how could you do this to me he demanded not allowing her time to gather her thoughts how could you keep his face contorted in disgust a child of i couldnthave done anything else she said quietly wrong you were the only one who could he countered because you gave me no choice could you have chosen then she asked rising her head again to face those intense black eyes would you even have considered keeping him she knew he wouldn t of course not he said vehemently proving her right now you know why i didnttell you she said matter of factly his eyes never left hers why he asked simply because i wanted him she answered delivering truth in her words and in the intensity of her gaze i needed him she added in a pleading voice wanting him to understand he shook his head in disbelief how could you want him why would you need his face contorted again a rape child nathan is not a rape child she argued oh please i was there remember i was the one raping you he bellowed spitting his dark sarcasm she held his enraged gaze you didn t severus i know what i ve done he said his expression filled with self loathing so you know you saved me that night unfortunately i did that too he stated she gasped in disbelief from what she was hearing what do you want to hear from me that i hate you that i hate my son i don t she said in exasperation you ve ruined the life i ve saved because you decided to keep that child look at you he said in contempt you could have been anything you wanted even minister of magic but look at what you ve become a pathetic muggle teacher who turned from the magical world in which you had so desperately longed to be accepted you dontknow what you re talking about she said shaking her head in denial all because of a child you had no right to keep without informing me he continued as if she hadntsaid anything i never wanted an heir i never wanted anything to do with children and now you come saying you wanted even needed this child what for to remind you of that night i decided to save you nathan is not a souvenir she shouted why did you keep him then if not to remind you of what happened because i needed him she yelled at him cantyou understand nathan is the best thing that ever happened to me he my son not only yours he shouted back they locked eyes both breathing hard after their respective outbursts what did you tell him she asked quietly breaking the uncomfortable silence that fell between them he didntanswer anxiety started to take over the adrenaline of the moment does nathan know did he tell him what did he say her mind was racing hysteria building severus what did you tell nathan she urged in a shrill voice he ignored her again and turned away walking toward the door severus she called following him he turned back then staring at her with those obsidian eyes she stopped where she was waiting for an answer that never came his eyes held hers for a moment longer and then with the sharp crack of apparition he was gone she raged in frustration how could he leave like that what is he going to do now a tear rolled down her cheek that was not how she d expected that conversation to end he was still furious with her and she didntknow what nathan knew or what severus intentions were regarding him she suppressed a sob and breathed deeply to regain control stubborn bastard she cursed mentally she was sure he hadntlistened to a single word of what she d said just as she knew nathan wouldn t either their tempers was so alike she brushed another unwanted tear away with the back of her hand she would have to speak to him again she would have to go to hogwarts but not now not today she knew he wasntready to hear her yet she sighed she would have to wait if she wanted to succeed nathan left the great hall after dinner and entered the dungeons his friends headed for the common room as soon as they had finished their meals wanting to enjoy the celebration as long as it lasted after all winning a quidditch match against slytherin was always a reason to celebrate through the night he stopped in front of the potions classroom door sighed and knocked after waiting for the usual enter and not hearing it nathan tapped the door once more this time with more force and still there was no answer after the fourth series of unanswered knocks ever so cautiously nathan opened the wooden door and peered inside the classroom was darker than normal he waited until his eyes became accustomed to the darkness so he could see more easily but even then there wasntlight enough to discern if he was alone in the room nathan hesitated for a moment before opening the door further he waited for a reprimand for intruding but it never came he entered the room and closed the door behind him but now he couldntsee anything incendio he said pointing his wand to where he knew a candle hung on the wall and the flame illuminated that part of the classroom it was empty nathan frowned where is professor snape his professor had never been late for one of his detentions before and he didntthink it was something the potions master would do after all he praised punctuality more than any other professor at hogwarts he pointed his wand to another candle and repeated the incantation that brought it to light he did this a couple of times more and the room now resembled the atmosphere he remembered from previous detentions what do i do now he looked around he didntthink it a good idea to leave what if professor snape was testing him no he was staying he decided nathan walked toward the front of the classroom where professor snape desk was he could see some books a quill holder with some quills inside two ink bottles black and red some blank parchments and others written in the potions master spidery handwriting nathan glanced around the room spending some time staring the door at the right of professor snape desk one he knew led to the man office but there wasnta sign of life there either he looked back to the desk and moved closer even upside down he could read the title of the book on top of the pile human transfiguration a potions approach nathan arched an eyebrow at that potions and transfiguration two subjects he liked he was tempted to take the book he looked around again and seeing no one reached for the tome it was heavier than he thought it would be nathan opened the book and started reading the first paragraph which was enough for him to know it was a very advanced book he narrowed his eyes but it didnthelp him understand what was written there he closed the book after reading and re reading the first page a dozen times he sighed and put the tome back on the pile then he turned from the desk and took in the classroom once more there was still no sign of professor snape he decided to take a seat by the workbench in front of the professor desk and wait a little longer if professor snape didntshow up in half an hour he would look for headmistress mcgonagall and inform her of the strange absence severus apparated to the edge of the forbidden forest wanting to hex something i shouldnthave gone there he admonished himself while stalking back to the school the cold wind blowing his robes and hair was doing nothing to abate his boiling anger he d been and still was very angry with hermione but he was now even angrier with himself he had decided to look for her after spending the afternoon following the quidditch match deep in thought he had been annoyed at the show of affection between his son and weasley and the look of admiration on nathan face he wanted that for himself he wanted his son to look at him that way and he was now frowning in contempt of his desires even at the remembrance so in the heat of his jealousy he had looked for her wanting answers she d messed with his life and with his feelings by keeping that child he needed to know why she had done such a foolish thing why she had kept the child but looking for her had been a mistake made in a rare moment of weakness even the icy temperature couldntlessen the burning sensation in his chest her voice rang in his head saying she had wanted the boy she had needed the boy his son but how could she want or need a child who a result of such a barbarian act he didntbelieve her and all he could think was that she had lost her grip on reality he walked up the steps leading to the oak doors and entered the castle going directly to the dungeons lost in turbulent thoughts he followed the dark corridors without looking around and the few students still out and about shied away from his menacing figure severus opened his classroom door with a bang he went straight to his desk to gather some notes on the practical aspects of his ongoing research he would be using tomorrow morning he didntnotice the burning candles nor the boy following his movement across the room professor snape nathan called severus who had his back to the boy turned startled at the sound of someone else in the room and growled in annoyance upon realizing who this person was who gave you permission to enter here he asked we have a detention sir when i arrived you werenthere since you didntsay anything about canceling it i decided to wait until you arrived nathan explained he turned from the boy again leaning his hands on his desk therefore not seeing the curious look that was being directed at him he closed his eyes and took a deep breath are you feeling all right sir he heard his son ask but severus didntacknowledge him when he heard the stool rasping at the stone floor he turned abruptly and found nathan coming his way stay where you are he said dangerously i can go to the infirmary if you want nathan suggested stopping in his advance i can fetch madam pomfrey do you want to help he spat his son just looked at him with an unusual expression then get out now the infuriating boy kept staring at him with that odd countenance i dontthink you should be alone if you re not feeling well sir my mother says don t he cut nathan off barely containing himself from saying something he would have regretted later he growled in frustration leave he said between gritted teeth nathan seemed as if he wanted to say something else but then he decided against it he shook his head and turning to leave as he d been told muttering things like stubborn man and shouldntbe alone under his breath severus wanted to tell the boy that he was the cause of his problems he wanted to tell him his mother was the cause of his anger but he didn t hermione had asked him what he had told nathan and though he had told his son nothing at that moment he felt like telling the boy he was his father and that he didntwant anything to do with him he took the papers he d come to retrieve and walked out the classroom no more thinking about the infuriating boy or his delusional mother for now he added reluctantly nathan walked quickly out of the dungeons after leaving the rude professor to brood alone he could drop dead in that cold classroom for all nathan cared he was tired of professor snape sharp tongue tired of being told to leave to be quiet when all he wanted was to help he stalked his way to gryffindor tower wondering about the infuriating wizard it didntmatter what his mother had told about the man or if the professor knew who his father was he just wouldnttake this anymore professor snape wouldntbe the first or the last person that knew his father identity there would be others and one would be willing to share the information so he wouldnthave to struggle with the likes of professor snape screw the man watch where you re going warned lupin after almost being knocked down by nathan i sorry sir said nathan where are you going like this lupin asked or better yet where are you coming from i was in the dungeons with professor snape but now i going back to the common room sir he answered lupin watched him closely in an odd way try to slow down before you hurt someone nathan his head of house suggested nathan nodded and started to walk again unaware of the defense professor observing him curiously narrowing his eyes sunday at lunch hermione entered the great hall accompanied by minerva she had flooed to hogwarts after contacting the headmistress that morning she had used the pretence of discussing the new position harry research put her in to discover how things were at the school she didntthink anyone other than minerva knew she was there and her assumptions were confirmed by the look of hatred that severus was directing to her from the head table and those of surprise from the other teachers hey nathan isntthat your mother with the headmistress asked kevin who was sitting facing the side entrance from where the witches had entered nathan turned in his seat to see his mother with professor mcgonagall and frowned yes that her he said still observing the witches hermione waved and nathan arched a questioning eyebrow she smiled so he relaxed and smiled back she must be visiting with the headmistress he added to his friends but was still surprised with his mother unannounced presence hermione sat by minerva side and the older witch separated her from severus how are you severus minerva greeted the visibly annoyed man at her other side you were missed at breakfast i can imagine he answered in his sarcasm not offering much more and making it quite clear he wasntin the mood for small talk hermione observed severus trying to discern if this was a good or a bad sign hello professor snape she greeted testing him he shot her a glare nodded reluctantly and went back to his meal when hermione had served herself she heard him say what brings you to hogwarts miss granger i dontthink your reckless son is in need of your presence he doesntseem sick or injured to me she didntmiss the tone in his voice or the smirk on his face no he doesn t i here for other reasons she answered and he dispensed her a sideways glance oh since you brought the subject up severus i want to call a meeting this afternoon to address the faculty concerning hermione presence in the school mcgonagall said then turning to hermione she added if that all right with you my dear sure minerva that would be wise i dontwant anyone thinking i here for the wrong reasons hermione said looking at snape he nodded to the headmistress and left his seat exiting the great hall hermione sighed will he ever change she asked aloud in a rhetorical way i hope so minerva answered after lunch hermione was greeted by most of the faculty she was talking with lupin when nathan approached the head table hello professor lupin he greeted mum what are you doing here come here nathan i want to give you a hug she said gesturing him to come to where she stood mum nathan said in a low voice i dontthink you need to hug me in the great hall he was glaring at her she just smiled at him all right i wonthug you just come up here i want to talk to you can we talk in the great hall she asked teasing him nathan smirked i guess talking is fine he climbed the platform where the head table stood and went to her i ll leave you two alone lupin said smiling i sure you have a lot talk about i hope he not giving you a bad time remus hermione said no more than you ever did he answered with another smile i ll see you at the meeting he nodded goodbye and left mother and son to talk you didnthave to say that to professor lupin nathan admonished and what meeting was he talking about i ll be working in a project here at hogwarts harry asked me to research a potion and i said i would now what new with you any new detentions i should know about no he answered quickly so will you be spending time here from now on he asked only fridays and weekends she answered eyeing him suspiciously do you have something to tell me nathan he arched an eyebrow what are you talking about i dontknow you tell me mum i haventdone anything wrong since the forest incident and you know i being punished already he answered annoyed yes and how is detention with professor snape she asked in what she hoped was a nonchalant tone okay for detentions i guess he answered with a shrug what kind of things do you do lines scrubbing cauldrons preparing ingredients he said dismissively he asked you to prepare ingredients she asked surprised snape was famous for his detentions and hermione knew what kind of nasty tasks he used to designate his unfortunate students but she never heard of a first year who had been asked to prepare ingredients yes frogs he taught me how to remove the eyes and all nathan added his eyes shining he taught you now she was dumbfounded she knew nathan was as talented in potions as he was in muggle chemistry but for snape to acknowledge that she didntknow what to make of it until something else crossed her mind what do you talk about during detention nothing nathan answered too quickly in hermione opinion so what are your plans for today hermione changed subject deciding not to push nathan on the matter she could see there was more to these detentions than nathan was willing to admit she would have to talk with severus the meeting with hogwarts staff was proving enjoyable hermione thought everyone seemed happy to have her back at hogwarts everyone but the brooding wizard in black of course who was staring blankly at the fire burning in the hearth minerva called the meeting to an end and all those present started to leave their seats welcoming her and enjoying cheerful conversation all but snape he had left his seat and was heading to the door of the headmistress office so hermione called after him professor snape he ignored her call and left but she followed him he was down in the corridors when she called again professor snape he turned this time still wearing that impassive expression she approached him we need to talk i dontthink so you left without answering my last question she said what did you tell him it was as much as she would risk in such a public place he pinched the bridge of his nose between those long fingers and sighed isntit enough that you ll be here every week to torment me i want nothing to do with him now leave me alone he said and turned from her to continue his way to the dungeons she followed him so you didnttell him she stated with a questioning tone what part of leave me alone dontyou understand granger he said visibly annoyed she kept up with him if you dontwant me to follow you all the way to your dungeons answer me he ignored her and she followed him some corridors later he stopped and glared at her answer me she demanded again why dontyou ask him afraid of what you ll hear he was smirking now oh how she hated when they smirked like that he and nathan i know something has been going on during those detentions she accused him with a pointed finger and i wontgive up until i find out as you so wisely pointed out i ll be here every week and we ll have all the time in the world to talk about it she turned from him and stalked away a n they ve met they ve talked sort of and now it begins i hope you liked the chapter and i ll only know if you tell me so leave

this story takes place in the future and contains hbp spoilers be warned beta reader snarkyroxy thank you very much a n chapter fifteen 0 confrontations and unresolved tension lead to consequences are you curious chapter 15 consequences severus had finally reached his personal lab after getting rid of granger or rather getting rid of her physical presence because she was still lurking in his mind severus had enjoyed seeing how much he had annoyed her now she knew how it felt to be in the dark he smirked at her fruitless attempt of intimidation now he had the information she wanted how does that feel granger that was when he remembered the boy who would be spending another detention with him in a couple of hours severus sighed at least these damned detentions were ending and he would only have to put up with the infuriating boy during classes that was something to look forward to certainly but it did nothing to improve his mood in fact he didntthink there was anything that could now with the prospect of having hermione granger at hogwarts every week he took the stirring rod that was resting on the workbench by the side of a simmering cauldron and stirred its contents furiously thanks to that afternoon meeting this batch of tests wouldntbe ready before he had to supervise his son detention severus cursed thinking while stirring severus cursed again and left the potion to rest for the next hour he knew what he had to do about the detention he prepared the next ingredients that should be added and went to his office to fetch some books nathan descended to the dungeons as he had done after most dinners this past month he was not even a little bit enthusiastic about it in fact he was so disappointed with professor snape these days that he lost his interest in the man praise in class and was actually hopping the potions master wouldntbe there for the scheduled detention he was one minute early when he reached the classroom door he waited until it was exactly seven o clock and tapped at the door three times there was no answer he tapped again louder and yet no response nathan sighed it seemed a repetition of what had happened the day before nathan looked both sides of the corridor expecting to see the potions master striding his way with that strong presence but he didn t wondering what to do he recalled what had happened when professor snape had found him inside the classroom alone and frowned i not going inside just to be told to go away he thought and his decision was made he turned back the way he had come walking away from his detention when it was a few minutes past seven severus entered the potions classroom from the side door that connected it to his office to find it empty nathan was late he sat by his desk and read a potions journal while waiting for the boy to show up five minutes passed and nothing five minutes more and yet no sign of the boy severus annoyance at the boy lateness was being substituted by something else and he gave up on the text he was reading where is he he thought finally letting himself name the feeling starting to grow concern severus was concerned that something had happened to his son he stood from the desk and walked to the classroom main door resolved to look for nathan and see why he hadntshow up at the appointed time he walked through the corridors of the castle as if nothing was amiss he tried the great hall first but very few students were still there and nathan wasntone of them severus went up some floors and reached the library feigning disinterest he walked by the tables and aisles finding only a ravenclaw prankster from whom he took five points but not a sign of his son or his gryffindor friends severus was reluctant to try their tower so he tried the same window at which he d found nathan after curfew last week nothing severus sighed in annoyance although he was feeling more than that where is this boy if i find him just wandering around the castle i swear he ll regret the day he met me he murmured as he headed to lupin office he knocked at the defense master door but got no answer he cursed knocked again and realized that maybe lupin wasntback from his weekend in london where tonks his wife lived he contorted his lips in disgust for what he knew he would have to do next enter gryffindor common room he was really irritated now he stormed the corridors muttering under his breath a thought of what could have happened to his son if he wasntfound in the tower crossed his mind only adding to his irritation he barked the teacher password to the fat lady and went through the passage its frame revealed his black robes billowing after his dark figure those paying attention to the door stopped what they were doing at the slytherin invasion the sound in the common room diminished considerably making those not yet paying attention to the potions master standing there stop talking as well severus didntsay anything he just scanned the room with narrowed eyes and when he saw who he was looking for sitting with his back to him by a table in the corner his shoulders relaxed a little he here he thought in concealed relief but that was not enough to abate his irritation he was quickly at nathan back closing the distance with few graceful strides kevin andy and some others that were playing exploding snap with nathan had noticed professor snape presence but not him what is it it not my turn nathan protested in confusion enjoying the free time mr granger came the cold voice from behind him suddenly explaining friends odd countenances he stiffened visibly professor snape the thought that the potions master had come to the gryffindor common room after him was disturbing he cautiously turned to face his teacher and wasntsurprised when his eyes met an enraged snape explain why you skipped detention mr granger professor snape said between gritted teeth the whole common room was frozen watching the exchange i didntskip detention sir i was there at seven but you didntanswer the door and i nathan started to explain but was cut off mid sentence ten points from gryffindor now follow me nathan sighed and followed the man out of the room he could hear the murmur of commiserations as he passed those gathered there he wanted to turn and tell them to shut up and to mind their own business but he held his tongue and just kept following professor snape just outside in the hall professor snape turned and faced him again it seemed as if he wanted to say something but then he just contorted his face in disgust and started to walk fast in the direction of the dungeons nathan could only follow i wontback off on this i ve had enough of his temper nathan thought creasing his forehead he would let professor snape have his say but he would make the man listen too in a matter of minutes they were by professor snape office the man entered but didntstop there as nathan had expected he followed the potions master as he passed through a door that was hidden by some shelves when nathan saw the room beyond his mouth dropped open and his eyes widened in admiration making him momentarily forget his earlier thoughts severus was halfway to the workbench where the cauldron that needed attention simmered when he realized that nathan had stopped at the threshold he turned fully prepared to snap at the boy when he saw the look of awe in his son eyes nathan was admiring his lab the boy eyes traveled through the room a great number of candles were burning and floating near the ceiling giving the room a brighter look than the potions master office there were shelves covering the walls from floor to ceiling filled with jars and boxes of potions ingredients and equipment nathan saw the three workbenches and the small desk that were the lab furniture and his eyes stopped on his professor who was looking at him with an expression nathan didntthink he d seen on that face before an expression that was there only for a short moment as it was replaced by the cold one nathan was very familiar with do you feel it safe to enter now professor snape asked nathan just nodded still surprised with the room is this your lab sir what does it look like to you snape returned with a lifted eyebrow it looks like a great lab sir nathan answered sincerely the open admiration in his son sincere answer prevented severus from delivering the sarcastic comment he d prepared yes it is he said instead shaking himself from the surprise of the unexpectedly civilized chat severus resumed his work and reached the cauldron just in time to add the next ingredients nathan stared at the man working he could see his professor was very concentrated and counting stirs this must be a very important potion nathan mused what potion is it he watched curiously professor snape adjusted the fire after stirring observing the cauldron for a moment he looked up and caught the boy studying him with admiration he shook this thought from his head and remembered why the boy was there i have the power to expel you from this school for skipping today detention mr granger they dontend until tomorrow and you have no choice but to attend them he said his anger coming back now i wasntskipping detention sir nathan said donttry my patience boy i not i was at the classroom by seven but you werentthere sir nathan retorted with not much of his own patience left dontuse that tone with me boy professor snape snarled advancing on nathan who didntback a single step and even lifted his head in a defiant move snape was towering over the boy now only inches from actually touching his hands in fists hanging at the side of his slim body i wasntskipping detention sir nathan affirmed again but this time he elaborated i couldntenter the classroom without you there sir you had said that yourself yesterday that was yesterday nathan took a deep breath trying to calm himself snape noticed i tired of it sir i tired of the psychological games the unfounded accusations the threats i dontknow what you expect from me i cantunderstand half of your actions towards me it driving me crazy nathan had had enough i dontexpect anything from you snape finally said after staring at his son face for some time surprised by his strong words then leave me alone and i ll do the same nathan stated i dontcare what you know about my father or what you think of it at all i dontcare if you re a brilliant potions master or a good teacher i just canttake it anymore he could feel all the pain filling the voice of his son with that statement and it reached some place inside his chest he backed some distance away and turned from the boy who lowered his head what is my task for today sir nathan asked that question just added to the pain severus was feeling tell him a voice demanded tell him you were concerned when he didntshow up tell him you were confused and didntknow how to act apologize the voice screamed in his head he closed his eyes i donthave a task for you today severus turned to face his son again and i wonthave one tomorrow you re excused from the detentions as for now nathan closed his eyes and sighed may i go then go nathan was at the door when he turned to face professor snape again he hesitated before asking are you brewing the wolfsbane sir the surprise of the question made severus answer it a variation of it he looked at nathan in disbelief nathan nodded i could recognize most of the ingredients but not all of them he stated good night professor snape he left severus stared at the door for a while after his son had gone lost in thought he d been berated by his eleven year old son and had said nothing back the boy words had hurt him even if he didntwant to admit it and they had done so because they were the truth albus was right he should have used these detentions to get to know him better instead of severus brought a hand to brush his hair back in a nervous movement he looked around and started cleaning the workbench he needed some occupation to distract him from his feelings and thoughts dontcome any closer granger severus growled severus you cantrun away forever hermione was staring at the man back i not running away he said with force turning to look at her you are she gasped i not running away either hermione walked towards him i wanted your son her voice was tender to his ears severus closed his eyes i cantbelieve you he said in a low voice a hand brushed his cheek and he leaned into the touch yes you can severus i wanted your son i needed your son she stated in a very low voice he opened his eyes i cantforgive myself i dontblame you she continued to caress his face i donthate you severus i thankful to you for saving me you re an honorable man he shook his head in denial turning from her touch i can t i ve hurt you i ve destroyed your future nathan doesntdeserve a father like me severus woke up from the agitated sleep another dream he muttered in annoyance it was the third that night he pushed the covers away and sat up on the mattress not even in sleep do i have peace he mumbled rubbing at his eyes leaving his bed he paced the room and stopped in front of the enchanted window where he could see the grounds illuminated by the moonlight the weak fire burning in the hearth wasntenough to warm the room and gooseflesh rose across his naked torso after the loss of the warmth from the bed covers but the increasing cold sensation of his bare feet touching the cold stone floor didntbother him like the dreams did they were always the same he was discussing nathan with hermione and then she touched him comforting him he could even feel the soft skin of her hands and he felt bad for being touched by her even in his dreams she ll never touch me and i wonttouch her either wasntit enough what he d done to her he shook his head that was not why he couldntsleep today his conflicting feelings were preventing his rest on one hand he wanted to know his son better interact with him accept him but on the other hand i can t that not an option he deserves better he mumbled absentmindedly rubbing at his left forearm where the dark mark had left a pinkish scar he stayed there watching the moon bathe the grounds with its silver light for what seemed hours until his tired and cold body won and he went back to bed and to his restless sleep hermione professor brice called entering her office oh hi william she answered taking her attention from the essays for only time enough to acknowledge his presence he kept quiet watching her fill the poor essay with red remarks he came closer to her desk busy i sorry william she apologized resting the red pen on the desk with reluctance only to take it again and mark yet another error and only then give up the plastic tube for good when she looked up to her visitor he was smiling sometimes i wonder why you like grading essays so much and some other times he trailed off but his impassive scrutiny was fixed on her lunch hermione she frowned it lunch time already she asked somewhat rhetorically looking for a clock it fifteen past midday he offered her she traveled the pile of essays with her thumb and rested back on the chair with a sigh you seem a bit off this week it not only the classes is it william asked no there are the classes but also the midterms to prepare the research to do journals to read he interrupted her it something else you re distracted like this since monday did something happen during the weekend hermione fidgeted in her chair were her worries showing probably she frowned at the thought and then fixed her eyes on william i fine it just that i ve realized how close we are to christmas break and how much work i have to do before it she said trying to sound convincing he nodded we have a lot to do at this time of the year he agreed and with another smile added and that includes eating she watched him bypass her desk and reach for the back of her chair pulling it so she could stand up let have some lunch she accepted his invitation and they left for lunch thank you hermione said to the surprise of the house elf helping with her luggage she was arriving for her first weekend at hogwarts since she d left school so many years before the rooms the headmistress had arranged for her were very comfortable they were on the same floor as the library fourth floor which made it halfway between the dungeons where she would be working and gryffindor tower where her son lived she liked the two armchairs facing the hearth in the room in the corner was a desk she would use for her study and result analysis late at night but what really caught her eyes was the view that the wide window behind this desk revealed the lake the forest and in the distance the houses of hogsmeade that she knew would have their windows lit with the yellow from firelight at night she d missed the simplicity of the wizarding world walking to the adjacent room she found a beautiful four poster bed covered with dark crimson curtains and silver and gold details matching the coverlet besides the bed that dominated the room it also had a wardrobe uncovering one of the walls on another wall was a door that she presumed lead to the bathroom she opened her trunk and retrieved what she would be using that afternoon she wanted to go straight to the dungeons and face severus but knew it wouldntbe wise she had to be patient she had to work cautiously she had to think of what was best for nathan she left her new quarters and walked the few corridors that separated them from the library she should start working on the research that was her reason to be there in the first place she greeted madam pince and went straight to the potions section perusing the tomes and deciding which ones would be more useful at this stage of the research hermione didntnotice the boy with a light smile who approached her looking for something in particular she startled from the book she was reading to face her son nathan i didntthink i would see you before dinner she hugged him mum let go he said scowling at her when she complied dontlook at me like that young man i you re mother and i can hug you whenever i want she said raising her chin and failing to hide the smile building at the corner of her lips nathan sighed i can see you ll be embarrassing me every weekend he said shaking his head she grinned then dontyou just love that he couldnthold the smile back anymore what are you looking for exactly i could help you like i used to do at home arentyou supposed to be revising for your upcoming tests you know i ve done that already where do we start nathan asked hermione could only smile at his eagerness they shared the afternoon lost in potions books and light conversation hermione was tempted to ask more about the detentions but didntwant to ruin the mood she missed the quality time she had with nathan before he came to hogwarts and she would have the whole day tomorrow to interrogate severus the time went by so quickly that when she next checked it was dinner time nathan was finishing the list of ingredients of the potion she had appointed him to copy from the book that it for today let have some dinner she stated are you going to brew something tomorrow nathan asked when they were almost at madam pince desk where hermione would check out some of the books no tomorrow i ll see my working space and check that everything is ready i ll probably start something on sunday hermione checked out the books after promising madam pince she would not take long to bring them back and they left for her quarters if you re working in professor snape lab i think you ll find everything you need nathan commented he has the most amazing lab hermione looked at nathan with renewed interest you know professor snape lab in my er last detention he led me there he was working on some variation of the wolfsbane potion nathan said but didntelaborate did he ask you to help she couldntkeep from asking no was nathan answer she didntask anything else but her mind was racing with a million questions remus lupin was in his seat at the head table observing the students eat and share conversations when he saw hermione granger and her son nathan entering the great hall he wasntthe only to notice hermione presence many students at the gryffindor table to where she accompanied her son were muttering with each other obviously about her he observed as she brushed nathan hair back and the boy frowned at her and that was yet another moment remus had had that d j vu sensation the same he d felt when he d observed the boy after the quidditch game hermione walked to the head table after that and was received by hagrid with enthusiasm lupin watched as she took the free seat beside the half giant and when she looked at him she waved he waved back with a friendly smile which she returned but soon it faded he noticed that her look had caught the figure of severus snape remus looked at the potions master and saw that he too was looking at her the meal went by and lupin noticed more of those looks passing between hermione and snape what is going on here he thought from time to time he could see hermione looking at nathan as if lost in thought during one of those moments remus shifted his eyes to snape and caught him doing the same thing which was unbecoming snape looked his way then caught him observing and frowned lupin tried to disguise the look of realization that crossed his features and averted his eyes to his plate it cantbe saturday hermione met mcgonagall after breakfast and the headmistress led her to the dungeons severus hadntbeen in the great hall this morning but hermione knew she would meet him soon minerva tapped on the door of snape office and entered after being invited by him she led hermione in just behind her snape didntacknowledge her though severus hermione is here to start her research for the ministry do you have everything prepared minerva asked him yes minerva follow me he said rising from his desk and walking to some shelves which moved to reveal a room beyond like her son had done before she could only stare at everything in awe very well severus i ll leave you to it turning to hermione minerva added and look for me later if there is something else you need my dear hermione smiled at mcgonagall of course headmistress thank you when minerva left hermione returned her attention to the room this lab is excellent she said to severus you can find cauldrons on those shelves he said pointing behind her utensils you ll find on those in the boxes some of the most dangerous and expensive ingredients are here and the rest are at the storeroom near the classroom which i sure you know where to find any questions she wasntsurprised by his down to business attitude yes i have questions she said he snorted of course you have she narrowed her eyes why dontyou want to listen to what i have to say why cantwe sit and talk about nathan he didntanswer severus i know something happened between the two of you did he ask you something did he tell you something i see you have no questions about the lab i ll leave you to your work was all he said he turned to leave but hermione halted him with her words why are you doing this she asked annoyed all i want is to protect my son i dontwant to see him hurting more than i know he will be already she needed him to understand he turned to face her again but that is not my problem you brought this on yourself he smirked she gasped in disbelief i cantbelieve you she protested severus if he suspects or knows that you re his father she paused not wanting to think of the possibilities i need to know so i can prepare him so you need to know interesting he said in a cold voice you know the feeling then she sighed i cantgo back and change things she said with sorrow he continued so you know that too what done is done we need to focus on nathan here if he knows something you must tell me she said looking him in the eyes to show her concern you should have told me he said between gritted teeth i had the right to know you had but you were also arrested and awaiting trial you had too much going on in your life already and i knew you wouldnttake it lightly she said of course i wouldnthave taken it lightly he roared it doesntmatter now she said back nathan is eleven there is nothing you can change about it so let focus on what to do now and forget what happened then forget forget he invaded her personal space in one long step and hermione knew she had phrased herself poorly i dontforget he said in a dangerous voice and stared at her a while longer before spinning on his heel and leaving her there alone she sighed closing her eyes this man her son father had much in common with nathan but he was a man not a boy she had to remember that she was not dealing with her boy but with a very very complicated man the next day her last at hogwarts for this first weekend she was to work in the dungeons her son had asked to join her and she d let him hermione would try to get the answers she needed she would learn what nathan knew she just had to nathan had gone back to gryffindor tower to fetch his equipment for handling the ingredients they would prepare today and she waited for him at the top of the stairs that connected the entrance hall and hogwarts sub levels that was where remus lupin approached her hermione he greeted she smiled remus i wanted to talk to you do you have a minute i supposed to be heading to the dungeons to start working on my project she stated i only waiting for nathan he insisted on helping it concerns him remus informed her his tone serious and his eyes on hers to emphasize his words hermione narrowed her eyes in a questioning way what about him he silently observed her for a moment which she thought was unusual behavior for him i dontthink you ll want to discuss the matter in such a public place she looked at him with a mixture of concern and curiosity is he in trouble again he sighed hermione i really dontthink it a matter to be discussed in the halls we can talk more freely in my office he suggested mum she heard her son call and looked his way she hadntnotice his approach i have everything with me gloves and all and it kind of heavy are you going to take long she looked at lupin catching a glimpse of the surprise that nathan quiet approach had caused in him too we can talk some other time he offered with a smile have a nice day he said adding a small nod of goodbye to both of them and left for the stairs leading up where are we going to work nathan asked drawing her attention back to him professor snape lab really she could feel the excitement in her son voice while they walked the dungeon halls but the enthusiasm was gone with his following words is he going to be there she looked at him trying not to show the significance the change in his tone had to her i dontknow why nathan shrugged dismissively no reason but i d like if it will just be the two of us like when we worked at home she couldntdecide if there was more to what she was hearing and observing of her son but they soon reached their first destination professor snape office the door was ajar conveniently still avoiding me hermione thought rolling her eyes upon finding there was no one inside she crossed the room and went directly to the shelves that she knew obscured the door to the lab with nathan just behind her the room was how she d left it the day before but for some phials containing a yellowish liquid resting where only empty ones had been giving away the fact that severus had worked there after she d gone it ll be easier to work here than home look at all the different knives nathan said examining the utensils stay away from the knives please she cautioned him and dontgo touching everything she added with a glare when she saw he had his hand halfway to the utensils on one of the shelves he withdrew his hands to his back and wandlessly levitated what he had been about to touch she shook her head failing to hide the easy smile lingering on her lips put that back nathan she chastised and look for some pestles they worked together talking first of the things they were doing and then commenting on the preparation of the ingredients they were discussing the influence of the size of a chopped root on the final properties of a potion i ve read in the text book mum nathan was arguing his point that the pieces must be smaller than a square inch only if the medium is basic and not acid nathan you cantrely only on books i telling you if you have pieces bigger than a square inch even if in a medium acid like this one you ll have a change in consistency and consequently in the properties of the final potion she lectured you re just saying that because you like things chopped small i ll do as you say but it unfounded he continued to disagree what did professor snape say she asked then nathan stopped the rhythmic movement of his hands for a bit but resumed his work saying i not sure you re not sure she said in an inquisitorial tone how that you re not sure i nathan stumbled at a loss of words she stopped her own task to place her full attention on him waiting for an explanation i cantremember what he said on that specific matter he managed she narrowed her eyes why are you lying to me she knew her son too well to fall for that i not lying he countered still chopping the root but he lacked the feverous tone she knew would be there if she was being unjust with her accusation when will you give up trying to fool me nathan he didntsay anything what arentyou telling me she insisted nathan sighed i wasntpaying attention to the class he admitted i thought you liked professor snape class i like potions he corrected her but i never said i liked professor snape she sighed then what happened in those detentions that made you change your opinion like this i never changed my opinion he answered donttry to fool me you told me on your letters that he was your favorite teacher what happened he found out i have no father he stated she took a shaky breath finally she thought and how does that change anything she pressed because people always change around me when they find out he closed his eyes stilling his hands i tired of it she let go of the utensil she d been working with and reached a hand to touch her son shoulder but he jerked away from her nathan i tired of making a clown of myself every time i asked about my father why are you doing this to me there was pain in his eyes when he looked at her why cantyou tell me you know that i ll tell you when i can and that you ll be the first to know she tried to reach a hand to him again without success you re lying so many know already and you didnttell me he protested raising his voice i not lying nobody knows she attempt to explain but was cut off mid sentence liar nathan scolded you re a liar even professor snape knows her eyes widened nathan was aware that severus knew i knew it he exclaimed and she realized that her reaction had betrayed her professor snape of all people knows who my father is what did he tell you her voice was weak she saw him thinking on how to answer and only realized she d been holding her breath when she exhaled after hearing his next words nothing nobody says anything his voice was stained with disappointment she wanted to reach out for him but she knew he wouldntlet her hold him right now how come he knows and i don t try to understand nathan we ve discussed this so many times i canttell you yet you why not he cut her explanation i can handle the truth mum i wontbe upset if he in azkaban or something i just want to know his name he pleaded she closed her eyes i canttell you yet she heard his growl of frustration it not fair he heatedly protested i the one who has to listen to snape dry remarks i the one who has to undergo my friends pity and you could end all of this but you won t tell me he raged and left the room at a run she knew he was crying hermione made to follow him but was stopped by severus snape hand on her arm and his quiet voice saying let him go release me she commanded shaking her arm trying to break free from his grip i need to go after him his fingers tightened around her upper arm she glared at him it your entire fault you destroyed everything i ve built i prepared him for your nastiness unfairness stubbornness and even so you found a way to make him hate you i hope you re satisfied she ranted finished he asked arching an eyebrow she narrowed her eyes bastard she was preparing another round of accusations but he spoke before they left her mouth your secret is still safe but not for long if i let you go after him his eyes were on hers and i dontthink that what you want for the little i ve heard of your conversation she sighed and felt his hand slowly withdraw from her arm why didntyou tell me he had realized you knew something she sighed i would have been able to dissuade him and things wouldnthave come to this he was fascinated by you to the point that i had to ask him to talk about something else what did you do to him in those detentions he he hates you enough to neglect what you say in class that quite an achievement you should be proud she said sarcastically and you say that as if it was a bad thing he countered she looked at him in disbelief do you want him to hate you you re saying that you really want your son to hate you you cantbe serious i thought you were happy with his fatherless status he said who would want a murderer bastard as a father he better off without me what are you talking about nathan worshiped you until you screwed everything up with whatever you said and did during those detentions he would be delighted to know you re his father he mock chuckled dontmake me laugh granger you filled his head with fantastic stories of how honorable and good i was of course he would change his mind after finding out the truth of who i really am he is not stupid the truth of who you really are severus do you still believe you re beyond redemption after all you ve done for the wizarding world she shook her head you ll never understand why i decided to keep him you re as stubborn as your son now if you excuse me i going after nathan she said and left his office kevin sat near one of the shelves in the library where he was working on his history essay with andy help he struggled with dates and names until he gave up trying to find the right goblin who had leaded that specific revolt he closed his book and looked up to andy i wish nathan were here to help us me too what do you think he doing in the dungeons with his mother preparing ingredients andy asked maybe perhaps he wouldntmind if we went there to see i dontknow andy answered hesitating what if snape is there too good point kevin agreed and opened his book again with a sigh do you think snape really knows who nathan father is i hope so it just too sad not knowing the name of your own father i wish we could help him find out if snape knows maybe we could investigate him and try to find out something kevin suggested i dontknow but it worth trying nathan deserves to know who his father is even if all we can find out is a name andy said we should work on a plan then when he comes back we can tell him our ideas sure these goblin revolts are too boring anyway andy agreed and they started working on plans to find out the identity of nathan father what they hadntnoticed was the blond slytherin with a smug smile standing behind the shelf by where they sat a n first of all i really sorry it took me so long to put this

confirmation what a mess of information chapter 16 search for information hermione walked through hogwarts halls with mixed emotions she wanted to find nathan and comfort him but she also wanted to go back to the potions master office and hit him hard for causing all of this if he had told her when she d asked what had been going on between nathan and him she would have been prepared for nathan outburst and she wouldnthave to be searching the castle for her son right now nathan words of accusation came back to her mind liar yes she was a liar but not in the way nathan thought nobody knew of her most guarded secret until severus found out how did this happen anyway she d been so focused on finding out what her son knew that she hadntstop to think about severus side of this story but now she was too worried about her son and too angry with severus to think straight hermione had been walking for half an hour by the time she turned a corner and finally found him there he was shoulders leaning on the wall framing a big window that revealed the thin snow showering the grounds and the lake her heart hurt seeing the lost look in his unseeing eyes eyes that were spilling silent tears the landscape beyond the window wasntthe only thing nathan wasntaware of she didntthink he d even noticed her presence in the quiet hall yet nathan she called in a low voice not wanting to startle him he didntlook her way but raised a hand to his face trying to wipe away the evidence of his crying she went to him i ve been looking for you she said no answer she sighed it breaks my heart to see you like this i dontwant you hurting i never did his eyes were still focused somewhere outside unseeing she wasntgetting through to him every time we argue about your father it only hurts more i know it frustrating for you but i canttell you the truth just yet and you have to trust me that i will as soon as i can i could lie to you say things about your father that werenttrue just to make you happy is that what you want lies because i canttell you what you want to hear and being mad at me wonthelp either i dontlike this situation any better than you she saw a new tear run down her son cheek dontcry anymore she said then her voice stained with sorrow for their predicament she reached for his face to wipe the tear away biting her lower lip to try to stave off her own tears he closed his eyes in an effort to hide his emotions she wrapped her arms around him i sorry nathan i so sorry she whispered stirring his hair with her spoken words of regret he didnthug her back though she closed her eyes and hugged him tighter trying to express with the gesture what she couldntsay with words hermione just held nathan resting her cheek on his head she felt him trying to move away after a while and released him from the hug he hadntsaid a word yet and he wasntfacing her either nathan she called softly trying to make him look at her and talk he did look at her then but no words were forthcoming his red rimmed eyes were focused on hers now and although his expression was frighteningly blank those black eyes were overflowing with anger and frustration nathan dontshut me up it hurts when you donttalk to me you re all i have you re my life she pleaded tell me his name he said quietly and steadily she bit her lower lip again keeping severus name from slipping from the tip of her tongue a tear rolled from one of her eyes not yet then donteven bother talking to me until you decide otherwise and with that he left her by the window and moved quickly away more tears stained her face and she closed her eyes and let them fall freely she regretted the position she was taking but she couldnttell nathan that severus snape was his father without knowing what his intentions were towards their son if severus didntcare for him she didntthink nathan could handle a father who was so close but yet so far she wouldntallow this to happen her heart ached but she couldn t it would be too disappointing she tried to calm down observing the snowy grounds the tears subsided but not her worries hermione had no idea what was on severus mind even less what was in his heart how did he feel about nathan anyway she wracked her brain recalling every word he d told her since he d looked for her last week they were annoyingly ambiguous at their first meeting he d been looking for answers he d seemed disgusted with the thought of her keeping his child and it was clear that for him nathan was the result of a barbarian act to him nathan could be not more than a reminder of that the materialization of his sins she sighed at the conclusions she was getting oh how wrong he is and then there was what she d heard today he was trying to keep nathan away from him because he thought himself unworthy he thought nathan was better off without him was he worried about what kind of father he would be does he care then he does she assured herself she knew it in her heart that severus was a good man and that in his messed up distorted way he wanted the best for nathan didnthe she sighed she wasntgetting anywhere she needed time to think before acting hermione collected her thoughts and walked back to the dungeons she would clean up the lab and would leave hogwarts a week would be enough time to come up with a solution for this so she hoped nathan sat resting his back on a pillow cushioning the head of his bed holding an open book on his lap he was trying to take his mind off the argument he had with his mother he couldntremember the last time he had been this hard on her but he was really tired and too angry to accept her excuses yet again no he wouldnttake any more excuses he had the right to know it was his father name they were keeping from him and nonetheless he felt his heart was clenched so tight that his chest was hurting he knew his mother was suffering because of his actions he d done this before back on one of his birthdays the image of her crying was threatening to bring new tears to his own eyes he quickly blinked them away and returned his attention to the words written in the book he read a paragraph and his mind wandered once again he sighed and closed the book annoyed oh there you are said kevin entering the dormitory with andy close behind we ve been looking for you guess what i have a plan to find out what snape knows about your father he revealed excited waiting anxiously for nathan reaction nathan just arched an eyebrow in askance it a brilliant idea nathan andy joined kevin all we have to do is confront him as your mother or one of the other teachers kevin told him with a little help of a polyjuice potion nathan sighed and shook his head at that thanks for trying to help me guys but this idea is insane why andy asked confused with his friend response do you know how hard it is to brew the polyjuice potion my mother was in her second year when she did it we re just first years besides i dontthink professor snape would fall for that nathan explained well we thought you could brew the polyjuice potion you re good in potions kevin argued the disappointment showing in his voice i sorry kevin i know you re just trying to help me and i appreciate it but i dontthink fooling professor snape is that easy then we cantuse my idea either andy said sighing heavily and sitting on the foot of nathan bed your idea wouldntwork even if professor snape was a first year andy kevin said seeming annoyed with his planning partner i sure peeves could take the information from him it was a good plan andy retorted hotly nathan smiled at his two best friends they were really trying to help him with this thank you andy but i think kevin is right not even voldemort could take information out of professor snape he was a spy remember we could interrogate him but we wouldntget any information out of him not even with peeves torturing him he pointed out although the image of peeves torturing professor snape was amusing even though it would be funny to watch he admitted smirking both of his friends laughed at the image when they d sobered from the laughter of the various images they d conjured of peeves torturing snape kevin sat on the bed facing nathan s what do we do then all of our ideas involved fooling or forcing snape to talk but with his spy background he trailed off why dontwe spy on him andy suggested do you think snape would go around talking about it we would only find out useless information about his boring life kevin refuted but something crossed nathan mind with that idea wait a minute he said that a great idea we can investigate professor snape life and find out something some information we could use in exchange for my father name the other boys could almost see the possibilities running through nathan brain shining in his eyes kevin was surprised with nathan idea bribery he asked in disbelief i would call it the slytherin way of achieving information he used the fact that i dontknow my father against me first so let say he brought it on himself nathan pointed out we just have to find out something he really doesntwant people to know nathan added reclining against the head of his bed again contemplating the possibilities with a smirk nathan you scare me sometimes said andy looking at nathan as if seeing him for the first time are you sure it a good idea kevin asked eyeing nathan with doubt it perfect nathan assured them all we have to do is investigate professor snape past we can start in the library and then we can ask the other teachers he been teaching here for ages they must know something we can use he paused observing his friends reactions if you still want to help me that is he added of course we ll help you it just kevin wasnttotally convinced of nathan idea nathan kept talking about the possible ways to get information on professor snape and he finally ended up convincing his two best friends they outlined plans for the rest of the afternoon and by dinner time nathan mood had improved enough to make him actually want to eat something arriving at the great hall nathan instinctively searched the head table for his mother but she wasntthere she must have gone home already he thought with a sigh nathan wasntthe only one to notice hermione absence at dinner remus lupin approached the headmistress and asked isnthermione coming for dinner i afraid not she had to go back to london for some work apparently minerva answered remus nodded and took his usual seat hermione had left hogwarts without looking for him as he d asked he mused on the reasons why she might have avoided the meeting he knew the paternity of nathan was a delicate issue for her he was almost certain that she d never revealed the man identity to anyone not even harry or ron he looked along the table and found the potions master eating his meal quietly should he confront severus would he admit the truth he d never said he had a son or revealed he had had a relationship with hermione but severus wasntone to go spreading his personal life to the seven seas remus didntknow what to do in fact he wasntone hundred percent sure of his suspicions what if he was wrong and nathan wasntseverus son he searched the gryffindor table then nathan was eating and talking with his inseparable friends he observed the boy for a while lupin was almost sure almost the similarities between nathan and severus were many mostly behavioral but there were also physical ones black hair black eyes lean body they were characteristics of nathan father for none were hermione s and severus fitted well for all of them nathan lifted an eyebrow at that moment there lupin thought it like watching the eleven year old snape all over again he sighed and turned his attention back to his meal it would be better if he talked with hermione first to be sure she would be at hogwarts next weekend but then he remembered the lunar calendar remus wouldntbe at hogwarts next weekend it was the full moon he looked at severus again contemplating and decided he needed to be sure before confronting the sour man nathan was surrounded by gryffindors when a group of slytherins lead by one very blond first year approached close behind him in the halls it would have been an everyday occurrence if devon malfoy hadntchosen that moment to open his mouth professor flitwick must be wondering where granger learned that little trick he so expertly showed us today in class what do you say granger malfoy asked loud enough for everyone to hear nathan ignored him so no other gryffindor gave malfoy any attention either that would be something my father would have taught me did your father teach you that spell granger malfoy continued nathan kept walking pretending not to listen what the slytherin was saying until oh no wait a minute i forgot that you dont have a father nathan eyes widened and he stopped in his tracks the group of gryffindors walking with him stopped too he turned to face the smug slytherin and glared at him i have a father nathan said tightly devon smirked of course you have you just dontknow who he is nathan didnthave an answer for that besides shut up malfoy why i wasntsupposed to tell i didntthink it was a secret your friends were discussing it freely in the library the other day the slytherin said with a mocking innocent expression nathan was shocked he looked at the two friends who malfoy was certainly referring to with disbelief those listening to the interaction were looking at nathan speculatively and he could feel their eyes on him well it was a very good wand trick anyway see you in defense if not earlier devon said and moved ahead along the corridor followed by the group of slytherins who also looked at nathan but with malice the gryffindors lacked i cantbelieve you nathan hissed at his supposed two best friends before striding away friday evening severus was finishing some potions for the hospital wing when the hidden door connecting his laboratory and office opened for hermione granger for a moment she seemed unaware of his presence in the room i wasntexpecting you today miss granger he said startling her as intended good evening severus she answered but said nothing else he observed as hermione approached one of the ingredient cabinets with a parchment in hand she browsed its content and made notations on the parchment he went back to stirring the bubbling cauldron in front of him but glanced from time to time at the woman sharing the room with him time passed in silence and she seemed to be rechecking whatever list she had in her hands now he was pretending to read a journal while waiting for the draught he d brewed to cool enough to be bottled you were right about nathan she broke the silence and severus was the one startled this time i shouldnthave gone after him that day he looked up from the journal to observe her openly she seemed deep in thought and there was something different about her he d seen her on a few occasions in the last months but he couldntremember ever seeing her this lost her words and a memory of their last argument crossed his mind did she reveal the truth to the boy he not talking with me he avoided me all afternoon he did this once before on his eighth birthday but this time it different she toyed with the parchment in her hands her eyes fixed on it this only confirmed his suspicions but nathan hadntbeen any different around him this week he saw her take a deep breath i want to tell him severus she stated and raised her eyes to look at him i want to tell him you re his father and end this once and for all i dontknow if i can meet him for breakfast tomorrow and have him ignore me again you ll do no such thing he said he was relieved she hadnttold the boy yet he added mentally he wontgive up until he gets what he wants she argued urgency in her voice i wanted to wait until you came to terms with it but i dontthink i can nathan is my life severus he my everything when he looks at me the way he did today it hurts too much you wonttell him he said he was starting to feel uneasy in the face of her obvious despair i telling him she affirmed he ll hate you severus stated blatantly and silence fell in the room he could see in her expression the possibilities running through her head go ahead and tell him that i his father but he ll never forgive you you ll make his life a living hell his friends will treat him with indifference he ll never talk to you again you re wrong she retorted holding her chin high he ll be happy to know you re his father he admires you you ll get to know each other better and you ll learn to love each other he snorted you ve lost your mind granger i dontlike him i dontwant to get to know him better he annoys me he said knowing in his heart it wasnttrue if you tell him i ll deny it if you insist you wontlike what i ll do he threatened walking closer to her until he loomed over her intimidatingly you re bluffing she defied i know you re just saying that i ve seen you with draco i know who you really are severus you wouldnthurt your own son if you re so sure then try me he said arching an eyebrow their eyes locked and they fought a silent battle one which was won by him when she turned away abruptly and growled in frustration he was relieved after malfoy declaration last week nathan had been questioned by all gryffindor first years and some hufflepuffs and ravenclaws too every student that looked for him with indiscrete questions or even worse pity added to his indignation over his mother position giving him strength to withstand his tantrum he would not talk with her until she had a name to tell him she had looked for him when she arrived for the weekend on friday and he bravely ignored her turning his back to her and walking away he was glad she hadntshown up for the evening meal that day or for breakfast the day after he was still angry with her but resisting her pleading tone and sad face was very hard nathan had forgiven his best friends though after that first encounter in the halls with malfoy he d shut the boys out for a while but then had forgiven them for they proved they didntknow the blond boy had been listening to their conversation nathan believed them he knew now that it had been a slytherin move of malfoy and nathan was only left to lament the consequences of that move but this week things had been different less and less students looked at him weirdly and their plans to get information on professor snape past were being applied his friends and he had been spending most of their free time on the task that was why he was currently standing in front of professor lupin office he took a deep breath collecting his thoughts and knocked nathan lupin acknowledged answering the door hello professor do you have a minute nathan asked yes i do the professor answered frowning slightly he stepped back and motioned for nathan to follow him inside closing the door is there something wrong no not really nathan hurried to answer i just want to talk about professor snape sir lupin stiffened a bit talking with nathan about snape was not something he looked forward to especially now that he suspected their blood connection take a seat nathan nathan took the indicated chair tea lupin offered and nathan nodded lupin took the tea set and placed it on the table he warmed the water with a charm and added the tea bags sugar milk sugar nathan took the cup thank you sir lupin with a cup for himself in hand took the seat across from his student professor snape he stated with a sigh looking tired and older than his age nathan took a sip of his tea i know you ve explained before sir but i wanted to understand why professor snape acts the way he does why severus acts the way he does lupin murmured to himself sighing again nathan professor snape has been through a lot in his life he began a war can affect people in many ways i dontknow what your mother told you about what happened back then but the war was particularly hard on professor snape i presume you know he was a spy lupin said and nathan nodded very well to be convincing as a death eater he had to play a flawless role and he did just that his interpretation was so good and he played the role for so many years that it became part of who he is i know that it not easy to agree with the way professor snape acts most of the time but i want you to know that it has nothing to do with you or anyone else specifically do you understand what i mean lupin asked yes sir nathan answered and they went quiet contemplating that for a while then breaking the silence again he asked do you think he regrets anything lupin put his empty cup on the table he may regret a great many things we all do nathan you see in a war there are decisions that must be made regardless of our feelings about them most of the time you have to put your personal opinions aside to favor the common good nathan rubbed his cup this was not what he d expected to hear and he went quiet again he didntknow what to ask next professor lupin watched nathan and interpreting his thoughtfulness he affirmed donttry to understand him too soon nathan professor snape is a very complicated man you ll understand his actions eventually i hope so nathan murmured nodding he finished his tea talking about less complex subjects and left professor lupin office knowing a little more about the mysterious professor snape but nothing of use to his plans nathan was walking down to the dungeons he had left his friends playing and studying in the common room after deciding he couldntignore his mother any longer that afternoon she had looked for him in the library asking him to talk to her again images of his mother sorrowful eyes and the sound of her pleading voice had invaded his mind constantly during the day he was almost at his destination now he was very close to professor snape office the only way to get to the man private laboratory he knew that his mother would be working there right now he knocked on the office door no answer he knocked again waiting when there was no answer after his third knock he opened the door slowly as he presumed there was no one in the room but he could see light coming from the laboratory hidden door left ajar nathan took a deep breath and entered it was time to talk with his mother again however when he was halfway from the door he heard hermione voice speaking conversationally she wasntalone he stood there for a moment contemplating whether he should go on or come back later when he heard the voice of the second person with her in the room professor lupin nathan frowned in confusion he didntknow his mother and professor lupin were close friends but there wasntanother reason for the presence of the defense instructor in a potions lab nathan moved towards the lab cautiously he could hear what the professor was saying now but i didntwant to look for him without speaking with you first hermione i dontunderstand remus you re not making any sense hermione watching nathan is like going back in time back to when i was a student here the resemblance between the two of them is very strong lupin insisted there was silence in the room ahead and nathan frowned in confusion what does professor lupin mean his musings were interrupted by the sound of his mother voice coming from the lab again remus i dontworry hermione i know this is a delicate issue for you if i not mistaken nathan doesntknow he heard lupin say no he doesn t his mother confirmed what about lupin said but nathan didnthear the rest of the question spying on your mother came a voice from behind startling him the conversation within the lab stopped and the door suddenly opened fully nathan saw his mother wide eyed looking from him to professor snape nathan she murmured looking stricken i was nathan tried to explain but was interrupted by professor snape you were inside my office listening behind the door to a conversation you were most definitely not invited to the voice of the potions master had an accusing tone it all right severus i dontthink nathan was eavesdropping on anyone conversation right professor lupin came to his rescue sort of i i was nathan locked eyes with his mother who still looked worried nathan she said quietly yes i was he admitted you were talking about me and i know exactly what you were talking about nathan held his mother gaze do the other teachers know too how many people will you tell before i finally allowed to know nathan was so focused on hermione that he missed snape sharp shift of attention which was now fixed on lupin nathan that not hermione tried to explain but nathan didntwant to listen i came here to talk to you because i thought you were telling the truth the other day you almost got me again with your sorrowful face and whiney voice mum but dontexpect me to forgive you after this nathan said ignoring the two professors he grimaced at his mother and hurriedly left the room only then hermione noticed there was another pair of black eyes fixed on her impassible and accusing severus remus noticed she began only to be interrupted once again i sure he did severus said and held her eyes a moment longer before addressing lupin what will you do with the information lupin severus i wonttell anyone else if that what you want to know i know you ve never said anything before and that you re very reserved about your personal life lupin assured the other man severus nodded he must not know i wasntplanning to tell him but i want to suggest that you do remus said looking from severus to hermione your opinion is neither requested nor welcome lupin this is between granger and i and i d appreciate if you would take care of your own business otherwise enough severus hermione surprised him with her strong reprimand remus is a friend i sure he will do what best for nathan he was just trying to help very well you know my position he told hermione and then turned to lupin i ll keep an eye on you lupin and with that he was gone in a flare of black robes dontworry lupin assured hermione who sighed i dontcare what your father does or doesntdo malfoy nathan stated they were in the middle of the entrance hall leaving from dinner devon malfoy was surrounded by slytherin first years and nathan had his friends with him too i was just talking with my friends here malfoy smirked and added i sorry if you re jealous because i have a father who likes me nathan closed his hands into fists trying to contain his rage he scowled at devon are you still looking for him or did you give up have you looked in azkaban devon asked making the slytherins laugh but that was only until nathan reply if my father is in azkaban malfoy yours should be keeping him company malfoy narrowed his eyes my father is not a criminal he said indignantly well that not what i ve heard maybe you dontknow your father all that well nathan said and didntwait for a reply he turned from the slytherin and went up the marble stairs with his friends you ll eat your words granger devon threatened none of them noticed the presence of professor snape in the shadowy corner behind the house points hourglasses then devon knows of nathan situation he mused frowning that wouldnthelp things in any way he sighed making his way to his office nathan was in the library it had been part of his routine since planning to investigate snape with his friends the other day they had been spending most of their free time on the task and nathan was running out of sources of information he and his friends had searched every book about recent wizarding history old school yearbooks genealogy and there was nothing of use against professor snape their attempts to persuade the other teachers to talk about the potions master were proving to be just as unsuccessful it seemed that nobody knew enough of the reserved man and those who did werentwilling to share malfoy had pointed out nathan lack of father at every opportunity nathan was ignoring the slytherin but he was also getting tired of it this only frustrated him more he closed another useless book and sighed heavily let take a break he suggested and the boys across the table leaned back on their chairs this is getting nowhere he admitted i agree said kevin what do we do then asked andy are we giving up nathan sighed we dontgive up andy we re gryffindors we just need another plan kevin said to the boy next to him and turning to the one across from him added isntit right nathan nathan didntanswer right away he was trying to figure out where their plan had failed yes that right we need another plan what are we missing he asked rhetorically who haventwe talked with i dontknow admitted andy i out of ideas to make the teachers talk unless we shamelessly ask what sordid secret you know about snape i dontknow how we ll make them talk okay then you take the headmistress and i ll take professor flitwick said kevin before andy could come out with his surely indignant retort to the choice of assigned teachers nathan blurted out the headmaster who kevin asked of course how could i ve forgotten him he must know all about professor snape and he must be willing to talk since he was killed by him nathan babbled lost in the

has a new source of information and hermione and severus have a lot to think about chapter 17 unanswered questions nathan sat in one of the armchairs in the headmistress office as part of his plan he d looked for professor mcgonagall pretending to be interested in applying for one of the positions as filch assistant so mr granger do you understand what it means to be a hogwarts assistant it no easy job the headmistress pointed out after a boring explanation of the assistant duties i do headmistress he answered dutifully wanting to know why it was taking so long for someone to call her out what is going on with kevin and andy he thought in apprehension and it was as if they had heard his thoughts headmistress a portrait of a chubby wizard called from behind her i think you should go to the dungeons is it peeves she asked resigned i afraid not it a bunch of those fireworks those colorful snakes the portrait told her and they re multiplying fast mcgonagall sighed mr granger i sorry but this will have to wait she said dismissing him oh i could wait here until you come back professor he said keeping his part of the plan on track if you dontmind that is she looked at him for a while deliberating his offer and then nodded i ll be back shortly nathan watched her go and as soon as she d closed the door he looked around at the many portraits hanging in the room and said urgently i need to speak with albus dumbledore oh what a brat spat a wizard with a large mustache and blue hat you re behind the fireworks arentyou nathan ignored that accusation and the others that followed and searched the wall for the wizard he d seen only in chocolate frog cards and old wizarding pictures i over here said a calm voice to his right mr granger isntit yes sir he answered and crossed the room to stand in front of albus dumbledore frame i wish to ask you about a wizard you used to know he said what you have to ask must be very important a fireworks attack is not a light diversion dumbledore said amused nathan fidgeted under the scrutiny of the portrait twinkling eyes i you knew professor snape very well didntyou sir he asked nervously yes i did albus answered slowly he well i know that why was it so hard just to say it he you know yes child he killed me dumbledore finished for him but only because he had no choice he added watching nathan intently there are situations in a war when some sacrifices must be made did you forgive him sir there was nothing to forgive dumbledore stroked his painted beard but you knew that already else you wouldntbe here what is it that you dont know nathan realized with those words that it would be much harder to get what he needed from this old wizard in the portrait than he thought he had hoped that the late headmaster would have regrets concerning snape and would be willing to share some sordid secrets from the potions master past he still thought it was worth the try and so he optioned for the direct approach since he didnthave much time before the headmistress would return he knows something of great importance to me but he wonttell me i thought that maybe you could help me nathan explained i need information i could use in exchange for what he knows something he wouldntwant the whole school to know that was it he was appealing to this wizard desire for revenge dumbledore observed nathan with even more interest now you re much more like your father than i imagined at first what you ask of me is for help in blackmailing professor snape not an everyday occurrence nathan eyes glittered after the first part of the portrait speech how am i more like my father sir dumbledore wouldntbe baited that easily but could see the opportunity that this conversation roused you re more willing to have what you want not concerning yourself with how you ll get it your father had it too and it was one of the traits i admired in him he paused but only when fighting for the right things nathan was hypnotized by the wizard in the canvas dumbledore had said more about his father than any other one person ever had were you friends i like to think we still are dumbledore answered with a light smile on his painted mouth but i thought you wanted to talk about professor snape he said arching an eyebrow nathan had completely lost his interest in the potions master he was now much more interested in what the great albus dumbledore had to say about his father no it fine i understand that you dontwant to talk about him sir he dismissed the old subject we can keep talking about my father if you prefer and you could start by telling his name he wanted to add dumbledore was amused i dontthink that would be possible but you might want to know that blackmailing professor snape wontget him to cooperate with you young one he might tell you who your father is if you gain his respect and friendship nathan frowned had he mentioned what information his potions professor was withholding he didntthink so how had the portrait known then i never told you what information i wanted from professor snape no you didn t nathan was even more confused how did you know then i know a great many things i know that basilisks are color blind that there are one thousand two hundred and seventy four flavors of bertie bott every flavor beans and that the headmistress hides lemon drops in the first drawer of her desk why dontyou take some while she not here dumbledore said winking mischievously and nodding his head in the general direction of the desk nathan frown deepened he glanced at the desk shook his head to organize his thoughts and looked back at the portrait before nathan could say anything dumbledore did too late he said and noises could be heard coming from the other side of the door gaining nathan attention you ll find the answer to your questions when you stop looking for them all you need is within you dumbledore added his eyes twinkling nathan blinked to the portrait in thought what does he mean he didnthave time to think or ask anything else though he went quickly back to the armchair he had been sitting in before the headmistress left and feigned boredom as if he d stayed in that position the whole time mcgonagall walked to her desk took her seat and sighed where were we mr granger she asked somewhat rhetorically ah yes the assistant duties well headmistress while you were out i had some time to think of everything you ve said and i believe i not ready for the responsibility of being a hogwarts assistant right now i appreciate your time ma am i know you re very busy her confusion showed in her face thank you ma am nathan added rising from his seat and quickly leaving the office when the door closed behind him his confusion was once again clearly visible on his face stop looking for the answers all he needs is within him what was that crazy portrait talking about and that was the famous albus dumbledore he thought not very helpful he descended the spiral staircase and as he walked back to gryffindor tower some of the other things he had learnt that afternoon came back into his mind i like my father nathan smiled he didntknow his father yet but now he knew more about him than ever before he fights for what he wants and so do i immersed in thoughts of the knowledge he d gained from dumbledore he entered the common room to meet his rule breaking friends who demanded a full recount of his conversation with the portrait so what you re saying is that he didntsay anything either kevin concluded after nathan was finished i not sure he might have said something useful in a cryptic way that was the most confusing conversation i have ever had and that saying something nathan confessed well you ll add it to the files right andy asked yes of course nathan assured him in fact i ll do that right now i dontwant to forget anything that portrait said absurd as it might have sounded nathan left the common room and went up the stairs to the dormitories he settled on his bed taking two rolls of parchment from his bookbag the first was the one andy had mentioned the snape files it was where nathan kept track of the information he thought relevant about the professor the second one which the others didntknow he kept was the one he called the dad files the second parchment had precious little information in the first column was a list of names entitled people who know to which nathan added albus dumbledore besides that it had only one other reference under a column clues professor lupin mentioned the days he was a student nathan had started taking notes about what he knew of his father after the conversation he had overheard between his mother and the defense teacher now he had more items to add the portrait of albus dumbledore had told him he had been friends with his father still is nathan added mentally he also knew that his father was a determined man who didntgive up on the things he wanted just like me he thought smiling he kept making notes of bits of his conversation with dumbledore and after re reading both parchments he realized he still didnthave what he needed to find out who his father was or to get the information from professor snape he sighed and lay down on his bed observing the red and gold pattern of his bed curtain nathan thought about the last thing the portrait had said trying to figure out what he meant by all you need is within you remus was deep in thought after what he had seen and heard that day last weekend in the dungeons he had gone there looking for a confirmation of his suspicions about nathan heritage and he had got said confirmation and much more he had watched nathan rage severus stubbornness and hermione helplessness and he had listened to her explanations and lamentations hermione had told him she had kept nathan a secret from severus and severus a secret from everyone else including nathan at that point remus had started to understand severus reactions to the boy and his actions that day in the dungeons but after having some time to think remus was now left with more questions than answers from time to time nathan secret father was a subject of discussion among the potters the weasleys and other members of the dormant order of the phoenix in the beginning when they had first discovered hermione pregnancy there was commotion from some and indignation from others when she had stated that the identity of the father was of no one business but her own the reactions were even stronger ron had demanded she tell them the name of the wizard who had done that to her minerva had asked hermione to confide in them but the calmest yet most worrisome reaction was that of harry the savior of the wizarding world had a cold look in his eyes a look that betrayed the power behind his young innocent features and it was something remus had seen only a few times and hoped to never see again hermione had been calmer than usual and had told them that nothing would change her mind more protests followed that statement but died when harry decided to speak he d approached hermione and said if you re so keen to protect him from us you better protect him well and then left the room with time everything had gone back to normal nathan was born harry was called to be his godfather and the identity of the father remained hidden well that wasnttrue remus knew severus was nathan father now and more unanswered questions floated in his mind why did hermione keep nathan from severus why did nobody know of their relationship back then or until now and now that severus knew why didntthey reveal the truth to nathan keeping it from harry and ron was understandable they had never liked snape but from nathan it could only be due to severus stubbornness because remus was certain that hermione would want to reveal her their secret to the boy he was sure that she knew of the admiration nathan held for severus or had held in the past since remus didntknow what the boy thought of the potions master anymore what he did know was the boy efforts to win severus praise had been tireless remus could remember the day he d found nathan upset in the dungeons for being dismissed without acknowledgement of his good work in the classroom but his observations of nathan since then had shown that things might have changed they spent a month of detentions together after all what had happened in those detentions he didntknow remus recalled their last talk about the stubborn man though nathan had looked for him in his office asking for an explanation of severus behavior why would nathan still want to understand severus anyway did the boy suspect something no he didn t not after what he had said to hermione that day it could only be the boy desire to win the praise of the most difficult teacher just like his mother when she had been a student he smiled with the memory but the smile soon became a sad longing expression he would never see the image of himself or tonks in any child remus entered the great hall by a side door greeted those already there and took his seat for lunch he ran his eyes over the four tables ahead taking more time to observe his gryffindors there was nothing unusual and it remained like that until most of the students had finished their meals it was then a movement of slytherin first years lead by devon malfoy could be seen approaching the main doors at the same time as a group of gryffindor first years nathan among them from where he was at the head table remus couldnthear what devon was saying but he heard the laugher of his companions another comment by devon was followed by more laughter and remus saw nathan turn to face the slytherin he was on his feet in a beat and he saw severus doing the same on his way to the growing circle of students that now surrounded the group he heard nathan furious demand take it back malfoy take it back by the time he actually reached the center of the confusion severus was already holding a furious nathan who had jumped to physically attack devon the slytherin held a hand up to shield his face eyes wild with surprise fear and disbelief it was clear that devon had never been attacked the muggle way mr granger this is unacceptable hissed severus ten points from gryffindor and a detention what about him wonthe be punished too nathan asked pointing at devon he started it he insulted my mum how can i be blamed i canthelp if she doesntknow who your father is devon retorted coming out of his shock to defend himself shut up malfoy nathan snapped enough hissed severus the man was still holding his son by the arm remus observed the scene suddenly lost for words how can severus watch this and not react not tell nathan he is his father he thought make yourself useful lupin barked severus ten points from slytherin and a detention devon he stated then looking pointedly at severus who narrowed his eyes now now the show is over go to your classes remus added to the crowd around them and they started to move mr granger in spite of what mr malfoy has said or done this muggle behavior will not be tolerated severus said looking directly into nathan shiny eyes the boy didntflinch or show any sign of acknowledgement remus wanted to smirk at the boy attitude even threatened physically severus still held the boy arm and verbally by the dreaded potions master he didntshow any sign of fear or resignation do you understand me severus asked again without averting his determined gaze from severus nathan answered yes sir can i go now severus released nathan arm not yet he answered mr malfoy the next time i see you engaging in a fight i wontneed a gryffindor to take points from slytherin is that clear but uncle sev devon started to argue only to be interrupted by his godfather it professor snape mr malfoy severus hissed and i asked you a direct question the blond boy lowered his head and murmured yes sir remus observed the frowning boy by severus side he hadntmissed devon slip of the tongue either devon be in my office at seven the boy nodded raising his hand to his jaw again do you need to see madam pomfrey no sir devon murmured when remus took his eyes from devon he saw nathan observing the blond boy with a smug expression in his face what professor snape said goes for you too nathan if i see you in a fight again gryffindor will lose more points than it lost today his words had the intended effect and the smirk was gone from nathan face i ll see you in my classroom at seven mr granger severus said turning to leave the great hall not turning back he added dontbe late remus saw nathan roll his eyes go to your classes he dismissed the boys and when he was sure they would indeed avoid one another remus left for the dungeons he knocked at the door to the potions master office but didntwait the answer he opened the door stepped in and closed it behind him and met the narrowed black eyes of the man across the room i dontunderstand how you can see nathan distress over this and do nothing he began merlin knows if i could have a child and it happened to be a son i would want him to be just like nathan i would be so proud that i would want the world to know he was mine and you are nathan father you have the right to say that wonderful boy is yours but you choose otherwise even knowing you re making his life more difficult because of this ridiculous decision severus expression didntchange throughout remus rant it was the same cold blank one he often used have you finished he asked lifting an eyebrow in annoyance i have a class in ten minutes remus sighed and shook his head i know you can see it severus i hope you can set your stubbornness aside in time he turned and left the office severus sighed as soon as the door closed what lupin didntunderstand was that this was best for nathan he didntneed to know severus was his father even with devon taunting him it was just a phase and nathan would soon forget all about it and see he didntneed a father enter severus answered the knock on the door of the potions classroom good evening sir nathan greeted closing the door behind him and walking to the front of the room cauldrons mr granger you know the procedure no magic i dontthink you will have any complaints after your muggle display earlier today snape was right nathan didntcomplain and went mutely to the cauldrons he started to scrub them and severus continued to work on the essays from time to time severus lifted his eyes from the pile of nonsense the third years insisted on writing to observe his son he could see nathan was really determined to finish his task as soon as possible good he thought he heard the boy shelve the first cleaned cauldron and looked up from the essays again the boy looked at him and they locked eyes while nathan walked back to the workbench where the second filthy cauldron of the evening awaited him not a word or a lifted eyebrow nothing although snape was interpreting this lack of interaction as a good thing he wouldntbe honest with himself if he said he didntmiss nathan pointed looks staring contests and witty answers ever present during the month of detentions they had shared his boy was a puzzle and this quiet down to business version of him was a piece snape hadntseen before nathan had been so close to finding out the truth when he had eavesdropped on lupin and hermione in his office last weekend what if he hadntarrived in time nathan would know he was his father and severus watched nathan work and contemplated what could have happen then like he d done so many times before what would nathan reaction have been his rational self insisted that the boy would have hated him even more than he did already but he couldntbe sure what if against all odds nathan no he couldnthope for that severus knew better than to think someone would willingly accept him as part of their life and then his thoughts betrayed him with the image of hermione granger she had somehow willingly accepted him in her life when she raised his son try as he might he couldntunderstand that besides she even thought nathan would accept him into his life too that he would even like to know he was his father she of all people knew what he was capable of and yet she kept saying things to encourage him to reveal himself to nathan to be part of his son life why now why not before when nathan was younger because she is aware of the danger you are he answered himself but if that was true why would she want to tell the boy now nathan was eleven living in a boarding school he wouldntneed his parents for much longer when he left hogwarts he would be a young man with his own life to build he wouldntneed a father anymore he concentrated on his task of marking essays again shoving those thoughts aside as he often did now not too long after that snape felt nathan eyes on him he didnttake his own eyes off the essays though some time passed and he felt those black eyes on him again but once more pretended he didntnotice he couldntignore the boy looks anymore though when nathan seemed more interested in observing him than cleaning the cauldron your task is the cauldron mr granger try to pay attention to it he said not taking his eyes from the parchment he was reading how did he do that nathan thought looking to the cauldron now i sure he didntlook up from whatever he marking not even once since i started the second cauldron nathan had always been impressed with professor snape awareness of his surroundings even though he knew of the man past as a spy nathan had thought he could use this detention to watch professor snape in a last hope to find something to add to his research of the man the more he knew about the potions master the more he was intrigued by him he continued cleaning the cauldron going through all the information he had gathered on the wizard up until now none of the sordid things he knew about professor snape past wasntcommon knowledge he frowned remembering what he d read the night before about the potions master role in the war most of it he knew already but some of the information had been new and not a pleasant surprise he d learned of the crimes professor snape had been accused of committing and although he knew his teacher had killed people he always believed it had been in self defense or on someone else orders like his mother had told him it was much like what his godfather and hero of the wizarding world had done but learning his professor had tortured and killed people of his own free will had been disturbing nathan didntfear the wizard sitting at the desk in the front of him but he mused on the reasons someone like him with so many skills and such intelligence would have felt the need to commit those crimes nathan didntrealize he d stopped scrubbing the cauldron until professor snape voice startled him from his thoughts i donthear you working mr granger nathan mechanically restarted his movements shoving those thoughts away for now he quickly finished his task and left the dungeons the library was quiet that evening it was close to curfew and few students were still working there mostly ravenclaws in a corridor between high shelves nathan stood distracted reading from a tome about star charts for his astronomy essay when the pale light coming from one of the lanterns was blocked by a shadow before he could react his arms were clasped by strong hands not even the noise of the book hitting the stone floor alarmed the others to his predicament the boys holding him didntgive him choice but he struggled to be released and reach for his wand anyway let me go i told you were messing with the wrong wizard granger malfoy said surging from behind his minions what do you want from me nathan asked still trying to break free i here to make you pay for what you did in the great hall devon answered folding back one sleeve of his robes nathan increased his efforts to free himself and you need two muscle mounts to help you the grip on his arms tightened i thought you were better than this he baited the slytherin but without success devon laughed did you think i would come for you unprepared i not a stupid gryffindor he approached nathan now you ll learn not to mess with a malfoy the punch hit nathan square in the jaw it stung but he didntutter a sound malfoy seemed disappointed with his lack of reaction to the aggression and hit him again harder this time the blow caught his face just below his left eye and a gasp left his mouth at the pain he now felt devon took nathan jaw in his hand and looked him in the eyes smirking i think you ve learned your lesson granger he released nathan face and started searching his captive robes when he found nathan wand he took it and said to his companions let the worm go nathan now wandless knew he didnthold a chance against the slytherins he just watched the boys walk away towards the door of the library and saw when malfoy dropped his wand turning to say in a sing song voice sleep well granger they left laughing nathan narrowed his eyes but it hurt to do that he took a hand to his face flinching from his own touch he could fell the swelling already he closed his eyes and sighed he would have a bruise nathan picked the book up from the ground and shelved it walked to where his wand was picked it up and went to the table where his things were he collected them and left the library he headed to the common room but then thought better of going inside he knew his face was bruised and he didntwant to deal with his friends right now he kept walking and before he realized where he was going he found himself staring out that big window on one of the higher floors focusing on the distant lights of hogsmeade he was still angry with what had happened in the library not because he had been beaten it hadntbeen the first time he d evoked the ire of someone had ended up in a fight and had gotten the worst of it he was angry because this would make his life even more unbearable than it was already malfoy would gloat over his triumph as part of his payback and his friends would pity him even more when they saw the bruise on his face when would this be over no he could deal with the stinging pain burning his face stronger than the pain was his feeling of helplessness and loneliness no one knew what it was like to receive strange looks from people you didnteven know how it was to have people like malfoy making snide remarks about your family every single day and do and say nothing in return how frustrating it was to try to finally do something about it only for it not to succeed suddenly it was hard to breathe past the lump forming in his throat and his vision of the shiny lights in the distant village blurred with what he knew were tears he closed his eyes and let them fall he felt so lonely he wanted his mother arms around him and thinking of her brought a new batch of tears to his eyes he missed her so much she was the only one who cared for him and if she was here now he wouldntgive a second thought to his tantrum and would hug her with all his strength but she wasntthere and he hugged himself instead whimpering entering the poorly lit hall was severus snape he d been surveying the school for students out after curfew and there one was the third tonight he quietly moved closer until he made out who the student was and halted his approach it was his son what was he doing out past curfew again he opened his mouth to snap at the boy and his insistence on breaking the school rules but his words were lost when he heard nathan snivels the boy was crying great he thought annoyed but in his heart he wanted to know what had made his boy cry thoughts of his own first year at hogwarts invaded his mind boys taunting him worry for his mother alone with his abusive father lack of friends days and nights of wandering the halls alone severus frowned biter feelings reaching his heart enjoying the view severus asked startling the boy it past curfew mr granger something i sure you know already nathan wiped his aching eyes and his running nose with the sleeve of his robe why is it always professor snape he thought you re becoming quite predictable mr granger tell me why are you up here sniveling he emphasized the last word when no answer was coming he demanded look at me nathan hesitated look at me mr granger severus repeated more annoyed nathan complied severus was taken aback by the purple bruise under his son left eye visible even in the weak light pulling out his wand he lit its tip with a murmured lumos and brought the bluish light closer to his son face taking his other hand to tilt the boy head higher he asked quietly who did this nathan pondered on whether to tell the truth or not professor snape wouldntpunish malfoy he d seen the closeness they had when his aggressor had addressed their professor much like nathan did harry and ron severus could see the indecision in nathan eyes he didntneed three chances to guess who had beaten him and the boy hesitation was unnerving is he afraid of malfoy now or is he afraid of me is he going to become shy and start sniveling again severus wouldntallow that i ve asked you a simple question who did this he said with more force in his voice it doesntmatter sir i donthave proof and you wontpunish him without it nathan said evenly you dontknow what i will or will not do boy severus spat annoyed it had never occurred to me that you were one of those few cowardly gryffindors he said watching his son eyes change in the light but then again they do show up from time to time he made a dismissive gesture and continued you re also sniveling around the castle quite often maybe the sorting hat had made its first mistake in centuries you should have been in hufflepuff i not a coward nathan strongly affirmed sir severus could see his son red rimmed eyes flash with the feelings his words invoked as intended gryffindors are so easy to bait he thought amused so tell me who did this to you and i ll give you the benefit of the doubt severus said arching an eyebrow you know quite well who did this sir and he had the help of two other slytherins this half declaration is not the best argument to contradict my suppositions mr granger but i think it all your courage allows nathan eyes were bright with anger under his wand light come with me he turned and nathan followed they walked in silence for a while until the boy spoke again this is not the way to my common room sir no it not when he heard his son intake of air to undoubtedly ask of their destination he elaborated i taking you to madam pomfrey she ll take care of this ugly bruise before i escort you to gryffindor nothing was said during the remainder of their walk to the hospital wing they entered the empty ward and severus said stay here and left to fetch the mediwitch she surged from a small door closing her dressing gown severus came just behind she asked nathan to sit on one of the beds oh dear boy she exclaimed when she saw nathan injury what happened nathan didntanswer and severus watched him intently madam pomfrey cast several spells on the boy to be sure that was the only wound and only when she seemed satisfied with her diagnoses did she bring out the healing salve i ll apply this to the wound and it will take from ten to fifteen minutes to absorb and do its job once done you wontfeel any pain and no bruise will be seen she explained and proceeded to rub the salve on nathan face nathan flinched with the first touch hissing his pain but didntprotest further severus stood at the mediwitch side observing the procedure she finished the application of the yellowish medicine and addressed the man will you be accompanying him to his common room severus snape nodded i ll retire then try to catch who did this to the boy she added aggravated and left the ward there was a heavy silence in the air nathan had his hands clasped in his lap his head down staring unseeing to the floor severus eyes never left his son and seeing him this down was making him uneasy let me see if the salve is absorbing severus said quietly nathan looked up his eyes still a little red from his crying earlier you shouldntcry in the halls where others can see you severus caught himself saying you dontwant people calling you a sniveling boy believe me he mumbled the word snivellus coming to mind in the voice of a marauder nathan stared at his professor confused severus felt awkward already for saying those few words of advice and didntlike the way the boy was looking at him he raised his voice and said let get going i have more important things to do than baby sit gryffindors he was in control again nathan frowned just for a moment professor snape had seemed almost nice but in another he was back to saying how much of a burden nathan was he stood from the bed and started walking to the door behind his professor the fire turned green calling hermione attention a head with messy raven hair appeared hermione are you home she stood from her desk where she was grading essays and stepped in front of the hearth into harry sight range i am harry can i step through or are you too busy no no come in hermione waited until her friend was fully in her living room how are you i fine just fine harry answered brushing ash from his dark blue robes they hugged what about you too much work i see he said pointing to the pile of papers on her desk end of term is always a busy time for teachers how are ginny and the kids hermione asked they re great the kids are all excited with christmas coming and that why i here we want you and nathan to spend christmas with us the whole weasley clan confirmed already remus and tonks should come too now to complete the family meeting it only you and nathan left harry said smiling hermione smiled sadly i dontknow if

that happen he asked confused we had a fight a bad one she said averting her eyes from the wizard in front of her was it about his father harry asked knowing the answer already hermione sighed yes she said simply and sat on the couch harry followed watching her intently i know what you re thinking but i canttell him yet i wish things werentthis complicated she murmured her eyes fixed on the crackling fire did you explain this to him yes she answered impatiently looking back at harry he cantunderstand it he called me a liar accused me of making his life a living hell and said he wouldnttalk to me until i had a name to tell him i just can t harry i ve waited this long and i want to make things right i cantput everything at risk after more than eleven years i know this is difficult for you that you must have good reasons to keep this a secret from all of us but you ve always said that you would reveal the truth once nathan was older why are you taking so long hermione he asked her i knew this would be a difficult year with nathan leaving for hogwarts and all i thought i would be ready to deal with this whole mess when the time came but the truth is that i not ready i thought i was but i not this is not how i imagined it would be harry i want to end this once and for all and i know nathan is ready but he not the only one involved i see harry said lowering his head i wish i could help but there is not much i can do not knowing the truth myself he pointed out hermione knew harry had never really forgiven her for keeping this from him but she knew better than to reveal the truth now harry and severus hadntgrown out of their hatred for one another and if she told harry that severus was nathan father she didntknow what he would do no as much as she wanted to tell him she couldnteither i sorry harry i ll tell you everything one day she apologized harry sighed what are you going to do about nathan do you want me to talk with him no i ll talk to him this

standing from the couch ginny will be trilled and so will lily hermione stood too harry sobered a little i have to go now but donthesitate in calling me okay i sure everything will be all right she assured him he nodded i know it will he hugged her again and went for the floo powder i ll see you in two weeks harry called out his destination and was soon gone in the green flames hermione sighed and went back to her pile of essays she still didntknow what to do with nathan or with severus god they were both so stubborn well she would talk to them again on the weekend and could only hope that they would listen this time severus strode into the laboratory resolute he knows i ve told him hermione stopped everything she d been doing and stared at him in surprise how did he take it he fine severus assured her you were right he was ready to know she released the breath she d been holding with a long sigh i told you he would like to know you were his father hermione bypassed the workbench to stand in front of him and took his hands in hers how do you feel about it he didntshy from her touch as much as i cantunderstand why you had him in the first place i glad you did i had him because he was your son i ve always thought of you as a great man severus i knew the world could use of an heir of yours and he was the result of your loyalty courage and hope in my future thank you for that and for giving me a chance to explain my reasons i respect them hermione the mention of her given name brought her eyes up from his hands she drowned in the intensity of his gaze and disentangled a hand to delicately brush back that stubborn strand of hair from his face he closed his eyes under her gentle touch hermione he whispered severus she answered in a whisper of her own and it was all she could say before his lips touched hers the kiss was tentative gentle and she thanked him for the arm supporting her now she melted in the sensations until the alarm clock brought her back from her dreams it was seven thirty and her real life demanded her to wake up and go to work she licked her dry lips and sighed for the loss of her dreamy severus of course it was another dream she thought she had had others and they were happening far too often for her own good she sighed again when she thought of the real severus every time they d talked they had argued would he ever see past what happened between them that night she hoped he would just like her dream severus had hermione knew they could have an almost friendly acquaintance they had worked well enough together during the war preparing everything for the final battle well enough until that night if things had been different if she hadntbeen captured and he hadnthad to save her what would have become of their relationship then would they had grown close and become friends she didntthink so as much as hermione thought they had a good rapport after he wasnther teacher anymore she couldntsee severus becoming friends with her without a fight the thought that followed made her smile she would have fought if it wasntfor her evident pregnancy that she had decided to keep from him trying not to add to his problems hermione would have kept in touch with severus whether he had been willing or not if only she had told him of nathan before what could have happened then would he have been easier to convince or would he have been just as stubborn as he was being now if only he could see past his stubbornness hermione was sure he could be a good father nathan would be much happier with him and so would i a light smile played in hermione mouth at the possibility of real kisses from a very real severus and she left her bed for a shower a n hey the chapter is over where is christmas i know i ve promised christmas

and poultrygeist thank you very much a n chapter eighteen hermione goes to hogwarts to make sure they ll have a happy christmas let see if she succeeds chapter 18 winter break all the cheerful christmas decorations in the castle were only adding to the potions master foul mood severus had slept poorly these past nights it seemed that as much as his conscious self was in control of his emotions while unconscious his mind worked of his own volition he d dreamed of things he didnteven know were still in his mind snapshots of his childhood his first years at hogwarts all haunting him in his sleep and all because of that night he found his boy crying in the halls severus sipped at his juice wondering one last time if there wasntanother way deciding there wasn t he left his seat and when he passed behind hermione s he stopped only long enough to say meet me in my office after you re done and resumed walking to a side door of the great hall hermione was taken by surprise at severus invitation and such a civil one at that she thought when compared to their last encounters her eyes went immediately to nathan he seemed normal or as normal as he d been ever since they had stopped talking to each other ignoring her and eating quietly eventually commenting on something he heard and never smiling or laughing she was waiting until the end of the meal to talk to him but now severus requested that time if it something about the lab she thought annoyed already well if it was something professional she wouldntmiss the opportunity to talk with him about more pressing issues severus was on her list of decisive talks for this weekend she was tired of waiting for him to come to his senses hermione knew there was more of her dreamy version in him than could readily be seen and she would make him show it she decided having finished with her dinner hermione left the great hall for her meeting making sure to pass by the gryffindor table good evening boys she greeted nathan friends who greeted her back she addressed her son who had his back to her i want to talk to you nathan i ll meet you outside the common room in one hour she was not asking be there she added to leave no doubt nathan nodded never turning to look at her and she left to meet the other party in this mess the walk between the great hall and severus office felt different somehow the students who crossed her path looked at her with an interest that wasntthere before it couldntbe the war hero thing there was something disapproving in their gazes what happened here during the week she mused but didnthave much time to think on it she was in front of severus office already she knocked enter good evening severus she greeted closing the door behind her what is it that you want to talk about she waited for a snide reply but it never came severus stood from his chair and proceeded to ward the office before sitting back by his desk nothing about the lab then she concluded are my dreams coming true has he finally considered what i said and understood what i did she could only hope you should talk to your son he began and the little hope she had of him finally coming to senses was gone with the word your he has not been himself since his situation gained the attention of the student body he informed her oh no she said aggravated sitting in one of the chairs in front of his desk i knew something had happened during this week the kids were looking at me differently she said the situation had grown to catastrophic proportions it had ceased to exist solely between the three of them and now it was public of course nathan was not himself he must be so sad she commented he became depressed for weeks when this happened at his old school and with all that has been going on she trailed off how did this happen i not sure he answered i think he told those friends of his and they let it slip typical gryffindors he mumbled most probably mr malfoy was around and the rest is history typical slytherin she mumbled he arched an eyebrow she wanted to smile at that but managed to maintain a serious expression and say may i assume that mr malfoy has been taunting him at every possible opportunity they were involved in a fist fight he revealed what nathan beat malfoy hermione asked surprised what make you believe that he wasntthe one beaten severus asked she looked at him speculatively i would assume that nathan is the more experienced in this kind of confrontation this is not the first fist fight he has got himself into severus she pointed out our son is not a saint and i know that he didntcorrect her phrasing that nathan was their son which pleased her i saw when he punched mr malfoy in the great hall although i missed when mr malfoy punched him back later that day i found him crying in the halls which he seems to have been doing quite frequently he pointed out i ve told him to stop but i think he needs to hear this from you he cares she realized he really cares hermione couldnttake his eyes off severus was she dreaming it nice of you to worry but why was he worried with nathan crying why was it so important to him she decided to ask and see if her dreams were really coming true but why worry over him crying in the halls of all things because this behavior is not tolerated among children his age and he will soon find himself the laugh of the school if someone other than me happens to find him sniveling in some corner hermione wondered at severus tone somehow it seemed that was more to it than he was telling her she persisted do you speak from experience as a teacher or as a student who went through the same thing children can be mean granger i hardly asked to be called snivellus did i he answered bitterly an awkward silence fell between them how could she have known that he d been through this too i sorry severus i didntknow your pity will hardly change that fact he interrupted her hermione fixed her brown eyes on him i dontpity you i never did severus held her gaze for a while then returned to the subject of their meeting i only here as a teacher to warn you of your son behavior it my duty to keep him from harm hermione was getting tired of his subtleties i can see he still only my son she said she knew that he cared her requested presence in this office and what had prompted it were evidence enough we both know you care for him so why pretend i thought we could spend an evening without arguing he said the meaning of his words not lost in hermione she sighed very well severus i wontinsist she said for now she added to herself if she had to wait a little longer she would but not too long hermione wouldntgive up he would see her reasons and everything would be like it was supposed to be the revelation that he was looking out for nathan was a good indicative that he wouldntresist forever she looked up at him intently staring at those obsidian eyes this moment wasnta creation of her mind he was the real severus the closest he had ever become to her dreamy version of him but still very real the thought of her dreams eventually coming true made her smile severus was uncomfortable with the way she was looking at him he could see her brain working and when she smiled it was too much he stood and walked to the door that was what i had to say if you dontmind i have work to do he said dismissing her hermione stood and walked to where he was by the door still smiling she turned to face him once more i hope this kind of discussion will become a constant from now on it so much easier when we talk instead of argue thank you for letting me know what has happened severus i ll talk to nathan her mouth slowly lost the soft smile as her eyes traveled over his face following the length of that stubborn strand of hair crossing his eye to the middle of his cheek before she knew what she was doing hermione had her hand level with his face as she reached to brush it back when she realized what she was about to do she fixed her eyes on his again seeing the confusion in them her hand touched his face in a feather light caress tucking the lock of hair behind his ear thank you for taking care of him for me severus she said placing a soft kiss where her hand had been just moments before and left the room severus stared at the door through which this mystery had just left her smile had been confusing her sincere brown eyes burning into his black ones had been unsettling but nothing compared to the gentlest of touches and the softness of her lips over his pale flesh how could she even touch him after all he had done to her what had prompted such an open display of affection could he call it that and towards him of all people he who had caused her so much pain didntdeserve it severus closed his eyes stunned he had called her to his office to ease his troubled mind to tell her to talk to the boy and stop him sniveling around the castle thus preventing nathan from a fate much like his own he had never thought she would that she could dreams were supposed to remain dreams in reality they would be just too complicated to deal with and hermione granger had jumped out of his dreams with her actions this evening bringing new thoughts to trouble his mind nathan stood waiting for his mother in front of the portrait of the fat lady who had decorated her canvas for the upcoming festive season he had been waiting this friday to talk to her and he was glad she had been the one to make the first move this would make things easier he hoped his thoughts of what he would say as soon as she arrived to meet him were interrupted by the chance to actually say them when hermione greeted him hello nathan hi mum and nothing else left his mouth not because he didntwant to talk to her but because he was the worst for apologizing let take a walk she suggested he nodded and they started walking after a couple of corridors passed through in silence hermione spoke again we need to work through our differences nathan you cantignore me forever and i wonttell you what you want to know just because you threaten to ignore me i know he admitted i was angry more silence followed that first exchange of words nathan broke it this time i sorry i called you a liar hermione sighed relieved it was really mean to say nathan it hurts to hear you calling me that when you know it not true she looked at him i never lied to you he stopped in the middle of the deserted corridor and his mother stopped too i know mum he hugged her really tightly i sorry i said that and that i yelled at you and that i ran from you she wrapped her arms tightly around him and he felt like everything would be all right again as if every problem he had was now solved because he had his mother with him placing soft kisses on the top of his head i missed you so much nathan she whispered i missed you too mum he answered i ll never do that again i missed you so so much he knew his voice was high and quivering with the effort to hold back tears and he knew she realized that i here now i with you she soothed stroking his back tears fell from his eyes and he felt her tears dampening his hair he held onto her until he felt calmer again when he was in his mother arms everything seemed better she brushed his hair back and placed a kiss on his forehead i know you ve been through a lot this week dontbe bothered about what other people say especially malfoy she said he was insulting you mum i couldntlisten to his voice anymore it was annoying me so much he said frowning at the remembrance i know he will annoy you even more if you show that you care punching people in the great hall is not going to make it stop only time will she explained but i cantlet him insult my family and just watch he said vexed you can go to the teachers professor lupin your head of house could help you breaking the rules and hurting another student will not i glad you re here he said and rested his head against her again his mother stroked his hair now there is no need to cry over it you shouldntlet these things get to you so much i know everyone feels like crying sometimes it only natural but crying in the halls can make things even more complicated for you act like you normally do and if you feel like crying or punching things do it in your bed using your pillow for a target she felt him nod his understanding after a moment as he undoubtedly took her words to heart there is only one more week until winter break and then you ll come home we ll spend all the time together she said to cheer him up and there is christmas harry invited us to spend it with him it ll be a lot of fun her smile was soothing and nathan found himself smiling back will the weasleys be there of course she answered him and i bet they ll have the most interesting games you lily and sirius will have a great time i sure they started walking again now that everything was all right they continued to talk about christmas and the end of the term and life was safe again now that he had his mother back hermione contemplated her weekend as she lay down in the comfort of her bed back in london she had gone to hogwarts to make sure their christmas would be good and she was happy with her accomplishments first on her list had been nathan he was always first on any of her lists it had been a pleasant surprise to meet him calmer and willing to solve their differences this time around she didntlike the idea of forcing him to see reason she liked him to make his own choices and decisions but this weekend she would have made him see whatever means she was obliged to have used to achieve her goal it was a good thing she didnthave to go too far her second mission severus had been just as successful what a pleasant surprise when she had entered his office to find that he cared for nathan more than pleasant if she thought of the bonus the end of that meeting brought she smiled with the remembrance his hair was just as soft as in her dreams his skin warm and pleasant to the touch she had been tempted to kiss him on more than just his cheek but the confusion in his eyes told her it wasntthe right time she had enjoyed it anyway sure enough severus had avoided her for the rest of the weekend meeting her during the meals and even then never exchanging more than one or two words of greeting and then only in return of hers what soothed her heart were the glances he sent her way every time he thought she wasntpaying attention hermione smiled at that content she was sure she had given him much to think about and she hoped he would come to the right conclusions but who knew what went through severus snape mind she could only hope if all progressed the way she wanted it was indeed only a question of time until her dreams came true all of them nathan and severus would grow closer their latter true identity revealed painlessly and severus would let her into his life and his heart just as he would nathan she hadntfelt this confident in her future since the day she found out she was a witch severus has never longed so much for a term to end since the days harry potter had been a student at hogwarts tomorrow he would be free from most of the students since a few insisted on spending the holidays in the castle to show how affected he d been by the events of this term he d almost been tempted to retreat to the solitude of his summer house but the ghosts of his past that lived there were worse than the company he d have at hogwarts his mind was tired acting as a spy once again was getting to him he had been keeping an eye on nathan and devon since the events of last week he hadntfound nathan crying anymore which was a good sign but he had witnessed devon taunting his boy several times since their last fist fight he hadntinterfered yet he felt the need to observe his son reactions to those taunts a little longer before putting an end to them he noticed that nathan wasntresponding to devon provocations anymore but it didntmean he has been unaffected by them severus was sure nathan was withdrawing into himself dealing with his frustrations alone in private he had done that himself many times in his youth and that was what concerned severus the most nathan shouldntfollow steps that resembled even a shadow of his own the idea of his son life path being similar to his was very disturbing he was keeping himself from the boy life to avoid that already and it wouldntdo for his efforts be thrown aside simply because of the taunts of another school boy he wouldnthave any of that severus sighed at the thought of having to interfere once again this time he couldntcount on hermione granger this time he would have to act directly and that was what he was lamenting he had examined his possibilities carefully infinite times by now and he was certain he had no other option as effective as the one currently in his mind resigned severus left the warmth of his bed and entered his living room searching the shelves that covered the big wall for the book he would need to go on with that bold plan here he thought when he found the book he d been looking for know the unseen revealing potions he took the tome with him to the desk and opened it scanning the index for a specific potion finding it he went through the list of required ingredients and the time it would take for it to be completed and was satisfied that he had just enough time to brew it before christmas severus read everything twice taking notes when he was content that he had everything planned for the brewing he stood from his desk and went back to his bed he dropped his tired body onto the mattress and closed his eyes going through his well practiced occlumency exercises to effectively clear his mind of all thoughts he had almost abandoned them since the dark lord had fallen for good but he d been searching them for the means to fight another of his new acquired troubles hermione granger she has been invading his dreams ever since last friday when she unexpectedly and unexplainably had touched and kissed him out of gratitude he added mentally even so it was more than enough to make him long for more gentle touches and many more kisses he inadvertently thought of how she would thank him for what he would be preparing as of tomorrow and annoyed restarted the exercise to clear his mind of the images conjured by his desires she wasntto be his not even in dreams and with a clear mind his breathing evened and he was at the mercy of unconscious thoughts by morning severus had a satisfied smile lingering in his thin lips while he slowly left his dreamy hermione and drifted to wakefulness the smile faded from his face and a groan escaped him as soon as he realized she had successfully invaded his dreams again annoyed and frustrated severus threw his bed covers away from him and entered his bathroom already disposing of his pajama shirt the cold shower was good to put his body at bay but only added to his foul mood that morning he had only one class today the last of the term and he was looking forward to the end of it leaving the shower he dried himself with a practiced spell dressed in his darkness and left for breakfast let the day begin so it can end already he thought he ate quietly successfully refraining from conversation with the others at the head table after some cross answers when minerva attempted to engage him in conversation that was until someone called him professor snape sir he looked down at the child interrupting his meal what is it mr malfoy father sent this to me and asked me to give it to you the boy said delivering a piece of parchment severus accepted it thank you mr malfoy he said dismissing devon who nodded and went back to finish his breakfast with the other slytherins severus opened the parchment dear severus my family and i request the honor of your presence this christmas gifts are not necessary just leave the dungeons this year and show up for a change there will not be many ministry officials only the beautiful female ones rest assured that i will show up and hex you on christmas eve or else hex myself should you not accept my invitation through devon yours draco malfoy now this he thought going through in his mind of all the things that could go wrong next to make his day even worse he sighed in defeat if draco was threatening to hex himself thus calling on the vow he had little choice in the matter severus yanked the quill from flitwick little hands ignored the wizard protests and wrote his answer below draco invitation fine he returned the quill to its annoyed owner and left his seat and his half eaten breakfast heading for the slytherin table send it back to your father mr malfoy he said giving the parchment back to devon are you coming for christmas unc yes i am severus cut devon before he had finished addressing him as uncle which annoyed him greatly devon smiled that great sir severus left the great hall resigned to his fate see you next term nathan andy called from where he d met with his parents at the platform see you andy nathan called back pushing the trolley to the exit of platform nine and three quarters back to muggle london with his mother by his side how was the trip from hogsmeade hermione asked tiring nathan answered i think it straight home then she asked placing a hand on his shoulder in a half hug definitely he answered they left king cross station in silence it could be that nathan was simply tired from the trip as he d said but even if he was tired there was something she didntlike about his silence she would be certain when they got home she thought they could use the underground as they always had but now that he was at hogwarts would you like me to apparate us home that would be good he agreed come here then she beckoned him into an obscured alley away from curious eyes hold on to me she instructed and a squeezing moment later they were standing in the living room of their flat thanks mum he said and relaxed visibly why dontyou take your things to your room while i ll prepare something to eat she suggested nathan nodded and went to his room hermione stared after him for a moment passed by the living room to light the fire in the hearth before going to the kitchen he not just tired from the trip she thought to herself it must be malfoy she concluded or severus she sighed at least he was home now away from them both she saw nathan shadow through the doorway when he crossed into the living room you have new books she heard him say and a smile crossed her features oh medieval wars she finished preparing the sandwiches and entered the living room nathan was curled up on the couch facing the hearth a book in his hand careful with that one it borrowed and i dontwant greasy stains on it she said handing him a plate with a sandwich nathan closed the book and placed it on the couch accepting the plate who is it borrowed from william she answered casually do you want some juice yes he accepted the filled glass who is william he asked then he works at the university with me she explained sitting beside him on the couch nathan ate half of his sandwich quietly and just as she drank from her glass he asked are you dating him she almost splashed juice all over herself she composed herself and retorted no i not dating him where did that question come from you re borrowing his books and trying to change the subject so nathan shrugged and went back to his lunch well i not dating him or anyone she insisted and if i was i wouldntbe avoiding the subject nathan arched an eyebrow mid bite and that was all the response she got would you mind if i had a a relationship she asked hesitantly nathan chewed calmly watching her intently do you like him that much hermione rolled her eyes i not talking of anyone specifically i not dating william who are you dating then i not dating anyone she said again annoyed forget i even asked you he drank the rest of his juice still looking at her from over the rim of the glass if you like him and he treats you well i dontmind he finally answered she looked at him waiting for the sarcastic observation she knew was to follow it never did though can i read his book nathan asked curling up again with said book in his hands go ahead she answered before leaving the room with the used dishes that was too easy she thought maybe her boy was growing up she looked at him from where she was in the kitchen and saw him totally lost in the book already she smiled quietly she re entered the room took the book she was reading from a side table and sat next to him like they used to do before he went to hogwarts she sighed contently she was engrossed in her reading when nathan broke her concentration by snuggling closer to her and resting his head on her lap she smiled and fondled his soft hair turning her attention back to the pages of the book again she missed these moments so much hermione was glad to be able to spend another holiday as they always had although her secret had been discovered by severus and others nathan was still oblivious she would make the best of it and work to have severus with them next year the potion was cooling and it was perfectly colorless the last stage of the brewing had been the most captious the charms although it was nothing compared to the spells he had to cast during the preparation of the wolfsbane severus was pleased nonetheless he still needed to add the liquid to the enchanted flasks and cast the proper linking spells before sending one to its new owner and severus would do that just before leaving for malfoy manor the extra time the potion would remain in the cauldron would guarantee that any residual magic would be released which was important to the success of the last step severus retreated to his chambers and took a quick shower to wash away the sticky feeling an afternoon of brewing always left after that he chose a set of black dress robes and went back to his lab taking two small flat round shaped phials he poured the liquid into them with a complex wave of his wand and some intoned words in an ancient language both flasks glowed gold and a tongue of light appeared between them creating a luminous connection the seven colors of the rainbow flashed through this tongue of light before it changed back to gold and disappeared the linking was done now all he had to do was add one of the phials to the thin silver frame that connected it to the silver chain adjusting it magically it was done and it was perfect he admired his work with smug satisfaction knowing that now he would have means to monitor the boy properly preventing him from sulking alone and unnoticed he took the chain and put it into the box on his desk closed it and attached the carefully written note he had prepared earlier to it severus summoned a house elf and instructed the magical creature to deliver his package to its destination then left hogwarts to apparate just outside malfoy manor he entered the elegantly decorated hall of the manor being received by none other than the host for the night draco malfoy ah severus snape the man saluted i glad you could come it not as if i had any choice severus mumbled and his night of social torment began severus tried to mingle without really interacting he wanted to be part of the background and he proved he was still good at it he would stay for as long as it took to distract draco and he knew it wouldnttake too much time with the rate his prot g was consuming his drinks time had passed standing in a corner of the room severus observed the party it was almost time to go back to hogwarts his eyes caught draco sitting on a couch near his wife pansy they had smug expressions on their faces draco was murmuring something into pansy ear he followed their line of sight and saw a group of children playing with some sort of magical device devon among them severus watched his godson assume the control of the game taking the magical device from a younger child hands who looked scared of the blond boy it was a repetition of what severus had witnessed so many times at hogwarts first with draco now with devon severus looked back to the couple on the couch and was aggravated by their indifference didntdraco see devon was becoming the same spoiled boy he once was and now said he so despised if it was nathan becoming a bully i wouldntjust watch he thought and wasntsurprised by it for once after a week of brewing that potion for the necklace he wasntabout to ignore the realization that he wanted the best for his son that included making devon stop taunting nathan severus aborted his plans to leave the party unnoticed and approached draco and pansy ah severus just the man we needed draco said watching him coming their way we were just trying to match every bachelor here who do you prefer the short blonde over there or that beautiful brunette in that corner severus saw pansy elbow her husband what draco asked his wife i not interested in your matchmaking abilities severus answered before pansy could berate her husband you seemed to have enjoyed lancy last summer i thought my matchmaking abilities were working for you severus rolled his eyes instead of distracting yourself with my love life you should spend more time watching your son what do you mean draco asked didntyou see what he just did to those children snape retorted what draco shifted his attention to the group of kids devon is just playing with them what wrong with that he really cantsee severus muttered devon is becoming the same spoiled brat you were pansy frowned and was about to say something to placate him when draco said devon is nothing like i was his tone was final i nothing like my father no you re not but that doesntmean you cantraise a spoiled child too the difference is that i donthave to sit and watch like i had to there is no dark lord draco frowned well it a lovely christmas party and i glad i could come thank you for your invitation severus said sarcastically turned his back to the malfoys and making for the door he had had enough of socializing for the rest of the year are you ready mum nathan was waiting by the hearth it was time to head for harry house where they would spend christmas harry had visited them earlier that week to ask them to also spend the night so they could enjoy christmas morning together harry was always so enthusiastic about what he called family reunions and hermione couldntsay no nathan was looking forward to christmas this year more than the previous the last time his mother had accepted one of harry invitations nathan had been eight now he was almost twelve and knew much more about the wizarding world than before it wouldntbe the same if they spent christmas with their muggle relatives who they only met at christmas anyway it wasntlike harry or ron who visited regularly or at least corresponded with them often did you take the extra sweater hermione asked entering the living room mum we went through this in the morning when we packed nathan answered impatient it was outside the bag she justified i took it can we go now hermione looked around once more as if checking to assure everything was like it was supposed to be yes nathan took some powder from a jar by the hearth threw it over the still warm burned wood and said number twelve grimmauld place he stepped into the green flames instantaneously feeling his surrounds swirl in a blur of colors some swirls later he fell in front of a lighten hearth unable to keep his balance if it wasntso quick he would never floo again he heard a voice call his name and then felt a hand on his arm helping him stand when he was positive he wasntdizzy anymore he opened his eyes to meet aunt ginny smiling face thanks aunt ginny dizzy she asked still holding his arm not anymore thanks he said not admitting how he really felt when he was steady enough to take in his surroundings all he could see was a red apron look how tall you are he was now being hugged by the red apron or rather by the woman wearing it hermione dear he is a handsome young man already you shouldntlet it go that long without visiting us they grow up too fast molly i agree hermione answered still brushing the ash from her clothes and nathan was glad that the weasley matriarch had released him to hug his mother instead how is my favorite godson doing harry asked placing an arm around nathan shoulders nathan smiled at his godfather i fine uncle harry harry stared at him for a while that good to hear harry finally said holding him closer for a brief moment now i hope you re ready to have some fun his smile was wider now of course i am are the twins here already harry finally smiled yes they are you will want to be careful with their candy if you dontwant parts of your body transfigured for a while his godfather warned winking nathan smirked i ll be careful with the candy just donttell what you ve just told me to my mother he said and stepped out of harry embrace i never said anything to ron either harry added feigning innocence nathan smirked again on his way to where the children were he didntescape other hugs the weasleys were very corporeal in their greeting the last to hug him were fred and george ah our new preferential customer one of them said how did the fireworks go the other one asked nathan looked around and saw his mother still engaged in conversation with ms weasley on the other side of the room they worked fine he answered in a low voice hi nathan a sweet voice greeted from behind him he turned and met the eyes of the grinning girl hi lily he greeted back i was waiting for you she told him and grabbed his hand pulling him to sit beside her on the couch nathan raised an eyebrow in askance he d known lily since well forever but they didntshare a friendship why was she waiting for him how is hogwarts she asked curious tell me all about it all about it there a lot to tell he tried to think what to say first well he started there are the houses and the classes her impatience didntallow him more time to articulate you re in gryffindor right what is it like it better than slytherin nathan didntknow what to make of her questions it was difficult to explain hogwarts to someone who had never experienced being a student there if you want to know about hogwarts you should read hogwarts a history their attention was taken from each other when one of the twins who seemed to be listening their conversation said no not you too hermione he called and when his mother looked their way the twin added why did you have to give him the book that shall not be named why nathan was startled when the other twin grabbed him by his upper arms dontlet the books consume you boy be strong i know you can do it he said dramatically nathan relaxed when he heard the laughter of those around them and especially when his mother said leave him alone fred go pester ron okay but we ll have a long talk later he said looking pointedly at nathan this must stop now you re still young and leaning in to get closer he added and we all know your real vocation to the arts of mischief fred winked smiling nathan smiled back the night progressed and more people arrived the house was full of joy and happiness there was music playing on the wireless mixed with the sound of laughter and animated conversation nathan had laughed at ron and hermione whom he lured into eating the enchanted candy hermione had laughed with nathan from the simple joy of finally seeing her son truly happy again it good to see him laughing so openly remus commented approaching her and you too hermione was still grinning as he smiled at her i glad you re working things out for him he added he having a good time i happy harry insisted on us accepting his invitation she answered you should change your hair to orange more often hermione it lights up your eyes tonks joined them placing her arms around her husband molly asked tonks started to say when an amplified voice invaded the room dinner is ready to tell you the dinner is ready tonks completed nonetheless the adjoining room had an immense table covered with food that filled the air with its scent stimulating the appetite there was room for everyone and dinner didntinhibit the good conversation they enjoyed the time and the good food and long after dessert had been served there was still movement in the house hermione yawned for the third time and decided to call it a night good night it very late and i sure the kids will be up very early in the morning to open their gifts murmurs and nods of agreement followed that statement she stood from the armchair and moved to where the kids were sleeping on the couches she was about to wake her son but watching the rise and fall of nathan chest she changed her mind and withdrew her wand to levitate him upstairs nathan was so worn out from the busy day that the only acknowledgement he showed was a mumbled protest when she placed him on his bed the night went by and christmas morning arrived nathan was wakened by sirius potter and his excitement over something nathan with his mind still clouded from sleep tried to figure out what was all the excitement about and remembered it was christmas morning it was gift time he sat up in bed and looked around the room sirius was at the foot of his bed opening a package and showing its content to lily it s what is it lily the card says it a remote control something muggle i sure coming from grandfather she answered it used to turn on and off the television it also changes the channel and controls the sound volume nathan said startling the brother and sister who had woken him up merry christmas nathan lily offered smiling there is a pile of gifts for you sirius pointed out let see what you got nathan left the bed and walked to its foot where the packages were he took a flat but big one first grandmother sweater sirius said giving little attention to the red knitted jumper with a detailed lion on its chest here open this one he offered a cubic box then nathan took it disentangled the bold and lifted the lid he peered inside and so did sirius what is it the younger boy asked a set of fireworks nathan answered it must be from your uncles he took the card and confirmed just that he continued opening the packages and was always very happy when it turned out to be a book much to the potters amazement the next package he opened was another book the fourth this time a quidditch one he didntneed to read the card to know who it was from uncle ron there was only one box left it was rectangular around two inches high nathan opened its lid and took the strange necklace in his hands watching it curiously nathan unfolded the letter he found in the same box dear nathan this necklace is an amulet with great protective powers to activate it you must hang it around your neck making sure the round glass containing the liquid touches your chest wear it at all times and i ll be with you when you most need me it my gift of protection happy christmas your father nathan read the signature and paled my father he thought incredulous my father he read again my father sent me a gift what a beautiful necklace lily exclaimed calling the attention of the others to his gift and him who this from she asked innocently having no idea what it meant to him it s he hesitated he didntknow how to say it it sounded so weird even in his head it from my father he finally said his voice showing the shock he felt he took the necklace and settled it around his neck as instructed when the glass holding the enchanted potion met the flesh of his chest it glowed a bright gold making lily take a step back its glow faded out and the liquid within it turned a vivid orange nathan grinned wow sirius exclaimed what is it for it a gift of protection nathan answered grinning even more severus sat by a wooden table sipping his morning coffee when the coin like glass object resting next to his plate of toast glowed gold nathan was activating it his son was wearing the necklace he looked fixedly at the amulet watching the golden light fade it wasntlong after the shine vanished that he observed the once colorless liquid acquire a vivid orange color his son was very happy he released a breath he didntknow he had been holding a n and that was christmas i hope you ve liked it 0 i have some people to

others helping molly in the kitchen christmas breakfast was always a lot of work even with dobby trying to make everything by himself nevertheless soon the food was spread across the large dinning table and the seats were filled one by one as the house woke up harry called to the kids from the bottom of the stairs of course they re awake they must be too engrossed in their gifts to remember breakfast harry said rejoining the others it didnttake long after harry sat at the table for the children to arrive in the dining room by then conversation filled the room and the christmas meal took its typical joy at length someone brought the subject of gifts up sirius was animatedly discoursing about his list of gifts and when it ended he said nathan got the coolest necklace is that it harry asked turning his attention to his godson can we see it he asked smiling nathan seemed unwilling to comply but slowly pulled at its chain bringing the round shaped glass outside his shirt it very beautiful nathan who it from harry asked then nathan took the now purple filled glass in his hand protectively he opened his mouth to say something but he never managed to articulate anything lily was faster it from his father she said preparing to bite her toast until the reactions that followed her revelation made her lower it back to the plate the chatter diminished instantaneously and died altogether the following moment leaving only an utter silence in the room eyes darted from nathan to hermione and stayed there she could see shock curiosity confusion and sympathy all directed at her all at that same instant she was as shocked curious and confused as them severus sent nathan a gift she blinked longer than usual turning her head to focus her eyes on nathan their eyes met when he looked her way is it possible hermione harry asked breaking the silence hermione didntregister his inquiry she was looking at nathan right hand gripping the pendant and holding it close to his heart why did he send him a gift she knew better than to believe it was for the joy of sending his son a christmas gift no there was more to it what is he playing at hermione harry called again she blinked and focused on him is it possible harry insisted harry green eyes were unreadable cold even and it made her uneasy hermione averted her eyes from his only to find others on her yes she answered and it was as if she had given a sign for them to start talking again and all at the same time her mind was growing even more confused with their questions and babbling adding to her own internal questions and babbling hermione rose abruptly from her seat not willing to take it anymore she bypassed the table and grabbed nathan by one arm making him rise from his seat too enough she growled and without further word she dragged nathan into the library and closed the door behind them hermione word wasntenough to bring silence to the occupants of the breakfast table nor was the sound of the library door closing with some force what finally brought order to the room was a single word from harry silence i know this is a surprise for us all but you already sent hermione away he said next dad what did i say wrong lily asked still a little startled with the consequences of her words nothing sweetheart you said nothing wrong then why you were so silent as if i had said something wrong she asked now more confused than fearful and why did aunt hermione take nathan away we are worried about nathan necklace harry answered but why if it a gift from his father she insisted harry eyes went colder ginny seeming to realize that took over answering her daughter questions have you ever seen nathan with his father ginny asked the girl appeared to be searching in her memory no she answered at length that because we dontknow him ginny completed her reasoning not even nathan sirius asked then ginny turned her attention to him not even nathan that sad lily observed lowering her head to look at her hands on her lap another silence followed do you know something we don t ron asked harry you re nathan godfather didntshe ever tell you who he is harry brushed his hair back no she didn t he answered i didnteven know she kept in touch with whoever he is what if the man only found them after nathan went to hogwarts arthur pointed out they lived in the muggle world until then dad has a point agreed fred she could have abandoned the wizarding world in search of protection she never explained why she didnttake that position at the ministry after the war george added nodding i ve offered protection harry said shaking his head in denial she knew it was safe to stay she chose the muggle world for another reason he was frowning in annoyance with the repeated suppositions and we ve discussed this already if what you re saying is right if she kept in touch with the man then why did he decide to show up only now ron asked who is this man i dontthink she planned any of this remus intervened she didntknow nathan father would send him the necklace harry looked at him suspiciously the way the werewolf had said that made harry believe remus knew more than he was letting on remus caught his eyes on him and didntsay or do anything that betrayed or denied harry suspicions which in itself was peculiar has something happen at hogwarts lately harry asked the defense professor something involving nathan or hermione harry continued to study remus who took some time before replying nathan and devon malfoy have been bickering at each other why harry insisted devon found out nathan doesntknow his father and he been taunting him ever since remus clarified and let me guess harry said in a tone of bitter irony snape didntdo anything to stop malfoy it not that simple we cantwatch the boys all the time remus explained visibly trying to defend the slytherin i ve warned him harry said ignoring remus explanation he canttreat nathan like he treated me i wontallow that and he been warned this is not about snape harry ginny interrupted her husband this is about nathan father harry rose from the table i ll find out what is going on now and with that he went to the library knocking hard on the door hermione leaned back resting her head on the old wooden door of the library and sighed closing her eyes when she opened them she saw nathan studying her looking confused she withdrew her wand and placed some silencing wards about the room let me see the necklace she demanded no nathan denied hermione sighed again calm down she thought i not taking it from you i just want to examine it she assured him nathan closed his hand protectively over the pendant again what do you want to look for have you even thought there could be something to harm you in it she pointed out it a gift of protection he declared lifting his chin in defiance how do you know that how do you know it from your father and not from someone pretending to be your father she was starting to lose the little control she d recovered there are people who would want to harm you people who lost a great deal at the end of the war with voldemort defeat what if someone sent you a jinxed amulet you re too young to understand mum what happened during the war and the fact that there are people mum who hate me and harry and ron and you cantrecognize dark magic mum she heard her son scream effectively interrupting her it a gift of protection it was in the letter my father sent me and he not a criminal or anything he fought by your side in that war how can you be so sure she asked taken aback by his apparent knowledge of his father allegiances dumbledore told me dumbledore her eyes widened how can dumbledore she snapped her mouth shut before she said anything else he was already a portrait when you were born nathan what can he possibly know about it besides she continued i not saying that your father would send you a jinxed gift just that it could be from someone else pretending to be your father now let me see the necklace he hesitated still hermione knew he could see her point by the look in his eyes he finally dropped his hand from the pendant and she could see the oval glass vial filled with a strong blue liquid a potion she realized definitely from severus she concluded in her thoughts what is going through his mind what does he want with it she couldntfind a plausible reason for severus actions let me read the letter she asked then nathan reached for his pocket and took a piece of parchment from it but didntgive it to her it really hard to read when it folded in your hand she pointed out annoyed nathan unfolded the letter but didntattempt to hand it over to her he held it open with the inscriptions turned to her so she could read from his hands hermione rolled her eyes and threw her hands in the air asking the gods for more patience this is ridiculous i ll not burn it or tear the letter to pieces nathan he flinched at her tone she closed her eyes that was not what she d intended hermione went to an armchair taking a seat come over here she bid nathan in a much calmer tone he slowly complied having the letter refolded in his hand she gestured for him to sit on her lap and when he did she encircled him in a half hug pulling him to her i understand the importance of this gift for you i do she made it clear running her fingers on his fine hair but i need to know if it legitimate if this is really a gift from your father i wontlie to you she added and you know that already she waited for a sign that he agreed and when he nodded lightly she said now let read that letter together and rested her head on his shoulder he unfolded the parchment again and she read it wear it at all times and i ll be with you when you most need me it my gift of protection she replayed mentally a shiver ran through her spine severus wanted to protect nathan in a very slytherin way she considered but that warmed her heart nonetheless it true isntit my father sent me a gift nathan asked searching her face for her reaction to the letter uncertainly she smiled at him yes he did a wide grin filled his face she hugged him tighter and he leaned into her embrace resting his head on her shoulder until a rather hard knock on the door broke the moment hermione they heard coming from the other side i know this is a selective silencing ward and that you can hear me open the door so we can talk it was harry only you and me if you prefer he added as an after thought mum nathan said looking back at her after being startled by harry knock uncle harry will want to see my necklace too wonthe will i have to show them all i not sure nathan she answered but i afraid so let me open the door for him and we ll find out she moved under her son weight and when he stood from her lap and she rose as well fixing her wand she brought down some of her wards and opened the door allowing harry to enter the library why did you leave the table harry asked her he now looked fixedly at nathan at his necklace nathan clutched it protectively once more go finish your breakfast hermione told her son i want to stay nathan answered do as your mother says nathan harry pressed nathan looked from harry to hermione and after she smiled at him nodding he left the library the door closed behind him and harry raised the wards this time tell me hermione who sent the necklace his father she answered tersely harry stared at her and who would that be i not telling you harry please dontinsist she asked no hermione i wontlet go this time around when it was only about you i knew you could handle whoever attempted to harm you but now it concerns nathan too i wontjust sit and watch while he might be in danger just because you wonttell me a name from some man you had something with more than ten years ago i won t he said firmly hermione looked at the intensity of harry green eyes as they flickered in hers unwavering there is nothing to be worried about she assured that all you need to know let go back to breakfast she suggested and made for the door but it didntopen for her she turned to him annoyed open the door harry harry taking a seat on a nearby armchair said take a seat hermione i not having this conversation with you again open the door she demanded glaring at him he didntshy under her glare take a seat he repeated simply she strode back to sit in an armchair facing his there nothing to worry about harry she repeated in exasperation it only a necklace enchanted for protection if i needed your help in dealing with this i would have asked why would he need protection from his unknown father a man who never cared to show up in all these years harry asked harry please she begged hermione i his godfather i love him as if he was my son and i love you as a sister i respected your secret for all these years satisfied with the thought that you wanted to keep both of you away from whoever this man is for reasons i could only imagine but now he enters your life through that necklace out of nowhere as if it was the most natural thing to do harry pointed out and you want me to believe there is nothing wrong with it i wontbuy that he completed shaking his head and reclining back on the chair hermione closed her eyes she would have to reveal at least some of her guarded secrets she knew that harry had asked before they had argued hotly about her refusals but he hadntinsisted as much as he was doing now and she knew he wouldntback off after that necklace and she understood his worry she shook her head lamenting severus slytherin approach and she would let him know as much after she was through with damage control here she opened her eyes to catch harry still watching her resolved he couldnthave looked for nathan before because he didntknow of his existence she revealed softly harry demeanor softened a little but not intentionally why i canttell you that only that it was my choice alone she answered why did you tell him now or recently or whenever you told him then harry asked confused with his wording due to his ignorance of the facts i didn t hermione stated but i glad he knows she lowered her head to look at her clasped hands i should have told him years ago she continued in a low voice it been hard for him to accept it just as hard as for me to deal with the consequences of what i did but the worst is what it doing to nathan she looked up again meeting his gaze i messed up harry and fixing it doesntdepend solely on me anymore i could help he offered some of the ice gone from his voice hermione shook her head in denial leaving the armchair i know you want to but no one can she said facing the bookshelves it his choice it the one decision i canttake from him she caressed the leather of the tomes trying to regain emotional control in their silence when a hand on her shoulder broke her concentration i dontlike to see you distressed like this harry said squeezing her shoulder in support i did what i thought was best for both of them she confessed i believe you harry said softly using his free hand to bring her head to his shoulder gently the library fell on a contemplative silence i can still help with nathan i ve heard his having trouble with malfoy harry offered her mouth curved in a ghost of a smile while she stepped away from harry embrace that has been dealt with she told him remus is taking care of that as his head of house but is snape dealing with malfoy harry said i think the old bat needs some reminding hermione sobered again harry dontinterfere i wontdo anything you wouldntapprove of he assured her and lifted his wand to bring down the wards let finish breakfast if there anything left for us he said gesturing for her to precede him back into the hall hermione didntsay anything else although she didntlike harry answer to her request him to not interfere at hogwarts she didntwant to raise suspicions towards severus nor did she want to leave nathan alone with all those sure to be curious weasleys good morning miss granger severus greeted without taking his eyes from the root he was chopping he has been expecting her at any time now he even thought she would have come the night before her self restraint surprising him when she didntanswer his greeting and just stood on the threshold of the laboratory he finally looked at her no the sight that met him wasntone of sheer happiness as he had expected it to be what were you thinking she said do you know how many questions i had to answer did you even think on the repercussion your little gift would have yes he had he would have means to know his son feelings and prevent him from withdrawing into himself if nathan had questioned her on anything severus knew she would be smart enough to answer the questions without great consequences to the secrecy of his identity it was not a high price to pay for his watchful eyes on the boy after all i sure you had great answers for all of his questions you always have he said amused by her distress hermione strode into the room and stopped in front of him across the workbench he was using she placed one hand on each side of the cutting board effectively taking his attention from the roots he lifted his eyes to meet hers she was enraged you think it amusing dontyou she spat well it not the weasleys were intrigued i thought harry was going to hex me if i didnttell him your name weasleys potter severus didntthink they would know of the necklace where did he go wrong where did his plan fail you never thought of that did you you never thought they would find out she stated as if listening to his musings why would they care they have nothing to do with it he answered annoyed if a father decides to send his son a gift it not anyone business hermione was shaking her head i not complaining believe me i was very surprised by your gift pleasantly so what i cantagree is with the way you re going about this i not looking for your approval either granger he made certain to let her know i dontcare if you agree or not why are you doing this why do you show you care when you re obviously doing your best to say you don t she accused if you dontwant to be part of our lives i really dontget you i ll never be part of your lives granger i told you from the beginning he clarified not in the way you expect me to then why did you interfere her tone wasntaccusing but a lament i ve asked you to tell him properly to sit the three of us and talk what you re doing the way you re approaching him he ll feel betrayed when he finally finds out that not my problem granger your mess your secrets he said i only doing my job and what is that to make him hate his father the moment he finds out it you to make him suffer this way is better he interrupted her his voice louder and stronger if hating me will guard him then that how it will be i trying to keep an eye on him granger to protect him and that includes from me he looked at her staring at him after his outburst and she seemed tired why did she have to insist that he revealed himself he has already decided he wouldntignore nathan existence only that he wouldntbe the boy father in all aspects of the role wasntthat enough i ll give you one week after the new term starts she said if you care for him and i know you do we ll sit as a family and we ll tell him you re his father he narrowed his eyes placing his hands on the workbench for support as he invaded her personal space threateningly do you think you can give me a deadline you who kept him a secret from me for eleven years that conversation will never happen ganger let alone within your stupid deadline he growled her reaction to his indignation unsettled him all she did was lower her head to look at the workbench as if his words were being said in his lecture tone you dontneed to get all defensive severus this is not a deadline i setting she said and lifting her eyes from the workbench to meet his again she added you set it when you sent him a mysterious gift for christmas she seemed resigned let do it the right way severus let tell him before he finds out she asked again he wontfind out unless you tell him severus said i never thought that you of all people were prone to delusions her eyes burned into his at this closeness he knows more than i thought he knew he didnteven question if the necklace was meant to harm him he knows his father was an order member severus and when he connects the potion in his new necklace to the only potions master in the order when he looks into your eyes the way i doing right now and sees his own he averted his eyes and didntsee hermione lower hers to the workbench when he examines your hands she continued and to his shock she reached to cover his left hand with her right one tracing the knuckles ever so lightly and sees a match to his own he straightened himself pulling his hand away from the workbench and from under hers severus noticed that her eyes remained on it while his hand moved even now that it hung at his side he crossed his arms then uncomfortable severus hoped he had covered any sign of surprise faster than she had raised her eyes to meet his she sighed heavily just think about it that all i asking severus and she was gone before he could consider the implications of all she d said and done severus scowled at the door he unfolded his arms holding the hand she had touched palm down he stared at it frowning prone to delusions he replayed her words in his mind tracing his own knuckles who deluding oneself he squeezed his hand and dropped it as if he could hurt it with his contempt nathan sat at the table sipping orange juice and distracting himself with the entertainment section of the muggle newspaper his mother sat across from him also having breakfast it been almost a week since christmas it was almost the new year in another week he would be back at hogwarts for a new term of classes with his friends and foes he added to himself suddenly nathan realized that his mother side of the table was too quiet he looked up and found hermione staring unseeing at him at his chest at his necklace he unceremoniously tucked it inside his shirt glaring at her it wasntthe first time he d caught her in the act she seemed more distracted than ever these days his move appeared to bring hermione back from her trance and she resumed eating the scrambled eggs that were sure to be cold by now are you sure you want to come with me she questioned him shoving her half full plate away and placing her crossed arms on the table there wontbe much to do i ll just set the experiment and wait in my office until it complete and as soon as it over i can apparate home and pick you up there nothing to do here either nathan pointed out if jeremy wasntspending time with his grandparents i could stay with him but he shrugged and you know i like to see the experiments just checking hermione said smiling and making sure i can say that i told you so when you start complaining you re bored why would i complain i would be ten thousand times more bored here than at the university is that so hermione asked amused what happened to i ll spend the whole holiday reading i ve read all the good books including those you borrowed from your boyfriend nathan defended himself teasing her back william is not my boyfriend hermione answered rolling her eyes but it was good you mentioned his books we re taking them with us i returning them to him that why you asked so many times if i wanted to go your boyfriend will be there nathan kept teasing mum has a boyfriend mum has a boyfriend he chanted i do not hermione said nathan just laughed not much later nathan assisted his mother in the laboratory of the chemistry department everything was almost done and he would soon have nothing to do for the two hours it took the experiment to complete of course he wouldntadmit he was already bored to death in anticipation of those hours ready hermione asked nathan positioned himself to turn on the start button ready on three then one two three hermione counted and nathan pushed the button while she added the last reagent to the mix great she said now we wait for the results hermione smiled at him and turned to clean the workbench before they left the equipment for the time being it takes two hours right nathan asked letting his impatience slip into his voice bored already can i say it then she teased him amused who said i bored he defied i just want to understand the whole process he lied hermione took off her gloves and apron yes it takes two hours she fondled with his hair and led him out of the laboratory saying let find something to save you from your boredom they had just entered the hallway heading for hermione office when a man called for her i didntexpect to see you working between christmas and new year william commented approaching them it just for a couple of hours before nathan and i go out for the day how was christmas i had a great time with my sister and her husband william answered and turning his attention to nathan said so you re the famous nathan it nice to finally meet you the man offered his hand in courtesy nathan took it this is professor william brice nathan hermione filled in nice to meet you professor brice nathan greeted still shaking the man hand call me william or will like your mother does the man smiled nathan nodded well i just wanted to say hello he told hermione i dontwant to keep you from enjoying your son company hermione smiled at william you re not keeping me from anything in fact we were going to look for you you just saved us the search william smile broadened looking for me what would be the reason i wanted to return the books you lent me they re in my office hermione led the way while they talked about the books nathan was asked for opinions and was content when both adults seemed truly interested in his point of view they reached the office and the conversation had changed to hermione experiment which led to other academic topics then to other books that made nathan wonder what it would be like if his mother was to really date this man or any professor for that matter nathan didntremember well the last time hermione had dated it been a long time ago and it hadntlasted long enough for his young brain to register many details at the time while he attended the muggle school he d seen many families like his own with only a mother and kids or in some cases a father and kids many of those parents had girlfriends or boyfriends and some of them even married a second time starting a new family why didnthis mother do that she was never married at least not that he knew about why wouldntshe want to marry or even date anyone nathan had heard stories of when hermione had dated uncle ron back when she was a student at hogwarts besides him nathan knew she have had to had something with his father did they date did she love him did he love her why didntthey marry why werentthey a family nathan didntknow he couldnteven begin to understand the potion inside his pendant changed from a light green to a deep blue showing the sadness that invaded his heart by now nathan had realized what those color changes meant his mood why did his father send him a mood necklace telling him it was for protection that he hadntfigured out yet nor what that liquid inside the necklace really was although he thought it to be a potion nathan would only be sure when he has access to hogwarts library again nathan his mother called he looked up away from the pendant in his hand meeting her eyes hermione looked worriedly from his eyes to the necklace and back again we still have an hour here she told him do you want to go outside or to the library maybe she asked still looking a little worried i can wait here nathan answered letting go of the pendant i can keep trying to understand what these trans reactions are he tried to force a smile it my fault entirely i sorry william admitted we shouldntbe talking about work hermione looked to his necklace again and smiled maybe medieval weapons would be a better topic she suggested nathan followed her gaze looking at pendant then and saw its contents were back to that light shade of green it took on most of the time would you prefer a sword or a dagger for a close combat weapon i think daggers are better for their secrecy pleasant conversation filled the hour they needed to wait william ended up being good company soon hermione and nathan were leaving the university to spend some time in muggle london they had plenty of places to visit before heading for the movies severus sat in his office staring at the coin like vial sitting on his desk classes had resumed and ever since the color of its content had acquired shades he had never seen in it before reds of anger browns of humiliation severus missed the light greens the oranges those unexpected pinks in fact severus had been stricken to observe that most of the time many shades of blue filled the glass vial replacing that soothing light green it showed that his boy was much more guarded in his emotions now that he was back at hogwarts than when he was only with his mother at least not even a glimpse of grey ever tainted the potion if the blue turned into grey he would have to act he would have to save his boy from a deeper depression and sadness or at least he convinced himself that was what he would be doing he hoped it wouldntcome to that and he didntthink it would the time nathan spent away from hogwarts made him good even not knowing his son very well all those detentions and this time he d spent watching his moods worked in his favor he was an observant man after all and he was sure he wouldntsee any grey in it or yellow he thought amused no coward yellows for gryffindors only when deep blue changed into greeny white did severus turn his full attention to the essays nathan was asleep that was his new routine now severus needed to be sure his son was peacefully sleeping before concentrating on anything else and even then he still checked his amulet for signs of any change he d never seen any significant or worrisome one though not until he d looked up from the last essay he had to grade and saw a swirl of graying yellow invade the peaceful greeny white severus was startled and on his feet in seconds he didnteven think before taking the amulet from his desk and activating it to locate nathan while exiting his office to the chilly corridor of hogwarts dungeons if his son was afraid and somber he had to find him immediately severus remembered the boy little adventure into the forbidden forest months ago and followed the locator spell faster until it took him to the entrance hall there severus stopped and frowned the spell was leading him up the stairs instead of through the oak front doors severus checked the potion in his amulet again it still had that yellowish tone with a grey tinge to it what are you afraid of if you re inside the castle he murmured to the halls climbing the stairs to where the spell pointed him only when he arrived just outside gryffindor common room and it directed him to go inside did severus question the veracity of the locator spell information if nathan was inside gryffindor why would he be afraid another check of his amulet and showed nothing had changed from his last inspection the only signs that he was doing this against his better judgment were a sigh and the fact that he had his eyes closed when he delivered the teacher password to the fat lady the common room was deserted at that time of the night it was way past midnight after all but severus had been almost sure he would find some commotion in there the locator insisted he should climb the stairs he knew led to the dormitories though what was going on up there he couldnthear any sound that would give him a clue or any sound at all for that matter silencing charms he wondered he was more worried than conscious of his actions now severus just wanted to find nathan and protect him from whatever was causing him those feelings the door to his son dormitory didntoffer any resistance and severus only found sounds of sleeping boys inside strange until a whimper reached his ears coming from one of the four poster beds severus wand at the ready cautiously pulled the drapes to the side to find nathan and only nathan although his boy was alone severus didntrelax yet nathan was struggling with the covers turning his head from side to side grimacing and whimpering he was having a nightmare severus entertained the thought of leaving the room leaving his son to his nightmare but his body wouldntmove nathan mumbled something breaking severus musings he mumbled some more and now severus thought he heard the words spider and back and no a few times he dreaming of that night in the forest severus realized more mumbles and he strained to listen and understand besides spider and away severus could make out the name of his son godfather harry and to his utter surprise his own name snape that made him stiffen even more uncomfortable with the situation severus knew the best thing to do was to wake him from the nightmare but how would he do that without being caught in the act he couldntwake him but he knew who could with the lightness of his graceful movements he left the dormitory crossed gryffindor common room and exited through the hole guarded by the fat lady he continued down the corridor the flaring torches trying to keep up with his fast pace he stopped abruptly and knocked at a wooden door it was opened for him after some insistence you need to go to gryffindor tower severus informed severus what is going on hermione asked visibly startled he having a nightmare severus answered you need to wake him hermione frowned seeming confused which annoyed severus leave your questions for another time we donthave all night he said which effectively made hermione act she threw a coat over her sleeping garments and joined severus in the chilly hallway she kept quiet while following his billowing robed person he didntsay anything else besides the password to access the tower he could feel she was analyzing him and knew he would have a lot of questions to answer after they were through here severus checked his amulet grayish yellow he indicated that she should precede him up the stairs to the dormitories he should have stayed down in the common room why did he follow her up stairs he knew the answer he wasntacting in his right mind and by the time some sense of self preservation invaded it he was already inside the dormitory he chose the darkest corner hermione was sitting on nathan bed from where he stood he could only see hermione back as a delineated shadow she was shushing the boy wake up honey it only a dream shhh it all right it only a bad dream he heard her sooth the boy in the sweetest of voices i right here with you no one can harm you mum he heard nathan high acknowledgement the boy moved to hug her the spiders were eating me shhh hermione shushed again and severus could hear the sound of her hands patting his son back comforting it over there are no spiders here it was only a bad dream she assured the sound of nathan desperation wasntonly heard by him a head popped out of another four poster bed who there asked the sleepy voice it only me andy nathan mum go back to sleep what going on andy insisted nothing just go back to sleep before we wake the others she whispered severus saw the head disappear back inside the protection of the drapes nathan didntseem that reassured though uncle harry couldntfind me professor snape was here but he didntdo anything and then he was gone the spiders were eating me calm down honey you were dreaming professor snape wouldntleave you there would he it was only a bad dream and it over she assured the boy some more silence filled the room severus could see the forms of their shadows entwined to each other could nathan have felt his presence in the room looming over him no he couldnthave could he why didnthe wake me his son soft sleepy voice asked breaking the silence who hermione asked back caressing his back my father the boy answered why didnthe wake me i know he was here only he was professor snape in my dream severus was as perplexed as he could see hermione was nathan didntonly sense his presence in the room but the boy had also known it was his father that he was his father come on granger he thought say something to dismiss his suspicions go back to sleep nathan you re very tired was all hermione said lowering nathan back to the pillow and tugging the covers back up severus saw her bend over and heard the kiss she placed on the boy forehead she remained stooped and he could barely make out the sound she was making she was humming a lullaby severus didntknow where the warmth that invaded his chest came from he shivered hermione hummed for a while longer and only when she left the bed and closed the drapes did he dare move she looked at him as if she d forgotten he was there he nodded towards the door they left they walked in silence lost in thoughts hermione deep intake of air called his attention she spoke your week is almost over severus but we still have time severus didntwant to hear that to be reminded of that he straightened his back standing in all his threatening glory but when he was prepared to deliver his snide reply she spoke again i get it go back to your dungeon i really tired and i know you ll be looking for me during the week and her door closed in front of him harry potter was finally free from ministry duties for an evening why did the criminals decide to act during holidays every year was the same he signed a last report sent a note to ginny and left the auror office he had just enough time to catch dinner at hogwarts harry didntforget nathan issue he knew hermione put too much trust in snape for her own good it been like this since the war times if she thought he harry potter was going to stand back with his arms crossed while that old bat laughed at his godson she didntknow him at all what intrigued him a little was remus lupin reaction to the whole necklace incident normally lupin wouldntjump in to defend anyone even if he thought they were being harsh in their accusations lupin would stay quiet watching without involvement that day at christmas breakfast the werewolf had jumped in to defend first hermione saying she didntknow about the necklace and then snape implying he was doing his best to look after malfoy harry didnthave the strength to think of anything else after the floo trip he was standing in front of minerva table when she greeted him surprised mr potter what brings you to hogwarts is everything all right at the ministry everything is fine minerva i here for a couple of visits really nothing related to the ministry he assured her how are you i sorry harry she apologized i doing fine the excitement of the students after a long holiday always results in more work for me but everything is fine minerva smiled at him hello sir harry greeted the figure of albus dumbledore hello my boy the portrait twinkled how are ginny and the kids they re great harry smiled at him would you join me for dinner in the great hall minerva invited i thought you would never ask harry told her it nice to see you professor dumbledore he told the portrait with great sincerity albus smiled it nice to see you too harry send my best to the others harry nodded and left the circular room with minerva who are you visiting if you dontmind me asking minerva said lupin and snape harry answered not supplying more information than was necessary snape minerva asked arching an eyebrow yes harry said simply he knew minerva wouldntbe pleased with that answer but he also knew she would intervene if she knew the reason of his visit they were already in the great hall so he felt it was safe to add we wontdestroy your school before taking the seat next to remus lupin harry was getting all the attention he was used to that by now so the only eyes he really felt wasnteven those of minerva glare it was those of the shadowy presence at her right snape harry what brings you to hogwarts lupin asked making him avert his gaze from the potions master i visiting harry answered how are you remus he asked smiling i fine lupin answered suspicious visiting with whom you minerva dumbledore the house elves food harry listed while serving himself potatoes snape lot of things bring me to hogwarts snape lupin asked like harry knew he would yes him too harry said dismissively can you pass me the juice lupin took the jug and placed it closer to harry what do you want with severus harry lupin asked looking grave let leave that between me and him harry answered we have more interesting things to talk about like what you know about nathan father for instance he gave lupin a side glance accessing the werewolf reaction to the subject was that annoyance why do you insist that i know something about that lupin said because you do harry said simply otherwise you wouldnthave intervened in hermione favor i know you and if you felt the need to interfere then you know much more than you want us to think harry i just knew hermione was unaware of the necklace because i was the only one observant enough to see her shock at the news the defense master assured him harry narrowed his eyes chewing on his food lupin had a point hermione seemed a bit shocked after seeing the necklace but that wasntenough to dissuade him harry knew better than that and decided to change tactics i just concerned about hermione and nathan she my best friend he my godson and i dontwant to be unprepared to deal with any pain this man can cause them harry said i only want to help i know how big your heart is harry lupin smiled at him but i think we need to trust hermione on this she wouldntdo anything to harm nathan look at the sacrifices she made for him lupin pointed out and if you want to help just be supportive he added and turned to look harry in the eyes no matter what you wonttell me will you harry said with a sigh fine i ll find out for myself you know i will lupin sighed just remember that nathan is only a child and he ll need you as his godfather if things go wrong harry looked startled at lupin what are you going on about i just asking you to be careful the werewolf warned and went back to his dinner harry frowned at his plate lupin definitely knew and was trying to hide it from him was that another sign that his suspicions were right could that wonderful smart happy intelligent boy be no nothing beautiful like nathan could come from no harry finished what he could of his dinner snape was next in his agenda and he would have to be prepared for that sharp tongue of his lost in his thoughts the way he was harry didntnotice nathan observing him from the gryffindor table nathan was intrigued by the change in demeanor in both uncle harry and professor lupin their conversation seemed to have worried both wizards normally nathan wouldnttake much notice but now he knew his godfather had been very intrigued by his necklace by the identity of his father since christmas the fact that he d looked for professor lupin who nathan was aware knew his father only made him more attentive to their conversation did uncle harry find out he thought he didntknow at that moment he caught harry glancing at professor snape snape he thought annoyed why does it always come back to snape nathan lost his appetite that wizard had even taken the part of his father in his dreams that was disturbing nathan tried to distract himself from harry actions which became impossible when he approached the table hello boys hello nathan harry greeted how are you doing nathan forced a smile i doing fine uncle harry what brings you to hogwarts he asked i needed to speak with some teachers harry said how are things with malfoy he being quiet since the term started nathan assured his godfather they had talked about what was going on in the school during the school break and harry had been very aggravated with what malfoy had been doing to him i glad to hear that did snape punish him harry asked i dontthink so but who cares nathan said i do nathan harry answered i ll make sure he gets what he deserves i dontneed you to protect me uncle harry nathan said frowning i can take care of myself the potions master strode pass them at that moment leaving the great hall harry followed the billowing robes with his eyes and nathan didntmiss any move of either man i know you can harry agreed with nathan last statement i still have one last visit to make dontforget to write to me once in a while harry patted nathan on the shoulder and left the great hall nathan was on his feet the moment harry disappeared from the doorway that conversation he wouldntmiss a single word he took his bag dismissed his friends questions and headed for the dungeons just outside professor snape office he could hear their voices as nathan predicted harry was talking with professor snape he took out his wand and murmured alohomora the door opened silently crouched he searched for shelter behind a table full of vials probably samples from students to be graded i donttake warnings from you potter now leave my office before i decide to hex you out of here you cantkeep protecting your little slytherins harry told snape you canttreat nathan the way you treated me nathan had never seen his godfather so angry harry was red with rage talking between gritted teeth who do you think you are to tell me how to educate my students professor snape growled rising from his chair and who do you think you are to treat nathan with indifference harry spat back also on his feet who do you think you are to tell me how to treat nathan snape growled lauder i his godfather harry growled back louder still and i his father snape all but screamed glass shattered at the back of the room nathan stood there transfixed staring wide eyed at the man who d made that last statement you he whispered all the time it was you he had tears on his eyes severus was shocked first with his confession to potter and next with nathan presence in his office he couldnteven muster his blank mask to cover his shock nathan knew it was over severus took a step closer to his son but nathan backed from him severus took another step towards him nathan he tried but the boy backed away further staring at him with wide eyes and a hurt expression finally nathan turned and fled crying severus closed his eyes this was not supposed to be happening so it true harry said coming back from his thoughts perplexed with snape revelation go find hermione tell her there is no need for a deadline anymore was all severus said before leaving his office a n yes he knows yes it was shocking yes it a cliffie lol i suppose i donteven need to ask you to tell me what you thought about it all right you all know i love to hear from you 0 special thanks to

truth disclaimer not mine it all j k rolling s warning this story takes place in the future and contains hbp spoilers be warned beta reader snarkyroxy thank you very much a n second chapter of my little story how surreal is that 0 let introduce nathan to the wizarding world shall we chapter 2 diagon alley the next saturday after the letter from hogwarts had arrived hermione and nathan left for diagon alley it was the first time nathan had visited the wizarding alley since his mother had never set foot there after leaving the wizarding world eleven years ago she had contacted harry and ginny who had contact ron and they would be meeting at the leaky cauldron to accompany them when they entered the pub she felt a surge of nostalgia the leaky cauldron hadntchanged a thing in the last decade well she shouldntbe surprised the wizarding world didntevolve at the same pace as the muggle world they still used quills and parchments amongst other things she scanned the tables searching for the familiar faces of her friends and found them in a table at the back of the pub surrounded by children wanting to meet the famous chudley cannon keeper and the boy who lived to defeat you know who ron was talking animatedly with his little fans much to harry annoyance harry still had problems with his fame even after all these years he gladly dismissed the children when he spotted hermione and nathan at the door of the pub mione nathan good to see you he said from a distance hi harry she answered and crossed the space between them to hug him how are you ginny where are little lily and sirius she inquired while hugging harry wife they re with fred and george at the joke shop she supplied hi nathan ready to go to hogwarts she added petting the boy on the head sure i ready i know everything about it already he answered let me guess your mother lent you her copy of hogwarts a history harry said giving hermione a knowing look that makes you the second person to read it in the whole of hogwarts history he said with a silly smile oh stop teasing harry hermione admonished slapping his arm playfully you know how much important information i got from that book you should have read it too true but why would we bother when you could tell us all the important information said ron finally free from his little fans and joining the conversation oi nathan ready to buy your new broom he said ignoring hermione murderous look i dontknow it written in the letter i got that first years arentsuppose to have brooms was nathan answer nah harry was already gryffindor seeker in his first year of course you need a broom he dismissed no quidditch during the first year ron that the rule harry was an exception she said glaring ron way let go into diagon alley then harry said coming to the rescue hermione and ron had dated for as much as six months after the end of their sixth year but it was a total disaster all they did was disagree about everything until they finally agreed to break up realizing they were much better as just friends ron never married but seemed very comfortable about it one of his biggest fears besides spiders was become his father yes let go nathan answered before my mum decides it time to use that wand of hers on uncle ron and with that they left the pub for the small courtyard that led to diagon alley harry tapped the bricks with his wand and the passage opened reveling the alley crowded like in their own first year now with voldemort gone for more than a decade the wizarding world was back to its normal pace with not a thing to worry about besides shopping the streets were filled with families and laughter nathan took in everything with his curious black eyes he had heard of diagon alley many times but his imagination didntdo the real thing justice it was so much more than he expected all those people wearing robes of all colors and sparks of magic everywhere the scent of the herbs and something he couldntfigure out filled the air near the apothecary they were passing challenging his senses their first stop had to be gringotts he heard about the wizarding bank too they needed to exchange their muggle money for the wizards equivalent nathan thought the goblins were a little scary but very efficient they exchanged enough money for their shopping and left the bank nathan was trying to take everything in at once the shops the people the objects hermione was watching every reaction and grinning madly she knew what it was like to discover this place for the first time well let start with madam malkin s then we can go to flourish and blotts for the books hermione told her son and added to herself in a low voice before those two drag you to the quidditch shop and the joke shop and so they went nathan was really happy when they reached the book shop he loved books he inherited his love of books from his mother many an evenings he had sat with her quietly to read and relax they were at the book shop for what seems like hours and hermione felt like she was truly home everything is more than perfect was her thought until she caught sight of nathan talking to a blond boy discussing a book she had no doubt it was a malfoy and sure enough none other than draco malfoy appeared behind the blond boy she was at her son side in a matter of seconds and in an instinctive reaction she placed a hand on nathan arm and tried to pull him out of draco range without being recognized come nathan we have other things to do before lunch but it wasnta successful attempt granger you re alive was all he managed to say surprised to meet her after all those years malfoy was her retort so nathan you said he asked the boy you were saying you re going to hogwarts this year yes sir i am he answered politely well i see you and my son devon will be fellow first years then he added with a smirk directed to hermione i sure they ll be good friends she retorted defiantly and turning to her son she said let go nathan we have other shops to visit and it getting late it was nice to see you healthy and alive granger i suppose you went back to your muggle world after the war was over he commented acidly yes i went i was just trying to avoid people like you malfoy and with that she took nathan by one arm and dragged him to the counter to purchase their books soon they were back in the street mum why were you so rude to devon father nathan was used to his mother temper and sharp tongue but he rarely saw her become so angered without strong provocation and he couldntfigure what it was mr malfoy had said that had infuriated her so the malfoys are not good people nathan draco devon father caused too much trouble when we attended hogwarts together and i dontthink he has changed much so i cantbe friend with devon he seems an okay guy to me you can be friends with everyone i just want you to be careful when it comes to the malfoys i will nathan knew that was no good pressing the matter any longer what was so terrible about the malfoys anyway i ll have to ask uncle harry he thought soon they finished their shopping for the school supplies and headed to weasleys wizard wheezes the joke shop ron brothers owned nathan had met all the weasleys some years ago during a christmas party at the burrow he enjoyed every second of their time there the twins were very funny and since his mother had decided they would be shopping in diagon alley this weekend he couldntstop thinking about their joke shop the shop was crowded there were so many things on the shelves that it was hard to decide what to look at first that was when lily harry daughter came and took nathan hand to give him a tour through the shop leaving hermione to herself she took the time to talk to harry about malfoy harry what do you know about the malfoys these days the question took harry by surprise he wasntexpecting hermione to take interest in draco after all these years why do you ask i just had the displeasure of meeting draco and his son at the book shop i want to know how dangerous the boy is he ll be starting hogwarts this year as well and i want to make sure nathan wonthave any kind of problem with him she informed her friend oh i didntknow the malfoy brat was nathan age he said with honest surprise i dontthink he a problem mione the malfoys lost most of their influence when voldemort fell and after a few moments of silence he added but i wouldntmess with them all the same i ll see what i can find out about the brat and i ll let you know meanwhile you should tell nathan to be careful around him i already did she agreed seeing his friends preoccupation hasntsubsided harry assured her he ll be fine hermione he a strong young man i sure no one will be bullying him and getting away with it he too much like you were at his age if not stronger i know harry it just she trailed off not wanting to voice her worries about her son departure to hogwarts she couldnttell harry how worried she was about nathan meeting his father for the first time and now a malfoy was going to be there too there were so many things her son didntknow didntunderstand he ll be fine harry assured her once more not even snape will be able to make him flinch let alone a malfoy brat he said matter of factly snape how will severus snape treat nathan she thought what if he treats him worse than the other students because he my son he doesntknow nathan is also his son after all hermione was distracted from her musings by nathan call from the other end of the shop mum you got to see this they look like plain marbles but when you squeeze them they expand and explode in different smoke colors and smells isntit cool nathan was really taken with all the magical products in the shop hermione had never abandoned magic completely but she didnthave many magical artifacts in their home she chose to raise nathan in the muggle world and thought better than filling the house with magical objects some time later they left the joke shop with more items than hermione thought healthy for a first year at hogwarts but most of them were gifts from nathan many uncles and she couldntdeny him the treat their last stop was the owl post to send the letter confirming that nathan would attend hogwarts next september as soon as the owl was sent on its way they left diagon alley and the leaky cauldron and were back into muggle london heading home there was a little more than a month until september 1 when nathan would be leaving his home and his mother to start his life as a wizard at hogwarts it was time enough for hermione to prepare him to the challenges of a wizard life and first on her list was cautions of a certain potions master she had to try to prevent any hatred between them but without telling the whole truth it wasntan easy task but hermione wasntfamous for the easy tasks she performed she was famous for her brain work on what people called lost causes and that the kind of effort she was going to apply to the task at hand a n i just want to add a note for the kind readers who took a little of their time to leave me a review i really overwhelmed with your kind words of encouragement after that i

much a n chapter twenty one nathan wakes up and has to face his new reality how will he take it chapter 21 hurting nathan felt his mouth become dry and darted his tongue out to wet his lips he took a deep breath but didntopen his eyes he stretched and yawned and something was odd that his numb brain registered he rolled over and stretched some more what was odd of course this bed was fluffy and endless good he thought just like mum mum he opened his eyes and assessed his surroundings he was not in his bed why am i not in my room he rubbed his eyes forcing his mind to work and he regretted the effort last night events came rushing with his consciousness and snape was again his father where am i he sat in bed now worried nathan didntremember leaving the trophy room he looked around and finally found out where he was he closed his eyes and threw himself back on the fluffy pillow that could only mean his mother was here who called her he didntwant to see her nathan opened his eyes to stare at the canopy of his mother bed he needed to get out of there he sat up in bed again searching for his clothes he found them on a chair and moved to put them on quickly he was dressing with his back turned to the door when he heard it open damn nathan he heard his mother say he stopped buttoning his robes and stood still never turning in hermione direction i didntwant to wake you he heard her voice saying closer now you seemed very tired last night are you feeling better her soft voice was only increasing his anger then a hand landed on his shoulder nathan stood stiller yet before shrugging her hand off him i fine he said simply and restarted buttoning his robes nathan we should talk about what happened yesterday i dontwant to talk about it he informed her i know you have many questions and for the first time i can give you the answers his mother words made him turn to face her nathan wanted to tell her how much he didntneed any of her answers now but he just said i know what i wanted to know i must be late for class nathan passed by hermione and went for the door but it slammed shut he turned annoyed to glare at her you are excused from your classes she told him we have all morning to talk to talk about what he spat tired of her so snape is my father big deal yes it a big deal you know it a big deal hermione said back glaring at him she sighed please let talk about it nathan was holding her eyes with his for a moment before saying i dont see the point hermione frowned dontyou want your father to be part of your life dontyou want to get to know him and spend time with him you can do all of that now that the point nathan had dreamed of all those things his mother was telling him he d wanted a father for so long and now he had one he knew who his father was and knew he would never have that i dontneed them i dontwant any of this anymore i dontwant and i dontneed i dontneed any of you nathan said do you want to know how worried about you he was yesterday she slowly walked his way he was very worried and i was very worried too severus cares for you nathan nathan was shaking his head refusing to believe what she was telling him she a liar he reminded himself you dontneed her lies he gritted his teeth and said i dontbelieve you everything you say is a lie you never wanted me to know that professor snape was my father you never wanted me to be happy with him nathan it not true she got closer and he circled the room away from her you could have told me he was no threat to us he was not in azkaban he was not dangerous you even said he was honorable and good you should have told me you knew i wanted to know i spent a month with him asking stupid questions about my father making a fool of myself were you laughing was he telling you how pathetic i was every time i asked him about my father nathan was shouting now nathan she tried to interrupt it must have been good to laugh about me or you would have told me before would you tell me sometime soon were you planning for me to find out like this and make me yet more miserable because that is exactly how i felt are you happy now he was panting nathan wanted to physically hurt her so she could feel how painful it was hermione quickly went to him not giving him a chance to escape she hugged him hard her hug was suffocating and the pain in his chest was getting unbearable i not happy i not happy i miserable too i never wanted to hurt you i sorry i so sorry she was whispering in his ear he didntwant to hear her excuses nathan wanted her to go away he wanted the pain to subside he struggled and she hugged him harder he growled and fought with new resolve until she couldnthold him anymore he looked at her breathing hard she was on the verge of tears and he didntpity her dont touch me again he said i dontwant to hear your lies ever again i hate you nathan took his wand took some deep breaths and intoned the incantation that opened the door for him before leaving though he turned to his dumbfounded mother and calmly added from now on i ll live with uncle harry and he turned and heard her sob and he didntback down he didnt even turn to glance at her she would feel how bad he felt and that what he wanted only then nathan left severus spent what had been left of the previous night thinking about what had passed with one declaration he had taken his place as nathan father and he was sure damned by now he cursed under his breath but had no escape this time he d claimed his heart had claimed and he was now officially nathan father regardless of what was best and prudent like severus had predicted when he first realized who the boy really was the situation urged him to take action and his need for making new decisions thus enhancing the number of mistakes he committed in life was paying off already what passed through his mind while he d carried nathan to bed revolved around the pain he was causing his son already that he knew was only a sample of what was to come the terrified look on nathan face in his office he taking the necklace off the way he took refuge in the trophy room were all actions that spoke volumes to how likely it was that everything would be all right like granger kept saying severus rolled his eyes the woman was delusional but she loved the boy if her previous reactions to nathan foul behavior were to be taken for granted she ll be miserable the moment the boy woke up he knew nathan foul behavior would be getting to him as well what will the boy do severus knew it was useless to try and predict nathan behavior he d learned that through their month of detentions there was no way to know what nathan would do but there was no way to convince his mind of that the last thing severus thought nathan would do was take the news nicely although images of his son smiling at him while working on a potion exactly where that hufflepuff was now crossed his mind and he could see himself nodding approvingly to acknowledge the perfect brew just to see the smile grow into a wide grin mr carson keep your mouth shut for the rest of the class five points from hufflepuff severus said dispassionately to the third year talking for what seemed the millionth time with his classmate while brewing the assigned potion of this morning double class nathan accepting him was also troubling in many ways he didntknow how to be a father what if the boy expected more than he could give severus wasntabout to start hugging and petting like he d seen potter do he couldntimagine himself taking broom rides playing exploding snap or any of those silly things would nathan want that was that what he longed for in a father severus suddenly realized he didntknow nathan at all and it felt oddly sad instead of thinking over everything he missed of nathan life severus chose to concentrate on what was more probable to happen if his son was already awake he might be yelling at his mother blaming her for everything that had gone wrong in his young life he d seen nathan do as much before and severus wouldntcondemn him for that in nathan position he would do worse than that shouts of accusations were a light breeze in the storm of his life severus blinked longer than usual to erase the image that brought to mind and when he opened his eyes again he saw only the ravenclaw girl stirring a cauldron with great concentration at the workbench nearer his desk the class would soon be over and he would find out what would become of his life from now on surely granger would be expecting him for a chat with or without nathan hermione stared out the window at the cold white morning the beautiful view of the snowy grounds had helped to calm her after nathan departure a few hours ago everything had gone wrong nathan wasnt only upset and hurt he was furious and his fury and resolve to pull away in this difficult and confusing time was heartbreaking for her he d preferred to stay alone a child who went through what he just did shouldntbe alone but her presence seemed to bring out the worst in him at the moment it hurt knowing your own child couldntstand looking at you without feeling angry betrayed vulnerable it hurt deeper than hermione could have imagined the things he d said she was glad severus hadntbeen with them when nathan woke up after things went quiet the night before hermione had replayed the last scenes of severus with nathan in her head and she d wished severus could have been with them then now all she could think of was how much bigger the disaster would have been if he had stayed she didnt know how prepared severus was to deal with this level of hatred from someone he cared for knowing how fragile this feeling still was for him and how reserved towards his feelings he was severus wouldnt have understood hermione had taken these hours to be pessimistic for a change it hurt but now she felt prepared to fight and make things right as they should have been since the beginning it was all her fault this situation had achieved such proportions and she would fix it hermione would not let their happiness fly from her hands now that all the cards were played she had nothing to lose anymore taking a deep breath hermione left her quarters at hogwarts she wanted to believe she had really nothing to lose but deep down inside she knew it only hurt because it was all about to be lost hermione wanted the feeling to go away her anxiety wouldntlet her stay waiting any longer she would start right away and the only waiting she would do was for severus in his office harry stared at the report he was supposed to be filling in hermione had lost her mind and was taking him with her into insanity he rubbed his forehead trying to alleviate the pain there having a bad day boss tonks asked in a tone of chide harry only sighed when harry didntsay a thing she asked more seriously feeling all right there harry harry sensed tonks preoccupation headache he said simply not lifting his head to look at her she now had taken a chair and was sitting on it backwards across from harry do you know what causing it she pressed yes harry said and then finally looked at her your husband tonks held the back of the chair with both hands at arms length withdrawing from harry table but still facing him with a frown and hermione harry added tonks eyes widened and harry realized his mistake no no you re getting me wrong tonks face relaxed now curiously eyeing harry for an explanation i went to hogwarts yesterday since christmas i ve been intending on clearing some things up now i took care of what i went there to but everything else is as clear as mud harry you re making no more sense than scrimgeour tonks commented how much you know about nathan father harry asked tonks eyes straightened i know remus knows if that what you re wondering he answered her unspoken question i know remus knows too but he tells me it not his secret to tell what did you find out i found out harry stated tonks approached harry table again now holding the back of her chair under her chin you did she commented conspiratorially her eyes darkening a shade yes but your husband wants me to keep it quiet tonks rolled her eyes straightening in her chair again remus is no fun are you going by him harry sighed throwing his head back for a while and bringing it forward again i dontknow hermione is completely insane i cant believe she he stopped ranting and took a deep breath all this anger was adding to his headache i think remus might be right about this he closed his eyes tight holding the bridge of his nose it snape tonks declared harry snapped his eyes open and stared at her only snape or you know who are capable of giving you such a headache and let face it nathan has snape written all over him there was no denying that i thought snape could be his father of course but to know for sure harry admitted what made me think twice were hermione actions with her moving to the muggle world and all that didntmake any sense knowing all she did for him which in a way supported the theory of them having something romantically she analyzed the possibilities but seriously harry it not as if the world is ending tonks added after only a moment placing a slap on his arm tonks you dontunderstand nathan found out too he was there when snape yelled he was his father you should have seen his face the boy was horrified and with reason harry pointed out making clear that the situation was grave and hermione is nurturing the mad idea of making nathan and snape interact she left him alone with snape she lost her mind snape yelled that at nathan tonks seemed shocked he yelled at me and we didntknow nathan was there but still harry said dismissively how can hermione trust snape like this it snape tonks shrugged if he the father she took notice of the clock hanging on the wall behind harry and stood placing the chair to its place i ve got to run we can talk more later harry she left the office calling for another auror who had just passed the door cant they see he thought annoyed it seemed harry was the only one thinking about nathan in this situation hermione had lost her mind remus was not interfering as always and now tonks didntcare at all well he cared severus entered his office and wasntsurprised to find the woman staring blankly at the snowflakes falling by the high round window maybe a little disappointed that she was alone but not surprised at all severus she acknowledged his presence seeming a little startled but also relieved he walked to his desk taking his seat behind it facing the armchair she occupied granger he said then not knowing what else to say silence fell upon them while he observed her struggle to construct her sentences in her head he was very upset she told him finally he doesntknow what to do with the news severus didntsay anything that was expected as he had told her before but he preferred to listen more before throwing that at her she continued he trying to pretend it not important and he got very defensive when i tried to tell him the contrary he didnt let me explain anything either her eyes hardened when she finished saying that but any other changes were lost to him when she lowered her gaze to her lap did he tell you how much he hates you already severus asked after a while she took a deep breath and looked at him chin up he doesntreally hate me she said or you so he d said he hates me as well severus concluded how much doesnthe hate us he asked arching an eyebrow she sighed a very great deal granger admitted can i say it now he dared to tease no you cannot she countered firmly her tired eyes regaining some of their usual shine if you had listened to me this wouldnthave happened you can absolutely not say a word severus snape severus reclined in his chair arching both eyebrows to convey a surprise he didntreally feel over her outburst he hates us that much he said he ll live with harry that how much he hates us those words really surprised him making him frown he ll not live with potter hermione rolled her eyes i here saying that nathan is upset confused and withdrawn and you only care when you hear harry name she was beyond annoyed and nervous and distressed it well past time you get your priorities sorted severus severus narrowed his eyes at her tone but instead of answering her accusations he finally decided to use his next words to put some sense in the woman you obviously know that this is all your fault granger you brought this boy to life and decided to raise him inside a bubble of lies and false hopes how could you expect he wouldnthate you and sensing her will to interrupt him he quickly added yes he truly hates you and he hates me as well of course but there is nothing new about that grow up woman you cantlive your fairytale anymore her lower lip trembled with the retort he knew she was struggling to hold back but it was true all he d said was nothing but the truth after some tense silence she spoke in a surprisingly controlled voice do you know nathan severus she asked and made a pause i know you dontand i not happy about it but i happy yes with the fact that i do know him i know how big his heart is how sensible and loving he truly is the truth she delivered with her eyes made it impossible for him to doubt her words he angry feeling betrayed nathan is hurting her voice lost some of its earlier steadiness she stood to pace the room and after some deep breaths she continued he also confused severus as prudent as he is i dontthink he had anything prepared for this scenario she threw her arms in the air to emphasize her point he needs us right now to help him sort things out he wont make it easy for us but if we leave him to his own devices he ll nurture the wrong ideas and might come to truly hate us then nathan is too introspective severus if we dontact now there will be no coming back he too stubborn and once he has made his decision it ll be really hard to make him see reason granger was still pacing but she stilled her movements for a short time she seemed disturbed by a memory of some kind she closed her eyes and said i dontwant to hear nathan say he hates me ever again and looking at him she added especially if the feeling is really there a haunted look filled her face i know you care for him severus you wontwant to hear it either believe me severus could have told her he was used to the hatred people felt towards him or try to dissuade her from knowing that he cared for nathan but he didntfeel like it it was a strange realization but he actually wanted to care for the boy and wanted people or at least this woman here to know he cared for his son stop rambling and tell me what your plan is and the smile that filled the woman face was obfuscating smiling like a mad woman will not reassure me annoyingly that only made her smile more authentic now reaching her brown eyes she took her seat again you two need to have some time together outside the classroom of course he needs to see you as more than his teacher she tapped her lips with a finger obviously thinking severus made use of that time to understand what she had just said spend time with nathan outside classroom that meant he would be acting like a father and the reality of the moment crushed him i am a father books granger exclaimed startling him he loves books and you have an amazing collection in your quarters she smiled again i cantdo this he found himself saying she sobered of course you can she assured all you have to do is tell him you have a book to give him and he ll follow like a bee after honey i just can t he reaffirmed and stood turning from her to satisfy the need for privacy of his thoughts severus could feel her eyes on his back but images of failing were dominating his senses he would fail his son he knew he would damned time potter showed up everything was perfect before that nuisance decided to defy him stupid potter nathan didntneed him his son had been doing fine without knowing the truth severus replayed the night before in his mind again and remembered how helpless his son had been when he d carried nathan to bed severus had thought about how vulnerable the boy in his arms was when he had helped prepare him for bed severus had been reassured by the weight of his boy resting against his chest the way granger so lovingly handled nathan now he could only think of how fragile his son was expressions unguarded raw nathan had seemed peaceful when he slept so innocent and now severus would certainly destroy what good was left in his son life he couldntdo that but he couldnthelp it from happening he was no father severus closed his eyes regretful he couldnt repeat what his father had done with him a hand landed on his right shoulder and severus almost flinched you ll be a good father severus you are already her voice was a caress but her words brought no comfort severus couldnt believe her i know you dontthink so but being a good parent is all about caring and wanting what best for your child and you do that already the hand lifted from his shoulder after a reassuring squeeze only to touch his face tugging his hair behind his ear and effectively startling his eyes open again you can do this severus i have faith in you she added and her voice hand and words caressed his senses and this time they were all effective severus was confused by hermione granger once again how can she believe in me like this and oddly it felt like he should believe her in kind could he severus turned his head and saw her gazing at him with open concern who is this woman he could only stare at her granger smiled come let find some other ways you can lure nathan into talking with you she said tugging at his arm beckoning him to his desk he loves potions but that out of question since that all you do together during class severus followed her lead to the desk and watched her fascinated by the faith she had in people and how courageous she actually was maybe those threads that had always made him think of gryffindors as foolhardy imbeciles were indeed something to admire in them granger was still talking animatedly as if all the problems in her life were about to be solved in the best way imaginable when the truth was that they were only getting worse but i not sure he might get interested in talking about i ll try he caught himself interrupting her rambling account of the many ways to get to nathan what the hell am i doing i lost my mind she was staring at him now searching making him uncomfortable under such scrutiny until she finally nodded that all we need severus lowered his eyes to the table top wanting the silence that followed that short statement as well as this whole conversation to end already damn he was committed there was no turning back now as much as i dontwant to i need to go back to london she blessedly answered his silent prayers i ll be in touch with you for news or anything granger added severus heard her stand up to leave and stood as well he kept silent while accompanying her to the door of his office which she waited for him to open for her and he complied she was passing by him at the door when she turned to face him again a disturbing luminosity to her big brown eyes thank you severus and she gave a half smile before making her way down the corridor towards the entrance hall he accompanied her path until he no longer could see her by the time he d noticed he wasntalone there it had been too late severus looked at the slytherin observing him oddly lost something miss yaxley the girl shook her head in answer and quickly left severus banged the door closed nathan andy exclaimed upon seeing him standing by the dormitory window hey andy nathan answered not as enthusiastically what happened to you harry potter was looking for you last night and then you didntcome back to sleep professor lupin came here to tell us you were excused from classes this morning but he wouldnt say why are you in trouble no nathan had forgotten about his friends he couldnttell them that he had finally found out who his father was he wouldntsay he was snape son i think of something i was with my mother he choked out andy was still looking at him waiting for the rest of his explanation nathan opened his mouth to say whatever would come to mind but kevin arrived at the same time nathan where have you been he was with his mother andy advanced in answering your mother was that why harry potter was after you last night kevin complemented his questioning i was with my mother she came to visit nathan bought more time for coming up with something else to explain his absence is there something wrong andy asked carefully nathan thought of using his mother being ill as an excuse but running the possibilities of that lie in his head thought better of it they would see her on the weekend anyway not really he answered my mother is fine but she wanted to see me but she here every weekend isntshe kevin commented can we be excused from classes if our parents come to visit us kevin expression changed from confused to thoughtful that would be useful you know how mothers are nathan shrugged anyway it got late and i stayed in her quarters for the night she was staying here all morning today so she asked professor lupin to excuse me from classes there you have it it was true but not the whole the truth excellent he congratulated himself lucky you andy said maybe i can convince my parents of visiting me on a monday morning it would be great to be excused from snape class snape nathan sobered can we go to the great hall for lunch i didnt have much at breakfast i hungry he said wanting to forget about the man and move on with his normal life there was no objection to his suggestion and they talked about what he had missed that morning in class while descending to the great hall nothing unusual happened on their way there as expected of course that nothing has changed with the school life nathan thought annoyed with himself why would something change in the castle because professor snape was his father it wouldn t but he couldntface those passing by them in the halls nathan walked watching his steps only when nathan saw andy feet step in what he knew was the great hall floor was it that he realized professor snape would be there he didntfollow andy or kevin other students passed by him and only after some time convincing himself that he was being a coward baby did he look up his eyes went straight to the seat left of the headmistress the empty seat alleviated nathan looked to the remaining staff joining the headmistress for lunch and found professor lupin observing him that made him uneasy again werent you hungry kevin called and nathan finally went to the table sitting by him kevin was staring at him and so was andy but entertained by the conversation around them they forgot nathan awkward behavior nathan ate little he could still feel professor lupin eyes on him from time to time what does he want mum must have told him to keep an eye on me he thought angered with hermione again he didnt take a bite of his dessert the others finished and they were ready to leave for the afternoon classes when andy sitting across from nathan acknowledged good afternoon professor lupin good afternoon andrew girls boys came the retort from over nathan head how are you today various answers followed professor lupin question but nathan kept silent what about you nathan he heard then dontyou like apple pie not really sir there is no chocolate in it i always have chocolate in my office if you need some professor lupin said his eyes conveying the real meaning of that offer nathan wanted to accept professor lupin offer but knew he was working on his mother orders he felt the need to thank anyway thank you sir lupin nodded solemnly and left the great hall by its main doors nathan lowered his gaze to the untouched pie he wanted to trust professor lupin but he truly had no one i ve seem you eat apple pie before the problem is not the pie is it kevin asked him i dontwant to eat the stupid pie canti have a no pie day nathan spat angered with his parents again but having only kevin on whom to release his frustration okay okay kevin retreated away from him donteat the pie nathan took a fork and stabbed the offending pie he didntcare about his friends flinch he only needed a time for himself after nathan left the great hall josephina turned to andy and asked what wrong with him i dontknow jose he been like that since he came back from spending some time with his mother andy answered maybe we should go after him she suggested good luck kevin said jose was looking recriminatory to kevin was that why harry potter was here yesterday she asked then he nathan godfather isnt he maybe kevin answered furrowing his brows i think something is wrong but he not telling us do you think it has to do with malfoy harry potter was talking with him about it yesterday remember andy suggested yes you might be right but why wouldnthe tell us then kevin countered andy shrugged jose stayed silent for a while but soon turned to talk about something else with the other girls kevin was puzzled but was brought back from his musings by a discussion of the latest professional quidditch results nathan went to the library it was quiet only a few older students there most ravenclaws he chose a secluded table in a dark corner and sat holding his head in his hands elbows leant on the table top they cantget to me like this nathan berated himself how would he get his life back to normal if he couldntignore his parents and professor snape wasnteven there nathan cuffed the table in frustration drawing curious looks from the others in the library he scowled at them but then sighed damn it was harder than nathan expected but he would succeed he didnt need them and he would live his life very well without them he just needed to try harder nathan had a whole afternoon to ignore his parents and be only himself with his classes and friends he stood and walked determined out of the library ready to face a troll or so he thought the afternoon classes went by uneventfully for him his problems resurfaced when he arrived in the great hall for dinner he was there his father nathan couldntgo in he wasntlooking but he knew professor snape was staring at him he had to go i forgot something in the classroom i ll go to the library after that i ll talk to you later nathan hurriedly told his friends and not leaving room for questions left the way he d come two flights of stairs later he stopped breathing heavily what wrong with me he muttered as much as he was chastising himself nathan didntgo back to the great hall that evening the morning after he woke up with a new resolve he would take breakfast no matter who was in the great hall he didntsleep well he was hungry and he wouldnthave any staring bat to make his day any worse nathan smiled when he didntfind any bats in the hall great better yet he was in the middle of his breakfast when the overgrown bat arrived through a side door they locked eyes when snape stopped on his way to his seat nathan gulped his juice with difficulty the moment passed in seconds but it had seemed hours for nathan feeling a crushing force in his chest nathan stood snape didnttake his eyes off of him the crushing increased and nathan had to leave the great hall for air severus watched nathan leave sighing and finally getting to his seat the boy was still running from him proving to be as unpredictable as severus thought who would have thought a gryffindor one of the only in his teaching history to never fear him would be fleeing from the great hall upon seeing him his son a coward he knew nathan wasnt a coward but severus reasoning was interrupted by the owl post to be more specific by the letter one of the owls dropped in his scrambled eggs severus rolled his eyes when he noticed the sender dear severus how are things at hogwarts i hope you have spoken with nathan and that he feeling better please send me some news sincerely hermione granger how can i speak with the boy if he running from me and she would be at hogwarts by that afternoon she could assess the situation herself then severus crumpled the letter without a second thought he knew he had lost his mind when he d agreed to join her crazy plan but the truth was that severus wanted to talk with nathan he just didntknow how severus shooed the owl that had been surely waiting to take a reply he wouldntbe writing he looked back to his plate to find his meal was spread all over and ruined muttering under his breath he left the great hall for another morning of classes at least he wouldnt have to put up with dunderheads in the afternoon during class severus had decided he wouldntshow up for lunch in the great hall he had told himself it was because he didntwant to face people after the class he had had but if he would be honest he knew the reason was other severus didntwant to disturb his son with his presence choosing to spend the afternoon in his lab he summoned a house elf and ordered a sandwich and tea severus was going through some notes of research when granger arrived later that day why didntyou answer my letter she asked skipping her customary polite good afternoon why answer a letter if you would be here to ask me in person severus answered she took a deep breath did you talk to him he looked at her contemplating his options then lowered his head to resume his notes i didn t the light was blocked by her body standing right in front of his desk then he didntgive her his attention but it became impossible to avoid her when she crouched and came face level with him holding the edges of the desktop dont wait too long severus he wontcome to you i told you he wouldntmake it easy for us her voice was soft etched with sadness severus rested his kill on his desk and faced granger i already doing this against my will dontpush me i didntwant things to get to this either i not pushing he narrowed his eyes cutting off her words okay so i am pushing but we donthave time severus his eyes gained more force of reprimand to her words dontlook at me like that you messed up this time you fix it it doesntmatter what you want anymore dontyou see you said you were his father now you are dont tell me what i can and cannot do woman he spat back she stood in front of his desk then you tell me what you can and cannot do severus i cantapproach someone who not ready to face me without blowing your perfect plan i cantbe someone i not from night to day just because you are deluded i cantfix your mistakes and what you can do severus her voice was strong but not harsh silence followed that question but her eyes kept speaking strong incisive boring into his he could hex her into next week he could expel her from his lab he could ignore she ever came into his life he could but he wouldn t and he didnthave to because she chose to leave on her own perfect he thought sarcastically nathan spent all weekend in his dormitory he didntwant to accidentally run into his mother in the halls or in the library he didnteven want to be occasionally found in the common room if any of them dared to come looking for him there yes them because professors lupin and snape were on his avoidance list as well if he was to be true to himself he would have to admit that even his friends were making him uneasy these days it was as if everyone was looking at him and seeing snape written on his forehead nathan knew they were not but he could see it every time he looked in the mirror or in a window reflecting him like now he turned from the window and went back to his bed books were keeping him busy this weekend it was almost over almost lunch time on this boring sunday he was frequenting the great hall for the meals but he only entered when he was sure none of them were there he had to wait during last night dinner until his mother left but the other meals were uneventful he heard laughs the other boys were coming to the dormitory and didntdo anything imagine professor flitwick running with those tiny legs of his and saying donttouch the furry thing dont touch the furry thing malcolm lesner squeaked in an imitation of professor flitwick all the boys laughed it was just too funny malcolm added layla was lucky kevin commented can you think of what snape would do if she made a mistake like that in potions various demonstration of sorrow followed that statement and they turned serious at once nathan observed the boys with the corner of his eyes while pretending to read his book andy decided to lighten up a bit you re destroying my classroom you stupid girl a hundred point from gryffindor he said trying but failing to imitate the potions master the boys chuckled at that you forgot the eyebrow kevin said and repeated andy phrase complete with an exaggeration of eyebrow movements everybody laughed at that well not everybody nathan didntlaugh in fact he was very serious and concentrated in not calling their attention to him and failed nathan does it much better kevin pointed out show them nathan all present turned to nathan waiting nathan stared at his book not knowing what to do well what he knew was that he would definitely not be imitating his father no way not now kevin i trying to study here he said and pretended to be concentrated in the reading nathan could see out the corner of his eyes that they were looking at each other he could even hear some of them commenting on something but he didnttake his eyes from the book the movement in the room soon ceased when most of the boys went back downstairs in the dormitory with nathan remained only andy and kevin what wrong with you kevin asked in an accusatory tone cantyou joke anymore where is nathan and what have you done with him nathan sighed finally deviating his gaze from the book i not in the mood for jokes all right i sorry if people trying to study in a school bother you he said harsher than he had intended nathan couldntbring himself to look at his friends after that i dontthink we re wanted here andy let not disturb the genius kevin said tugging at andy robes pulling him to the door andy resisted but finally gave in as soon as he was alone again nathan closed the book and threw it to the foot of the bed he wanted to pretend nothing had changed he wanted but couldn t what would happen when his friends found out and he still had to go to potions class tomorrow was his first class after what he d heard in snape office and he didnt know what to expect he decided not to think of it right now and prepared to go down to the great hall for lunch it was still in the middle of lunch time when he reached the top of the last flight of marble stairs that lead to the entrance hall and he stopped at the main doors of the great hall stood his mother and she d seen him nathan contemplated turning back to gryffindor tower but when she didnt come in his direction right away he was at a loss for what to do of what to think he then decided that if she didnttalk to him he didntneed to talk to her either as if hermione wasntthere nathan resumed making his way to the great hall when he arrived at the entrance hall level he heard nathan he ignored it and kept walking ignoring his mother nathan never looked away from his goal the gryffindor table and only knew hermione hadntfollowed him when he was seated he relaxed his shoulders and sighed chicken pie was the only thing he wanted to think about right now monday morning arrived and nathan could see the first rays of light invading the room he hadntslept at all not even the nice afternoon he had spent the day before had taken his mind off the class he had this morning yes after what he d called a successful encounter with his mother in the entrance hall nathan had regained some of his freedom back and had joined the other gryffindors in the common room the afternoon before he didntthink professor snape would come after him in his common room although he d done that in the past but nothing that had passed the day before mattered now not when he would be the one going to professor snape encounter now and not the other way around what would snape do what would snape say how could he face the man nathan didntknow and wasntmuch interested in finding out the room was brighter now the more the time passed the less nathan knew what to do the first of his roommates stirred in slumber awakening for the day that had started more movement voices nathan didnt move though he could see through the gap of his curtain that some of his roommates were up and dressing for the day i can do this he rose from the bed and started dressing in his uniform as he did every week day i a gryffindor i can do this he entered the bathroom all that was left of his morning rituals was brush his hair and teeth and he would have nothing else to do to postpone breakfast and class with his father he felt a flutter in his stomach when he tasted the toothpaste he spent more time than usual washing his mouth and face and when nathan finally faced himself in the mirror he couldnthold his dinner in his stomach anymore he ran to a toilet nathan didnthear andy come in he was still concentrating on breathing wanting the nausea to go away nathan andy called are you ill nathan was about to answer when another surge of nausea took him i ll call cornwell andy said and after minutes he was back with the head boy what are you feeling mr granger the older boy asked nausea nathan managed between quick breaths what class do you have this morning nathan heard the boy ask potions andy answered professor snape wontbelieve you are ill the head boy told him and nathan lost control of his stomach again go for professor lupin it was a command to andy who left right away nathan sat eyes closed resting on the wall next to the toiled when his head of house arrived he really ill sir cornwell informed the professor thank you michael professor lupin dismissed the head boy nathan didntopen his eyes the flutter in his stomach was still there he felt a cool hand touch his forehead do you know what made you sick lupin asked nathan slowly shook his head no soon he felt the tingling of magic hitting his body professor lupin was casting some charm on him nathan sighed when his stomach settled feeling calmer than he d been in a long time he enjoyed the feeling for a while and then opened his eyes to find professor lupin studying him as if contemplating what to do with him better lupin asked yes thank you professor lupin offered his hand and nathan took it his head of house helped him stand waited while he washed his mouth and followed him out the bathroom do you think you can go to potions nathan stopped turned and was back inside the bathroom in an instant his body ignored the fact that there was nothing else left in his stomach professor lupin conjured a towel and offered it to him and nathan accepted without a word when he had calmed a little professor lupin spoke again i know it must be hard for you nathan but you cantavoid your father much longer nathan focused on the wall across from him why was this happening with him why did it have to be so hard even if you could keep avoiding him he a professor here professor lupin continued what would you do would you drop potions nathan looked at his head of house with hopeful pleading eyes no you cantdrop potions lupin said frowning at nathan why are you avoiding him in the first place is what i might ask i thought you wanted to know who your father was to meet him to talk with him am i mistaken no you re not nathan answered in a mumble then what are you waiting for the professor persisted i dontwant any of that anymore he answered and took a deep breath are you feeling better professor lupin asked do you think it safe to leave the bathroom it not my favorite place to chat lupin teased nathan took another deep breath before nodding he was feeling better they left for the dormitory where they sat on nathan bed professor lupin was again staring at him in a most uncomfortable way nathan shifted on his bed why are you avoiding your father nathan his teacher asked once again those brown eyes were relentless on him and nathan felt obliged to answer i not really avoiding him he said and knew he was being ridiculous the moment it left his mouth he kept quiet then not wanting to make things even worse what if severus came here looking for you what would you do then lupin asked nathan finally looked at his teachers face he wontcome it was a wish he would like to remain true why do you think he won t and nathan was again faced with the truths he been building since the day he found out professor snape was his father he wouldntlook for him because he didntcare at all for him professor snape wontcome after me because it hurt to think of that again and it would hurt even more to admit it aloud he doesntwant anything to do with me sir the knife that had been lodged in his chest since he found out twisted how can you know that lupin insisted i ve spent a month of detentions with him sir i know nathan didnt want to discuss that he didntwant professor lupin to come with any excuse of the sort he knew his mother would come up with i ve known severus since we were your age professor lupin started he cares for you as i dare say he never cared for anyone before it might not be evident as i ve told you he not an easy man to deal with and he far too complicated for simple understanding whatever has passed during that month of detentions it might not be what it seems nathan was skeptically listening to his professor opinion no one knew what had passed with his father during those detentions wouldnt it be better to actually ask him to actually hear from him what he thinks of you i cantbelieve you are afraid of doing that because you re the gryffindor in charge his head of house told him inclining his head to convey his utter disbelief in nathan not being courageous enough to do so maybe you should try maybe severus will surprise you he done this before lupin smiled at him i wontmake you go to potions today but dontexpect to be excused next week the teacher added more seriously dont think of what could go wrong when there is so much that can go well lupin stood i ll see you in class and with that he left nathan with a lot to think about even with remus words nathan was still avoiding severus the whole week never looking his way always avoiding the dungeons so as not to cross with him in the halls although he could feel those cold eyes on him whenever they were in the same room at least he had convinced himself that he would go to potions class no matter what it wasnt as if he had any other choice but he wouldntlet snape turn this into a nightmare the same went for his mother especially after the letter he d gotten from his godfather the library was a place he liked to visit and he wouldntstop going there on weekends because of her she had caught him in there on saturday morning it had been awkward but nathan had managed to dismiss her attempts in talking with him faith renewed in his strength nathan left the great hall for his very first encounter with his now known father he entered the potions classroom as if nothing was amiss taking his usual place in the front row nathan was very confident until the potions master entered the room through the door nathan didntlook his way he caught his breath and stared at the stained workbench open your books to page two hundred and ten professor snape said and started lecturing as he usually did nathan couldntplace the empty feeling that normal behavior brought to him he had put so much expectation into this encounter that he was somewhat disappointed with the man ability to act as if nothing had changed as the class progressed nathan confused frustration built into displeasure and hatred for his father apparent indifference nathan anger with the man only grew when they were set to brew the day potion there was no grace in nathan movements while he chopped and sliced and grinded he mechanically followed the recipe not even thinking about why he was actually putting all those roots and animal pieces together in a cauldron severus was walking between the aisles commenting on the procedures of every student like he did every class he was also taking points when necessary he didntwant nathan to feel things would be different now that he knew severus was his father he was the same professor that he met in the first class who his mother had met in her first class that wouldntchange nothing had gone amiss up until now severus had not asked him any direct questions and nathan hadntvolunteered to answer any of them either what severus thought was consistent with the ignoring game the boy had been playing since that evening he was almost at nathan cauldron now the potion wontstir itself miss parks he commented to the girl now frantically stirring her cauldron contents and continued to the first row of students stopping behind his son severus immediately noticed the lack of care nathan had used in the preparation of the ingredients sitting all mixed on a corner of the workbench the boy sliced the root with an unnecessary force taking uneven chunks of it and not caring about it severus peered inside the cauldron still silent its content was a horrid brownish color as he d presumed what color was the potion supposed to be at this point of the brew mr granger light yellow sir of course his son knew that and the correct answer didntsurprise him although the tone in his address had called his attention and what color is yours severus asked then you can see for yourself sir nathan answered without taking his eyes from the roots he was dilacerating severus bypassed the workbench to stand in front of him five points from gryffindor what color is your potion mr granger he asked again nathan looked inside the cauldron brownish i think but you knew that already sir the boy said and as if nothing was happening took a bunch of dilacerated root and threw in his cauldron making the mix hiss when he was about to throw a whole salamander tail in it severus held his hand nathan finally looked at him pure anger firing from those deep black eyes the whole class was pretending to work while observing the exchange what will happen if i let you add this to that soup you re making severus inquired holding his son eyes and hand let find out nathan said forcing his hand towards the cauldron severus held him firmly i wontlet you blow my classroom up just because you feel like it he took his wand from his robes and evanesco ed the cauldron contents ten points from gryffindor mr granger and you failed this assignment he added in a hiss finally releasing his son wrist i want an essay on the possible reactions these ingredients can produce if mixed improperly on my desk by the end of this class severus scolded the other students who more than quickly went back to work what is he playing at he thought when settling on his desk again he would really explode the cauldron that was a disturbing thought especially when severus knew his son was completely aware of that vengeance it was a possibility severus observed nathan scribing with a concern he didntshow in his face sooner than severus expected nathan was in front of his desk handing over a piece of parchment and turning back to grab his things and leave you re not excused from this class yet mr granger he told him sit down nathan looked enraged but he didntneed to be told twice severus looked at the parchment in his desk it was far from being a proper essay all it contained were lines of ingredient x plus ingredient y equals something they were all correct but that was not the point this was another affront to severus command the class was over and severus had reached to a decision you re dismissed he said but added not you mr granger soon they were the only ones in the classroom severus approached his son who was deliberately not looking at him i dontknow what you expected to achieve with such behavior but rest assure you that it will not be tolerated nathan didntreact severus placed his hands on the workbench if i had let you drop that salamander tail inside the cauldron i you and several of your little friends would be in the hospital wing now but i believe you haventthought of that he made a pause to let that sink in nathan head of course you haven t everyone safety is not your concern but mine nathan was refusing to look at him it was unnerving look at me severus commanded nathan didntmove his head but his eyes shifted to meet severus ignore me as you please be as mad as you want but donttry to explode a cauldron in my class severus voice was dangerously low nathan had his mouth in a thin line now go you re already late nathan took his things stood and before turning to leave he said what do you care severus watched the boy hurriedly leaving apparently more than i should severus answered to himself each day that passed the tension between father and son grew severus was being charged not only by nathan foul behaviors but also by granger daily letters the third weekend after his slip of the tongue approached and the only words he d spoken with his son were those exchanged in class at least one thing had changed after that day nathan now wasnt ignoring him like before no they didnttalk but they could be seen in the same room especially in the great hall for meals such as now severus had made a matter of power struggle to pass by the gryffindor table on his way out of the room every meal he wanted to make sure nathan knew he was being watched that he was around the first time he d done that he felt nathan stillness the following times he could only feel the anger his son directed at him today though when nathan saw that professor snape was leaving his seat he stood as well that new routine of passing by the gryffindor table every time professor snape left the great hall was unnerving nathan to no end but nathan had had enough of that dance and today he would pay back nathan friends stood with him they went to the main doors and were almost there when nathan felt his father was close enough to hear what he would say i have something to tell you he told his friends i found out who my father is you did andy exclaimed nathan could see with the corner of his eyes that he had his father full attention i did he nodded but unfortunately he dead his friends lamented the news as he d expected and he added it okay really it not as if my life would change much if he were not he was just a nobody and the reaction it brought to the potions master nathan hadnt predicted in seconds he was being grabbed by an arm this is just silly stop this nonsense right now his father hissed or what nathan asked back what will you do he defied you canttalk to me like that boy i ve lost my patience with your little hide and seek game and i wonttolerate more of your disrespect as if i owe you any respect you mocked me every time i entered your classroom watching me make a fool of myself you could have told me but all you did was to treat me like a stupid dunderhead then give me a reason not to treat you like one ten points from gryffindor snape growled take ten take a hundred take how many bloody points you want i dont care nathan voice was loud enough to call the attention of the whole school you are the monster everyone says you are i will never respect you i hate you nathan growled i hate you let me go he bellowed and pulled his arm free severus released his son eyes lost in the expression of true hatred in nathan face even after his son had left running he just stood there nathan words hurting his shattered soul he felt a hand on his elbow and for a ghost of a moment he wished it was granger and not minerva s severus what has just happened here the seriousness in the headmistress tone brought him back to his brooding scolding persona and severus realized all the eyes on him it a long story headmistress if you ll excuse me he told her leaving the great hall minerva followed professor snape she called he stopped annoyed i want to know what is happening right now she was using her classroom tone with him i ll be waiting in my office she told him and left severus felt someone approaching coming from the great hall i dont want to hear what you have to say lupin he dismissed not even turning to face his colleague his presence only building in severus irritation i ll take care of nathan the werewolf told him nonetheless and left for the stairs severus sighed and followed minerva path you re telling me that hermione that she with snape this is just gross ron exclaimed in his outrage to harry news say it louder i dontthink the passing muggles heard you harry admonished ron was still astounded she dated me why would she want to go out with snape harry rolled his eyes ron that not the point i worried about nathan here of course i sorry it just that it snape poor nathan he didntdeserve being related to that bat yes and hermione wants them to interact we cantlet snape have any influence in nathan life hermione is just deluded if she thinks i ll sit and watch just because snape is nathan father harry commented she came to my house to tell me to leave it to her and snape i think she really believes snape is capable of being a good father she told you that ron asked incredulous she was really out of herself when i told her snape wasntcapable of caring for a rat but what can we do if she decides to bring snape into nathan life i mean hermione is his mother and and snape is his father ron contorted his face again i still cantbelieve she was capable of that well there have to be a way to convince her nathan sent me a very disturbing letter i showed it to her and all she did was cry harry tone was more lenient now i just want to help her see the mistake she making we ll find something mate ron assured patting in harry shoulder they finished their drinks and left the leaky cauldron but even after their departure a quill scribed frantically enchanted to take note of every said detail a smug witch waited the quill with some impatience maybe we can get the front page my dear yes definitely front page material a n yes i ve created a monster this chapter was huge now you

hands crossed in front of her awaiting his explanation he contemplated the armchairs facing the headmistress desk but decided he wouldnteven need to take a seat for what he had to say wouldnttake long severus fixed his eyes on the stern witch nathan granger is my son severus registered the shock on minerva face but had decided not to be affected by the witch reactions he only recently found out and he doesntseem very happy with the fact as you could see by his little display in the great hall hermione son minerva rationalized still shocked with what he d thrown at her although now she frowned so intensely that her eyebrows met it was you if by that you re saying it was me who impregnated her it was just what i told you minerva the boy is my son now if you ll excuse me i do have some things to do before the day is over severus turned to leave the office but minerva voice was firm severus snape dontyou dare leave this office without explaining yourself properly he turned to face her again i have nothing to explain all you need to know you now know i ll try to keep our shows of affection in private in the future so as not to disturb the school routine oh no you re not getting out of it like this severus she was a girl how could you she was your student from the time she was eleven for merlin sake a student minerva was obviously disgusted with the idea and he could totally agree with her if the woman knew what the circumstances were she would be horrified severus didntwant to stay there arguing with minerva about raping a former student not the most horrifying thing i ve done in my life he countered and couldntstop glancing in the direction of dumbledore portrait now if you dontmind minerva there is nothing else that concerns you on this matter other than the unacceptable behavior of the boy i ve already told you i ll try to keep this from happening again he turned to leave one more time i cantbelieve you minerva said to his back you were not even decent enough to recognize the child as yours you left her to take care of him on her own a child taking care of another severus alone he turned to face her at that donttalk about what you dontknow minerva it was hardly my fault what that crazy woman decided to do and now you re blaming her so typical of you severus minerva spat back at his accusation of her star pupil severus had heard enough he walked back the length he d crossed on his way to the door and was again in front of the headmistress long solid wooden table you think all your gryffindors are little angels dontyou they are incapable of making mistakes either arent they well i ll give you some stark news minerva she chose to raise that child alone not me she was foolish to hide him from me all this time and then decide it was a good idea to let the boy know she your precious know it all gryffindor minerva not me the shock on her face was so foreign this time that some of severus rage was abated and turned into a sick smugness he smirked at the wordless witch i dontthink you were prepared to hear that your lovely hermione granger is not the perfect woman you all think her to be you didntknow minerva asked still dazed with the revelations severus smirk dissolved no i didn t and now it too late for anything isntit minerva seemed lost in thought eyes focused on a point of the table she finally looked back at him she told you when she was here after you found him in the forest no minerva erase the image you have of that supposedly responsible and strictly correct girl from your mind she never told me and i dont think she would have anytime soon and before she could say anything he added i found out on my own during detentions minerva nodded to herself that was why you wanted to get them to be supervised by another teacher she was back to studying him again you were denying him she accused i wontdiscuss my actions with you minerva what i do regarding the boy is my decision only was all he said to that severus was not stopped by the headmistress on his way to the door this time but by someone else severus called a voice from the wall severus closed his eyes his back to minerva and the portraits what has nathan decided albus asked softly not turning to face them severus said minerva can answer that he continued on his way out of the office and was gone in a flare of robes nathan slept poorly another night this was becoming a constant since he had found out snape was his father and it was tiring him what he had thrown in the man face the day before was well deserved he was certain of that so why wasnthe feeling good after such revenge why did every word of praise and every tap on his shoulder make him feel this odd sensation in his chest why was every word of professor lupin sermon the night before weighing on him making him feel guilty whatever the reason it was bothering him when nathan entered the great hall for breakfast many eyes turned his way he was expecting that his friends were patting him on the shoulder again supporting his triumphant entry after saying what many had dreamed of saying to the potions master but had never got the nerve his chest went tight when he realized even some slytherins were watching him with respect and went tighter yet when he found his father observing him from the head table averting his eyes quickly while being dragged along by his friends nathan was thankful when the subject left his enraged attack on the feared professor to go to more mundane matters he could delight himself in a carved out moment of anonymity to try to calm the feelings that were invading him since he d met his father unwavering eyes he was so concentrated in not taking his own eyes from his plate that not even the flapping owls bringing the mail broke his concentration but being invisible was rather impossible with someone calling his name what is it he finally asked andy after being called for the third time you re in the daily prophet andy said not taking his eyes off the newspaper am i that was totally unexpected why andy didntanswer nathan insisted why am i in the daily prophet nothing andy just stared at the parchment in him hands frowning seeming stunned let me see this kevin said grasping the prophet from andy numb hands what is it what does it say nathan inquired once more he looked around and saw that others reading the paper were looking at him and he didntlike the way they were doing so he didntlike it at all when he was about to take the newspaper from kevin hands the boy said you re snape son his friend was frowning much like andy had been only now nathan knew why what nathan shrieked and took the offending parchment from kevin he couldntbelieve it there it was on front page for everyone to see father of war hero hidden son revealed since the beginning of the school year much has been said about war hero hermione granger heir hogwarts first year nathan granger and the connection of his birth to her departure from the wizarding world it was speculated that the young boy was the offspring of an old childhood love of the muggle born witch thus her choice to raise him among muggles or even that he could be an illegitimate son of none other than harry potter however it has been uncovered and confirmed by a trustworthy source that the father of this poor boy is known murderer of the great albus dumbledore ex death eater professor severus snape this revealing news brings the whole mystery into a new light and other possibilities as to why the brilliant witch left the wizarding world so many years ago arise shame fear the secrecy of her son paternity which according to the same source was kept for all these years even from her closest friends seems to lead strongly to the veracity of these suppositions nathan didntneed nor want to read more all he needed to know was there and the enormity of it was apparent in all those eyes on him what would he do now he searched for his father eyes and found them on him like so many others a voice got to him above the rising hubbub in the great hall the prophet is wrong isntit there was undisguised hope in the way kevin asked him that snape is not your father you told us your father was someone else he added dismissively andy only stared at him measuring but his stare held pressure enough to make nathan admit with his silence the truth the news brought kevin seemed to be waiting for an answer though nathan i nathan glanced once more to the man at the head table then back to his plate he is he finally admitted for the few that could hear it the moment was really awkward what will they say nathan didntknow maybe awkward wasntreally making justice to the moment it was oppressing it felt like the great hall was going to close around him snape kevin asked again nathan looked up he tried another glance to the head table but this time didntfind who he was looking for nathan stood yes snape he spat and turned walking to the door his steps growing in speed with the volume of the voices in the great hall he crossed the threshold walked a few steps to the left and leant against the stone wall closing his eyes nathan wanted to make his heart stop beating so fast he exhaled heavily everybody knew who his father was that snape was his father nathan threw his head back to hit the wall a few times only then did he open his eyes again his father was across the hall on the top of the stairs that led to the dungeons looking intently at him he stared back until the man turned and went down the stairs come in hermione called the person knocking at her office door she didnteven lift her head to see who was entering since she was expecting william i just finishing this she added scribbling frantically in a notebook having her free hand up to emphasize her need for some time to finish the note she was taking nice office for a muggle institution hermione froze on hearing that voice though i would never believe someone who would tell me hermione granger had exchanged the glories of being a war hero for the simplicity of this muggle life if i hadnthave seen it with my own eyes the unexpected visitor added hermione was torn between being surprised angry and curious what would that woman be doing here those left in the wizarding world arent enough to satisfy your hunger for degradation and humiliation arent they good material for your sick creativity what do you want here a reporter goes where the news is the woman said clearly enjoying hermione distress i thought you might want to concede me an exclusive have you lost your mind hermione asked outraged with the woman blatant cynicism i ll never concede an interview to you skeeter i donteven know how you found me you re definitely not welcome here your record was updated with the ministry of magic when your son started at hogwarts as i sure you know rita told her conversationally while scanning the room by the way my readers would love to know more about him we should do a joint interview with you both hermione narrowed her eyes at that rising from her seat and reaching for her wand just when william arrived with a muggle in the room hermione would have to swallow the hex intended for skeeter i sorry i didntknow you had company william apologized you can look for me in my office when you re free excuse me he was turning to leave when hermione eyes never leaving skeeter hurriedly said there is no need for that professor brice she was taking her leave rita made little of hermione glare and turned her attention to william measuring him up in appraisal i see you re busy she told hermione still looking at william she took some rolled parchments from her purse and offered them to hermione you know where to find me if you change your mind i hope to see you and that lovely boy of yours soon hermione took the offered parchments just to make her go away faster she watched the reporter exit the room after another speculative examination of william hermione wished she could hex the woman and tell her not to even try to get to nathan but she couldntdo that without having to obliviate william next who was that woman he asked as soon as they were alone in her office only someone i would rather not have seen today she dismissed his question she was obviously still affected by skeeter visit and william presence although welcomed to help her get rid of the intruder moments ago was now restraining her need to curse the woman or even hex something are you all right hermione she sighed i ll be fine will there is no need to worry hermione forced a smile to reassure him you can go ahead and start the discussion with miss jensen i ll join you in a few she tried the smile again william looked at her for a short while before nodding and reluctantly leaving her office for that hermione was grateful she needed some time to calm herself properly and also understand why that bug came to see her hermione wasnt about to be fooled by that interview request no even skeeter knew hermione wouldntbe granting her with any interview never what did she want then threaten me through nathan that was when hermione remembered the bunch of parchments she was crushing she quickly flattened the newspaper and when the front page news hit her hermione gasped feeling helpless and hurt for nathan and even more enraged with skeeter she reread the printed news of her most guarded secret and although tears escaped her eyes in sadness hermione profaned the low woman and her trustworthy source more tears spilled from her eyes but she wiped at them angrily it is not the time for this hermione she admonished herself she had to be whole to fix what that woman had done it was highly frustrating to see everything she d planned ruined with only a few printed words this wouldntbe such a disaster if nathan and severus had grown closer already but at this moment when so much was yet to be sorted out she sat by her desk and stared at it there was nothing she could do now this last blow to her plans was definitely final hermione was trying to gauge the extent of the consequences no she didntcare for her reputation for what people would say about her hermione was worried this would make severus withdraw from them that it would turn nathan into a target for gossips he would not be ready to deal with or worse yet of labels he wouldntwant to fight off having nathan agree he was the son of a murderer would never do hermione nervously contemplated her next move her wait was definitely over she begrudgingly acknowledged if the time she d given them hadnt been enough for them to grow close to accept their parts in each other lives in a natural way she would have to make them do it now regardless hermione would make this family work for nathan sake she would bring those two together she would make her friends accept the facts and they wontneed to dread gossips ill intended news or anything of the sort ever again with that in mind hermione cleaned her face from the last tears and walked out of her office to meet william she would visit harry later in the day and would have everything settled for when she got to hogwarts tomorrow no caution needed now that everything was in the open she was on the offensive and would bring things to their proper place or her name wasnthermione granger lily it my turn to tip the owl sirius potter whined annoyed with his older sister dad lily you know thursdays are sirius turn to get the newspaper harry admonished the owl is getting upset dad he taking too long to tip it the girl defended herself sirius give the coins to the owl harry said yes dad the boy agreed dispirited petting the annoyed owl a couple of times more before paying for the day issue of the daily prophet harry took the rolled newspaper while dobby poured him some coffee you can help me feed the owls later but only if you eat the fruit ginny told her son who seemed to cheer up enough to oblige the potter breakfast progressed as usual until harry exclaimed holy crap sirius giggled at his father swearing harry ginny cautioned her husband before he would say something worse when harry folded the prophet and made to throw it across the room ginny grew worried he kept the newspaper but swore again damn sirius giggled again what wrong harry his wife asked nosy witch who cantsee happiness why cantthey leave people alone for a change harry pushed his plate away too annoyed to eat what did skeeter do ginny knew the beetle too well after so many years on the social spot not to know that what was upsetting her husband was her doing harry sighed are you in the newspaper again dad lily asked not really lily dontworry and eat your breakfast he told his daughter before leaving the table for the house library taking the offending parchment with him ginny sighed dobby prepare some toast and a cup of coffee on a tray for me please yes dobby do mistress mum why dad wonteat at the table i want to eat in the library too sirius protested when you grow up but for now you eat at the table dobby popped into the room with the tray she d asked for thank you dobby keep an eye on the children please she took the tray and left for the library she entered the room without announcing her intrusion and placed the tray on a corner of a desk ginny then approached her husband reaching out a hand to his shoulder while he stared out the window what wrong harry ginny accepted the newspaper he was offering her upon scanning the front page she understood his reactions and was astounded herself so it was snape harry didntreact to her exclamation ginny looked at him more closely you re not thinking of confronting snape about this are you because it not your business harry dontdo anything without talking to hermione i know he completed annoyed and feeling guilty with his wife first impulse to remind him not to interfere after reading the news i just saying this because i know how you feel about snape nathan is very dear to us and i know you re not happy to find out that hermione well that he a snape i just asking you to calm yourself before doing anything harry rubbed his forehead i dontneed to calm down ginny i already knew nathan was he closed his eyes and sighed ginny was perplexed you knew and you didnttell me she accused her husband how could you hide something like that from me now you calm down ginny i was going to tell you i only recently found out and just didnthave the opportunity yet didnt have the opportunity who are you trying to fool harry ginny never liked to be left out of anything how long have you been hiding this from me dont make a drama out of this ginny snape told me when i saw him last but hermione didntwant the news out but i your wife harry rolled his eyes it not as if i wasntgoing to tell you wait a minute snape told you ginny was starting to see past the fact her husband was keeping secrets from her you were sticking your nose where you shouldn t werentyou when will you learn harry damn it he swore to himself what are you not telling me ginny asked knowing her husband too well i didntwant the whole wizarding world to know it like this he pointed the newspaper in her hands i was just trying to help nathan to make hermione see she was making a mistake now you told skeeter ginny asked wide eyed no he answered but then sighed lowering his voice to add but i think she heard me talking about it by what she wrote harry took the offending newspaper she was waving at him and threw it in an empty armchair harry ginny was going to complete her lament but seeing his annoyance and knowing it was with himself she only approached him and reached out a hand in comfort squeezing his shoulder i was just trying to help him i his godfather it my job to protect him and look what i ve done now all his friends and teachers know he related to snape and it all my fault ginny just listened still too mad at him to disagree with his self accusation after some silence she asked what were you trying to help nathan with hermione thinks it a good idea to bring snape into nathan life i cantlet that happen ginny stopped her caress of his shoulder and stepped away from him harry turned to face her trying to understand why you re trying to separate father and son is that what you re telling me no that was not what he was doing he was protecting nathan from snape which was completely different in harry point of view can no one understand it you who never had the opportunity to know your parents are making an effort to take that opportunity from nathan she added he was not taking anyone opportunity of anything or was he all he was doing was trying to keep snape from interfering in nathan life thus taking the opportunity of nathan to know his father harry was shocked to understand that ginny was right what was i thinking i can see you understand what a stupid idiot you are for even thinking of doing such thing ginny added interpreting his expression right he sank down into an armchair ignoring the rustle of crumpled parchment taking his head in his hands all i could think was that i should protect nathan from snape you know what i think of snape and that wontchange i just harry was still upset with the notion i didntthink i was in fact taking away nathan chance to meet his father i wouldntwant that ginny sat on an arm of the chair and pressed a kiss over harry head fondling his hair i glad you can see this now i hope it not too late for you to fix whatever foolish thing you ve done already harry looked at the woman he loved with reverence she was really special in a quick move harry brought ginny to his lap and kissed her deeply what would i do without you he smiled at her but the smile dissolved when he yelped and rubbed his arm where she d just hit him she stood from his lap and glared at him that for hiding things from me harry james potter ginny was at the door leaving when she turned to remind him pointing the tray on the desk eat the toast before leaving for the ministry after a disastrous breakfast a morning spent mostly in silence and ignoring the staring of his classmates nathan truly expected to meet his mother at lunch although it wasnteven friday yet he thought she would have come after reading the newspaper it would have been nice to have her here even though he was not on speaking terms with her at the moment nathan missed her nonetheless now more than ever the afternoon classes passed mostly like the morning ones his best friends were not avoiding him but they werentacting as usual either they rarely asked him something and didntinclude him in their conversations it was clear to nathan that they wouldntwant to spend time with him now that he was officially snape son that was why he was taking dinner in a far corner of the gryffindor table that night he was still aware of all the staring he was attracting but he preferred that to his friends indifference to his presence at least his father was missing from both meals one pair of eyes less to stare at me nathan though not really admitting what his father absence really meant to him at the head table headmistress mcgonagall was quite aware of the lonely boy taking his meal at the gryffindor table and the empty seat by her left she turned to lupin and asked have you seen severus today not after breakfast no lupin followed minerva eyes to the far corner of the gryffindor table and assured her i ll talk to him and see if he needs anything minerva looked back at remus and understood he was talking about nathan she nodded he looks even more like severus at his age when he being reserved it was remus time to nod you dontseem surprised with the news remus minerva added conversationally i already knew he admitted as you pointed out nathan is quite a reminder of severus at his age i cantbelieve i didntsee the signs before she confessed you were our teacher minerva i would be alarmed if you would remember how all your former students looked when they were kids he smiled at her again looking at nathan he added i was severus classmate though it easier for me to see the resemblances between the two of them and he has much of his mother too she added he a gryffindor remus smiled mischievously at her minerva couldnthide her mirth when she said poor severus remus left the head table short after that he was taking a seat beside nathan his back to the table before the boy could say anything not very hungry today not really nathan answered maybe avoiding your friends is taking your appetite lupin suggested i not avoiding anyone it seems i made the wrong assumption there must be several reasons you re eating at the far end of the table i sure nathan sighed i just making their life simpler this way they dont need to make an effort to chat with snape son why an effort should be needed to chat with you nathan you re the same wonderful kid you were yesterday lupin assured him nathan smiled sadly at his professor he knew his head of house was trying to cheer him up being always so nice with him but nothing professor lupin said would change what the others thought of him now that he was snape son do you think you re less than you were before finding out you were severus son nathan looked back at his professor to find his penetrating look on him no he simply answered good lupin nodded because you re not they were silent for some moments following those statements lupin broke the contemplative silence you know where to find me if you need anything donthesitate in doing so he patted nathan on the shoulder and left for the main doors professor lupin was always there when he needed and he couldntavoid thinking her mother had chosen the wrong teacher to be his father nathan looked around then and found he was almost alone in the great hall he d been so lost in thought that he didntrealize the time going by he stood and made his way to the common room he wasnt surprised when every gryffindor forgot what they had been doing to look at him the moment he crossed the portrait hole but he couldnt say the same when andy called him from a far corner why didntyou eat with us the boy asked when nathan was closer although he could see that andy was really intrigued by his behavior during dinner nathan didntneed to be a genius to notice the discomfort of the others with him he was somehow happy that andy had called him over there but he didntwant to spoil the others night by staying i was late and didntwant you to have to wait until i was finished to leave the great hall nathan finally answered i guess i ll see you later in the dormitory i have some reading to do before class tomorrow then addressing the group as a whole he said good night some answered others didn t nathan couldntsay who was in which group he was leaving the common room for the dormitories as soon as he bid his leave if he had looked he would have seen andy sad face while watching him go later that night he was on his bed the curtains hiding his opened eyes in the darkened room all the boys were already there presumably sleeping as he also should have been when he heard a whisper nathan he closed his eyes nathan are you still awake his friend insisted nathan had decided to ignore andy when a raven haired head invaded the space of his bed through the crimson drapes what is it he finally gave in i want to talk to you andy whispered back nathan sighed and sat up on his bed giving space for andy to do the same nathan took his wand and whispered a lumos why are you avoiding us the boy asked nathan sighed again dropping his eyes in the dim light i know what you re doing andy and i appreciate it but i cantmake the others be around me when it clear that they dontwant to andy was going to protest but nathan anticipated i know you still want to hang around with me both smiled nathan sadly but i dont believe the others think the same now that i professor snape son it was a bit of a shock andy admitted i know nathan agreed sorrowfully maybe they need some time to get used to it his friend suggested i need some time to get used to it another sad smile did you know he was your father when you fought him yesterday andy asked nathan frowned at himself before admitting yes oh was andy answer to that a tired silence fell upon the two friends andy yawned it late nathan said at length yawning as well he was actually getting sleepy now see you tomorrow andy said climbing out of nathan bed to go back to his own nathan murmured a nox and was finally sleeping this day away hermione left her footprints on the snow as she made her way through the frozen grounds of hogwarts castle she walked fast against the wind her cheeks flushed from the cold she had gone to visit harry the day before expecting to find resistance to her desires once more but the man who met her was a completely different version of him well not completely different but at least willing to give up his affront in the nathan interacting with severus issue even if with sneers and frowns good for him hermione had thought because she had gone there with the same resolve she was reaching the school with now to sort things out no matter what she flung one of the heavy doors open and was bathed with welcomed warmth hermione cleaned most of the snow from her clothes and took a deep breath it was not long past noon but nathan should be free of duties by now he didnthave classes on friday afternoons nor did severus she made her way up to remus office hermione had contemplated how to approach her son after these weeks of no communication she had discarded looking for him in the common room especially after yesterday prophet her best chance was to ask remus to summon him to his office and see how things progressed from there she hoped nathan would be more willing now that would make things easier for them all remus answered her knock with a smile i glad to see you hermione he stepped back to allow her entrance it good to see you too remus what can i do for you he asked settling back behind his desk hermione took an armchair facing him i was wondering if you could summon nathan for me of course lupin answered solicitous he withdrew his chair only enough to address the portrait to his left sir gryffindor would be so kind as to fetch mr granger from the common room the founder made a bow of courtesy and left the confines of his canvas thank you hermione expressed her gratitude to remus not a problem he assured her with a smile how is he i mean after the newspaper did severus speak with him after that she couldntcontain her anxious curiosity seeming to realize that she worried her bottom lip before adding i sorry you wouldntknow if he did i just worried i happen to know that he didn t remus answered nonetheless she looked at him for a moment then nodded nathan is he a little sad and confused with the way things are developing but that was to be expected it was not supposed to be this complicated she admitted in a lament godric gryffindor reentered his painting at that moment he on his way he offered thank you sir lupin smiled at her she smiled back i would offer you some tea but i off to a class in a minute you can use my office for the time you need she stood at that with him following suit there wontbe necessary thank you i ll wait for him outside i have another place in mind for this conversation i glad you re here hermione he admitted i very fond of nathan and have a great faith in you thank you again remus i dontthink i ve thanked you enough for everything you ve been doing for my son it the least i can do he said accompanying her out the door and through the still empty classroom back to the halls of the third floor when she turned to him to thank him again she found his eyes locked somewhere over her shoulder she turned to see what had caught his attention and observed nathan approaching good luck he wished before greeting a third year arriving for class and reentering the defense classroom hermione waited her son move toward her among older students slowly she wanted to hug him right there he seemed so sad but that would not do she had to control her emotions or she wouldntbe getting what she was there for when he stopped in front of her quiet she told him i asked professor lupin to call you she still wanted to hug him i thought that must be the reason nathan told her we need to talk she said may i assume that wouldntbe a problem her words were objective and firm but her need to hug him only barely bearable nathan shrugged it okay he agreed dispassionately never meeting her eyes preferring to watch the movement in the hall at least looking up from the floor hermione reached a hand to his shoulder unable to resist anymore come then she beckoned and started for the marble staircase she smiled with herself when he didntobject to her touch she was even curving her mouth into an actual smile when he leaned closer and she could now involve him in a half hug they walked in silence marveling in the simple company of one another until the corridors were emptier you worried me with how you ve been acting she confessed there wasntan hour spent in my day that i wouldntthink about you of how you were doing feeling i was thinking about you too he confessed next making hermione tighten her one armed hug while they descended another level of the castle so you donthate me she intoned in a question nathan shook his head you were angry and hurt i understand she helped him he nodded i sorry things werenthow you hoped they would be they got out of hand and that was not how i wanted them to progress either she let her words sink in continuing to guide him around the castle they were a few steps from the entrance hall when she decided to disclose her intentions that why we re all going to talk today as a family and will start to bring things to how they were supposed to be since the beginning nathan stiffened by the time she d said family do you mean talk with him he faced her for the first time that day eyes wide as if she was saying some absurdity precisely she answered urging him into the entrance hall so they could make for the dungeons nathan disentangled himself from her arm shrugging it off nervously but she held him by the hand i not meeting him he stated we ll both be meeting him she countered trying to assure him confidence by including her i agreed to talk to you not him hermione could see he was getting more agitated nathan there is no reason to postpone this anymore come we ll just talk she pulled him a couple of steps towards the dungeons you cantmake me talk to him he raged visibly losing control throwing his weight in the opposite direction she was willing to take him yes i can but i was hoping you d be willing to cooperate to put an end to this inane situation she answered while he shook his head in denial of her every word trying to free his hand no i wontgo there mum i won t he pulled against her hold angry stop this nonsense right now she hissed you re not five years old anymore for god sake you re acting as if i was dragging you to your death or something hermione was expecting some resistance but nothing so desperate like this it got worse he hates me mum believe me he doesntwant to see me please he whined trying desperately to free himself from her firm grip that enough she said briskly both annoyed and somehow scared by such strong denial she summoned force to her resolve and said still in a harsher tone than usual he doesnthate you nathan she took a deep breath to calm herself and went very close to him face leveled with his looking seriously into his eyes here is the thing you are coming with me down there like it or not you can keep walking like the capable boy you are or i can petrify and levitate you there what will it be nathan was staring at her in disbelief on the verge of tears after that statement hermione hated the way she was forcing him to agree to this meeting but she had made up her mind they had no choice in this the three of them were going to come to an understanding and today calmer determined but with her heart aching she turned to the last flight of stairs and urged come tugging at him to follow they got to the potions master office and hermione knocked having nathan between her and the door her heart was beating faster with the prospect of finally getting there to this meeting of having her son and his father together knowing of one another if only she could be sure of severus receptivity he not here nathan said to the lack of answer to her knocks trying to evade her hands to go back from where they d come she held him firmly in place and tried for the doorknob with no success she turned to go further into the dungeons taking nathan with her becoming more nervous and anxious with each step they took what if severus refused to answer her stopping in front of the next door hermione forced those thoughts away trying to focus on her gryffindor traits and knocked where are we nathan asked alarmed your father quarters she answered and nathan tried to escape her hands again mum he must be busy we can come back another time he tried but she wasntlistening concentrated on her goal severus open up hermione called knocking harder nathan was looking at her as if seeing her for the first time shocked with her boldness towards the feared professor he not here mum let s nathan suggestion died when the door opened in front of them held by a scowling severus snape what do y severus tirade was cut short by the sight of nathan good afternoon severus hermione greeted as if nothing was amiss and pushed a reluctant nathan into severus living room not waiting to be invited seeming to regain his power of speech severus questioned what the meaning of this we re here to have that conversation she answered right away what conversation i have agreed to none of this hermione gave him a pointed look dontbe obtuse it doesntsuit you severus we re having this conversation in spite of your agreement to it i wontbe waiting on you two to start working things out between us she looked at both her boys this time severus glare would have scared some of the deceased dark lord minions nathan looked from his enraged father to his mother still holding him by the shoulders as if waiting for the impending duel hermione returned severus glare unwaveringly donteven start severus we re not getting out of here before working this through and with that she moved nathan with her to one of the sofas coaxing him to sit and making herself comfortable by his side severus growled have you lost the rest of the sanity you had woman i not playing your little games anymore now do get out he barked out hermione didntmove staring at severus with her chin up not until we have talked we need this family meeting severus family what family severus was pacing in front of his guests he stopped in front of her to add gesticulating as if she was younger than their son there is no family granger there will never be she frowned at severus of course there is she countered outraged leaving nathan alone on the sofa to confront severus with full force we re nathan family i his mother you re his father a family he snorted in her face this severus motioned to the three of them is not anyone definition of family maybe not before hermione had to agree but from now on it is this can never be granger give up severus affirmed again annoyed it past the time you abandon your pathetic dreams of all happiness and smiles then tell me severus since your inner eye seems able to see our future why cantthis be a family she dared him oh how this man could infuriate her he bared his teeth to her you damn know why this will never work granger i dontthink i do no do enlighten me severus severus bared his teeth again this time actually growling why did you bring him with you this is not a matter to be discussed in front of a child i beg to differ she countered him again you need to put aside your differences you haventtalked to each other since nathan found out the truth about you she told him matter of factly and we need the whole family for a family meeting she added severus rolled his eyes stop with the family crap you haventconvinced me why we cantbe a family yet maybe you should stop with the crap she challenged and that did it you asked for this granger he started getting closer to her threateningly do you really want to know why this will never be something resembling a family because i wontinflict my presence to someone who hates me just to make this fantasy happen for you your son hates me severus finished saying that with the most dangerously low voice his argument had seemed to have the effect severus expected silencing granger or at least one of them i donthate you came the small voice from behind the woman what severus asked in obvious disbelief hermione came out of her daze and turned to her boy on the sofa who held his head in his hands she sat back on the sofa and caressed nathan head of course you don t honey she asserted him no one hates anyone here he does nathan looked up to his father to deliver his accusation he never wanted me around always sending me away for no reason he doesnteven come to the great hall to eat most of the time and and he tried to get another teacher to supervise my detentions oh for merlin sake severus said mostly to himself pinching the bridge of his nose as if plagued by a headache hermione sighed so they thought one hated the other what a mess she took a deep breath and started severus doesnthate you nathan far from that actually he cares for you and is always worried about you when that didntseem to affect nathan much she continued when you were having trouble with malfoy he contacted me to tell about the situation and to ask me to talk to you about it he made you that necklace at christmas so he could know when you were sad or in danger even if he wasntaround she knew her words were having some effect when she saw nathan look speculatively at severus who now had his back to them and faced the hearth hermione carried on with her speech one night you were having a nightmare and severus could see your distress through the necklace he came looking for me so i could wake you up and take care of you he was there with me nathan until you fell asleep again severus exhaled audibly bowing his head was he ashamed of her telling nathan these things she wouldntback down now that she knew nathan was within a step of persuasion when you heard his conversation with harry the day you found out we were both very worried about you as you might imagine her voice was breathily soft her hands caressing his head severus and i searched through almost the entire castle for you before we found you sleeping in the trophy room i wanted to wake you up and see if you were injured but he held me back and carried you in his arms to my bed he helped me tuck you in for the night and watched you while i talked with harry and professor lupin she paused and looked at severus still form contrasting with the light shadowing him from their view then turned back to their son whose black eyes were softened by what she d told him to be sure she added your father cares a great deal about you nathan hermione permitted the silence to soothe the air between them the crackling fire lanced shadows on nathan contemplative face she knew she d made through nathan inclined his head is it true he asked his father severus didntturn to them or made any sign that he had heard him hermione stood and approached slowly severus she called tentatively he looked at her from the corner of his eyes then closed them she reached a hand to touch his shoulder in an encouraging gesture and he sighed with the touch answer your son she asked softly he stepped away from her hand to turn and face nathan severus locked eyes with his son for a moment before finally answering i dont hate you their eyes continued to hold one another for what seemed an eternity and nathan nodded his acceptance to his father confession that it we re finally getting somewhere hermione risked smiling at them it was severus time to nod even if reluctantly i think this puts an end to any plan of cauldron sabotage and yelling in the halls he arched an eyebrow to nathan nathan lowered his gaze to his hands i sorry sir hermione looked quizzically to severus but he didntoffer any explanation to that now if that was all i do have things to attend i wasntexpecting to be locked in a meeting for the afternoon he added looking pointedly to hermione this time before she could deny that dismissal nathan was on his feet and heading for the door well their first family meeting was officially over wait for me in the hall nathan she called after him before he could disappear into the castle she wasntfinished with him yet nathan muttered his agreement and left the room when the door clicked closed she turned to meet severus and almost collided with him she didnthear him approaching i dontlike surprises he told her bear in mind that this sort of intrusion will not be taken lightly in the future he wanted to intimidate her she knew to caution her with his looming figure and deadly low voice but his proximity had a very different effect on her if she had stayed behind to say something to him she didnt remember anymore mesmerized as she was by the moment realizing she d been staring at his lips she averted her eyes looking for something to say she tried her voice and felt her mouth was dry she darted her tongue to lick at her lips and cleared her throat severus stepped back and she wanted to follow but didn t i hope to see you at dinner hermione said and felt foolish like a silly teenager i dontthink i have a choice he answered crossly she suppressed a sigh of disappointment with his answer and turned for the door indeed you don t she was gone severus heard the echo of the door closing and was free to frown at himself what had just happened here no he wasntreferring to the invasion of the infuriating woman into his private space bringing their son with her to trick the boy with this false family she had created in her insanity he would be worrying about that later what was bothering him right now was that heavy lidded eyes had fixed on his lips that tongue that had darted out to moisten her own and most definitely the raw need he felt so strongly of kissing them until they were swollen and she was breathless in his arms damn it he admonished his treacherous mind he knew the images he witnessed today and those he would conjure later would be filling his dreams in ways he would not have wanted essays where did i leave those essays he urged himself to think heading out of his quarters to find occupation for his mind in his office a n yes a family meeting with many good outcomes i proud of myself for achieving that actually 0 of course i would be lost without my angel ginnyw and friends such as haley they were holding my hand and pointing me to the right direction all this time thank you 0 on a sad note snakyroxy is no longer my beta 0 she left the fandom for a while because i hope she comes back but indigofeathers was generous enough to take her place and help ginnyw thanks indy 0 coming next nathan feels what it like to be a snape and hermione wants the family meetings to continue disclaimer not mine it all j k rowling s beta readers ginnyw and indigofeathers thank you very much a n chapter twenty three nathan feels what it like to be a snape and hermione wants the family meetings to continue chapter 23 being a snape hermione emerged from the potions master quarters with her self control shaken nathan who had been waiting for her as asked mistook her unfocused eyes for disorientation i here mum he said approaching her hermione shook herself from her thoughts come on honey she placed a hand lightly between his shoulder blades to lead him out of the dungeons nathan let himself be led giving no resistance this time since he had left the so called family meeting he d been immersed in a tangle of new thoughts and feelings shattering his previous assumptions and feeding his internal confusion the moment his mother had told him they were going to meet his father his heart had ached and his first reaction had been dread his mother behavior at professor snape door had surprised him with her lack of caution when the feared professor answered his mother insistent knocks and she had pushed them both inside nathan had thought there was no way the three of them were going to walk out of those quarters unharmed he had watched in silence while his parents argued not knowing what else to do to say that he d been surprised by the path their discussion had taken would be an understatement the way his mother had spoken about them being a family about the meeting being a new start for them had struck his heart with shaking force only his father denial reminded him of the surrealism of it all when professor snape had hesitated in answering why they couldntbe a family nathan hopes destroyed the night he d found out who his father really was were reborn and he longed again to have the family his mother was so vehemently saying they were he wanted his mother to win that argument and when his father had said the only reason their family would never exist was nathan hatred for him he had to interfere nathan sighed at the top of the stairs they had just climbed to the first floor he d made professor snape really think he hated him when he actually didn t but at the time nathan had been so angry and frustrated with the man that he d felt the need to scream at him to get past the wall the man seemed to have around his feelings when he left the great hall that day nathan had thought nothing of what he d said only enjoyed the victory but if he were to be honest with himself the stunned look in his father eyes had haunted him no he didnthate professor snape but nathan knew the man hated him and he d said so today only to find out that professor snape hadnthated him either then what had been all that that hatred he felt emanating from the man there was no other word for that and yet his father had said with all those words that he didnthate him if all that his mother had told him today if half of it was true facts his father had not denied not a thing then that could only mean he didntknow what to think of professor snape anymore nathan looked at his mother face and could see she was also lost in thought he d seldom seen her act the way she had today so forceful and determined he d forgotten how strong she really was maybe because he knew very well how to get to her how using her vulnerability to all things related to his father made her feel he felt ashamed for using her feelings against her and lowered his eyes to watch the stones of the castle pass under his feet he was sure she would scold him for all he d said to her for all the accusations he deserved it she was such a special woman the best mother there was and he d told her he didntneed her that he hated her what was wrong with him why would he say he hated people when he didn t just because he had been mad at the world it didntmean he had the right to do so but he hadntknown what else to do that day and yelling accusations at her was all he had in him they reached his mother quarters and she used her wand to bring down the wards the vision of his mother doing magic had always awed nathan and it wasntdifferent now it reminded him of how things were before hogwarts of how happy and simple life was even without knowing his father nathan vision blurred with unshed tears and the emotional load from these weeks and especially the meeting they d just returned from began to overwhelm him he longed for the happy and simple life he had only now he wanted his father to be part of it a family just as his mother said they crossed the threshold and his mother closed the door behind them a tear slid his cheek unable to be held back was it possible would he really have a complete family now another tear rolled down after the first nathan there are some things we need to talk about the first being how you ve behaved all these she trailed off are you crying she asked in a much more lenient tone he was fighting the tears as he shook his head in denial not trusting his voice yes you are she disagreed what wrong honey she touched his face to wipe away another stubborn tear i he squeaked then tried again i dontknow hermione cupped the back of his head in her right hand and drew nathan to her chest her other hand on his back pressing him to her hugging him i believe this was the last strength you had i sorry i had to force this meeting honey but you needed to know you were wrong about each other you understand dontyou nathan nodded against her chest knotting his hands in her robes she kissed his head and brought him with her to the sofa where she sat them both down and pulled nathan onto her lap hermione took his head in her hands and brushed his hair back from his face smearing his tears i very proud of you for admitting you donthate your father she told him that was really brave she smiled at him nathan nodded again now calmer than a minute before he gulped down the last of the lump in his throat and said i didntknow professor snape thought i hated him for real i was just really annoyed with him for all he did to me i know honey hermione drew his head to her shoulder and nathan made himself more comfortable to lie against her i thought he hated me he confessed by way of an explanation for his actions now you know he doesn t she said simply nathan nodded again and silence surrounded mother and son with her caressing and holding him nathan was deep in thought for another moment before deciding to clear up another point you know that i donthate you dontyou mum because i said i did but i didntmean it you were angry and frustrated but what you said was really hurtful but i didntmean it he insisted looking her in the eye i know but you have to start choosing your words more carefully it hurt badly when you said that even knowing you didntmean it i sorry he apologized and hugged her hard burying his face in her neck she sighed and hugged him back try to think before you speak or act for that matter i dontknow what you said or did to your father these past weeks but i want you to know that he doesntknow you as well as i do and anything you say or do will be taken seriously by him she cautioned i know i wontsay things i dontmean ever again i hope you keep your word on this now move off onto the couch you re getting too heavy for me nathan reluctantly settled on the cushion but leant back against her side cherishing her ministrations too much to let them go quite yet while she continued to play with his hair he decided to ask some of the questions that had been lingering in his head for some time now if he cares for me as you say why didnthe look for me before hermione stopped moving her hand letting his hair escape from between her fingers he didntknow you existed until very recently she told him honestly how come nathan insisted i never told him he had a son just as i never told you he was your father this was confusing why he asked wanting to understand her reasons she didntanswer for a while but then began to move her hand over his head again and said when i found out i was pregnant with you i was very happy but also very apprehensive it wasntthe best of times to have a child i was too young your father had too much on his mind and the war was over for merely weeks even with all the difficulties i knew i wanted you more than anything you always gave me strength to live to start over after all the horrors of the war but i knew your father wouldntthink the same not at that moment she stopped her caressing movement again you see he was being judged for his participation in the war as a death eater and we were gathering evidence to attest to his role as a spy for the order of the phoenix even when he had already confessed to his part in dumbledore death nathan looked up to see his mother lost in memories she continued severus didnt make our work easier he thought he deserved to pay for all the things he had done under voldemort orders when he truly didnt have a choice he was absolved of course but i believe it took a while for him to accept the wizengamot decision he wanted to go to azkaban nathan asked not quite understanding his father from what his mother was telling him he did hermione confirmed looking seriously into nathan eyes in his opinion all he did during the war were the consequences of his choices and his choices alone so he thought it only fair to pay for them by being held there but we wouldntlet him go to azkaban for doing what he had to do to help harry and the order his participation in the war was crucial nathan he truly a hero much more the hero than people say i am but not everyone could see that and he was one of them nathan lowered his eyes to his lap but why didntyou tell him about me because he would have blamed himself for that too he would have thought that he was ruining my life by making me have a child at such a young age i sure he would have demanded that i give up on you when all i wanted was to have you more than anything in my life she pressed her lips to his head i couldntlet anyone get between my baby and me so i chose not to tell anyone especially not severus nor me nathan added i had plans of telling him and you every year after your first birthday but it seemed the right time never came until he finally found out he was really mad at me for keeping you from him and i so very sorry she finished in a whisper nathan sniffed i wished you would have told us i sorry i was so selfish and coward i really thought i was protecting you from all of this pain that you re going through right now but what good did it do you re suffering all the same you almost ended up hating each other and it my fault i hope it in your heart to forgive me one day nathan didntsay anything he didntthink he had much to say after that he definitely couldntsay he forgave her but he couldnt say he wouldn t either it was all too much to handle at the moment so he didn t it helped that his mother didntseem to be expecting a decision from him for now knowing his father hadntlooked for him during all those years because he didnteven know of his existence was a relief at least professor snape might still want to get to know him although nathan couldntsee how or why that brought a new question to break the silence what happens now which was answered with another question what do you want to happen now that sent nathan back into thinking about his new reality what did he want what will it be like to have professor snape as his father he d had a taste of what it would be like from his friends reactions to the news everything would be so much easier if you had chosen another teacher to be my father he sighed remembering how professor lupin was always so kind and helpful hermione chuckled that would have made you a completely different boy and i wouldntwant that she touched his nose affectionately with a finger smiling at him but it would have made my life in gryffindor easier now everybody looks at me as if i ll turn into professor snape at any moment or something i cantblame them who would want to be friends with professor snape son severus wontwin any popularity contests will he i sorry your friends in gryffindor cantsee past the house rivalry and the strict professor at least now you ll learn who your true friends are i suppose he agreed reluctantly but you still haventtold me what you want to happen from this point on everybody already knows i snape son i might as well be it nathan shrugged hermione smiled you wont regret it nathan i know you and severus will become good friends you have a lot in common she stopped her enthusiastic speech seeing the frown on nathan face what is it i dontthink i want to have things in common with professor snape oh dontbe silly dontyou want to be a good potion brewer dontyou want to know how to duel like him to be able to create new spells to be that courageous he can beat uncle harry in a duel nathan commented yes he can she agreed but he always cruel in class he countered i never said cruelty was something you should have in common with your father she refuted his argument you re not a different boy just because you know severus is your father and will now spend more time with him you re a sweet boy just and good most of the time and i would hope that remains the same i will have to spend more time with him wonti it ll be like detentions all over again nathan sighed detentions are punishment spending time with your father is not a punishment whatever he made you do while you were in detention it not what you ll do as father and son it made sense but nathan didnt know what snape and he could do together that didntfall into the punishment category he couldntsee professor snape having any kind of fun dontworry so much his mother told him you ll see how things will go naturally as if you had been doing things together always hermione stood up then and talking about things to do would you like to join me in the lab she extended her hand he accepted it with a smile after spending the rest of the afternoon grading essays he d retrieved from his office and catching up with some potion journals severus had to leave his quarters for dinner he hadntmet any staff members since breakfast that fateful morning preferring to have his meals in his quarters but tonight he would attend dinner in the great hall reflecting upon the woman last words to him this afternoon severus felt himself challenged to meet granger at dinner and make sure he made nothing of it when he arrived there he was greeted by the headmistress good evening severus it nice to see you she seemed to expect an answer which he didntgive her i was starting to think you were ill i had considered asking poppy to pay you a visit if you hadntshown up for dinner he was already sitting by her side when he retorted if i were ill i would be dead by now i was only busy i glad you found some time to join us today lupin said from minerva other side severus ignored the werewolf while making his plate he wanted to eat prove to granger he thought nothing of her childish challenge and go back to the dungeons to his lab that she d been occupying during the afternoon the only but was she was not in the great hall yet and severus would have to wait to make sure she would see him there he finally looked up from his plate and took in the hall while drinking from his goblet the first thing he noticed was nathan absence he must be with her severus realized and he wasntmistaken there he was walking beside his mother crossing the threshold of the main entrance they talked animatedly while she led him to a seat next to wood the normalcy of their behavior after everything that had happened was oddly calming to him severus had been worried about nathan since their meeting even if he didntwant to admit to it hermione found his eyes on them and they stayed on her while she made her way to the head table only when she nodded smiling did severus realize what he was doing and harrumphed minerva noticed how the boy faring have you talked to them yet she asked yes not that it any of your business minerva he tried to dismiss her he reminds me of you at his age she added conversationally ignoring his rude answer he nothing like me he answered frowning at his plate he has a lot of hermione too of course he a gryffindor for one ah so that the reason for all the meaningless chatter he concluded head of slytherin has a gryffindor son i shocked that headline didntmake it to the prophet yet the news would change how the wizarding world lived i sure minerva silence after his sarcastic tirade claimed his attention he glanced her way in time to see granger talking to lupin she was all smiles and even touched his shoulder while they talked of course lupin was melting into smiles for her too disgusting he thought but only out of jealousy how could she act as if nothing had changed or worse as if things had improved tenfold now that the world knew she had had some kind of association with him he had barely taken his eyes from his plate and she was all smiles and cheerily chatting disgusting he made a point of ignoring her eating fast granger exchanged more pleasant words with minerva is this a tea party he castigated her mentally minerva asked granger to join her for tea the next day following on the heels of this thought and severus smirked into his goblet then she did the unthinkable she took the seat on his left i see you made it to dinner granger said getting herself comfortable to have her meal and she is already annoying me i dine here from time to time he held firm against his impulse to roll his eyes she was silent while she made her plate adding to his nerves nathan is feeling much better after our first meeting we spent the afternoon in the lab together like we did in the old days she finally told him severus took his eyes from the table to search for his son nathan was eating quietly apparently left out of the conversation going on around him as he watched only wood had directed some words to the boy words responded to with only a silent nod severus frowned he adapting came the woman voice and he looked at her to see she had her attention on nathan too they re adapting she amended life will soon be back to normal severus doubted that he ll always be judged for his relationship to me he being tested not judged severus he has to prove he hasntchanged because they now know you re his father it wonttake long now that things are moving along better between the two of you he still didntbelieve her but he would not discuss this in the great hall minerva was already paying more attention to them than to her food granger fell blessedly into silence after his lack of argument though it was a pity it wasntfor long when do you think we can meet again the three of us she asked severus sighed and gave up on his pudding you do know that we ll have to meet regularly right she was arching an eyebrow at him the impossible woman since i here every weekend we could schedule something on sundays if that good with you he averted his eyes from hers to observe his son clearly playing with the food on his plate it took him a long moment but severus nodded his agreement it would do him good if you met without me at least once a week too she added now also observing nathan she then looked at him speculatively probably waiting for him to refuse their eyes met and he held them he could see her expression changing softening but never weakening such beautiful eyes we can discuss this later in my office he caught himself inviting severus eyes left hers searching the table he became uncomfortable with the moment and stood to leave i ll soon be with you she told him he blamed his traitorous mind for taking more meaning from her answer than was really there and his expression hardened severus nod was so stiff hermione would have missed it if she wasntstill staring at his angular face she d been lost in his eyes for a moment she was always mesmerized by how impossibly black they were she went back to her dinner but her mind remained on the man leaving the great hall the darkness of his eyes was similar but at the same time completely different from nathan s hermione wondered if it was because of the experience the lack of innocence impregnated in severus gaze wondered if those eyes had ever been like their son s nathan was always reserved but never shy since yesterday though he couldntmeet other peoples in eyes afraid of how they would look back at him like now such a contrast to the pleasant time he d spent with his mother until she d left him by the gryffindor table now he was alone again with his classmates who were decidedly ignoring him well not all of them andy was trying to pull him into the conversation but nathan didnt feel comfortable enough to really join he knew andy was kicking kevin under the table he wasnta fool nathan tried eating to see if it would lessen the awkwardness of the moment he kept his attention on his plate but the awareness of those looking at him was too heavy and so became the food he nodded every other time to what andy was saying and pretended to be eating until he would be free to leave for his dormitory the only thing keeping him in the great hall was his mother watchful eye from the head table nathan had promised her he wouldntavoid his friends so he had to stay his father had been watching him too what would he be thinking his mother was talking to him undoubtedly about their situation nathan frowned at the thought of him being a problem to be solved it was just as good that his friends stood to leave so he wouldnt have to think of it he followed them literally nathan kept behind preferring to walk alone well not as alone as he would have preferred a group of slytherins soon reached him just outside the great hall look if it isntthe new snape commented one of them a gryffindor is the head of slytherin son how come ironic dontyou think the boy sniggered nathan ignored him but one in their group didn t it not because he isntsnape son that was harder to ignore especially because he recognized that voice but nathan kept walking look at him he a weak whinny baby who goes straight to his mum and harry potter when he needs something pathetic snape son would never be like this malfoy continued nathan stopped and turned to them looking malfoy in the eye the slytherin smirked raising his chin in challenge the others were looking at nathan speculatively no one knew what would have happened if andy hadntshowed up to pull nathan by the arm away from the slytherins dontpay attention to them andy said in the middle of the stairs leading to the first floor nathan was still facing malfoy who hadntbacked away either you know he worth nothing nathan finally looked ahead and did as andy asked he didntknow what pissed him off the most malfoy calling him weak and whinny or doubting the legitimacy of him being snape son he wanted to growl in frustration why are you still not talking with me andy asked making nathan put malfoy words aside i not not talking with you andy they walked in silence as they continued through the halls and up another flight of stairs you re not talking with me andy said again nathan sighed what do you want me to say that it cold outside that professor binn assignment is boring he asked annoyed i have nothing to say did you talk to snape andy asked a cautious tone to his voice yes nathan answered sulkily a while later he added sort of and when nathan didnt fill in andy put forth the question what did he say there had been so little words from his father to him at the meeting he told me not to explode cauldrons and yell at him nathan sufficed to say that seems like snape andy nodded seriously and what did you say that i wouldn t andy nodded again wise answer nathan rolled his eyes but felt better for telling andy these things about snape as his father maybe his mother was right and all this would serve him to find who his real friends were andy was definitely one of them come in he called hermione entered quietly closing the door behind her she approached his desk and took an armchair facing it she waited he waited she sighed how do you want to proceed with the weekly meetings she finally asked if it inevitable sundays are fine i thought that had been agreed upon during dinner what about you and nathan she inquired i think i can arrange wednesdays after dinner if there is no detention to supervise nathan was afraid your time together would be like detention she remembered amused she sobered it wontbe right he occupied his hands with rearranging parchments already ordered for once i dontthink you should meet here in your office i think your quarters would be more appropriate she suggested that may help him understand the differences between the father and the teacher he nodded what do you intend to use this time for she asked next i thought meeting without you meant having my own agenda he arched an eyebrow severus could see she wanted to roll her eyes but was restraining herself impressively he wanted to smirk i think that leaves very little to discuss unless you want to talk about the weather she told him visibly irritated he smirked then in fact there is something else we need to discuss after the prophet circus there was an increase in the mail volume i need you to find out if he got anything i should know about skeeter was very considerate in putting him in the sight of my enemies i think he would have told someone about any threats but it wouldnthurt to ask i sure you can add that to your agenda severus she tilted her head as if he didntknow retaliation when he saw it fine he told her not wanting to concede her victory i ll ask him myself she smiled and kept smiling observing him he wanted to ask what she was smiling about but didnthave to he knew by now that she would be happy with the smallest of things severus liked her smile nonetheless what do you have planned for sunday he asked her her smile grew before she disclosed her plans for their scheduled meetings she wanted them to have dinner every week just the three of them to his skeptical look she spoke of how families talked about their days or in their case weeks during shared meals severus could have argued they were not an ordinary family but he decided having dinner with granger once a week was something he already did regardless the only changes would be where and the addition of nathan i agree he told her great we ll meet you in your quarters at five she smiled again i am looking forward to it why would she she a glutton for punishment he reasoned if you say so he said already imagining how awkward the evening would turn out to be i shall be there he took a parchment from his desk hoping that would be enough for a dismissal it settled then she stood to leave i ll see you at breakfast you know you will he answered he had the impression she had hesitated on her way out after those quiet words but he couldnt know for sure severus hadntlooked up after saying them after deciding he would be who he was regardless of what people thought of him nathan was feeling more confident that saturday morning he had accepted andy invitation to go to breakfast and was heading for the great hall kevin was with them but he seemed vexed well too bad for him nathan thought but intimately he felt sad about it anonymous eyes continued to follow him around nathan could sense them but he didntfeel too intimidated anymore andy didntseem to care so why would he they went to the gryffindor table talking about the transfiguration assignment apparently andy had missed him enough that even homework was something he was willing to discuss this early on a weekend nathan saw his mother already having breakfast sitting by his father side she smiled at him when she caught him looking professor snape only returned the look not changing his ever bored expression well nathan thought it only fitting for professor snape had never changed his way of acting all this time they took their seats and started to serve themselves kevin hadntspoken a word yet but nathan wasnt letting his uneasiness at that show he acted as if that newspaper had never arrived and talked animatedly with andy that was until talking was made difficult by the sound of the owls invading the hall many of the birds went straight to where nathan was dropping letters over his breakfast another handful of them went to the head table towards his parents but he wasntpaying attention to those since that one issue of the daily prophet nathan amount of mail had increased enormously that a lot of mail andy observed it been like this since that story about me on the daily prophet nathan told him it seems i a celebrity now he laughed andy did too are they asking for autographs andy joked one or two are nathan answered seriously andy eyes went wide what do the others say he wanted to know then most of them say how sorry they are for me others say i not to believe in what that article said that my real father is uncle harry nathan rolled his eyes and a couple say they were happy for me he finished the same two who asked for autographs kevin said breaking his self imposed silence when nathan was going to answer that a package fell between them this one was late andy pointed out holding the goblet that would have been where the package was dropped only a few moments ago hadnthe taken it before it for you nathan when nathan reached to take the box and examine it a bigger hand came out of nowhere and took it away nathan was so put out that he didnteven think before he turned to meet the thief and said hey that mine his father arched an eyebrow at him nathan eyes went wide for a brief moment before they narrowed i ll take the letters too snape said putting out his free hand palm up waiting they are for me nathan said calmly to his father hand they went quiet not moving in a war of patience and stubbornness all the students observed them attentive snape grew tired of waiting and snatched away the letters from the table mumbling to himself something nathan couldnt catch this move shouldnthave been unexpected but nathan was at a loss of what to do nonetheless it took him a moment before reacting sir nathan called leaving his seat to follow the man who was now fast approaching the head table snape didntstop professor he called again annoyed speeding up in his step to reach his father snape finally stopped and turned to him why are you taking my mail nathan asked coming to stand before him do you know any of these people professor snape asked back waving the letters in his hand i dontknow sir you stole them from me before i could read who they were from nathan glared his father was unaffected so what if i dontknow them they re still addressed to me he tried again they are still confiscated from now on you wontbe opening any correspondence from unknown sources now go back to your seat mr granger but nathan argument died when he looked at his father menacing pose arms crossed holding the package and the letters there was no arguing as nathan should have known by now he turned and went back to the gryffindor table fuming in rage who does he think he is to take away my letters nathan murmured with himself sitting next to andy again your father the boy answered him nathan shot him a murderous glare andy averted his eyes from nathan and started to eat quietly he cantcome here and confiscate my mail nathan protested unable to keep quiet after such thing they were addressed to me not him he bit savagely into a piece of toast and caught kevin staring what he spat at the head table someone else was staring and it was not at nathan hermione was trying to understand what had just occurred looking intently at severus you re gaping granger he told her dropping the letters and the package next to his plate and resuming his seat she closed her mouth and narrowed her eyes what did you just do you said i should take care of the correspondence problem i taking care of it you said you would talk to him about it severus i didntsee much talking going on she pointed out if you didntlike the way i handled this you should have handled it yourself he retorted eating scrambled eggs as if nothing was amiss missing her roll of eyes hermione took the pile of letters from next to his plate he grabbed at them to prevent her from taking them and they locked eyes she hoped her look was showing her lack of tolerance for this childish fight maybe it was because he let go with a sigh she went through the letters reading the names on them she stopped suddenly and moved a letter out of the pile shaking her head visibly irritated when she had finished she heard him say satisfied there was a letter from harry in the middle of them but i not expecting you to know that it not as if you looked or asked before taking them away how do you know there is no harm in that letter he asked arching an eyebrow oh please she stood taking said letter with her she passed by him on her way out and was positive she heard him chuckling he thinks it funny does he hermione wasntamused she reached nathan and greeted his friends there was a letter from harry for you she told her son i dontsuppose severus explained why he was taking the letters did he no he didn t nathan answered visibly annoyed taking the letter from her hand it for your safety she explained we ll talk more about it later today or maybe tomorrow during family dinner family dinner nathan asked yes every sunday we ll have dinner together you can look for me in the lab and i ll explain it all to you she kissed his head and left the great hall great nathan mumbled opening his godfather letter nathan didntwear his uniform when he met his mother in her quarters on the third floor they had agreed he would dress casually for their dinner together nathan couldntsee why dressing in jeans t shirt and a sweater would make any difference in anything but it seemed important to her hermione was waiting by the door also wearing casual clothes the crimson dress she liked to wear for going to the movies and a coat that looked like wizarding robes she greeted him with a warm smile ready she asked yes he answered trying to ignore the discomfort in his stomach arentyou wearing the necklace she asked next evening the collars of his t shirt and sweater so they would be in place with one another no he said calmly seeing the look that always preceded a lengthy argument he added i have it with me i want to know how it works exactly before i ll wear it again very well she conceded as long as you re willing to listen to his reasons his mother had told him professor snape wanted him to wear the necklace that was his christmas gift again the same one he had taken off the day he had found out snape was his father she had also explained why professor snape was confiscating his mail something nathan was still suspicious about this was the same reason why he hadntput the necklace back on yet despite his mother explanation nathan wanted to hear it from professor snape before making his decision it seemed reasonable they made their way to the dungeons where they would meet his father for dinner nathan wasnt surprised this time when they passed by professor snape office door and went straight to the next which nathan now knew was his quarters his mother knocked and soon the door opened good afternoon severus she greeted and was answered by a nod of the man head good afternoon sir nathan followed suit and received a nod for that as well snape stood aside holding the door open in invitation they stepped in and waited to be told to sit down when they were nathan took a seat next to his mother by the sofa while his father sat in an armchair close to it both facing the hearth nathan was staring the fire not knowing what else to do he could sense the tension in the air something that always made him feel uneasy coming in here had brought their last meeting to the forefront of his mind and it was like going through that all over again the things that had been said and how you have an amazing collection of books severus his mother said finally unfortunately she added dontyou think nathan nathan looked away from the fire reluctantly and took in the room two of the walls were covered with books from floor to ceiling something he hadntpaid much attention the last time he d been there it was an amazing collection of books yes he agreed there was silence again did you read them all severus his mother asked blessedly not to him most of them his father answered nathan tried to catch some indication of professor snape mood by his voice but couldn t it didnthelp him having his eyes fixed on his hands instead of the man face but doing the last was out of question we also have more books than we need and i think nathan read most of them too from all the books you ve read what would you call a favorite nathan there she was asking him again and such a tough question er nathan thought i couldnt choose one could you severus nathan took a deep breath with his mother change of target this was worse than an oral test no that was definitely an irritated no it seemed professor snape didntlike the interrogation either nathan heard his mother sigh fine we ll stare at the hearth for the rest of the evening she said nathan looked at her definitely annoyed he concluded he chanced a glance to his father and he was pinching the bridge of his nose definitely irritated nathan assumed he looked down to his lap again feeling engulfed by the awkwardness of the meeting when he remembered the necklace in his pocket he bit his lower lip and came to a decision taking the object in his hand i brought the necklace he announced quietly you were supposed to be wearing it not carrying it around his father told him now looking at him i want to know how it works before i ll wear it again it lets me know when you re in trouble the man said as if that was enough explanation nathan wanted more how i know the potion shows my mood but i dontthink that would help me much severus can see your mood too if you re in danger he ll know and will be able to go to you to help his mother intervened but how nathan insisted professor snape stood up and walked through a door behind where nathan sat a few moments later he came back with something in his hand nathan didnthave to ask this is a vial of the same potion you have on the necklace they re linked whatever color the necklace shows it shows in here too if you get in trouble i ll know why do you think i ll get in trouble it seemed odd they would be thinking and talking about it all the time you re a gryffindor snape said that what you do nathan narrowed his eyes at his father but his mother laughter made him look at her puzzled sorry she apologized and took a deep breath to sober herself your father and i have people that may want to cause us harm due to the war we re concerned that with the exposure you re getting someone would try to harm you somehow to get to us she looked very serious now we want you as safe as possible and if someone really dares to get to you we ll be there to deal with the imbecile is that why i cantread my mail either nathan asked we cantassume your letters are harmless professor snape answered you could have said so before nathan told his father he should have his mother agreed earning a glare from his father and i know how to defend myself from mere letters nathan added if you so badly want to know how sorry people are for you by all means have them back professor snape said there were a couple of them from people happy for me he countered and i dontwant them back you can keep them sir i just saying i can defend myself professor snape stood again then you wontneed this anymore he said taking the necklace from nathan hand nathan was taken by surprise he wanted to stand up for himself but he didntwant the necklace taken from him it was a christmas gift hermione seemed to understand what was going through his mind and interfered oh please honestly she stood and took the necklace from severus hand put this on nathan nathan obeyed the pendant glowed gold and so did the flask in snape hand i think we should eat now she added leaving the sitting area to go to the small table on a corner of the room nathan followed not wanting to stay behind with his father who didnttake long to join them the food was served by a house elf snape summoned as soon as they were seated at the table they ate in an awkward silence quickly and the dinner was soon over we ll meet again next week his mother told professor snape who nodded tiredly nathan you ll meet severus again on wednesday evening just the two of you i suppose it would be good to settle a time and place now nathan mouth went dry a meeting without his mother nathan wasntlooking forward to it my office at seven snape told him and it so sounded like a detention to him yes sir was his automatic response good evening severus hermione said they left nathan felt tired it was as if the muscles of his shoulders had collapsed from their bones melted all he wanted was to get to his bed and sleep a n no it not easy but i have faith in those three 0 i forgot to squee about an art miateixeira made for this story as a christmas gift for me well it never late to squee so squeeeeeee lol ah yes the link ferporcel dot livejournal dot com slash 55189 dot html and since i already squeeing i ll squee some more for the betas sake squeeeeee gin and indy you re wonderful thanks 0 coming next more scheduled meetings and some not at all planned disclaimer not mine it all j k rowling s beta readers ginnyw and indigofeathers thank you very much a n chapter twenty four more scheduled meetings and some not at all planned chapter 24 needing more than a name nathan was trying to follow professor lupin advice and move on with his life he d found the professor on his way up to gryffindor tower after sunday meeting and lupin had asked him how things had been seeming genuinely interested so nathan had told him professor lupin was someone nathan was starting to trust with these things and wednesday scheduled meeting left him in need of advice so why not professor lupin it had helped maybe the previous dinner had had something to do with it too being so awkward for all three of them not only nathan he d realized with professor lupin help that things couldntget worse than they already were in a way professor snape was still the same old professor snape his mother was still the same loving and caring mother she d always been if a little more anxious and worried than usual shockingly he was the same boy he d ever been too even andy was acting the same nathan had been worried for nothing or almost nothing the rest of the school was still acting like things had changed just as he d thought they had they were wrong he knew now okay not entirely wrong he had to admit he now had a father everyone knew and that changed a few things but thinking more clearly nathan was sure this couldntbe so different from all the times people found out he didntknow his father or it could be even better now because not having a father was worse than having professor snape as a father much worse nathan was positive that things could only improve from now on and it was a relief he d slept late that sunday but slept soundly like he hadntin a while he d awakened rested and ready for the first week of the rest of his life monday potions class would act on his behalf nathan was sure true to his belief professor snape lectured asked questions they were assigned a potion to brew and asked to deliver a vial for evaluation just like he had in most of their previous classes nathan could feel the level of anticipation amongst the other students especially the slytherins but he knew his father would act no differently now than he had in all the classes before professor snape had done as much on other occasions thank you professor snape nathan thought after they were dismissed for after class jose came to talk to him he still didntgive you any points for answering that question i wouldntexpect him to nathan answered he didnteven talk to you after the class jose added seeming puzzled with the occurrence there was nothing to be said nathan shrugged smiling on the inside you seem surprised by that well he your father isnthe jose told him i thought i dontknow that maybe he would be nice to you nathan actually smiled with that one and started to laugh a real laugh jose looked even more confused and nathan felt it better to explain professor snape is still professor snape jose especially during classes he was never nice so why would he start now he shook his head to emphasize the absurdity of the thought i just thought nothing has changed i think we re running late for defense nathan said and they went to the next class of the day during lunch andy wanted to know details of sunday dinner nathan told him some of what had passed explaining the necklace andy approved of his decision to wear it again but kevin although he remained around for the meals and most of the classes was still uncomfortable with the situation and his opposition to nathan wearing the necklace became all too evident snape is spying on you through this thing he said he not he watching over me there is a difference kevin nathan felt the need to retort defending his father well if what you said to jose after potions today is true and nothing has changed snape can only be spying on you professor snape has been watching over me or better yet all of us since the day we stepped foot inside this castle do you forget that he d saved me long before this father thing happened andy was nodding kevin didntsay anything against that argument it was not as if he could deny what nathan said anyway and more gryffindors relaxed around him too it seemed that jose and andy had some influence after all of course they no longer spoke of the teachers when nathan was around and he only knew that because they were not as careful as to who heard their conversations or didntin the common room nathan even caught them speaking of him once or twice but although this was an annoying change he couldntmake himself care that much re reading the files could be accounted for contributing to this change in attitude too having wednesday meeting looming over him made nathan take out the rolls of parchment he d written months ago when researching snape life for any dark secret that would make the man say who his father was such irony at the time nathan had two different sets of parchments the snape files and the dad files it ended up that he didntneed to have those separate ironic indeed but it was good he d made them different parchments then now he could look at them with a new perspective it was intriguing to confront what people had said of his father and what he d found out about professor snape through research if one read the descriptions and facts without knowing they accounted for the same wizard one would not guess perhaps the part of his father being a determined man was fitting to the role professor snape had played in the war although being considered a friend by albus dumbledore that was still quite surprising and also a great contradiction nathan was curious of how those pieces would fit in the same puzzle who was professor snape who was his father how did these two people merge into one nathan couldntquite figure that out yet yes meeting with him outside the classroom was awkward and nerve wracking but maybe it would help him put the puzzle together his mother had said he would get to know his father now that the meetings wouldntbe detentions but opportunities to have quality time together nathan didntknow how that was possible yet but he could see some benefits in the dreaded meetings now and wednesday arrived despite the two days resembling normalcy nathan was nervous by the time he knocked on the door of the potions master office enter good evening professor snape good evening that was a first professor snape had never answered one of his greetings with actual words but he hadntlooked up from the parchment he was apparently grading nathan moved closer to the desk the man was occupying to peek yes that bottle of red ink couldnthave been for anything else but grading nathan waited until professor snape finished and rested the quill on the desk the man entwined his fingers and placed his hands on the same desktop looking at nathan who looked up from the man hands to his face they stared at each other for a quick moment and professor snape looked briefly down nathan followed his gaze to his necklace it blue nathan stated looking back at his father i can see that which means i not in trouble nathan added snape expression was hard to interpret he rose from his chair and bypassed the desk coming to stand beside nathan they locked eyes again before professor snape said come nathan followed his father out of the office and down the corridor to the professor quarters on the short walk they passed some slytherins walking back to their common room and nathan felt relentless eyes on him one pair lingering longer malfoy s professor snape opened the door and nathan followed quickly inside he sighed when the door closed behind him intimidated are we professor snape asked no nathan answered in the wake of the accusation he wasn t was he it was just the uneasiness of being watched i dontlike the attention he added looking everywhere but at the man beside him of course professor snape moved to set a fire in the hearth illuminating the room further when he proceeded to the desk at a corner and set about rummaging through some books nathan asked still standing near the door why did you bring me here professor snape didntlook away from what he was doing your mother thought you might want to see my books mum of course nathan thought he looked away from his father and around the room paying more attention to the walls covered with books nathan approached the nearest shelf and ran his eyes over the tomes reading a title here and there the first set of books was related to potions they were basic textbooks advanced ones books about potions for one or other specific purpose and went as far as bordering on herbology with tomes about the use of plants in potions that was all he found on the smaller wall beside the door they d come in from nathan chanced a glance at professor snape and saw him on his feet bending over the desk writing something nathan headed for the next wall of books it was hard to read the title of some tomes especially those on the top shelf but it wasntthat hard to deduce that they were still potions making themed although now they bordered on charms soon they were exclusively about spells enchantments curses and counter curses some were ethically dubious at the very least such as curse your enemies and fighting with magic curses and counter curses these shelves ended at a door the same door professor snape had used on sunday nathan could see professor snape still busy with his own things and went for the books on the other side of the doorway there were more on curses and counter curses although now amongst books about dark creatures nathan wondered why there were so many books about werewolves now the titles were getting more difficult to read some were missing altogether others in languages nathan didntknow intriguing and captivating nathan thought and his curiosity was piqued he went further and saw books that were definitely dark manipulating with magic irreversible hexes and curses more books he couldntread the title of entrapping souls enchanting the blood painful potions captivity and dominance by blood magic even muggles knew blood magic was something to be feared there were movies about it nathan wondered how powerful they really were torturing curses had his father ever cast the cruciatus curse probably nathan thought back to all he knew about professor snape and decided he d definitely cast unforgivables more than once blood relations and related hexes hexing family members why would someone want to hex a relative was it what that book was about nathan reached out for it these books are not for you nathan was startled and turned to face his father withdrawing his hand how did he get here he was by the desk just now unless you feel like killing me his father added nathan stared at him wide eyed professor snape stared back nothing evident in his expression nathan shook his head in denial and lowered his eyes when his father didntsay more but continued where he stood nathan felt he was expecting something from him i didntknow what the book was about sir nathan tried you ve been more convincing in your lies before i not lying he looked up to his father face it true he affirmed that was almost convincing nathan clenched his hands you told me i could look at the books these are dark arts books i know sir nathan answered the unspoken question from all the other books i have here the only one you reached out for was this one mr granger is that what you want to become a dark wizard his father asked face inscrutable even with the accusation present in his words well you re a dark wizard arentyou nathan answered back defensively his father eyes changed and professor snape straightened his shoulders you should go to your common room he said dismissively you always send me away why do we even bother with these meetings nathan said frustrated he turned to leave and was halfway to the exit when nathan his breath caught nathan not mr granger he didntdare look back or move forward how do you like your tea tea nathan looked over his shoulder to his father not believing what he was hearing professor snape held his eyes for a moment and then went about transfiguring a tea set on a small side table nathan turned to him fully watching his wand work milk and sugar he finally answered walking to the couch professor snape poured the brew into two cups and added milk and sugar to one of them which he handed to nathan thank you sir nathan accepted the warm cup still a little confused to what was going on professor snape took the other and settled himself on an armchair nathan sat on the couch and sipped at his tea simply to have something to do professor snape stared at him from over his cup their eyes locked and nathan took another sip before saying we have the same eyes his father eyes never left his while he sipped once twice before agreeing so we do and the same hair nathan added this conversation was doing things to his stomach and he knew it had nothing to do with the tea the color perhaps professor snape said it not only the color nathan chanced a half smile his hair got greasy faster than usual they finished their tea in companionable silence nathan thought it had been the warmest tea he d drunk in hogwarts or he felt warmer for other reasons he couldntfully understand all he knew was that he didntwant this moment to end just now he smiled at the hearth maybe we have more things in common we dontknow yet why would you like that his father asked nathan shrugged and then looked at him do you think i ll ever be a good potions brewer like you professor snape regarded him if you apply yourself nathan smiled at him and a dueler i never saw you cast more than alohomoha and heating and cooling spells professor snape told him i can levitate things i was the first to do so in my class actually professor flitwick said i was a natural nathan grinned i can show you he told his father taking his wand from his pocket nathan straightened his shoulders and waved his wand wingardium leviosa he intoned perfectly and the empty cup floated in the air look at me his father called nathan did so and the floating cup crashed on the stone floor he looked back at it frowning embarrassed at his failure professor snape cast silent spells and the cup was whole and on the small table again when you learn a spell try to cast it in different circumstances such as without eye contact with the target there is more to charms and defense against the dark arts than the teachers tell you in class professor snape stood come i ll walk you to your common room i know the way sir nathan assured him good evening he nodded without facing professor snape still embarrassed and turned for the door the fire burning in the hearth of severus office went green and the headmistress floating head appeared there severus she called minerva he answered with a nod draco malfoy is here with me and wishes to see you severus frowned send him through minerva head disappeared and soon draco was standing in his office brushing ashes from his coat good afternoon severus draco severus nodded would you care for something to drink tea is fine the blond man answered taking a seat on one of the armchairs severus conjured the tea set and offered a filled cup to his unexpected visitor taking his place behind the desk he asked what brings you to hogwarts he took a cup for himself draco drank from the warm tea and rested the cup on severus desk before answering the granger boy severus was not surprised what about him should i call him the snape boy draco teased almost accusingly his name is granger severus answered but it common knowledge that he also a snape you haventdenied it no i haven t severus saw draco eyes narrow that doesntchange the fact that he a granger why her severus why potter insufferable sidekick i can understand your desire to hide such relationship from the wizarding world but to hide it from me there was no relationship severus answered annoyed and where did you get the assumption that you were my confidant you have a son devon age he older than devon draco thought through the implications of that you used granger during the war severus would not disagree with that he d used her and the war had been in full rage then why didntyou cast a contraception charm the same question he d asked himself several times since the day he d realized the boy black eyes mirrored his severus still didnthave an answer to that so he kept silent you never acknowledged him in all these years why now draco continued interrogating he still a granger devon told me you meet with them on regular basis why the insistence severus thought what do you want draco i want to know why you have a son and i the last to know draco scowl didntgrace his aristocratic features you re the only friend i have i trust you with my life i entrusted the best of me my son to you you know how much this means to me draco rose to his feet and was pacing in front of the desk and you think i betrayed this trust severus finished i haven t draco their eyes locked appraising draco seemed almost as if afraid he wasnttelling the truth severus held his frightened angry gaze with respectful steadiness the grayness of draco eyes fell back beneath his lashes when they were painfully closed in a frown i would have wanted to meet your son severus regardless of the mother draco confessed severus chuckled when draco opened his eyes and looked at him again he said so would i donttry to deceive me severus i not trying to deceive you i didntknow i had a son until recently granger hid him from me the stupid chit severus let contempt color his voice and saw the surprise on draco face a few months ago when the boy told me he didntknow his father i looked him over and figured it out he let his rage with such a situation show and the blond wizard nodded after looking straight into his eyes for a moment i ll kill granger when i see her draco said falling back into the armchair severus appreciated the sentiment but not as he did months ago no he wasntabout to forgive her for what she did but he didntneed to see her dead to feel avenged she d raised nathan kept him when severus knew he wouldnthave and severus was fond of the boy the contemplative silence was broke by draco i met the boy in diagon alley when i was buying devon supplies i dontthink he knew who i was i dontthink he did then severus agreed she raised him in the muggle world i sorry severus draco said with genuine sorrow you didntdeserve that severus shook his head draco was a pure blood and would never understand muggles and their world it was fruitless to try and convince him that being raised amongst muggles was not the worse thing that could happen to a wizard draco didntbelieve in the purity of blood anymore but that didntmean he was a muggle lover either i would like to meet him properly one of these days did granger spoil him beyond fixing devon told me he a gryffindor which is damage enough draco commented i m severus hesitated he hadntexpected that from draco still getting to know him myself draco nodded dinner is being served in the great hall will you join me severus asked trying to shake off the uncomfortable moment standing up to leave i ll have to decline your invitation pansy is waiting for me draco stood as well and extended a hand to severus who accepted the courtesy shaking it i ll walk with you to the great hall i want to see devon before i leave it was severus time to nod and they continued to the great hall hermione opened her apartment door harry i know it a little late for a visit but we cantmeet on weekends and i work late he started apologizing hermione was surprised by the visit last time she d seen harry she d been really mad at him and harsh words had been spoken not that she felt ashamed for the things she d said to her best friend in the moment of rage mind you and she wasntabout to apologize somehow hermione knew harry wasntthere in search of an apology or explanations even and that was what surprised her about him looking for her she let him in and joined him on the couch what brings you here harry hermione asked not wasting time with pleasantries harry took a deep breath i worried about nathan how is he he asked and hermione knew it was his heart asking he doing fine she answered we re trying to work things out after the mess you ve made we ll succeed eventually the last word came out in a much lower voice sunday dinner left hermione worried about how long she would take to fix all the damage done to nathan his relationship with severus was very fragile and resented more than she thought it was i sorry hermione i hermione interrupted harry search for new words of apology was there anything else you wished to talk about harry averted his eyes to his lap visibly uncomfortable with her down to business response to his visit skeeter will step back from further investigation of nathan case wontshe be fired for using what she heard from you without your authorization hermione asked indignantly no harry confirmed showing his annoyance in his tone apparently publishing unauthorized information is not considered gossiping and speculating when the next words harry said were hushed and murmured hermione didntunderstand them what was that they are not considered gossip and speculation when the source is known he sighed they pointed out that i was the source and that the information was true at least they agreed to drop skeeter from the case and to have no more about nathan published if i harry sighed again write a weekly column on quidditch during this year season and agreed to an exclusive interview with skeeter and you agreed of course hermione pressed harry appeared visibly hurt of course hermione smiled serves you right for meddling in other people business i sorry hermione harry had a pained look about his face hermione sighed i know you are but i still mad at you what can i do to make things right again between us he asked pleading hermione brought a hand to rub at her temple go home harry please hermione i love you and i love nathan i he paused to find the words i wasntthinking i never meant to make the situation worse for nathan or for you i would never hurt you hermione you re the sister i ve never had and you know it nathan is more than a nephew would be harry reached for hermione hand squeezing it please he asked again staring into her eyes i donthate you harry she admitted softly it just that right now i cantlook at you and not remember what a mess you ve made her hand was squeezed again nathan looks up to you and you know that your hatred for severus hermione tried to control her temper before completing doesnthelp him i ve been trying hard to prevent them from hating each other all this time only to have you destroy years of work i wontget in the way again harry said trying to reassure her damn right you won t she hissed a threatening finger directed at harry hermione turned from him breathing slowly to calm herself she wanted to hex him but deep inside she knew harry was suffering more than hexes could make him and that was far from comforting a crushing silence settled over them until harry said i didntknow what to do suddenly it was like i was living a nightmare snape was the father of the sweet kid that is nathan i still cantthink of you and that about how that was even possible worse yet the truth when she didntinterrupt him harry continued snape hurt me from the day i met him how can i let that happen to nathan it wonthappen i do understand what you did but that doesntchange the fact that i asked you not to interfere hermione reminded him looking harry in the eyes but she averted them to her lap when she added i know what i doing hermione needed to believe her own words you give snape too much credit i give severus due credit she looked at harry again and yet you hid nathan from him donttalk about things you dontunderstand hermione warned why did you do that then if not because of snape harry insisted this falls into the none of your business category she glared at harry and dontlook at me like that i still angry with you it late and i have a meeting in the morning so if you dontmind harry clenched his jaw and swallowed his questions he left without another word wingardium leviosa a spoon levitated for the umpteenth time as quills books chess pieces had done all day all week since thursday nathan failure on levitating the cup on wednesday had led to a compulsion towards the spell in a few days he d been casting it without looking at the subject but concentrating hard to maintain the something in the air now nathan could eat scrambled eggs and levitate a spoon although it would respond to gravity after a while he wanted to prove to professor snape he was a capable wizard it was still saturday he would have almost the whole weekend to practice before showing his father what he could do that was why nathan was heading to the library alone after breakfast instead of following andy and kevin outside to the quidditch pitch he didnthave time to watch gryffindor training nathan had some training of his own to be doing maintaining the levitation spell while almost completely concentrated on something else was tricky and nathan was still having trouble with it reading and casting the spell at the same time was how he trained for such situations he chose an empty table put his copy of hogwarts a history on it and opened the book about goblin wars he d been reading holding his wand he spoke quietly wingardium leviosa hogwarts a history rose several inches from the table satisfied nathan carefully took his eyes from the floating book and started reading while trying not to forget what he was doing simultaneously never lowering his wand several pages ahead on his reading nathan was still holding the spell until his wand went cold losing the warmth associated with channeling magic he looked up from his reading and was surprised to meet grey eyes staring at him devon malfoy held the book he d been levitating how did he get here nathan had been so lost in concentration that he d never seen malfoy approaching that book is mine nathan stated madam pince wouldntbe happy if she knew you were mistreating books malfoy said give me the book back nathan demanded adjusting his grip on his wand or what malfoy challenged nathan ran a list of hexes in his mind what do you want malfoy he asked letting his annoyance show i just wanted to remind you that i dontcare what people say you ll never be worthy of professor snape and i dontcare what you say now give me my book back nathan pointed his wand at his opponent he ll never take you seriously granger you donthave what is needed you re just too pathetic malfoy said letting the book fall to the table top the noise drawing attention to them nathan lowered his wand not wanting to be caught in the act of almost hexing another student as had happened before malfoy was halfway to the door when nathan turned his attention to him again and sighed in frustration he resumed his activities but found he wasntable to concentrate fully madam pince was looking cross with him at the third time the book hit the table disturbing her library that only added to his irritation nathan didntneed to hear he wasntworthy of being professor snape son especially not from malfoy who he knew was his godson thinking about the things malfoy surely knew about his father which nathan couldnteven begin to imagine he was feeling unworthy indeed maybe that was what professor snape was trying to tell him when the cup crashed maybe nathan wasnteven smart enough to catch his meaning nathan shook his head to send those thoughts away professor snape had invited him to drink tea even calling him by his given name he d told him he could be a potions brewer as good as he was one day nathan was worthy and he would prove it severus why is nathan levitating things all the time hermione asked him after answering his nod of a greeting with a good afternoon it was saturday and they were in the lab she was working on her project and he d just come in to fetch something from his desk there is he severus asked in answer not seeming much interested shuffling about one of the piles of parchments on the desk you know he is you saw him in the great hall she told him matter of factly do you know why maybe he practicing he suggested not giving much importance to her question or wanting her to believe he wasntgiving it importance she realized maybe something happened on wednesday hermione countered after that he shuffled about another pile of parchments and apparently found what he came looking for he straightened from the desk a roll of parchment in hand and said maybe severus was gone before she could react to that insufferable man she cursed under her breath nathan hadntstopped ten minutes to talk to her properly leaving her curious as to what had passed on wednesday and now this hermione shook her head and tried not to think about that anymore she hated being left in the dark and they both knew that mum are those what i think they are nathan asked when hermione emerged from her quarters carrying two large books yes nathan groaned but hermione didntmind she had planned this quite carefully during the week and was positive it would have a good result soon they were at severus door being welcomed by the potions master himself they walked in and were asked to take seats on the couch how was your week hermione asked trying to start a conversation tiring severus answered simply teaching is tiring hermione agreed after waiting a moment to see if he would elaborate she had to remind herself to be patient or else this dinner would turn out to be like last week s she saw severus looking at the books she d brought with her as if trying to guess what they were hermione decided it was a good time to enlighten him i ve brought some photos i thought we could see them before dinner nathan sighed slouching down on the couch hermione turned to him what so terrible about it anyway he gave her the look she smiled at him and turned to severus who was watching them intently i think it better if you sit beside me so i can explain the pictures hermione suggested severus hesitated while he tried to find a good reason to refuse her invitation he found none so he had to comply he sat by her though as far away as he could i think we should start with the muggle album what do you think nathan granger asked their son i vote for none nathan mumbled in response she simply opened the first album without commenting on the boy answer three unmoving pictures covered the page these are the first pictures of nathan my parents took them when we were still in the hospital after he was born she commented he was so cute the cute comment made severus want to roll his eyes nathan wasntso restrained i was not cute i looked like a mandrake severus smirked a suppressed smile you were and still are very cute granger said and it seemed to be a constant quarrel between them she turned the page here we re already at my parents house we stayed with them for the first weeks she commented severus thought nathan looked more like the cute baby she claimed he had been he wore a yellow overall with a bear on it and was smiling toothlessly for the camera he was so tiny on the other picture nathan was being held by granger and seemed to be sleeping the look on the picture woman face while gazing at the bundle in her arms could only be described as tender awe she was so young granger turned the page this is me trying to bathe him she told him amused he never liked it very much and it was always a struggle even now she added obviously teasing nathan severus saw a very young and wet granger trying to hold a very irritated nathan inside a small bathtub severus stared at the picture and started to wonder if he would have managed the task it seemed like a mess and he was certain he wouldnthave wanted to be part of the activity isntit enough humiliation to show me naked nathan mumbled granger sighed and turned the page nathan seemed older in the pictures now and so did she these are from his first birthday party not many people featured in the pictures but it was the first time he saw potter and the weasleys in any of them nathan seemed happy in potter arms they were all smiling potter aside severus was glad nathan had had a party for his first birthday the next pages were filled with pictures of nathan standing taking baby steps making a mess while eating on his own for the first time and mostly laughing near his mother she was always smiling or laughing always happy if severus were to be in those pictures would they be so happy would severus all he knew was that he would have wanted to be beside them during those happy moments granger turned the page and there was a curious picture severus leaned to see and only then realized how close he d gotten to her in the course of the activity she didntseem to mind is that a cast on his arm severus asked puzzled yes she answered he fell while he was playing in the school playground and broke his arm when i got there the doctor had already put a cast on it i healed it as soon as we came home but he had to keep the cast for the time the doctor had prescribed much to his annoyance or it would have seemed suspicious of course severus agreed it itched nathan added pained at the memory more pages more smiles and another picture puzzled severus what that supposed to be granger turned to look at him and their arms touched she didntseem to mind that either it when nathan played john darling from peter pan in the school play granger clarified she was still resting her arm against his severus frowned both at her coziness and the unrecognizable costume mum made the costume it was the worst nathan explained interpreting his frown correctly severus chuckled hermione granger bad at something hell must have frozen severus said and only then realized what he was doing why am i teasing her it was not that bad she protested nathan arched an eyebrow at her although severus wasntpaying much attention to the interaction anymore with her protest she d made the space between them vanish and now in addition to their arms their knees were touching the fine fabric of her skirt making it even more intimate it getting late for dinner severus stated coldly and rose from the couch he could see the confusion on granger face it wasntthat late but severus would not elaborate he snapped his fingers and a house elf popped into the room you may serve dinner he commanded they followed him to the table nathan didntseem to care about the change but his mother was still looking at severus in a searching way she didntvoice her thoughts which was a good thing they started eating in silence not as uncomfortable as the one that had accompanied them last week severus thought the meal would end in silence when granger interrupted it i didntsee you much the whole weekend what were you doing that kept you from even helping me in the lab she asked nathan i was busy the boy answered vaguely were you studying for some test i dontremember one so early in the term she insisted kind of again nathan answer was vague severus was finding their interaction interesting and was getting curious himself nathan was blatantly trying to hide something from his mother and maybe him why have you been levitating things all the time she finally asked and severus knew that was where she was heading for all along i was practicing nathan said echoing severus cryptic answer to the same question earlier that day and quickly added are we going to see more photos changing the subject severus was smirking when granger looked at him again searching he sobered i dontthink so she said after waiting for some kind of answer from him maybe we should retire for the evening severus suggested nathan nodded and stood from the table waiting for his mother to do the same she reluctantly did but instead of heading for the door she kissed nathan and said have a good week honey i have some things to discuss with your father before i go nathan nodded and bid severus good night leaving him alone with his mother what is it severus asked that was what i was going to ask what happened you seemed to be enjoying the photos as i said it was getting late and if you dontmind i want to be well rested for the week he tried to dismiss her granger stared at him for another moment and apparently decided to respect his position in any case this evening was a great improvement from last week s nathan was much more relaxed around you and i think it has to do with whatever happened on wednesday i told you could do it well done severus she commended smiling he couldntsee how wednesday meeting had something to do with nathan change in attitude besides the practice of the charm he d performed that day he chose not to comment waiting for her to leave her faith in him was always unsettling i ll leave the albums with you i hope you ll have some time during the week to see the rest of the photos she told him and the hesitation in turning her back to leave was evident severus stiffened his posture guarded she was always unpredictable when she looked at him like that granger seemed to realize his change in posture and dropped her eyes from his face i ll see you next week she said before turning and heading out from his quarters granger was dangerous he decided nathan had practiced hard he was confident that he could prove himself a good spell caster now he was counting the hours for his meeting with his father this wednesday nathan felt he needed the reassurance after so many bitter remarks from malfoy about his not being worthy of professor snape attention already at his father quarters nathan sat by the hearth and accepted the offered tea it seemed this would become their wednesday meetings schedule they were silent while they enjoyed the warm brew but as soon as nathan was finished he told professor snape i ve been practicing the levitation spell as you might have noticed sir indeed i have snape said nathan took that as an encouragement to continue i thought about what you said last week and there was really more to the spell than what we ve learned in charms nathan stood from the couch and took his wand in his hand without further explanation he intoned wingardium leviosa and the teacup floated in the air without being asked to nathan took his eyes from the flying object and fixed them on his father smiling a victorious smile can you chat and maintain the spell professor snape asked his expression unaffected by nathan display of magic yes i can nathan answered never once returning his eyes to the cup his smile broadening to show his teeth move the cup in the air professor snape told him nathan smile faltered a bit he d never tried to move the object without looking at it i can do this he assured himself he concentrated in making the cup move to the left so it would show in his sight range nathan still couldntsee the cup what if it not working he concentrated harder closing his eyes briefly move he almost sighed when the cup appeared on his peripheral vision nathan grinned in triumph i did it his grin dissolved slowly when he brought his attention back to professor snape the man expression was still the same neutral almost bored one regardless of nathan show of in his opinion outstanding magic control put the cup down the man told him nathan did as he was told with something aching in his chest he was about to pocket his wand and sit back on the couch when his father instructed do it again now without speaking the incantation without speaking the incantation how am i supposed to do that nathan looked gravely at his wand it not possible he looked to his father professor snape didntlook as if he was kidding and was waiting nathan swished and flicked his wand like professor flitwick had taught nothing happened he did it again and nothing he was going to fail one more time nathan chanced a glance to professor snape and back to the wand in his hand swishing and flicking it again to no avail fly stupid cup after his fifth unsuccessful attempt professor snape stood from his armchair and said keep practicing the man went to his desk on the corner of the room and ignored nathan altogether how am i supposed to do this nathan thought annoyed but never voiced the question swish and flick swish and flick fly fly he wanted to growl in frustration nathan sat back on the couch and sighed he was not going to ask his father how to do it he was not he looked around the room the many books arrayed along the walls nathan was sure there was at least one of them about levitation spells and yet his father didntsay anything he looked to the man by the desk and the ache nathan felt in his chest became too much he stood again trying one more time to make the stupid cup float in the air failing again he strode to the door and left banging it in his wake severus lifted his eyes from what he was reading at the sound of the door slamming shut he looked around and there was no sign of nathan he frowned fishing in his pocked for the glass vial containing the mood potion it flashed in shades of red he angry severus muttered confused his frown deepened what did nathan expect that he would stay on the armchair watching his sure to be frustrated attempts to levitate the teacup even showing great control over his magic already severus didntthink he would be able to control the target without looking at it and him bringing the teacup forward was a pleasant surprise the boy would take several weeks months even to get the hang of a non verbal spell which was much more than he would expect from a first year even when all the abilities he d showed here today were accounted for the angry reds continued to show in the vial but there was nothing severus could do he returned to his text but couldnthelp but look at the mood potion every other minute deciding he wouldntbe bothered by nathan display of petulance severus pocketed the vial and continued his reading with a stubborn avidness hermione tried the third dress exasperated with what she saw in the mirror what is wrong with me of course hermione wasntworried about her reflection as much as she was about her behavior this was not a date for god sake she let herself fall to the bed and took her face in her hands frustrated since last weekend hermione had been thinking more and more about severus she knew she had feelings for him but she thought they were under control hermione had put so much on hold for nathan this need to pursue severus was almost disconcerting when she least expected she was thinking about him asking herself what would be his opinions reactions to the most mundane things she would catch herself dressing up for him and it scared her at the same time she felt the excitement of being in love sure for the first time in her adult life about her affections but she felt as if she was betraying nathan now more than ever she should be concentrating on him putting his happiness first but what really intrigued her was that she wasntneglecting nathan in this only her own interests were meeting his this time and yet it felt wrong to be thinking about herself as a woman instead of only a mother she couldnthelp it though severus was the man she d been waiting for all along now she was certain hermione knew even before acknowledging it he had what no other did and they didntbecause they could never have there was only one severus snape and hermione had been unconsciously looking for another one all her life to no avail the men hermione had thought to be good enough were indeed good men some too good others not good enough ones too simple plain others intelligent but not witty enough they would never aggregate all the characteristics she imagined in a man and she was resigned to being too picky to know that such complex and complete man didntexist just to come face to face with him in a potions classroom a shiver ran down her spine with only the memory of that reencounter how she had concealed those feelings so expertly from herself still amazed hermione it seemed so obvious now so natural maybe it had been the war and how her life had little space for relationships back then or perhaps she had been too young and immature when they had worked together in destroying the horcruxes to understand that what she d felt was more than admiration for severus hermione knew things had changed for her when he d saved her but had no place for romance in her life after the horrors she d suffered during the war during that night never for who had done it but for the deed in itself no woman would think about men after such traumatic happenings but then again why didntshe realize anything when her decision to keep nathan had been made so much easier because his father was severus it should have been obvious no reason to debate the past any longer hermione understood now and had decided she wouldntpass up this new opportunity of finding out if she could be happy as a woman but her happiness had to wait a little longer yet she couldntlet her dreams overwhelm her common sense taking control of her actions these dinners are not dates not dates she chanted in her head they are for nathan and nathan alone not dates but she wished they were of course she did hermione sighed last week he d been comfortable by her side touching her although she suspected that to be the reason for him calling dinner as early as he did but he seemed comfortable when he wasnttaking notice of their closeness of course hermione had felt every bit of contact that happened between them that evening was i throwing myself at him she shook her head in denial she wouldntdo that not consciously she reminded herself frowning hermione control had been very thin when he touched her when he was too close if he touched her again today if she had an opportunity to touch him hermione didntknow if she could resist and that would be a cursed disaster severus was not ready hermione could only hope time would work to her benefit softening severus to her constant presence hope was the last to die and he enjoyed your closeness last week her wishful brain added she smiled despite herself hermione could almost feel severus body supporting hers on the same couch they d shared last week only they would be reading a good book together her smile widened what kind of book would we share she thought distracted with the image her traitorous mind was conjuring she shook her head annoyed get a grip granger she admonished in a murmur taking herself from the bed to finish dressing nathan would be by soon this was all for nathan and no one else especially now that things seemed to have regressed on that front nathan had been obviously agitated when she spoke of severus to him and sad like she hadntthought he would be again he d been close to admitting something was wrong only to tell her it was nothing severus though blatantly said there was nothing amiss getting annoyed when she d insisted otherwise when nathan arrived that evening hermione offered him one more opportunity to talk about what was bothering him to which he said nothing dontuse that tone with me hermione answered mildly i sorry nathan apologized i wish you would trust me nathan i wonttake sides or make judgments she insisted one last time it nothing really his tone was pleading hermione looked at him measuring if insistence would help she concluded it wouldn t so she motioned for him to precede her out of her quarters and put an arm around his shoulders come then let get going they walked in silence hermione momentarily distracted from her previous worries to focus on her sad baby if he didntwant to tell her what had made him so upset the only thing she could do was try to make this evening pleasant try to see a genuine smile hear a contented laugh mother and son arrived to their destination being welcomed by their sunday host severus offered tea to which nathan refused immediately severus observed him with great intensity hermione watched the interaction with increasing worry nathan looked decisively grim with the extension of the silence and she looked back at severus in the hopes of some kind of explanation when none was offered hermione was prompted to say severus what is i have a potion in the making that needs my attention if you ll excuse me i wontbe long he said interrupting her question and standing to leave hermione could only stare and follow him with her eyes until the only thing she could see was the closed door when she turned her attention back to her son he was looking at her with curiosity i didntthink he did that to you too nathan said amused did what she asked walk out or send away he explained making a derisive gesture to the door why did you refuse the tea that was rude of you she changed the subject but was still weighing what he d said about severus walking out on them i dontwant tea he answered you should at least thank him for the offer that not the way i brought you up she countered dontworry mum he doesntcare what are you talking about maybe she would be getting an explanation after all i think we should leave these meetings alone nathan looked in her eyes to say that his seriousness taking her aback they re not working i thought last week had been an improvement didntyou hermione was being careful but something happened during the week she voiced finally it fine mum we dontneed to be best friends nathan said i know he is my father and that enough for me she frowned her heart aching for the sadness in his voice how can this be enough for you honey i dontthink you re being true to yourself she let that sink in besides i dontthink your father would agree and where is he nathan pointed out damn you severus she thought i know things are complicated honey they are not easy for any of us but that doesntmean we should give up she told him nathan bowed his head are you really giving up do you really want to wonder what could have been if you had insisted she added nathan frowned contemplating her words she hoped be patient honey i know all we need is time hermione assured him brushing his hair from his eyes and planting a kiss on his forehead she rested her forehead against his dontbe sad she said lifting the corners of his mouth up with her thumbs and smiling at him nathan was still resisting if you dontsmile i ll have to tickle you you know that she mockingly threatened i warning you he remained serious so hermione used a finger to tease the side of his ribs he jerked in reaction and showed a half smile before admonishing her stop hermione poked him again now on the other side smiling mischievously he jerked again smiling and trying to push her hands back but he was unsuccessful and soon nathan was laughing like he hadntin quite a while hermione laughed with him for the pure joy of seeing him relax in merry mirth they didntnotice the door open severus stood by the door watching the scene before him with amazement everything was so foreign the sound the vision this background nothing seemed to fit and yet it seemed right it felt right mum nathan was saying breathless with laugher stop his son laughing in his living room before dinner yes it felt oddly right and his resolve of minutes ago was completely forgotten severus would go on with the meetings granger seemed to notice him there is everything okay with your potion she asked tucking in her shirt and making sure her hair was still contained in its binding she was flushed severus noticed it was an interesting sight yes he answered approaching the couch and taking his place on the armchair he looked at nathan with curious interest noticing his discomposure with a secret delight i see you were not bored in my absence he was already comfortably settled when tell me severus are you ticklish the question took him off guard what severus stared her full attention was on what he would say and it was unsettling he was starting to feel uncomfortable under her inquisitive eyes so he glanced at nathan who seemed to be amusedly interested in what his answer would be too but severus could only stare mum is ticklish almost everywhere but especially on the feet and the sides of her belly nathan words were something else severus wasntexpecting to hear this whole conversation was surreal he looked back at granger and she was blushing my slytherin mind will make sure to store this information he saw her get uncomfortable shift on her seat and to his dismay smile shyly she sobered quickly anyway granger said what are you brewing i didntsee anything in the lab i started when you left he told her falling back into known paths with the potions related subject the wolfsbane for professor lupin nathan asked yes i ve read about what happens when a werewolf doesnttake the wolfsbane it awful nathan commented seriously that was as far as the interactions between severus and nathan went as for the boy mother she was still acting a little too comfortable around severus for his taste sometimes he would forget to whom he was talking to and would find himself enjoying her conversation much to his surprise this had gone on and off the whole evening and now while they were eating their puddings severus realized that her behavior had always been off putting to say the least even more disturbing if the history of their relationship was taken into account i thought i had seen you eating chocolate cake before dontyou like it the very subject of his musings told him proving every thought right severus had decided to continue with the meetings but some things would have to change it close to curfew he pointed out to nathan ignoring her comment you should walk back to your common room yes sir the boy stood and so did the adults i ll see you on friday honey granger kissed nathan forehead saying her good byes and watching him leave to stay behind like severus knew she would another habit that had to end he crossed his arms over his chest waiting to have her full attention the door had barely clicked closed when severus said what happened here today he wanted to hear from her what she expected to achieve with such behavior to severus dismay she seemed confused with his question that added to his annoyance now bordering upon anger it a simple enough question granger he insisted when all she did was look at him what do you mean severus her dissimulation would quickly make him lose his temper dontplay dumb with me he said dangerously low apparently she knew a threat when it came from him if her change in posture was anything to consider severus she started and took a step in his direction i not playing dumb i really dontknow what you re talking about she took another step but seemed to hesitate on a third i thought we were having a good time tonight i was even going to point this out point what out granger severus interrupted her how inconvenient you are how nosy you are he wanted to make her feel as uncomfortable as possible to throw her out of her personal safety just like she d done to him all evening she had her mouth slightly open but hadntsaid a word finally silent i see severus commented i had the impression that you were enjoying the evening severus but it seems i was completely mistaken she frowned and took another step towards him but stopped when he spoke again you think that just because we share a child you have the right to bother me with questions on matters that are none of your business it was his time to approach her while he spoke that just because i have accepted this silly plan of yours to meet every week you have the right to take liberties she backed up a step against his advance severus i dontunders tell me granger you didnt really think we would suddenly become best friends and forget all that had happened did you i did she blatantly answered meeting his eyes i do she amended it seemed like she wanted to say more but nothing came out of her mouth severus chuckled taking another step towards her so that she conceded another one reaching the back of the couch now he was where he knew he looked most threatening nathan he told her he the reason we meet every week for these pathetic dinners he took another step just to be certain and she was trapped between him and the couch i ve agreed i would be part of his life severus inclined his face so he could speak directly into hers what else do you want he hissed that was when he felt it her lips touching his reason told him to get out of reach but he wasntmoving her warm lips stayed over his pressed tightly he couldntmove he couldntthink severus could only be there shocked into passivity her lips moved against him he could feel it the soft brush the ease of the pressure on his unresponsive lips registered in his confused brain he knew that but couldntdo more than acknowledge it until her hands touched his face making reason rush back in an electric wave and he was free from the hypnotic effects of her earlier actions severus grabbed at her wrists and put some distance between their faces he stared at her with a frown wishing his brain would come to his aid i want you as part of my life as well miss granger said in a whisper severus could feel her words against his moist lips before he could register she was touching again kissing him tenderly she miss granger severus pushed her away holding her firmly still his brain finally snapped back bringing the information his reason had been based on miss granger he said and with the name came the realization of their history of the war of that night he dropped her wrists instantly and walked away retreating from her scowling lifting a hand to brush his hair back severus you ve lost your mind severus told her you re completely mad he turned to glare at her she met his glare without apparent hesitation observing him with hope how could she what is wrong with you woman he thought annoyed and still confused i not out of my mind she disagreed i you damn it severus why did you have to come so close she turned bracing her hands against the back of the couch severus glare intensified even if he was the only one aware of the fact she was blaming him you kiss me and i the one too close you were touching me why the hell did you do that before her silence could make his desire to hex her form into action she turned to face him and gone was her earlier hesitation her eyes were strong and so filled with emotions that he wanted her to look away because you made me do it you came asking for it i shouldnthave kissed you but now it done and i not taking it back this is what else i want severus she gestured between them i want you in my life there you have your answer have you a memory problem he growled more annoyed and now angry with the witch with each minute he managed to think about the absurd situation can you remember who save your speech severus she told him and although her eyes still swam with emotion her voice was calm and strong i assure you i didntforget a thing i know this comes as a surprise to you i have no intention of spending my words on you insane woman he cut her off in the middle of her explanation get out of my rooms he demanded severus there is i said out his whole face trembled over that last word i not going anywhere before you listen to me she countered now that i ve started i ll go to the end of it i wontdo he tried to say but she was not having it listen just listen severus crossed his arms in front of him impatient he told himself he didntwant nor need to listen but he felt he wanted to know what had compelled her to do what she did first of all i not insane so please stop saying that granger glared at him but he sensed her uneasiness second this is not some momentary lack of judgment on my part perhaps how things happened tonight was but not what happened and now there is no reason to deny it you were asking and you were very close and i didntknow how to hold back the true answer although i knew it would lead to this is this your idea of revenge granger severus took advantage of her pause for a breath to ask voicing his own version of her reasons to do what she did she sighed i knew you weren t that you wouldntunderstand right now and i want you to understand i have no reason to want revenge on you much the contrary i have only reasons to respect and admire you for all you did for me and my friends for the whole wizarding world what prompted me to kiss you is not a moment impulse either i ve been woman he interrupted listen to yourself you want me to believe i never gave you reason for revenge would you are you back for more then do you want me to take you by the arm and throw you to the ground do you want me to rip your knickers from you stop it to undo my trousers and stop it cover you invading you like a lifeless thing stop it she cried i not unaffected by what happened she had tears in her eyes and severus felt he d gone too far he should apologize but he also wanted her to understand the insanity of what she was claiming to feel for him her rapist before he could decide she spoke again i was taken from my friends had my head invaded by that monster she raised a shaky hand and brushed her hair back nervously they tortured me for information i didnthave crucio is something i dontdesire even for my worst enemy and they cursed me for what seemed an eternity her voice was soft with the sadness of the memory severus knew well of what she was talking about and felt memories of his own invading his mind when i thought dying was a pleasant option when all my hope was gone i heard your voice she told him and lifted her eyes to meet his i knew what you would do but i also knew why you were doing that i didntenjoy any of it but neither did you i know you didn t severus he hadn t but a man cantdo what he had done without enjoying himself at least for a moment and he had it was what it had taken for him to get her out of there and he carried the burden with him every single day of his miserable life you saved my life on more occasions and ways than that you risked your life for us uncountable times she paused and took a few steps towards him what i want you to understand is that i can see i not fooled by the appearances of your actions what you did was the brave choice in a difficult situation if instead of doing what you did had to you i dontknow had to cut my leg off or curse me to free me i know you would have and i wouldntbe less grateful but you would be considered a hero like those who did the same in other circumstances severus simply looked at the woman in front of him unable to ignore her arguments but still feeling guilty for not having chosen to sacrifice himself when he should have he was startled when she touched his hand but didntshy from that warm soft touch i sorry you had to make such a horrible choice but i really really glad you did thank you severus i ll forever be grateful and i wish you could forgive yourself for being a very brave slytherin he stared at their hands while she said that not trusting his emotions for the second time that evening it was not often that he found himself confused his introspection was interrupted by the action of her squeezing his hand i hope this can help you understand why nathan could never be a burden she continued and let go of his hand she left shortly after that and severus followed her with his eyes frowning with conflicted feelings since hermione granger had invaded his life for the third time severus had been having a battle with himself when she was just another muggle born student he knew he had to mistreat her and be indifferent to her qualities and that was not a problem she was not a problem beside her connections with potter when they had worked together in the war destroying horcruxes he had been free to admit her skills and intelligence even the ease with which they worked together and that might be why he was bound to save her that night when she was back as the mother of his son though since then severus hadnthad a definite opinion about her her actions intentions and now her feelings as well the fact that she was making him question his own actions intentions and feelings so well cemented in him before made his head ache the way his mind was insisting his skin remember her touch was not helping either how could he let himself be caught like this and by her no less you should be more careful granger malfoy said with disdain after practically walking over nathan knocking him to the dungeon stone floor nathan stood quickly and shoved at malfoy chest making the blond take a few steps back to maintain his balance malfoy pushed him back what wrong with you just because you re suddenly related to professor snape doesntmean you have reign of the dungeons i ve had enough of you malfoy nathan answered and pushed the slytherin again only this time malfoy was ready and the fight didntescalate to actual punches because a deep voice snarled from the end of the corridor what happening here they separated but continued to glare at one another professor snape was upon them in a beat i thought that i had been clear last time he was visibly annoyed this muggle behavior wontbe tolerated professor snape faced nathan and malfoy in time twenty points from gryffindor and another twenty from slytherin nathan was used to having points taken by professor snape and enjoyed malfoy expression of disbelief his amusement was only short lived as he heard his father growl follow me he took his book bag from the floor and obeyed walking the dungeon halls beside malfoy to professor snape office they entered and waited until the professor turned to address them again i dontknow and i donteven want to know why you were fighting like two muggles in the halls again what i want is to make clear that this stops now any question uncle severus i didntdo anything to him he wasntlooking where devon have you listened to anything i ve just said i not interested professor snape cut off malfoy words and nathan was very aware of the familiarity in the way they addressed each other do i make myself clear this time yes malfoy answered lowering his eyes to his shoes nathan was observing everything very carefully very well just keep in mind that i wonteven remember who you are if this happens again his father finally turned his attention from malfoy to him do i have to repeat myself mr granger no sir nathan answered meekly feeling the formality cut like a sharp knife he didnthave the urge to argue after how domestic this all sounded between malfoy and his father this felt like everything malfoy ever said was true and nathan hated it there was silence for a moment until professor snape seemed satisfied he bypassed the desk and sat behind it nathan knew that to mean they were dismissed but he didntmove he wouldntleave before malfoy what are you waiting for written permission to leave move malfoy turned to the door and before following him nathan met his father eyes but found nothing there besides annoyance he suppressed a disappointed sigh and left disappointment turned quickly into anger when malfoy was waiting for him outside not even a detention you re lower in his regard than i thought the slytherin taunted amused he took twenty points from you nathan countered feeling stupid for even using that as an argument but he couldntlet malfoy get out of it without at least one attempt at fighting back nathan refused to let the pain of his father indifference show the same twenty he took from you malfoy smirked knowing that there was no argument left for nathan watch where you go the dungeons can be a dangerous place for distracted gryffindors let meet somewhere else then nathan challenged walking closer to the slytherin so his voice wouldntarrive to his father ears just behind the door what makes you think that it ll change anything malfoy scoffed you dontbelong here in uncle severus life granger something i can tell you here or anywhere else i want to see you prove your empty words malfoy nathan lowered his voice even more in his anger a loud noise from professor snape office startled them it seemed that the man was coming out malfoy didntwait to see that confirmed and left along the way to the slytherin common room nathan didntwant to meet his father either and fled quickly towards the entrance hall nathan managed to keep out of his father and malfoy way until on wednesday professor snape looked for him in the great hall during lunch mr granger nathan turned to meet the man he d been avoiding i donthave time for a meeting tonight so i canceling it with no more than that he strode for the doors scowling at the world he canceled our meeting nathan head was rushing looking for reasons this was the last rock over his oppressed heart he keeping me away snape is not in his best of moods this week he given so many detentions that they re starting to look like a group activity nathan heard a fifth year sitting a few feet away saying while his father left the great hall the group of older gryffindors laughed at the joke but nathan still couldntunderstand what was so funny about it finally a free wednesday with us kevin commented we could explore the fifth floor we know for sure that snape wontbe catching us out after curfew being so busy as he is his friend smiled mischievously yeah maybe nathan said disheartened somehow he didntwant a free evening well he did but not like this and when he was almost sure professor snape was avoiding him because he was boring annoying unworthy they left for the afternoon classes and not even the reassurance of his friends was making his most pessimistic assumptions go away and nathan was trying to replace them by the few optimistic ones he got andy tried to help he has detentions to supervise his friend had told him before they started eating dinner and nathan clear disappointment at the vacant seat by the high table was disguised so i ve heard nathan answered dismissively do you think he busy with something else andy insisted nathan shrugged and filled his mouth with pie he didntwant to talk about it any more they ate in relative silence the full day affecting more than only nathan charms had been very demanding that afternoon when he thought his day would soon be over he heard malfoy i ve heard professor snape exchanged your company for detentions he provoked well it doesntsurprise me malfoy added i not interested in your stupid comments malfoy this definitely proves my theory of your unworthiness i think there is no doubt of that now malfoy continued making a show for his slytherin audience but if you re still not convinced because well you re a gryffindor that called for some attention along the table you can meet me in the library later since you re obviously free this evening and i can make it all clear even for a lesser gryffindor like you watch your words malfoy kevin threatened rising from his seat to emphasize his intentions just tell me where and when nathan said ignoring the others rising for the defense of gryffindor i ll find you there when we ll discuss the details malfoy turned and left some gryffindors still defending their house to his back how dare him come here and say things like that kevin said outraged who does he think he is he just a stupid slytherin you wontgo will you andy asked nathan of course i will nathan confirmed seriously we will amended kevin that snob needs a lesson or two nathan you shouldntgo what would professor lupin say about it what would professor snape andy insisted this is between malfoy and i and it gone far enough if he thinks he can prove i not worthy of my father then i want to see him do it nathan was stronger in his words than he was in his emotions he was starting to think malfoy was right and maybe if the slytherin proved it nathan could let go of this whole father thing once and for all except he didntwant to let go nathan didntwant malfoy to be right he shoved aside those thoughts and simply headed for the library it was stupid andy was right but nathan had to do it kevin followed of course and so did andy even against his better judgment they didnthave to wait too long for malfoy to show up he had his usual followers with him they stopped by the entrance of the restricted section and nathan went to meet them andy and kevin on either side of him i see you brought an audience with you malfoy said to nathan so did you kevin anticipated any answer nathan could have to that to the point malfoy nathan said while the animosity escalated between the groups glaring at one another go into the restricted section and bring us a dark arts book malfoy dared him nathan dontdo it we shouldntgo into the restricted section least of all to get a dark arts book madam pince will catch you and you ll be in deep trouble andy was saying urgently on his left well malfoy pressed for an answer i ll do it nathan answered holding his head high to the dare and ignoring reason malfoy smirked what does it prove nathan nothing andy was still trying to advice him against it if nathan were thinking he would have agreed with andy entering the restricted section to get a book hardly proved anything but it apparently did for malfoy right now that was incentive enough nathan walked to the doors that led to the forbidden portion of the library leaving his friends and foes outside he always wondered what was really behind those doors and now he was there wand lit in his hand observing his surroundings at first he didntnotice anything different but as he advanced walking further away from the doors he could feel something heavy in the air what was only a sensation became more real when nathan heard a muffled scream he stopped and looked around expecting to find someone there right behind him his heart was beating faster and he didntwant to stay there much longer perhaps this wasntsuch a silly test after all nathan forced himself to approach the shelves the spines of the books betrayed how old and obscure they were some showed a title there others nothing but a symbol others yet not even that many of the books were written in languages nathan couldntunderstand an agonized whimper came to his ears and nathan turned startled again looking for its source a book moved on the upper shelves calling his attention to it making nathan step back and hit the books behind him something definitely not human growled in response it was time to get some book any book and get out of there nathan reached for the first tome he could catch and walked quickly away from the screams and grunts of the books only when he felt he was safe enough did he think to look if the book he held met the requirements of malfoy dare anima codex he read his elementary latin translated it into decoding souls well any magic with souls was dark so it would do nathan emerged in the main hall of the library to find only his friends there where malfoy he went to fetch madam pince the scum kevin cursed what took you so long come on we need to get out of here before they come back andy urged taking nathan by the sleeve of his robes irrationally nathan wanted to stay and show the book to malfoy to shove it on his face and prove that prove what it didntprove anything damn malfoy set him up and nathan was so lost in his internal struggle that he didnteven notice going inside the restricted section only served to prove what a dunderhead he was stupid stupid what was i thinking nathan thought while he followed automatically after his friends towards gryffindor common room he ran into kevin when he stopped by the fat lady so distracted by his musings he was sorry nathan apologized kevin mumbled an answer and exchanged a look with andy nathan noticed he sighed i was distracted okay nathan added annoyed and barked the password storming into the common room and straight to the upstairs dormitory he was relieved when no one followed him and nathan crashed on his bed tired of feeling miserable tomorrow was his birthday and he was sure no one remembered or cared his father the least what went wrong what gods had he insulted to deserve this nathan turned in the mattress burying his face in the pillow i wontcry i won t he shouldntspend another tear on this he turned again to face the crimson curtains and felt something beneath his back the book bag he d thrown on the bed before collapsing on it nathan sat down took his shoes off and opened his bag fishing for the book he d shoved there while fleeing from the library there it was anima codex he put his book bag out of the way and sat cross legged with the dark book in his hands nathan didntknow why he was doing it only that he was he went through the first chapter with increasing interest it was an ancient book but the difficult english didntdeter him learning about souls was very interesting and absorbing just what nathan needed right now he advanced through the book going through the theories of a soul origins its ethereal consistency and attachment to a body despite its independence of being needing more and more space in his mind and arranging it where before his frustrations and disappointments with his father mother uncle harry and professor lupin as well as his hatred for malfoy lurked his friends had come and gone to sleep hours ago and nathan was still captivated by the forbidden book no one had seen him with it he d been careful nathan didntwant to hear he wasntsupposed to be reading it especially now that it was getting really interesting there were potions that affected the soul directly for good and for bad spells that would bind souls or release them and even mentions of the existence of horcruxes and what they were like nathan had heard in many accountings of the war some of potions were complicated even to understand the recipe never mind actually brewing them nathan wondered if professor snape would be able to do it and then remembered he didntcare about professor snape some of the spells were as hard as many of the potions but others seemed easy enough resting his eyes on one of the spells of the latest kind nathan started to wonder if he could cast it this particular spell seemed inoffensive enough and nathan felt an urge to try certainly freeing one soul in an experience of astral projection couldntbe harmful he wouldntbe casting it on anyone but himself nathan thought about the consequences of such a thing and couldntfind a reason not to try it would be fun he wanted some fun nathan practiced the wand motion thinking twice about casting the spell every minute that passed he grew more confident and thinking about not doing it seemed silly stupid even he could do it and that would prove to him that all they said and thought of him was wrong another few repetitions of the easy wand motion cemented his resolve very softly he read and reread the spell learning the words he would have to chant nathan would do it because he could because no one was there to tell him he couldn t taking a deep breath nathan waved his wand while speaking the spell and tapped at his third eye he felt a dizziness that soon receded nathan looked down and saw his legs there still a very solid mass of flesh and bones and was starting to think he had failed when he glanced back and saw his upper body lying on the bed nathan widened his eyes although the real eyes didntmove remaining closed he stood up and the body his body was still on the mattress he finally thought to look down his ethereal self and his eyes widened again accompanied by a gasp nathan could see through himself as if he was one of the ghosts of the castle the shock of his success eventually wore off and nathan grinned looking about his other self peacefully sleeping while his soul was very awake this could be very useful he would be able to go places and have the perfect alibi his body in a bed so many possibilities now he needed some real sleep though this occurrence had lifted his spirit literally and figuratively and he felt ready to face his birthday on his own in the morning nathan spoke the spell that would take his soul back to his body and closed his eyes waiting some unpleasant sensation that would accompany the reattachment when he felt nothing nathan opened his eyes and was faced by the sight of himself in the bed like before the spell hadntworked nathan chanted the words carefully again and opened his eyes to the same scenario a third try and nothing happened either nathan was starting to worry a few more tries and not a change nathan essence was still no nearer to getting back into his body he started to attempt variations of the same spell getting closer to his resting self trying to touch it as he chanted and nothing nothing nothing nothing he was in a panic after an hour of frustrated attempts to be whole again a n that it i hope things are more interesting now she kissed him and nathan is in trouble severus is not a lucky wizard or is he 0 junew has asked for the necklace colors and their meaning here you are sort of it only

all j k rowling s beta readers ginnyw and indigofeathers thank you very much a n chapter twenty five nathan is locked outside of his body worrying his parents chapter 25 outside the day was dawning and nathan knew he wouldntwake up that morning when the light hit his face from the gap in the hangings not even the strongest sun of the brightest summer day of all summer days would be able to make him open his eyes after all these distressing hours of fretting crying or simply staring at his sleeping self nathan body was still a soulless shell soon his roommates would be up for the day and someone would come check his bed nathan sat cross legged next to his body waiting for that moment he had tried to verify his mood necklace to see what it showed but it was covered by his pajamas he wondered if it was clear like when he took it off angry with his father perhaps it was black death black would professor snape notice nathan lowered his head if his father came through the dormitory door thinking he was dead and found his peacefully sleeping hollow body what would he do he wanted to believe professor snape would flick his wand and solve everything even if it was only to have nathan whole so he could separate his soul from his body properly by killing him afterwards his mother would be very disappointed he knew at least she wouldntsee him like this he glanced at his body again they would get him fixed in no time his mother would only hear of it afterwards nathan was sure she would panic if she looked at him lying unconscious like that but they would put him together madam pomfrey professor lupin professor snape someone they had to it was an easy spell an easy spell he didntmaster nathan took his head in hands again elbows resting on his translucent knees how pathetic was he yes he had answered this question many times already but he was so utterly disappointed with himself that his thoughts were going in circles always coming back to chastise him this time though the cycle was broken there was movement in the room distracting him from his thoughts nathan left his bed to see who was waking up great andy cautiously as not to startle him nathan walked a step forward and called andy maybe he was too cautious for andy continued rummaging through his clothes as if not listening to him nathan hissed andy he didntwant to wake up the others just yet he walked and was standing in the middle of the circular room now andy he called in a normal voice if a bit hesitantly andy still had his back to him taking out whatever he was taking out of his trunk but then he turned around looking at him dontfret nathan hurried to say raising his hands before him and waiting for the shock to show on his friend face but when he could see none when andy didntsay anything or show any sign of surprise nathan realized he was looking through him and not at him and he was the one shocked he cantsee me nathan couldntbelieve it he was translucent yes but so were all the ghosts in the castle and andy or any other person for that matter had no trouble seeing and talking with them why would it be any different with him andy please say you can see me that you re only joking nathan was panicking coming closer to his friend standing right in front of him andy didntseem to realize his presence it not funny andy stood from the bed and left for the bathroom ignoring and almost walking through him nathan stared wide eyed at the door that had closed behind andy if they couldntsee him how would they know what happened if no one knew what happened how would they fix it they wouldn t couldn t i locked outside my body forever nathan went back to his bed with tears spilling down his translucent cheeks he tried in vain to perform the reverse spell ten more times crying even harder he hadntrealized just how utterly screwed he was until andy couldntsee or hear him his other roommates were all awake by the time nathan had calmed a little the book was still opened in the page of the spell so when they find his unconscious body they would know what happened and how to fix it that thought was the only think holding his hopes of getting back into his body anytime soon is nathan in the bathroom he heard kevin ask from somewhere in the room nathan was back in his concealed bed it wouldnttake much longer now for them to find out no josh is there is he still sleeping then did he think he could be late for class just because it his birthday kevin said making nathan close his eyes at the mention of his birthday i ll wake him up andy volunteered the hangings of his bed were pulled open abruptly wake up andy cried expecting to startle him his friend was smiling but when nathan body didnteven stir the smile faltered wake up nathan you cantstay a lazy slug in bed if we can t nathan was watching his friend intently seeing all the emotions crossing his face andy shook his body shoulder come on stop it i thought we could go to breakfast earlier today of course his body didntreact i wontwake up andy go get professor lupin nathan unheard words were those of sad resignation it not funny nathan his friend said shaking his body again wake up andy was panicking nathan realized he saw kevin come to his aid come on nathan you re annoying andy kevin said shaking his shoulder and now you re annoying me too i think there something wrong with him i think we should call professor lupin andy finally said but didntleave the side of the bed nathan realized he was still hoping it was all a joke when not even those words made his body open its eyes kevin was convinced i ll do it he left to find professor lupin his other roommates were now gathering around his bed asking what was going on kevin soon came back to tell that professor lupin was on his way that was when something terrible happened kevin i dontthink professor lupin should see that andy was pointing to the open book near his body right knee nathan translucent self followed andy pointing finger and got agitated is that the book he took from the restricted section yesterday kevin asked so only andy and nathan could hear him andy nodded professor lupin cantsee it kevin agreed then dontmove the book nathan shouted when kevin reached for it trying to take kevin hands away of course neither his words nor his actions did anything to prevent kevin from doing just that and useless were all his other pleas no no no dontclose it he followed kevin and the book to kevin trunk and when the book was very well closed and concealed from everyone eyes professor lupin entered the room no nathan screamed and he had new tears in his ethereal dark eyes how will he fix me now when nathan went back to where his body lay professor lupin had already broken through the boys who surrounded the bed and was touching his fleshly forehead calling his name with worry in his voice nathan nathan can you hear me yes i can but you canthear me nathan snapped unable to control his frustration after having his biggest hope taken away and hidden into kevin trunk he climbed into bed and watched professor lupin inspect his body eyes arms taking his wand and murmuring some words under his breath he observed dispassionately his body glow in a red light after one of the spells had hit it andy go to the great hall and get professor sna the door flung open the very moment professor lupin was saying that calling the attention of everyone in the room well not everyone nathan closed his eyes and missed the image of his roommates getting out of professor snape way as the man crossed to room cursing under his breath nathan opened his eyes and kept staring at his body the glow from professor lupin spell was fading slowly in the same pace of his own perceptions of his surrounding nathan was watching it fade staring without really seeing lost in his hopelessness his father hand came into view when the remaining of the red light dissipated it touched his body forehead nathan finally looked up following the length of arm professor snape was scowling down at him well not at him but at his body he was holding his wand and seemed to be concentrating what happened professor snape asked nathan was opening his mouth to answer forgetting he couldntbe heard when professor lupin spoke the boys called me when they couldntwake him up i dontknow what happened but he doesntseem to be physically injured professor snape listened while casting apparently the same spell professor lupin had cast before for nathan body was glowing red again professor snape turned from the sight looking at the others in the room who can tell me what going on here he asked silence was his answer mr brown professor snape singled out arching an eyebrow i dontknow sir mr wood professor snape tried i couldntwake him up sir andy said his father turned again watching his body once more running his eyes from nathan face to feet and back again the conscious part of nathan startled when the feet he d been staring at moved he watched his body being lifted from the bed into the arms of his father i ll go ahead of you to forewarn poppy professor lupin said why professor snape challenged you d be more useful if you knew what was going on in your own house lupin he adjusted the weight in his arms and left for the door nathan followed not knowing what else to do they went down the common room exited by the fat lady door and continued through the corridors that would lead them to the hospital wing it was still early and they found very few students out of their common rooms not that either part of nathan was aware his unconscious body held by his father and his soul following the socked feet of it as if in a trance when the feet rocked up and down one last time and then stopped nathan snapped out of his reverie and really looked at his father he took in the image this man made carrying his body his father face sported the usual unreadable expression but his eyes were different in a way nathan couldntclassify professor snape rearranged the body in his arms holding it more upright head on his neck chest on his chest supporting the weight with a single arm and freeing a hand to get to his wand he cast alohomora and they entered the infirmary poppy his father called after the mediwitch while he carefully set his body down to a bed making sure its head rested softly on the pillow poppy severus the mediwitch came rushing to where his father stood and his body lay there is something wrong with him professor snape said the mediwitch started to wave her wand over nathan body making professor snape step away from the bed nathan stared at his own pale face watching the first couple of diagnosis spells hit it the mediwitch concentrated on her examination and nathan attention was drawn from her to his father the same strange glint of earlier still shone in his eyes his expression locked in a frown was he worried or angry it was difficult to tell looking at the man hand two fingers rubbing at each other nathan added anxious or irritated to his list of possibilities madam pomfrey was still for a moment catching his attention the only indication that his father had noticed the change as well was when he took a step closer to the bed and toward nathan body there is nothing physically wrong with him for all i know he sleeping deeply more deeply than a stupefy would make him and so enervate wontbring him to awareness my spells also tell me he didntingest any sleeping potion at least none of the common ones his condition seems stable enough for now which is good in a way but also bad since he not waking up on his own madam pomfrey paused and turned from his body to his father what happened to him professor snape stared still frowning at the pale face making little contrast with the white pillowcase as he answered i dontknow yet he was on his bed in his dormitory when we found him and none of the other students revealed anything useful i was hoping you could tell me the mediwitch frowned i suspect this is the consequence of a curse although if he was inside the dormitory when you found him i cantthink of any hogwarts level curse that would have such a strong effect nathan listened to madam pomfrey speculations growing more and more worried with her assessment of his condition did this mean she couldntfix him either if it a curse it one i dontknow of madam pomfrey added and that answered nathan question somehow he d known already but against all odds he d hoped the mediwitch might have been able to reverse this situation you cantbring him back professor snape came to the same conclusion voicing it she shook her head not without knowing what hit him nathan helplessness and frustration brought tears to his eyes once more they couldnthear nor see him they couldntfind the book describing the curse and counter curse and they couldnthelp him back into his body without it this couldntget worse i ll floo minerva and then st mungo s the mediwitch told his father st mungo s if they sent his body away from hogwarts nathan didntthink that was a good idea he didntwant to be sent away from the castle he looked at professor snape waiting for some miracle luckily his father intervened when madam pomfrey was already turning to the hearth that wontbe necessary severus the headmistress must be informed yes yes minerva yes but not st mungo s his father interrupted annoyed i cantheal him severus he should be sent to st mungo s i disagree the man interrupted again looking pointedly at the mediwitch who glared at him their silent struggle for power seemed to go on forever nathan observed one and then the other in turn he didntwant to be sent to st mungo s but if madam pomfrey couldnthelp him why was his father opposing to the idea of sending him to the hospital right now nathan only wanted professor snape to win this glaring contest he could think about his motivation later madam pomfrey finally went to the hearth and called the headmistress she didntfloo st mungo s but was still looking cross making very plain to professor snape what her thoughts were on the matter the headmistress arrived on the silent ward and madam pomfrey went about explaining what was going on the two witches approached the bed where his body lay nathan followed them paying attention to everything that was said nothing new was disclosed and finally madam pomfrey made known her wishes to send for st mungo s why haventyou flooed them yet the headmistress asked the mediwitch made an exasperated gesture in professor snape direction he d been quiet since the headmistress had arrived severus professor mcgonagall prompted turning to him as if only then noticing his presence in the ward nathan followed her he wontbe sent to st mungo s professor mcgonagall seemed taken aback by his finality nathan was getting nervous with the situation was his father denying him help didnthe want him to be well again if there is nothing poppy can do here we need specialized help i his father and i say he wontbe sent to st mungo s it was the first time since the day nathan had heard the man confessing he was his father that he d heard professor snape admit to their blood relationship what was he playing at he might be seriously injured severus poppy said he stable yes but this can change at any minute we dontknow what hit him madam pomfrey said exasperated professor snape glared at her from the corner of his eyes a warning why dontyou want to send him to st mungo s severus the headmistress asked seemingly curious nathan was also interested in the answer i donttrust his safety outside the castle he stays until i say otherwise nathan tried to gauge the true feelings behind that statement was professor snape really worried about his safety thinking back professor snape had always come to his aid when he was in some kind of trouble maybe he was in fact worried his safety madam pomfrey asked puzzled yes his father glared at her again if nathan could be heard he would have told her not to cross him again severus if you haventnoticed the war has been over for more than a decade now are you really this paranoid about he has his reasons poppy is mr granger really stable the headmistress intervened just in time for professor snape was glaring at her with such intensity that his face was turning red with what nathan was sure was fury he is but i ll order some breakfast and you can explain the situation in more detail while we eat professor mcgonagall led the mediwitch away by the arm professor snape was left alone with nathan he made an irritated noise after the retreating pair before closing his eyes and taking a deep breath nathan saw him turn to the bed and look at his body in silence as usual his expression showed nothing of his thoughts and nathan was again at a loss at how to interpret it his father closed the short space to the bed and fixed his eyes on the chalk white face it was then that his expression changed nathan observed in amazement as emotions passed over his father face he had never seen such things in those black eyes they were almost warm tender then long fingers reached out to touch smaller ones nathan gasped a pain that couldntbe physical pulsing in his ethereal chest his father had never touched him like that before why dontyou wake up it was almost a whisper i dontknow how nathan answered desperation building again he wanted to go back into his body he wanted to feel that when the fingers left the small hand and brushed back the hair from his fleshly face a tear escaped nathan eyes he blinked it away and looked up into his father face the man was frowning you re cold he whispered what happened to you i sorry nathan apologized feeling the enormity of what he d done thinking playing with dark spells wasntso serious looking at his father now oh how sorry he was for not being able to feel those caresses for causing so much trouble what if they never find out what had happened to him his vision blurred with the accumulated energy that composed his invisible tears did your birthday unleash some curse on you his father continued his quiet interrogation and nathan realized he knew it was his birthday i dontbelieve someone invaded the castle to curse you i cursed myself nathan sobbed i sorry professor snape didntreact to nathan anguish only stared at his body in contemplation the same finger that had been touching nathan face was now rubbing his father thin lips held there by the support of his other arm crossing his middle although the man seemed to be observing the weak rise and fall of his unconscious body chest his eyes were glazed staring into space in concentration taking in his father pensive face nathan observed that apparent calm and tried to reign in his own emotions professor snape didntvoice any more questions but it was obvious that he was trying to figure out what had happened to him even if he had doubts about his father feelings for him his simple presence there by the bed was reassuring nathan was much calmer when the headmistress and the mediwitch approached them again his father posture straightened and his expression turned colder nathan noticed any change professor mcgonagall spoke first no his father glanced at the bed one last time if you ll excuse me i want to go to my quarters before heading for the classroom he nodded to the women but before he could leave the headmistress spoke again severus do you have means to contact hermione when she teaching at university mum nathan closed his eyes already bracing himself for her disappointment not by any other means you have minerva then i ll need you to go to her during your free period she needs to know what has happened as soon as possible minerva i d prefer to use my free period to research the possible curses that are influencing the boy i sure hagrid wouldntbe averse to the task or even filch severus i cantsend a half giant amongst muggles and filch cantapparate be reasonable the tone in the headmistress voice was of annoyance but also of authority his father mumbled something about details that had never stopped other heads of that school before and agreed halfheartedly fine very well then i can be sure that you ll warn me if there is any change in his condition in the meantime the question was directed at the mediwitch who nodded warn me too if you please his father added then nodded courteously to the women again and finally managed to leave the ward nathan lost interest in the women talk his mind now filled with thoughts of his mother making him oblivious of everything else oo0ooo0oo severus walked the corridors of the castle with long strides with all he had to deal with right now he really didntneed hermione granger added to the lot it wasntuntil minerva had mentioned her that he had realized the absence of her in his thoughts for a full hour the first that week their imminent encounter was not what he need right now waking up from another dream of lips and hands on his face and confessing words had sent him moodily to his bathroom that morning angry with his traitorous thoughts he had bathed methodically he had gone through his morning rituals with a frown on his austere face not even bothering to address himself in the mirror with recriminations like he d done the previous morning he d simply scowled at himself and left the bathroom to dress and leave his dungeon quarters for what promised to be another infernal day infernal was an understatement now he knew when severus had assessed the condition of his son mood before leaving like he did everyday the grey of his enchanted potion took all thoughts from his mind nothing else mattered but finding nathan now he had a son in an infirmary ward a class of dunderheads to teach and hermione granger to meet his head ached reminding him that he hadnthad time to drink any coffee severus entered his quarters and banged the door behind him grimacing at the pang the loud noise brought to his head he went straight to his small kitchen and prepared a cup of coffee then slumped into an armchair and sipped at the strong brew he hoped this would make some of the pain dissipate and when it didn t he pressed his eyes with his fingers remaining like that for a while headache potion he thought he silently summoned a vial that came straight into his hand severus unstoppered the vial and drank from it not even bothered by the foul taste in the silent room his headache receded and he started to summon books from his shelves a pile of them now rested on the coffee table only some of the many severus thought might bring some insight into the curse ailing his son he made a face at the large number of books but he had to start somewhere he took the first three on the top of the pile and left for his morning class severus reduced his lecture to a minimum and soon pointed to the page of the textbook where his third year hufflepuffs and ravenclaws would find the potion to be brewed he didnthave to warn them twice of how he wouldnttolerate any interruptions and chit chat during the rest of the class apparently the first twenty points he d taken during the lecture were enough to show them he wasntin the best of moods the first book severus scanned had nothing enlightening about what could have hit his son he was again trying to understand how the boy could have been cursed right under his rather large nose he should have been aware that something was about to happen that something wasntright he d been constantly reading his son fan mail but nothing had jumped to his suspicious eyes as actually threatening obviously he d missed something or someone severus left his table to wander about his classroom scrutinizing over the cauldrons of nervous students granger had obviously also missed any clues that could have warned them that something like this would happen but then severus hadntexpected her to see anything the woman was incredibly blind about everything and he would soon meet her again after one of her huge displays of blindness if not the biggest one severus took two points from miss landers for stirring too hard thinking about that woman was frustrating she would sometimes fool him showing intelligence seeing into things predicting happenings but those moments were now completely overshadowed by he frowned already back to his desk her lips were far too soft for someone with such an inflexible mind he really didntwant to think about that he opened the second book and focused on nathan problem he knew poppy had discarded any school level curse but he wasntruling them out yet he had stopped being amazed by what dunderheads were able to do when not even trying of course that would widen his search for a treatment greatly but he didntwant to be too simplistic and miss the obvious another book without a curse that seemed to match what had happened to nathan how could it be that none of his friends saw anything if nathan was hit while already asleep some of those gryffindors must have heard or seen something he needed to interrogate them he would do that right after this class only after this class he would be apparating to london to meet granger he rubbed his eyes and closed the book he d just opened why did she have to inflict those supple lips upon him and she had caught him by surprise severus snape hated surprises what would he do about her the class was almost over he had to think fast he told himself as if an acceptable answer which hadntcome to him in all these days would suddenly pop into his head he took the third book he d brought from his quarters and tried to focus on it again he was halfway through noting the lack of help it has been so far when the students handed in their sample vials and moved out of his dungeons alone in his classroom and without any of the answers he needed severus left for his quarters to change into muggle clothes he would stick with plan b ignore their last meeting and simply tell her about nathan getting rid of her as soon as possible oo0ooo0oo severus felt exposed without his robes even if his winter cloak covered most of his black suit too much of his white shirt still showed the warmer temperature inside the chemistry department building didnthelp in the least obliging him to dispose of his cloak and expose even more of himself the guard informed him where granger office was located but she wasntthere he pondered the possibility of leaving a note under the door and going back to hogwarts she would know soon enough and would be obstructing his investigation of the curse in earnest only the concealed warning in minerva voice made him walk further down the hall searching for granger it was obvious that minerva had promised poppy that they would send nathan to st mungo if his mother agreed and severus couldntlet that happen he needed granger on his side for this matter and to achieve that he had to talk to her personally he stopped a young man probably a student and asked where he could find her i think i saw her with professor brice in the laboratory of synthesis it down the hall the last door to the left sir severus inclined his head in thanks and followed the student instructions from the glass windows that gave the room a fish tank appearance he could see her and indeed she had company perfect severus thought sarcastically now i ll have to mind the secrecy of the wizarding world of all things he decided to wait and see if the muggle would leave he observed them interact unaware of the world outside he could see the muggle better than he could see her the man was young maybe older than granger by a few years she was busy with something on the workbench and they were engaged in conversation the muggle smiled while he talked and severus didntlike the way he looked at her when he did so how long would that go on more students filled the hall now and severus felt even more out of his element standing there waiting he looked around for a better place to stand and in doing so he caught some of the conversation going on around him and a comment stood from the rest dontbe silly sarah of course he dating professor granger haventyou noticed how they re always together that doesntmean anything oh please just look at them severus followed the girls eyes to the couple in the lab and caught the muggle professor pulling granger hair from her face placing the curly locks behind her ear at first he only stared not knowing what to make of the scene or even why he needed to make anything out of what he was witnessing then he was angry and not caring why he felt so he decided he had waited long enough and that it wouldntbe much of an inconvenience if he had to obliviate the muggle after all he crossed the hall and opened the door to the laboratory granger looked to the back of the room where the door and he were severus he glared at them we need to talk he told her going straight to the point she didntreact right away only looked at him with surprise and then turned back to whatever experiment she was conducting the muggle though continued to look oddly between them i at a critical stage of the experiment she said at length still attentive to her work can it wait five minutes she finally turned her head to watch him for his answer she seemed uncomfortable with his presence in the room sorry for interrupting the love birds he thought sarcastically and advanced to where the couple was the situation disturbed him more than he felt comfortable with as if i had any time to spare here while our son is in a hospital bed it was what he wanted to say but he decided to lean back against the empty workbench parallel to the one where granger worked and waited for her full attention crossing his arms over his chest and glaring at the muggle just to be sure when that didntmake that bothersome man leave the room severus prepared to deliver his sweet venom on him granger glanced quickly at where he stood almost behind her and he held his tongue to take his scrutiny from the muggle to her averting her eyes again she spoke before he could severus this is professor brice a colleague of mine william this is professor snape from that boarding school nathan attends the muggle extended a hand to him in courtesy severus looked at it contemplating his next move coming to a decision he finally grabbed the hand and held the man eyes adding to granger introduction and nathan father glass chimed over at granger workbench and severus felt a corner of his mouth pulling up trying to form a smirk the muggle seemed taken aback by the statement as he should be it nice to finally meet nathan father the man managed covering his uneasiness quite well and tightening his grasp on severus hand uncomfortably before letting go granger couldntdisguise her nervousness nearly as expertly i done here she said turning to them her eyes looked for his searchingly severus had her attention at last we need to talk severus repeated his earlier statement we can use my office it down the hall or he can leave severus suggested pointing a thumb in the direction of the inconvenient muggle i ll stay if you want me to hermione severus raised an eyebrow at that muggle petulance and then looked at granger she was fidgeting he crossed his arms over his chest again that wontbe necessary will thank you but to prove that annoying was his trait the muggle insisted are you sure i wouldntmind staying severus rolled his eyes i positive thank you again will i ll talk to you later she physically pushed the glaring man towards the door he acquiesced reluctantly murmuring something to granger before finally walking out the door your boyfriend is very protective of you severus commented does he know you go around kissing other men behind his back granger gasped and then glared at him there is nothing between william and me severus i wish there was but alas i cantcare for him as more than a friend the heart is a dumb thing take mine for an example it chose you instead of him severus grimaced angry a hufflepuff would have been touched she sighed why are you here she asked nathan why else what about him she asked her features completely changed to concern he in the hospital wing he said and braced himself for the barrage of questions that was sure to follow why what happened is he all right of course he not you wouldntbe here otherwise it serious isntit he waited say something she demanded are you quite finished he asked just say it he asleep he started she frowned we cantwake him up he added and her lips parted before he completed yet she took a hand to her forehead why is he asleep what happened we suspect it a curse induced sleep he answered not wanting to prolong her visible distress a curse who did that to him the eyes that stared at him were now fierce and bright severus i dontknow he let his own distress over the situation emerge as impatience and brushed back his hair what you mean you dontknow who cursed him what cursed him her indignation and its veiled accusation were not lost in him he was perfectly fine yesterday i only found him this morning in gryffindor tower on his bed sleeping if i didnthave to teach or waste my time coming here under minerva orders i might have found out what is happening to him already why didntyou say so we re wasting precious time she turned from him and headed for the door they hadntdiscussed st mungo yet granger i not done with you yet he called but she didntstop damn he cursed under his breath he couldntuse magic to lock the door before she would leave he would have to go after her following her through the halls he reached her by the end of the corridor granger he grabbed her arm halting her progress she turned angry with him we re wasting time severus she repeated and tried to free herself let go of my arm please he looked around them there were muggles everywhere stupid muggle institution he cursed in a murmur annoyed that he had to measure his words poppy wants to send him to st mungo s if she asks for your permission deny it he released her arm now i done with you st mungo s her worried frown deepened her eyes became unfocused he could see her throat working as she gulped how grave is it donthide anything from me severus just tell me what you know there is no need to send him to st mungo s he stable there nothing wrong with his vital signs he merely sleeping why would poppy suggest st mungo s then she bit her bottom lip i already told you we dontknow how to wake him up yet when poppy doesntknow what to do she sends for st mungo instead of taking her lazy arse off of her chair and doing research she stared at him for a moment when the moment extended for more than he felt comfortable with severus sighed annoyed until i know what going on he wontleave hogwarts she took her eyes from him and looked somewhere in the distance seeming to consider his words or so he hoped at least the woman wasntstupid she would know the risks involved in taking nathan out of the castle i need to see him she said suddenly her eyes focused on him again brighter than before i ve got to see him she turned from him and took her way through the corridor taking a right turn where it ended severus clenched and unclenched his hands before deciding to follow her cursing again it wouldnthelp if she were to apparate and splinched herself in her haste he really didntneed that right now he turned the corridor in time to see her going through a door and unfortunately that muggle following her inside a few quick strides left severus in front of the open door and he could see granger shuffling papers about a desk her back to him and the muggle hovering about he could also hear what they were saying you re distressed i think you should sit down and calm yourself hermione i donthave the time will can you do me a favor and explain to dr ghazali that i had a family emergency and had to leave in a hurry i dontthink he in his office right now and i dontwant to wait for him hermione tell me what wrong with nathan maybe i can help severus really didntlike the way that man spoke his son name granger blinked a few times visibly trying to rein in her emotions you re helping she answered eyes on the desk the man finally caught sight of him by the door severus crossed his arms authoritatively granger glanced up to look at that muggle nuisance and followed his attention to the door and him she paused in what she was doing and seemed to be expecting severus to say something you re coming with me he said she didntargue and quickly resumed her task the muggle continued to stare at him though severus held his gaze impassively leaning against the doorframe the staring continued for a while longer until granger broke their concentration i ll be going then here a note for dr ghazali thanks for everything will i ll let you know if i have to be absent for long she handed him a folded sheet of paper took her coat and bag and walked to where severus stood severus straightened his posture and moved aside the muggle left the room before granger but waited in the corridor while she locked the office i ll walk with you this muggle is truly irritating that wontbe necessary severus intervened before granger could say anything he took her by the arm and led her to the exit leaving the muggle to watch some steps into the chilly day severus turned to his quiet companion to inquire where can we apparate from she conducted them through the grounds of the university her silence was somehow disconcerting that wasnthow he thought she would react to the situation or to his presence then severus reflected on what he knew about hermione granger and concluded that nothing concerning her should surprise him anymore this morning was another good example no yelling no crying no running around like mad and a muggle boyfriend they entered a dead end between two buildings where they stopped she had her wand already in hand when he shook himself from the memory of that intruding muggle fingers on granger hair and grabbed her hand surprised but still haunted eyes answered his move by staring mutely at him i wontcome back for any part you leave behind he held his wand in one hand and moved the other to grab her upper arm instead of her wrist she stepped closer and before he could react he was wrapped in her arms her head on his shoulder she had her eyes closed trusting him blindly it took him a moment an inhalation of her scent to bring his brain back and in order to manage a successful apparition with a crack louder than he had produced in years he vanished them from london and stood now still enveloped by her warm body in hogsmeade apparently every part of them had made through intact including her scent he inhaled deeply answering to his impulsive need of enjoying her fragrance again she loosened her hold of him and stepped back slowly she opened her eyes to look straight into his chest where her head had rested and a hand was pressed fingers running down his tie he observed her attentively unsure of what would follow but she didntlift her gaze only turned and still silent walked to the gates and into the grounds of hogwarts a shudder ran through his body and if it was due to the loss of the contact with her body or the chilly winter day he wasntgoing to think about it his son was in the warm castle cursed needing him that should be the only thought on his mind at the moment crossing the grounds through the doors and straight to the hospital wing severus followed granger so he could make sure she wouldntgo against his will to keep nathan at hogwarts they entered the infirmary granger looking around trying to decide where to start looking for their son where she asked severus pointed to the left ward and entered just after her when she caught eye of nathan she increased her pace to almost a jog while he approached with less haste his boy seemed even paler than earlier and severus feared that his condition had changed for the worse in the hours of his absence oh honey granger touched the small white hand with her trembling one severus watched in silence sweetie you re so cold she whispered loud enough that severus could hear her free hand flying to nathan forehead why didntyou let me know that she was here poppy admonished him in passing quickly approaching the bed severus didntreply he cold he needs more blankets granger had both her hands on nathan face he cold she glared but her imperativeness lost some of its force with the tears flowing freely down her face poppy cast one of her diagnosis spells then addressed the woman still attached to her patient he deeply asleep it not uncommon that his body temperature is lower than normal ms granger even though we suspect the cause of his slumber is a curse we dontknow for sure what curse it is if it any i donthave means to treat him here i need your consent to send him to st mungo where a specialist can examine him severus stepped closer to the bed when the mediwitch mentioned st mungo s poppy glanced pointedly at him he glared at her granger continued to stare at nathan pale face how can someone hurt an innocent child what did he possibly do to deserve this the pain in her voice disarmed him a bit he was born my son he reasoned as an answer to her question fixing his eyes on his son covered feet ms granger i think the healers at st mungo might be able to help him but i need your consent to send him through poppy insisted he cantleave hogwarts at those words severus looked back at her and breathed a quiet sigh of relief there is nothing i can do for him here i dontknow what severus told that he ll find out what going on and will find a way to wake up nathan that what he told me by the way granger sniffed and turned to him what are you still doing here you were supposed to be researching his eyebrows shot up at that when her petulant chin went up a bit more he narrowed his eyes and said i might as well do that since you ve got crying over the sleeping boy covered he turned missing the billow his wizarding robes always made and headed for the door i ll be joining you soon she called after him of course she will he thought striding out into the corridors of hogwarts a n i know it took me forever and a day to put this chapter together but i assure you that the next chapter is written and only needs some adjustments thank you for your faith in me and this story it means the world to me coming next severus and hermione work together and nathan finds a way to be heard disclaimer not mine it all j k rowling s beta readers ginnyw and indigofeathers thank you very much a n chapter twenty six severus and hermione work together and nathan finds a way to be heard chapter 26 a new perspective nathan had watched his mother come in without really taking much notice of the man who had followed her his mother had come and although he had wanted to avoid this moment since he had realized how screwed up he was now that she was there nathan felt only sad that he couldnthug her tight she had cried quietly and he had cried with her she had let her hand slide over the forehead of his sleeping form and he had tried to touch her back comfort her but only got immensely frustrated in the process spilling angry tears she had sat by the bed and stared at his body and he had stood by her chair watching sadly remorse was eating his shiny little soul and he d tried in vain to perform the counter curse for the umpteenth time to no avail his mother had been so silent that she startled him when she suddenly stood up and kissed his fleshy forehead after smoothing back black hair we ll find out what wrong your father can be a lot of things but he a very intelligent man who knows a lot about curses he ll help me find a cure dontworry i know mum i ll go find some books she continued to tell him in a soft soothing voice but i ll be back to check on you later she bent over to kiss him between the eyebrows and then his cheek happy birthday honey she wiped away a stubborn tear and nathan watched her leave with his saddened translucent eyes i so sorry mum the sorrowful energy couldntbe held back and it leaked down his face tears of his own he would never try a spell on himself again and he would never want to know anything about the dark arts while he lived it was a promise he would keep he wanted so much to go back into his body if only he could go back in time and never perform this stupid spell but time wasntcoming back instead an infinite amount of time passed or so it seemed for nathan madam pomfrey had come to check on him before and after lunch nothing had changed his mother hadntcome back yet and neither had professor snape he didntknow why he had stayed with his body when his mother had left the hospital wing sitting down on the floor by the bed was melancholy there was nothing he could do there and there must be something he could do other than stare at the green wallpaper of the infirmary in misery he would go mad from waiting for what he didntthink was coming he needed to leave the hospital wing to test his limits if he felt something different with the distance he could always come back and remain near his body for the rest of this half life the possibility ached and he had to try he had to leave now so he did and he decided to steer to the library and there he went without feeling anything that would have stopped him searching the hall he found the reason for his need to be there his mother o0ooo0o hermione head was a mess of screaming disorder she was so stressed she needed to calm down and be able to think a full thought it d been a while since she felt like this worried sick what she needed was to focus nathan needed her he was so pale that he could blend in with the ghosts never had she seen him so helpless and that was making her helpless he was not prepared she had not prepared him for life in the wizarding world she was failing her son hermione had assumed he would be safe in the castle that nothing more than the childish jinxes usually exchanged between hogwarts students would send him to the hospital wing and cause her to be summoned by the headmistress voldemort was dead his followers were dead or imprisoned there had been no reason for worry wrong wrong and wrong hermione she mocked herself angrily but he was supposed to be under surveillance severus was supposed to be watching over him he d even devised that troublesome necklace for christ sake where was he when the son he said he was watching and protecting was being attacked by god knows who inside the castle no less hermione closed her eyes trying to be calm and rational she knew it wasntseverus fault the blame rest mostly on her severus didntknow how to be a father so she had no right in charging him on that then why was she blaming him because he was here and he should have known what was going on hermione sighed this line of thought wasntgetting her anywhere what she needed was to clear her mind so that she could focus to find a cure for her baby taking a deep breath she went back to the book she d been studying clicking her muggle pen to take notes of any information slightly important in helping nathan it was the fourth she was reading on the subject sleeping spells why there were so many of them this should not have happened he should have been watching over you honey o0ooo0o nathan approached his mother ignoring all the other occupants of the hall she had her head bent over a huge ancient looking book pen in hand taking notes on whatever she was reading he stopped next to her trying to read what she was studying it was about sleep disorders caused by magic nathan sighed you should be studying soul magic mum a dread that she would never find out what was actually wrong with him came back heavy on his ethereal chest leaving him slumped on a chair by her side hopelessness seemed to render him unable to move unwilling to forego her silent company so he remained there trying his best not to think once more time refused to work backwards and as it passed nathan grew bored of watching the movement of students in the library and of his mother note taking the sheer force needed to keep his mind empty proved ineffective and a singular thought wouldntleave him alone she was wasting her time their time and he couldntfind a way of telling her that he tried to move the eraser resting on the table but his not so solid fingers kept going through it without the least of disturbance he stared at the offending object and was startled when his mother closed the book she d been studying and started gathering her things at least they were moving on from the fruitless search nathan followed her into the halls of hogwarts castle not ready to let go of her quite yet o0ooo0o she would not try to deny that the time she d reached the end of the last book she d selected suited her schedule well the classes had been over for at least a quarter of hour so she could head straight to the dungeons to discuss her findings with severus when she d finally managed to keep her irrational irritation of him out of her way she d accomplished as much research on sleeping charms and spells as humanly possible for an afternoon the students portraits and what else crossed her way to the core of the castle went almost unregistered eager to go through the implications of her findings and to soon prove any of them right hermione stopped only to open the door to severus office without even remembering to knock i ve listed some curses the man bent over books on the desk held a hand up successfully interrupting her speech but not her advance into the room he finished reading and taking notes on a piece of parchment and she was upon him by then when he finally looked up she thrust her carefully compiled list in front of him these are the curses i ve listed i heading to the hospital wing to run some tests but i wanted to check on you first i thought you might have something to add or that you might want to be there to see the results i didntfind specifics on possible side effects the testing may cause although i dontsee why there would be any anyway she made a pause for air after saying that all in one breath when she was going to continue with explanations for her suspicions of each of the listed spells she held her tongue watching him go quickly through the list of curses and hexes and even marking the paper in that horrid green ink as if it was another of his student essays i ve tested him for most of them it none he said curtly going back to his note taking you may test for the others i marked but i dontthink there will be any positive response you did what the annoyance that hermione had diligently worked to abate was back as quickly as the blink of an eye when have you tested him didntyou have classes all afternoon she wouldntbe able to hold herself back even if she wanted to and right now she didntmuch care have you even thought that i might have wanted to be there for any and every test she glared at him in anger noting with increased belligerence that it didnthave any effect on the infuriating man do you know how stupid you make me feel every time you make me discard a whole afternoon of work she accused waving the now useless list in her hand we re both coming up with the same list of curses if i knew someone else would be helping with the research like you very well did i would have the decency to let the person know what books i would be looking at first or would ask the person to join me in searching we re in this together for god sake we re both his parents her tone of voice had risen as the rant was spilt hermione anger grew to a level she hadntreached in a long time and severus didnteven have the decency to look at her while she spoke severus she called the most unbelievably exasperating of wizards continued to move his quill over the parchment as if there wasnteven anyone there let alone screaming at him she clenched her hands in fists crumpling the edges of the paper she held and feeling like hitting him for such blatant disregard she quickly bent over the desk that protected him and and grabbed the quill from his hand as a consolation prize i talking to you she hissed how very mature was all he said taking another quill from the holder on the desk and dipping it in dark green ink i trying to add as much detail as possible to the observations i made of each test so if you can refrain from shrieking while i reminisce that would be appreciated oh she would hit that large nose and make him take that right back she was so angry only she needed to know what he had found out about what was addling their son as much as she needed air hermione felt for the strength that had been pushing her on since severus had found her in the university and it was not there weak and defeated she let her body fall heavily on the uncomfortable chair just behind her hiding her face in her hands god i pathetic o0ooo0o nathan watched the scene unfold before him with apprehension he was sure his mother would explode if she didntdo something to dissipate her anger quickly nathan had seen his mother angry on many occasions and knew she had reached the highest level he d seen in his life he would never push her past that stage of anger he looked at his father the man acted as if he hadntbeen interrupted ignoring her completely the disdain he showed for his mother distress was starting to annoy nathan more and more his displeasure with professor snape increased when his mother fell heavily on a chair in front of the desk and held her head in hands elbows on her knees nathan even reached a hand to touch her voluminous hair but retreated upon remembering he was unable to comfort her by touch or any other means look what you did he told the man even though he knew that he couldntbe heard why do you have to be such a git all of the time just dontdo that again his mother said into her hands nathan continued to glare at professor snape as improbable as it might have seemed those few quiet words from his mother after all the shouting gained professor snape attention nathan saw when he stopped scribbling and looked up observing her intently his expression was the one nathan usually saw on those harsh features dispassionately and infuriatingly blank what made nathan disapproval of the man attitude abate a little was how long he stared at his mother as if he was contemplating something very serious and important about her professor snape dramatic sigh called to his mother attention making her look at him their eyes met what do you suggest then that i stop trying to find a cure because it interferes with your schedule his mother reclined on the chair waving a hand in the air whatever she said i just dontwant to waste any more time in fruitless research just dontdo that again i ll find out what is wrong with nathan the way his father said that punctuated with his given name made the remnants of nathan anger dissipate his father was actually trying to help him his mother was still holding professor snape eyes as if they could communicate more through that connection than with actual words whatever they conveyed to each other they seemed to have reached an agreement of some sort his mother closed her eyes and sighed tell me what you ve learned from the tests she asked him it not a sleeping curse his father told her the previous exchange the shouting the harsh words all but forgotten they started to talk about what information professor snape tests had revealed nathan listened for a while his hopes renewed after his father statement but soon his attention drifted elsewhere lest his frustration at watching two brilliant adults struggling with other wrong theories take him over the edge of his thinly held together sanity he inspected the jars leaning the shelves some containing floating things he could recognize others more challenging nathan was still listening to what his parents were discussing over at the desk but he tried not to think about what he heard preferring the distraction of the jars and their contents despite the distraction his mind would drift and try to find ways to end this torment he tried to reverse the spell a dozen times more without success before giving up again if only he could tell the couple by the desk what had happened where the right book could be found a scratch of wood on stone followed by his father voice broke nathan concentration i need to attend dinner in the great hall the professor complained then added in a growl stupid rule breakers i ll move to the lab his mother said in answer standing up as well and gathering her things nathan approached the desk to better listen to his parents you should come with me professor snape was scowling down at his mother but she didntseem to notice i promise i wontplay with your toys while you re gone she assured him adjusting the books and papers in her arms before looking up at him you ll be less of a nuisance if you re fed that was an insult right nathan could have sworn that it was but his mother was looking at professor snape with that expression she held for when he did something she thought endearing one that was almost always followed by a wet kiss on his cheek and some fondling of his hair that gave nathan pause would his mother try to kiss professor snape on the cheek but then again it wasntunheard of that mothers would kiss fathers on the cheek he d seen his friend mothers kiss their fathers on the cheek more than once i ll order something from the kitchens dontworry she answered trying to smile the glow in her eyes was almost genuine nathan noticed professor snape had insulted her and that made her happy he would never understand adults professor snape scowl deepened before he nodded and left the office without looking back his mother and nathan watched him leave nathan followed his mother with his eyes when she finally retreated to the lab he thought for a second and decided that the great hall would be less boring than another hour or so watching his mother read he crossed through the door at a trot eyes screwed shut and followed his father steps down the dungeon dark corridors o0ooo0o nathan is still sleeping then asked jose yes kevin confirmed to her and anna who had looked up when he approached the table with andy jose seemed sad with the news none of them were aware of their invisible companion while they talked about the happenings of the day nathan had met his friends on the way to the great hall and now listened with attention standing right behind kevin and andy at the gryffindor table what do you think happened to him jose asked do they know i thought professor lupin would have found out by now but after an afternoon questioning the whole house for nothing i not so sure there was a time i thought he wouldntrun out of questions anna confessed he did only he went back to the same ones over and over again andy said so they still dontknow concluded jose maybe he thinks you re hiding something anna accused what were you doing last night after all andy was about to say something when kevin elbowed him that none of your business andy rubbed at the side of his ribs glaring at kevin before saying no we re not hiding anything anna they were as nathan knew quite well they were hiding the book the very thing that would help his parents and professor lupin put things right again you should hand the book to professor lupin he told them knowing they wouldnthear him but not caring we dontknow what happened or we would have told professor lupin kevin added and that nathan knew to be the truth maybe snape is behind this he could have cursed nathan anna conspired careful not to be heard by anyone else if he was concerned dontyou think he would rather be with nathan than show up for dinner wasnthe supposed to be worried she asked diverting all eyes to the high table professor lupin is absent poor nathan jose lamented professor snape has nothing to do with this nathan wouldntlike to hear you saying that nathan was thankful to andy for dislodging the accusation the only one who could be blamed was himself no one commented on anything else but nathan wasntmistaken by the doubt evident on the girls expressions before they went back to their dinner kevin did the same only his features didntshow the doubt nathan saw on the girls faces andy stared at their professor a little longer before resuming his dinner quietly nathan felt suddenly very tired the day seemed to have lasted as long as a week and he could only imagine what a week of this would feel like he sighed and closed his eyes and when he opened them it was to find a running boy on track to collide with him instinctively he took a step closer to the table reaching out for support but finding nothing that would be solid to help him he looked down and saw with wide eyes that his hand had gone through andy shoulder he withdrew hurriedly andy shuddered at the immaterial touch or was it nathan imagination was that a ghost the boy asked kevin no it was aston he already losing points for running kevin clicked his tongue nathan reached out to touch again now on purpose and watched his friend shudder andy looked over his shoulder to where he stood if his friend could feel that i think it was a ghost andy insisted confirming nathan suspicions that he d felt something kevin shrugged but nathan could only smile andy had felt his touch inadvertently nathan did it again and laughed when andy shuddered and dropped the fork looking from side to side searching for the source of his distress i right behind you nathan said grinning to what he got no answer well even if they could feel his presence they couldnthear him yet but still nathan tried to touch kevin the same way he did andy but that didntseem to work hmm interesting he mused he touched andy once more this time his friend stood up quickly turning around ready to admonish who or whatever he thought was causing the chills nathan laughed at him but it was more out of happiness for his discovery than of his friend predicament he felt like hugging him this was a huge development nick andy said and nathan spun on his translucent heels to see what his friend was looking at i trying to have dinner here excuse me nearly headless nick inquired nathan smirked andy thought it was the ghost he touched andy shoulder just to make a point andy shuddered growling while the tremor ran through his spine it not funny his friend protested nathan looked around there were a few students staring maybe he could call the teachers attention maybe his father would notice and would understand what was happening to andy maybe they would find a way to communicate he used both hands to touch andy this time hoping it would cause a stronger reaction it did andy jumped forward stop it andy glared at nick i thought you ghosts werentsupposed to do that the ghost approached and said there is no ghost distressing you my boy maybe you should ask your sleeping friend there to stop playing tricks on you nick glared at nathan whose eyes widened you can see me he exclaimed of course i do now stop touching the awake the ghost reprimanded you can hear me as well nathan eyes couldntgo wider who are you talking to andy asked you wontbe bothered again my boy you should enjoy the food while you still can nick eyes strayed longingly to the food on andy plate then the ghost floated away muttering something about meatballs nathan left his confused friends and practically ran after the ghost of gryffindor house screaming wait wait nick after searching the first and second floors nathan was dispirited where were all the ghosts of this castle when he needed them now that he knew that they could see and talk to him there were none around he found a few ghosts during his perambulations but as soon as they spotted him they fled it was way past curfew when nathan was strolling the dungeons and saw a shimmering glow from around the corner he smiled when he noticed that the ghost didntflee as he approached but as soon as he recognized who the ghost was nathan smile slipped nathan stared at the figure floating only a few feet from him while he decided how to approach him he canthurt you dontbe afraid you re a gryffindor he mentally told himself what asked the intimidating figure startling nathan who didntthink that the ghost had seen him yet i he started lifting his head to adjust his attention as the tall ghost approached you re not a slytherin the ghost surmised what do you want here i need your help baron sir i need you to speak with professor snape nathan voice wasntthe firmest he d ever used but it came out steady enough what business would a gryffindor have with the head of slytherin house the suspicious ghost asked narrowing his eyes nathan didntknow how the baron had found out he was a gryffindor this ghost was definitely creepy and he wanted to keep the chat to a minimum i professor snape son baron sir he answered without preamble i without my body and he canthear or see me i need his help to undo the spell that did this to me would you talk to him for me sir the silence that followed was the eeriest thing nathan had ever experienced his soul shuddered defying his lack of body when the bloodied ghost approached even more as if he was trying to sense nathan by smell follow me the baron said drifting quickly through a wall nathan hated it but he followed him through and many other objects he had to overpass before they were in the middle of his father living room it was darker than usual with only the dying flames of the hearth to illuminate it he looked around but his father was nowhere to be found he asleep came in the hoarse whisper of the ghost drifting from a wall nathan hadntseen he d crossed until then nathan opened his mouth to ask him if there was any means to wake the professor but the ghost was already floating away leaving his father quarters nathan could only stare at the spot on the wall the ghost had chosen to traverse he knew i needed him he said and thought he sounded desperate even to his own ethereal ears nathan at the sound of another voice that deep voice calling his name nathan spun on his heels at a speed that would have made him sway if it wasntfor his lack of mass there before his gaping face stood as translucent as himself the soul of his father how could that be nathan didntknow and he wasntin any condition to rationalize past the question thank merlin it you his father soul let out in a soft tone that nathan had never heard from the man before professor snape was seeing and talking to him and that was everything he d longed for since this whole mess started the relief of finally completing the quest that started when nearly headless nick had spoken to him was overwhelming but it felt like nothing compared to the vibrating energy coming from his approaching father who was crossing the room towards him and it only intensified when professor snape took his small head into his large hands the light emanating from eyes usually so black captured nathan full attention and he let himself be thoroughly inspected where have you been nathan had barely registered the words so quiet was the question i he tried to answer but it was hard to form anything coherent when surrounded by such strong feelings anxiety relief contentment and something warm that he couldntidentify seemed to dance through him and nathan was almost certain that the emotions he was sensing werententirely his doing you ve got me worried his father continued you cantsimply leave your body and not go back like that young man even the harsher tone of this last statement was nothing compared to professor snape usual displays of displeasure it was though enough for the overwhelming energy to dissipate a little leaving nathan with a feeling of loss he couldntfully understand i want to he finally managed to answer i ve tried he added many many times sir nathan felt like crying the ability of absorbing those waves of foreign feelings combined with his own being more than he could handle that must have showed on his shining face one of the hands resting on his shoulders came to brush his fine hair in the soothing way he d seen it doing to his body head that morning when no one was looking explain yourself nathan he closed his eyes it a spell he started at his father request i cast it on myself and now i cantcast the counter spell and i locked outside of my body but i want to go back i just dontknow how and i ve followed all the instructions i did everything right and it still wontwork and i dontknow what else to do shhh his father broke into his rambling explanation bringing nathan head to press against his torso nathan went silent like the tears he d been spilling reveling in such intense contact you need to calm yourself if you want me to understand what you re saying instinctively nathan went about the motions involved in taking deep breaths and even if no air was needed the act made the vibration of the flickering of the light they were made of quiet slightly he felt protected and that was all he needed to halt the flow of tears streaking his cheeks you mentioned a spell nathan nodded in agreement what kind of spell a soul spell he answered to the deep voice he hadntfelt this small since he d left pre school for primary school his father released him stepping back you shouldntknow any such spell where did you learn it in a book sir of course i sorry nathan apologized i know you are now that there was a distance between him and professor snape the energetic field that had shaken his soul had lost force and he could think past his emotions professor snape had actually acknowledged his apology nathan stared at the man settling on the couch and tried to filter the actions from the waves of emotions that had taken place from the moment he d heard his name that night it wasntan easy exercise and the silence in the dungeons at that ungodly hour became disturbing his father had greeted him with concern and although he could remember one or two isolated occasions when he d thought professor snape might have been worried about him there was always a lingering doubt brought by the actions that would follow not today though today his father had been openly concerned going to the extent of voicing it nathan continued to stare at the soul of his father while he let himself be transported back into the moment he d been held dare he think kindly by those shiny arms engulfed in warmth not completely or at all physical his father had hugged him actually hugged him you were hugging me it finally became words the eyes that hadntleft him all the while he d been staring danced giving nathan all the answer he would get and he felt hugged again come over here his father beckoned and nathan obeyed hypnotized by that new found light that insisted on bestowing warmth from otherwise cold black eyes you ve had a trying day that and a nod to his right completed the invitation to join him on the couch nathan sat down and then frowned who are you his father arched an eyebrow at his question was that a soul spell or a memory charm you hugged me you were distressed and you hugged me professor snape rolled his eyes and with that dismissed the matter tell me about the spell he prompted nathan put his confusion aside in favor of explaining the spell he d cast on himself in recounting his actions the night before he realized how simple the spell had been and yet it turned out a complication of such astronomic proportions where is this book his father wanted to know afterwards it in kevin trunk tell me about the counter spell again what wonthe leave right away to punish my friends for such grave disregard of the school rules wonthe even mention it deduct house point or or whatever when nathan had decided to tell the professor where the book was he d braced himself for the worst what he got was even far more than what he d classify as the best this was plain weird it was as if professor snape didntmind that a restricted section book was hidden in a trunk inside gryffindor tower nathan rising suspicions couldntbe silenced any longer you re not professor snape he was on his feet to make that accusation he took the magical imprint of his wand in hand professor snape nathan his name and the tone in which it was voiced made him actually point the wand at that stranger the man looked from the wand to his face and smiled always prepared he nodded appreciatively that my boy i not nathan said and energy accumulated on the tip of his wand shining dangerously at the man who opened his arms and hands beside his head to show he wouldntfight nathan magic i dontknow who you are but you re not professor snape he added more controlled i severus your father you cantbe he wouldntact like this talk to me like that he wouldntknow how to leave his body and be here in spirit with you the man completed before he could you retained your consciousness i see come over here the man beckoned nathan didntbudge nor lowered his wand fine his father seemed to sadden with that short acknowledgement when the body rests during the sleep the soul is free to rest as well he started to explain that wasntenough for nathan who stared sternly at the man until he continued we re free to be who we would be if we werentunder our brains wrath all the time their eyes met by the man insistence i free to simply be severus your father nathan didntrealize he d lowered his wand while his mind worked to understand what he was being told confused he asked are we dreaming the man smiled with a sincerity nathan had never seen from him before come sit with me he invited nathan walked slowly to the couch and frowning sat by the soul claiming to be his father s part of what is going on here is registering on the subconscious part of my brain so yes this will register as a dream the man explained further nathan looked sideways to the figure of his father when a mix of feelings hit him at once this is all a dream then oh i assure you this is very real apparently you ll remember it all when you get back into your body since you retained your consciousness i on the other hand will manage to remember only glimpses of what we re living now outside the confines of the flesh if anything the sadness nathan felt wasntentirely his own he looked up and met his father downcast eyes used to finding there expressionless features it was fascinating to see and feel all those emotions coming from the always heavily guarded wizard and nathan was readily reminded of that morning in the hospital wing when he felt sorry for not being able to feel his father caresses on his face and hand as if he d spoken that aloud fingers touched his face brushing his hair back with both hands resting on nathan shoulders severus said i sorry my boy for what his father was apologizing it wasntclear nathan let himself be absorbed by the engulfing emotions and felt his shoulders being squeezed affectionately before he was released we need to reverse the spell you said the book from which you learned it is with one of your friends who was that again kevin he answered the anima codex is in kevin trunk i probably wontremember much of this conversation when my body wakes up nathan tried to interrupt and say that he could ask the ghosts to help them communicate but his father raised a hand and continued urgently this is important nathan please listen my body is coming to awareness at this very moment it will take a few minutes until it awakes fully it important that i remember at least where to look for the book and here is what i need you to do he stood from the couch follow me he commanded and left through a closed door nathan crossed the door that now he knew led to his father bedroom he looked around he d never before thought about what professor snape bedroom looked like and even so he was surprised the bed dominated the room and the light colors of the hangings a moss sort of green were something nathan wasntexpecting from the always black clad man there was a soft looking rug in a dirty sort of cream color on one side of the bed where he found the soul of the owner of this room standing he seemed amused but it lasted only for a short while you ll have time to look around later now i need you to come over here nathan obeyed he approached the bed and only then took his attention from the soul to its usual bearer the body of his father rested peacefully under a voluminous comforter his lips were slightly open and his nose was even more prominent from this angle i need to get back inside the soul told him do as i say talk to my body about where to find the book repeat it until i awake and maybe i ll remember do you understand it not start now nathan nathan was put out by the interruption but did as he was told and started telling his father where the book was the book is in kevin trunk say it as an order nathan his father soul was positioning itself over the bed tell me to look for the book with kevin he watched with fascination as his father soul adjusted its lower half against the body lying there on the bed ask kevin for the book he said go on the soul instructed ask kevin for the book he repeated then again and again the soul lay over the body disappearing completely and nathan came closer to the man and continued to chant ask kevin for the book ask kevin for the book a pair of black eyes snapped open so suddenly that nathan breath caught in his throat in a swallowed gasp his father looked directly at him and for a moment nathan thought he could see him this assumption soon proved wrong when his father blinked and stared at the light green hangings above him the man took a deep breath and moved dislodging the comforter nathan took a step back when his father sat on the bed stretching his neck when he stood he was the strictly rigid professor snape that nathan could recognize even when wearing a nightgown nathan missed his father freed soul already

disclaimer not mine it all j k rowling s beta readers ginnyw indigofeathers and annie talbot thank you very much a n chapter twenty seven the book is found and they work on the counter spell chapter 27 working together severus had slept poorly the few hours he d devoted to his rest were disturbed by dreams of matters that still worried him this morning he d dreamed of his son and the disjointed images he could piece together didntleave his mind at ease severus was used to sleep depriving pressure but this was different in some way he hadntbeen this worried since the potter days washed and in fresh black robes he entered his living room and looked at the book covered desk in the corner somehow he knew that going back to those texts was pointless scanning the room all the books there had the same effect there was a weight on his mind telling him that the answer wasntthose books they needed something that wouldntbe found in this room maybe resorting to printed words was not the answer at all only the answer should be in a book somewhere and that voice in his head sounded strangely like granger s when had he started listening to what the woman said it made a strange amount of sense though even if it was just a strong feeling of rightness that made it so that same feeling told him that the precise book wasntthere where then the library was the obvious choice and severus was glad that he would disagree with that womanly voice that had suggested it in his head this time around he had a different idea as to where the crime scene the answer would be found inside gryffindor tower he didntquestion why the tower was important he wasntsure he understood it himself what he did know was that he would be questioning a pair of gryffindors as soon as he set eyes on them o0ooo0o nathan watched in anxious anticipation his father go through what he supposed were his morning rituals the clock on the mantelpiece told him it was too early for breakfast in the great hall and it also made nathan wonder if his father was always up at such ungodly hour the way the man eyed the books on the desk told nathan that this wasntan ordinary morning for professor snape nathan wanted to believe that his father was up this early out of worry for him and he was succeeding it was infinitely easier to accept that his father cared for him after the previous night events would professor snape remember what passed between them would he find the book in kevin trunk maybe nathan should go after a ghost but even the idea of walking the whole castle in search of one willing to hear him out was dispiriting it would probably take less time to wait until breakfast and see if his father would approach his friends time passed in restless silence with nathan observing his father and unable to keep from reliving his meeting with the man soul he observed and compared the now with then looking for signs that the caring soul was indeed inside the austere shell on a second or perhaps it was on a third or even a fourth look the fog hiding professor snape feelings didntseem so dense the eyes were more alive as they gazed at the fire the gestures more human as he handled a cup of tea maybe it had always been this way only nathan had never noticed before maybe images nathan had banned from his mind of dreams he didnthave anymore were there unbidden brought back by his hopeful heart he felt smaller a child holding his father hand while they walked to the playground a hand nathan would no longer remember closed into fists of white rage but lightly stroking the leather of a book cover he could feel the touch as if it was indeed on the skin of his own hand maybe on the space shining its emptiness in the light of the fire never warm enough nathan could see himself he would join his father to read in the evenings and when the printed words got jumbled nathan would lend his heat to his father thighs by resting his head there soon the hand would be back and nathan could feel it already a token of his meeting with freedom maybe he would relive that one day maybe even if the day wouldntbe today or tomorrow nathan felt like waiting again the dreams could come back no longer forbidden and the next time he dreamed nathan would know it was real and possible nathan immediate wait ended with that promise when his father stood and reached for his black outer robes preparing to leave his quarters they would head for the great hall and nathan hoped his father would seek kevin nathan no longer had desire or reason to stay away from material life anymore more than ever they needed the book o0ooo0o severus didntmean to leave so early for breakfast but waiting uselessly in his quarters wasnthelping to bring his son back idle time flooded his mind with thoughts and the more he considered it the more he felt sure of his resolve to look for answers in gryffindor tower lupin hadntlooked for him the day before and that greatly annoyed severus the defense professor had surely investigated his house severus knew even if he hadntfelt obliged to enlighten him of his findings yet unless lupin had reported to granger instead though that was not any improvement because if he had that meant granger didntsee fit to share the intelligence with him would she use knowledge as means of revenge severus knew she could although the possibility of that being the case now was deemed false by her own words that she wouldntwithhold information where nathan welfare was concerned lupin was the moron then severus didntneed their help to get the information he needed he could very well get his own answers from the boys he was one of the first to arrive at the great hall and had the whole meal to wait for his sources only hagrid occupied the head table when he took his customary seat and scanned the still mostly empty hall biding his time would have been less trying without the undesirable company of his colleagues any change in mr granger condition severus minerva asked were you informed of any change severus returned the question then sipped a small mouthful from the cup of coffee he intended to make last until the gryffindors arrived a simple no would have sufficed nothing has changed before minerva could go on with her chattering severus added and no poppy cantmove him to st mungo s what does hermione have to say on the matter minerva asked she wontagree with the transfer either severus assured frowning now she can answer for herself thank you the very subject of their conversation intervened granger took the seat on his other side before adding if we dontfind a way to wake nathan up by the end of the day i ll contact st mungo myself and risk his life in doing so it a very reasonable decision especially coming from his own mother he could taste his sarcastic words mingling with the bitter flavor of his coffee have you made any progress the question unnerved him not only because it pointedly ignored his comment but also because she already knew the answer what could he have found out since they parted late last night he could see that her attitude hadntimproved much from the afternoon before since she d started yelling at him for the simple reason of playing his part as nathan father granger had been trying to wound him with what she deemed witty words at every opportunity she got was she blaming him for what had happened if that was the case she was completely mistaken if she was looking for a scapegoat for their son illness she should be blaming lupin that reminded him did lupin report to you he asked her was he supposed to worthless werewolf he cursed he found me in the library when i was collecting all that useless information yesterday severus didntappreciate her cheap sarcasm and let the feeling show through his eyes he was very distressed by the fact of being unable to be of more help he offered his apologies for letting nathan come to harm when he was responsible for his protection but i assured him that he wasntthe only one responsible i wouldntexpect him to be watching nathan all the time there were others claiming to do so nonetheless he showed only disdain for her open accusation severus wouldntgive her the pleasure of a scene in the great hall but he also wouldntlet her get away with blaming him for what had happened gryffindors are famous for their irresponsibility was his comment he made sure she understood the threat woven in his words she had the gall to snort whatever severus his attention was then on the students entering the hall but from the corner of his eye severus could see granger tipping her cup and taking hurried bites of whatever was on her plate it didntsurprise him when she stood to leave thankfully exactly when his potential witnesses were crossing the threshold when he stood as well granger misread his intention i dontneed you to escort me he took the pleasure in snorting before leaving her behind without a glance back on his way to the gryffindor table once there he paused only long enough to say mr brown and mr wood a word in my office you have fifteen minutes if any ghost had been paying attention to sleeping boys that day it would have been witness to the huge grin that radiated enough love to be called an ethereal hug such a ghost might have even become curious enough to follow the trail of hope that oddly accompanied the gryffindors into the dungeons that morning o0ooo0o he held himself rigidly in his chair and watched the boys approach his desk with the caution that his steady gaze warranted what exactly happened in that tower severus asked as soon as the gryffindors stopped in front of him they looked sideways at one another annoying severus with their silent hesitation i waiting he urged i dontknow sir woods answered what about you mr brown severus prompted do you care to tell me what happened i dontknow what happened sir the boys flinched when severus growled you ll tell me what happened whether you want to or not so i suggest you start talking we really dontknow sir wood voice took a pained tone when we went upstairs nathan was already in bed i only found out that something was wrong in the morning werentyou together severus wanted to know startled that his son had been in bed earlier than his friends then severus realized that he didntknow anything about his son routine in the common room nathan went to bed earlier that night wood again answered why severus demanded silence i asked why severus intoned gravely he was upset sir wood once more answered brown remained silent will i have to keep asking why or are you going to tell me what happened before i lose my patience wood gulped brown remained silent looking grave malfoy set him up sir brown finally said he challenged nathan to get inside the restricted section of the library knowing that he would get in trouble if someone caught him there the moment nathan entered malfoy ran to fetch madam pince severus narrowed his eyes but no one got caught or i d know of this stupidity by now he pointed out anger rising and making him want to yell detentions at that precise moment how could nathan have let himself be goaded by devon yet again after all the warnings he gave him them he felt like shaking both instead he concentrated on the task at hand glaring at the two boys he had in his presence what was the challenge brown fidgeted but wood answered nathan had to bring a book sir what book severus insisted wood looked at brown as if asking for support brown was looking everywhere but at the two other wizards in the room severus knew he d reached the heart of things where is the book he asked brown tensed and wood stared intently at his feet mr brown i want this book here now both boys jumped with that last loud command move he barked and they were finally compliant leaving in rushed steps with the promise of being back right away snape banged his fist on the desktop growling to let loose some of his anger stupid brainless brats he cursed between gritted teeth promising himself that devon malfoy would not walk out unpunished this time he sighed a book from the restricted section what was nathan thinking until he saw what book it was severus couldntbe sure but he was almost certain that what was cursing his son came from it a dark arts book most probably and severus could only hope it was something he d be able to reverse he didntwant to think about what would happen if he couldn t severus pinched the bridge of his nose feeling a sadness he usually didntlet reign over his rage he would probably understand the overwhelming regret taking hold of his feelings better if he could see the boy standing next to him a hand hovering over his bowed head o0ooo0o andy and kevin had come back with the anima codex and the detention they d earned for hiding it in the first place accompanied by the loss of forty house points had not been surprising given the twisted lips and deep frown that had met them for the handover of the book surprising however was the look of apprehension his father bestowed the dark arts book now that the boys were gone nathan own anxiety rose for a moment professor snape only stared at the book on his desk seemingly lost in thought and his expression made nathan see once again a glimpse of the soul he knew resided inside his father eyes were almost glazed and nathan longed to see what thoughts were passing through his mind to understand why he felt like hugging and comforting the man beside him reversing their roles this morning they were both startled by the sound of the door opening to let his mother inside she stopped when she saw them no just his father in the room i sorry i assumed you would be in the classroom by now she apologized for the unannounced invasion as i should be his father back to his usual demeanor said he stood gathering his things and with them the anima codex when nathan was sure professor snape would approach his mother with the news he simply passed her by and exited taking with him the only means to help her find a way to bring nathan back hey nathan protested if he had classes to teach professor snape should have left the book with his mother at least for the morning his indignation did nothing to stop the scene unfolding before him and nathan was due for another morning outside of his body he thought about looking for a ghost but then gave up on the idea what he needed was someone studying that book as soon as possible and if professor snape had taken it maybe that was what he planned to do leaving his unsuspecting mother with her useless tomes nathan headed for the potions classroom where hope currently resided o0ooo0o five points mr riley severus said he d assigned the quickest potion a first year could brew and yet the dunderheads were making every unthinkable mistake and holding him back he d brought the book with him but hadntdared to open it in a classroom full of students this was the kind of text one should never take for granted such dark texts should have never had reached his son hands soul magic this couldntbe good if severus were a lesser wizard he would have admitted that this was worse than simply not good a tampered soul severus would not think about dementors severus would not think about the dark lord a shiver ran down his spine regardless of his will not to think of the past he needed to get rid of the students as he felt time was of the essence now more than before you have twenty minutes to get the potion done and get out of my sight he told the class turning his back to them and starting towards his desk at the front twenty minutes but that not enough severus heard that protest and ground his teeth spinning to meet his godson with a sneer on his face five points from slytherin mr malfoy he said without even blinking then added and a detention devon was not the only gasp in the room but un another five points from slytherin mr malfoy severus cut the boy before he could protest any further after what he d found out earlier listening to his godson voice without blaming him for what was happening to his son had become a challenge severus knew he wasntguilty alone but it didntchange the fact that he was guilty nonetheless severus should have put a stop to this stupid childish rivalry sooner had he known that it would have come to this he would have what was wrong with his son soul time seemed to slow down when it should do the opposite severus went back to his desk and as soon as his stipulated time was reached he shooed the first years from the classroom and prepared to leave immediately after them uncle severus he growled the boy fidgeted but stood his ground waiting to be acknowledged what severus snapped wanting nothing more than to get rid of the bothersome delay did you really mean it when you said detention his godson had the temerity to ask have you ever heard me say detention and not mean it severus retorted narrowing his eyes never devon said slytherin instinct prompting him to belatedly add sir when severus turned to leave again the boy insisted but why severus glared from over his shoulder for being a selfish spoiled brat and disobeying your godfather and thus putting my son life at risk and now i ve had time to reconsider you re in detention everyday from tonight until i see fit he kept his gaze on the boy face only long enough to see it lose all color then turned and left o0ooo0o if another boy who was also in the room could afford losing any color he would have nathan gaped at the door his father had exited by not believing his ethereal eyes and ears professor snape had given malfoy endless detentions on his behalf no less a heart that couldntbe a real one threatened to jump out of his mouth a loud sniffle reminded nathan that he wasntalone in the classroom he turned to see malfoy scrubbing at his eyes with a hand visibly to clear them of tears malfoy was crying who crying now he goaded knowing the blond couldnthear him he my father not yours nathan thought he had the right to feel elated with the sight of his nemesis crying but he didn t he insisted how nice is it to hear how much of a disappointment you are again no joy when the words were out nathan scowled at the sniffling boy and answered his own question it was awful to hear that you were a disappointment his mind took him to harry his godfather and nathan couldntimagine how awful it would be to hear that from him how awful it had been to hear that from his father nathan decided to leave the room before he started feeling sorry for malfoy that would be too much o0ooo0o hermione was distracted from her quiet note taking when severus entered the laboratory i glad you re back we need to start some potions right away she told him forget it he answered hermione gaped frowning then at his refusal you listen to me severus if you his soul was tampered with he announced and kept those dark eyes on her many questions crossed her mind in the short period of a few seconds but none found her voice she stared speechless at severus until her mouth moved and uttered a low whispered soul this was in his possession he showed her a book so if you ll excuse me i need my lab she moved her eyes quickly from the book to severus face give me that book severus you ll have no use for it the dark arts are accio book hermione said and the book left severus hand and flew to hers before she could open it though severus had his hands on it holding it closed have you lost the few brain cells you had he growled release the book this instant let go severus if he thought he would take that book from her he was very mistaken a staring match ensued until he sighed still holding his side of the book fine you donthave to leave while i examine it if you think you can work around me you dontknow me at all granger you cantsimply open a dark arts book without examining it for curses and jinxes first as you should know what addling nathan what the hell severus let the book go shaking his hand to dispel the ache hermione knew he must be feeling from her nonverbal jinx without waiting for his offensive response sure to follow she opened the book that seemed to make him stop his advance for only seconds before he tried to take the book away from her again i still whole severus i never perceived you as a coward so stop acting like one she admonished him holding the book out of his reach and your vast knowledge in the dark arts would have assured you that nothing would happen when you opened that book i sure stop being a child and start thinking before you act oh brave gryffindor he sneered you ll end up in a bed next to nathan or worse you ll take me there with you severus continued to watch her gravely not seeming to have realized what he d insinuated hermione blushed and averted her face trying to hide her thoughts a juvenile hope in fact he was right about her childish behavior but that didntexempt him of his share in this argument when did you find this book she asked trying to change the subject back to the task at hand and how did you know nathan had it lupin has no control over his gryffindors or any knowledge of the goings on in their tower nathan took the book from the restricted section and was with it the night this all happened his friends were hiding this small insignificant piece of information severus exuded sarcasm and hermione knew by now that this was a defense mechanism he used with excellence ignoring his unfounded accusations she asked you said that his soul was tampered with do you know that for sure or was it only a guess hermione met his eyes again implying that she would take sincerity and nothing else i hope i wrong severus said and hermione bit at her lower lip severus hermione tried but she simply couldntvoice her fears lest she made them true or had his confirmation i know he confirmed nonetheless inflecting his voice in a warm way she hadntheard before i think we ve lost too much time arguing already let me work on the book hermione oh the slytherin bastard i think you should work on your persuasion skills instead severus they re lacking calling me hermione with that sultry voice of yours wontmake me hand you the book and leave you free to hex me out of here she blushed again but this time she sustained what she hoped was a resolved stance and kept staring at him when he didntdeny his manipulative strategy she continued i think we re perfectly capable of working on the book together we both want nathan well so i dontsee why not hermione saw his eyebrows come together then saw nothing more as she turned her back on him and walked to a workbench placing the opened book on it she turned the pages looking for the table of contents and heard him approach feeling him stand behind her it seems you re determined to be deliberately reckless i couldntcare less although you should be thinking about nathan when you do that he all i thinking about you re breaking my concentration it wasnttrue she hadntstarted reading yet nevertheless it made him hold his tongue and when she finally started to read her concentration was indeed broken by the sound of the stool rasping on the stone floor and his annoyed voice asking for space and access to the book hermione mouth quirked at the corners but she soon sobered at the gravity of the situation nathan soul was she couldnteven think of the possibilities so she abandoned her thoughts to rationality and studied the book with severus a sigh none of them could hear was voiced to the room and a boy who was only half there climbed onto the edge of the workbench to watch his stubborn parents work together o0ooo0o nathan paced in front of the workbench in his father lab his parents had gone through half of the book discussing many aspects of it but not the most important aspect yet they still didntknow what was wrong with him even though they had read the spell he d used professor snape had gone to the great hall his mother was bent over the anima codex and nathan was lost for what to do next he was still pacing when a shiny spot of light caught the corner of his eyes nathan stopped abruptly mum his mother turned to him at his call and nathan watched with odd satisfaction as she gasped and widened her eyes at the sight of him nathan she ran to embrace him tightly nathan my little nathan she murmured with her lips on the top of his head you re here you re really here she stepped away moving only as far as an arm length to look him from feet to head turn him around and hug him tight again in one piece thank goodness for one moment i thought you might have been lost split apart and taken from us nathan answered the hug with as much enthusiasm feeling her love and relief flow in gulfs of energy but you haven t right you are whole arentyou she asked taking his head between her hands gently she used her thumb to clear his cheek of the tears of happiness and relief that had escaped his eye nathan could only nod before being hugged tight again never complaining since his unexpected meeting with his father soul the night before he d been anticipating a meeting with his mother eagerly even staying around and hoping that his parents souls would feel his anxiety and would find a way to lead their bodies to rest and freedom why dontyou go back to your body then his mother asked him a lump still constricted his throat and his voice was choked by the energy of his tears dontyou want to she insisted and her weak tone made nathan cling to her more firmly talk to me honey she pleaded mum he started but couldntgo further i here sweetie mum is here her arms still wrapped around him meant more than any words nathan closed his eyes remembering the night before when his father had calmed him down before he was able to speak a hand traveled from his back towards the top of his head where it hovered as if outlining something you re still connected to your body please come back to me baby i want to he said through his tears his mother held him gently by the arms frowning at him at eye level then why wontyou did that book harm you in any way she asked urgently i cantlive without you nathan please it the spell he told her i cantcounter the spell the frown smoothed and determination filled her eyes mum is here to help you honey do you know what spell it was feeling like a five year old and not caring nathan nodded and went about explaining what had happened to him by the end of his narrative he felt like apologizing by every other sentence i couldnttell you because i didntknow how to make you listen to me i sorry mum i tried to explain to the ghosts but they wouldntunderstand i sure you ve tried she soothed him caressing his face as she did and then placed a kiss on his forehead pulling him to her chest again it going to be all right your father and i will help you find your way back her quiet words and understanding calmed him more than anything else could because he believed her nathan knew his mother would do whatever was necessary to make everything all right again and they had what they needed with them you have the book now he agreed nodding and finding some strength to shift in her arms when the door opened to watch his father enter the room nathan stiffened when professor snape approached his mother sleeping form he pulled from her embrace and made to stop him no dontwake her up he won t his mother assured him holding nathan by the hand nathan let his mother pull him to her again when his father took a seat letting her sleeping body be he sighed comforted closing his eyes a light hand caressed his hair and he enjoyed the previously denied contact nathan could swear her hand was warm even thought it was intangible they remained like that involved in an intriguing silence nathan tilted his head back and found his mother watching the other in the room professor snape sat across from her material form and although he held the anima codex open in his hands the only reading he could be doing was of hermione features he trying to find me she explained nathan looked up at her confused you re right there the outside that he can easily see yes she said softly but not the inside and that what he trying to find hermione brushed nathan hair from his eyes and then looked at the professor again he almost understanding almost reason can be quite an obstacle when you re so used to its safety only time can teach the ways of the whole she looked down at nathan again he almost understanding she smiled kissing his forehead again the peace nathan felt curved his lips even though he didntknow why hearing those words was making him feel so he was still smiling happily content to forget everything else for the time being when his mother decided to speak again now it time to work on that counter spell you told me about before i wake up i dontknow how long i ll sleep in such an uncomfortable position his mother seemed pained to remind him that she would have to leave and nathan sighed they tried the counter spell in many ways and languages with different moves and immaterial wands but not even his mother was able to restore him to rights why isntit working she muttered to herself nathan didntknow either how could such a simple spell be so hard to counter frustrated he moved away from his mother and closer to his father maybe he would know something they didnttry yet why couldnthe fall asleep as well there must be something else to this spell that i missing his mother said approaching professor snape from his other side cantyou make him fall asleep nathan asked she extended a hand over his father long raven hair and for a brief moment professor snape closed his eyes and tilted his head back as if leaning into her touch a deep sigh escaped him exposing his tiredness and maybe his longing to be with them nathan added his own contribution to his mother efforts or so it was what he d intended by the hand he placed on his father shoulder his mother smile told him he was helping his father opened eyes told him he wasn t i dontthink he ll let himself go with me sleeping right there his mother explained she stroked professor snape hair and forehead once twice nathan watching the soothing movements until they stopped he looked up and found them both looking at the sleeping form as it stirred nathan felt a pang in his chest searching his mother soul for any sign that she was disappearing from view she strayed from his father and simply pulled nathan into her arms apologizing with the gesture and the waves of sorrow he could feel with her hug we ll find what wrong with the counter spell we wontrest until you re back with us she let him go and nathan followed her with wet eyes watching her sit in the chair with her body bend over whisper i love you and blend in with herself nathan she said waking up startled from what could only be the nightmare of leaving him mum nathan sobbed o0ooo0o the bloody baron entered the laboratory and hovered nearby the times the ghost visited severus were only when the slytherin house was under impending destruction he sighed and acknowledged his presence what can i do for you baron i bring a message from your son professor nathan granger asked quickly abandoning everything she was doing and approaching the ghost the baron dispensed a sideway glance to the woman while severus braced himself for the message if a ghost was bringing it could it mean the bloody baron spoke to severus again he cantwake up on his own because the counter spell failed he couldntwake up the counter spell failed severus heard a strangled sob what is the spell we need to counter he asked trying to keep his mind as rational as possible anima libertas the ghost provided severus had already read about the spell in the book we ve read about it it in that book i know i ve read it granger babbled rushing to the book with trembling hands and turning the pages carelessly where is it where is it severus watched the despair of the woman with thoughts running through his mind the counter spell had failed if i had questions to my son would you be able to deliver them and come back with answers severus inquired he is here the ghost told him something floated in severus stomach and he didntknow if the feeling was good or bad granger left the book again asking urgently nathan is here where when it seemed that the baron wouldntanswer his grave voice said right in front of you madam unbidden severus looked at the spot in front of the woman expecting to see his boy there awake but the air was empty he looked at granger a hand extended ahead obviously expecting the same and saw a tear slide down her face the sensation in his stomach spread to his chest and severus felt constricted making him fight to remain focused and rational ask him why the counter spell failed he addressed the ghost again he doesntknow why it simply failed to work for him and for his sleeping mother what sleeping mother granger managed to ask in a weak voice the ghost only looked at her clearly measuring and then turned to severus again she doesntremember her dreams your son doesntconsider her responsible for her failure because it was agreed that you would keep looking for alternatives granger gasped but severus didnttake his attention from the ghost there was critical information in his words and severus had to be quick in his assessment of them his twisted heart wouldntlet him slow down the process he only realized that his son could be reached in sleep within his dreams flashes of images crossed from subconscious to conscious can he only be reached through dreams severus wanted to know he is locked in sleep severus expected more but that was all that the ghost provided i couldnthelp him the pain in her words called them to severus attention granger stared in defeat at the spot the baron had told them nathan was her demeanor intensified the feelings in his chest making him snap get a grip woman she looked at him then and their eyes met his holding hers in their strength granger heaved in a last stinging breath squared her shoulders and cleaned her eyes and cheeks she wasntthe best of sights but she was granger at least how will we help him she asked understanding all the implications of the spell and counter spell listing what could have gone wrong she nodded retaking her place with the books and parchments but not quite going back to work yet probably still too disturbed by the surprising news the ghost still hovering there had brought do you have any other information for me baron nothing relevant professor and irrelevant severus thought to ask dontfight sleep the ghost offered and it was what it sounded advice severus inclined his head accepting it before joining granger and work to help nathan o0ooo0o thank you nathan said low and slowly while wiping at his eyes and cheeks in an imitation of his mother previous gesture the bloody baron inclined his head politely before floating away it was as though nathan mission had just been completed by the departure of the ghost and he felt drained of energy weak and tired he walked in short steps to where his mother was and inclined his head on her shoulder watching his father take the seat opposite them silence prevailed his mother was staring at the book probably lost in thought his father pinched his nose his eyes closed have you found the spell his mother remained silent at the quiet words of his father moving her head up to look at him anima libertas professor snape instructed her nathan took his head from his mother shoulder when it rose and fell with the deep breath she took before reopening the book while she turned the pages nathan observed his father face the brows slightly furrowed in what nathan understood as a sign of determination the mouth set in a rigid line the sound of flipping parchment stopped and his mother started to read from the book filling the room with her sorrow etched voice which grew faulty as the words became darker in content it a simple spell his father objectivity broke the over emotive tone of his mother why isntthe counter spell effective he asked for long minutes nathan joined his mother in her silent contemplation of his father words he only eleven his mother said he twelve and i dontthink that relevant his father dismissed and the fact that he d corrected her over his age made nathan relax his tense expression he a first year severus of course it relevant how do you expect him to be able to counter this spell on his own like this sodding book says he has to he only a child and we re talking about dark magic severus dark magic she waved the book and then released it as if burned making nathan take a step back and look at his father forgetting who he was pleading with for help to comfort his mother to his surprise the soul surfaced in the warm expression of his eyes for only a moment but time enough to make nathan plead again with his own eyes granger the man called his mother didntseem to have listened hermione he called again now using her given name she focused on him it not relevant the man insisted nathan watched in anticipation his parents staring at one another not knowing what they would do next i sorry his mother apologized taking her seat again nathan sighed relieved he not a fully trained wizard but he performed the spell so he should be able to perform the counter spell professor snape continued what i trying to say is that he a beginner in charms only recently he learned how to levitate objects the fact that he performed the spell correctly once doesntmean he mastered it his mother insisted and her calm took the sting nathan felt with her lack of faith in his potential let find out his father told her taking the discarded book and starting to the door wand in hand nathan went after his father apprehensive and was followed closely by his mother what are you going to do she asked what nathan also wanted to know i ll perform the spell what else on whom she asked mirroring the urgency nathan felt his father stopped by the door to his office turning to stare at them her making the silence fill in for the answer and it did no his mother said putting to words what nathan couldn t you ll not cast the spell on yourself i wontlet you nathan watched his father wanting him to agree but also wanting him to perform the spell and join him it could go awfully wrong it could lock his father outside his body as well it would be bad but nathan wouldntbe alone anymore his father soul would be with him it was bad nathan was a bad selfish boy but he couldnthelp it not that he had any say in what his father would actually do but he would be disappointed if his father yielded to his mother will severus she pleaded probably interpreting his expression as resolve i you can t i do and i will and if it doesntwork his mother left his side and approached his father i will be without nathan and you nathan didntwant his mother to be left alone either selfishly though he thought she could always join them at his side of the world a n this is the first part of a chapter that became too big to be posted in one go it means that i ll post the next chapter during the weekend cheers 0 coming next a conflict between the teacher and the father and nathan wakes up disclaimer not mine it all j k rowling s beta readers ginnyw and annie talbot thank you very much a n chapter twenty eight a conflict between the teacher and the father and nathan wakes up chapter 28 teaching and learning severus didntknow how to react to her obvious concern we ll work through the ghosts i ll be able to give you information nathan can t he said reassuring her awkwardly she wrapped her arms around him before he could predict her action strangely he felt supported by her gesture increasing the discomfiture of the moment for him severus wanted to be wrapped in her arms because they were hers at the same time that he didntwant to because they were hers mercifully sorrowfully she stepped away scowl as much as you want to she told him and only then did he realize he d been frowning it doesntchange the fact that i care get used to it running a hand down his arm she grabbed the book in his hand he didntlet go not even with the goose flesh her touch aroused where are we going to do this a bed seems appropriate your quarters or mine he pulled his hand away trying to turn around and hide the color rising and warming his face against his will his mouth went suddenly dry he cleared his throat intent on saying something to cover for his misled thoughts when he heard an oh severus closed his eyes severus i didntmean to merlin have mercy he thought gods this is embarrassing okay no one quarters the hospital wing has beds nathan is there severus paled at the thought of his son the boy soul was probably still in the room listening to this words would not put this to rights so he stalked away without a glance back she followed of course but silent at least insufferable woman if he could trust someone else to help with nathan he would have hexed her for for touching him caring for him he came to a halt in front of the bed where his son body lay and forgot the woman and his feelings immediately watching the boy ashen face the baron message was vivid the words in the book more meaningful severus gripped his wand with more force if i not conscious in half an hour find a ghost he told granger he was sitting in a nearby bed when her voice made him shiver severus he looked at her for the first time since their awkward embrace tell him how much i love him he saw in the brightness of her eyes the love she felt for their son and was forced to nod lying on the bed determination moved his wand arm and latin flowed from his lips to his mind his eyes had never closed but he felt light as if sleep was taking him forcefully he blinked his shining boy stood framed by the much too solid form of the worried woman looking down at him nathan smiled you re here severus turned his head to look at himself helpless on the bed and then back at nathan it odd isntit his son observed it was disorienting to say the least severus experienced a tumult of sensations he didntknow the origin of he looked down at his hands flexing them trying to feel the matter they were made of he could see his fleshy legs through them i think it like being a ghost or something his son provided and severus looked up back into his now not so cheerful smile it a matter more subtle than that severus pointed out the background moved taking his attention with it granger passed by nathan and approached the bed she came too close for his liking making him notice some energy filled with feeling severus left the bed just before she touched the forehead of his body and frowned down at her we cantfeel a thing severus looked at his son who also watched him being assaulted by the intrusive witch do you think the counter spell will work the question made severus focus on why he was experiencing all that for the hopeful eyes his boy turned on him made his chest vibrate dread hope determination show me what you ve been doing mr granger it nathan the boy corrected already bypassing the bed where his own body remained immobile with the energetic equivalent of a wand in hand his son intoned the counter spell severus frowned again nathan repeated the motions and words to the same result nothing severus couldntsee where there was flaw so perfectly his boy was performing the spell again flawless again nathan sighed in annoyance but performed the spell once more as perfectly as before without being asked nathan did it again cantyou see that it not working and angrily his son repeated the spell and muttered curses as it failed and failed and failed mr granger severus called trying to break him from the trance he seemed to be caught in mr granger and on the third call it nathan the boy yelled trembling on the verge of breaking down it nathan he mewled taking steps back from the bed and into a corner where he slid down hugging his knees sorrow radiated from severus unable to be contained by layers he didnthave with him at the moment his son was so tiny his mind was too quick to remind him of granger words nathan was only a child a first year nathan nathan severus started approaching the ball of light that was his son soul you canthelp me either can you we ll stay like this forever until we die and then we ll be ghosts because we re leaving this unfinished business his son looked up at him with pleading eyes i dontwant to be a ghost he was scared severus tried casting the counter spell on him and only stared when it had no effect on his boy he did nothing else could do nothing else but stare a strange vibration was urging him to do more but he couldntlet himself move any closer we re not giving up he managed hoping the urge would diminish nathan waved in the direction of his body on the bed it doesntwork until i find out why the boy went quiet and severus followed his eyes to where granger tenderly caressed nathan face severus could recognize apprehension in her eyes but he doubted that the boy was looking at her and seeing the same so he was surprised when nathan said she worried yes he agreed so are you the boy added that should be obvious severus stated defensively nathan looked at him and severus felt it deeply as if his son eyes shone directly at his core seeing all the boy stood composing himself as best as he could and asked how do we find out severus knew he d changed the subject back to the spell by the determination in his voice first i need to try it myself if i successful we ll work from there the very moment severus said that he felt something heavy hit him but knew it couldntbe anything material nathan was looking intently at him i ll come back for you severus told him uncertain why he was doing so the pressure alleviated a fraction and then changed to a different kind of pressure when nathan approached promise the boy asked i a man of my word nathan severus assured then promise you wontleave me here alone his son insisted i won t severus promised the boy hesitated before nodding the pang in severus chest changed once more and now he knew it was coming from the inside was this what it felt like for a father to care for his child this mixture of pain and reluctance this desperate need to make all wrong right so that his little boy wouldntsuffer it made him want to touch nathan although he wouldn t somehow he understood that touching soul to soul would make things even more confusing and complicated he glanced at the bed they were by watching the pale face instead of the shining one and the hand that came and went from his limited view was this what granger felt for nathan an urge to comfort and protect greater than everything has he felt something stronger than what he felt for his boy she loves you and so did he she does the boy voice saved him from his thoughts they locked eyes i ll be back for you nathan do you what is going on here madam pomfrey entered the ward demanding control of her jurisdiction severus groaned she ll want to send you to st mungo s too nathan deduced severus glanced at the boy mum wontlet her nathan added vehemently we re working on the counter spell granger told poppy how by cursing everybody else in the castle poppy frowned indignantly waving her wand at severus body when a faded blue brightened his pale face the mediwitch turned on granger with an ugly glare you that it i flooing st mungo right now oh no you re not granger said obstructing poppy way to the fireplace to the room at large she said severus if you can hear me do something try to go back nathan urged him anxious to help the mother severus granger cried when poppy trained her wand at her oh for merlin sake he cursed before trying the counter spell that would hopefully send him back into his body and he blinked with his own flesh and blood dark eyes no one flooing anywhere he rasped o0ooo0o nathan gasped when his father was sucked back into his body it worked the counter spell worked nathan watched his father sit and talk paying little attention to where and what mesmerized and at the same time disappointed that his father had succeeded on his first attempt while he still remained sadly bodiless sadly o0ooo0o thank goodness hermione sighed when she heard severus voice she walked fast to his bedside leaving madam pomfrey to follow if she wanted to how do you feel is everything okay did you bring nathan with you as she asked that she almost knocked the mediwitch down on her haste to get to her son bed he wasntawake hermione turned expecting severus to explain the counter spell works he told her massaging his temple with a hand and waving the mediwitch attention away with the other let me check on you stubborn wizard madam pomfrey insisted using her wand on severus again the fact that he was stating the obvious made hermione want to tend to him herself but how could she let nathan hand go especially not knowing yet why he wasntawake she waited severus looked at her his eyes focused and he probably saw how worried she was i cantperform the counter spell on him as we d already surmised by the information we had he perfectly capable of performing the spell though i watched him try several times he glanced at the mediwitch hermione knew he wasntcomfortable discussing this with others around but she had to know why isntit working then severus eyebrows moved a little closer to one another and hermione heart constricted in her chest he didntknow why the counter spell wasntworking how did you talk to mr granger madam pomfrey intruded into the parents silent conversation what counter spell are you attempting giving more space for severus to concentrate on a solution hermione thought it better to answer the questions herself nathan cursed himself using a spell we have identified a few hours ago named anima libertas his soul is somehow detached from his body and can communicate only through the ghosts severus could talk to him when under the same spell she finished and addressed him again her voice less clinical more affectionate how is he severus fine given the circumstances hermione didntlike that answer in fact she didntlike it at all what would she do to help her baby why wasntthe spell working damn it she needed her boy back she needed him to squeeze her hand in response to open those beetle eyes and look at her to smile at her and hermione she heard her name in severus voice and only then realized she d not been listening to the sounds of the ward before she also realized that she d been biting hard at her lower lip we need to help him severus why do you think the counter spell is not working she asked him comforted by his proximity now that he was standing next to her some knowledge he doesnthave is getting in the way he paused in his explanation so she took her eyes from nathan to severus you were right when you said that his age was relevant he only a beginner in charms he turned from her and the bed where nathan was the comfort was gone where are you going she asked i promised i d be back your magical level is depleted the mediwitch admonished reminding them of her presence you re not performing this unknown charm again he glared at the matron but hermione knew that madam pomfrey was right in her worry hermione had no other option then i going instead no both said at the same time severus frowned and added you need to be here for when he awakes her hand was still holding her son s and her resolve deflated we cantjust sit here doing nothing she protested childishly and we won t severus guaranteed and before madam pomfrey could object he was already unconscious in bed hermione sighed o0ooo0o severus watched his son soul move his mouth but couldnthear what he was saying making himself shake his head to clear it from the fogginess and you re shining differently sir are you all right severus heard what nathan was asking at last the boy eyeing him with big concerned eyes i fine he felt obliged to say although he knew quite well he wasntin the best of shape poppy was only trying to take control of a situation she has no business with as always it not up to her to know what i can or cannot do with my magic severus was already feeling better he thought he squared his shoulders you only slept for a little while last night and it night again already the insinuation that he might be overly tired made severus instantly want to admonish the boy and say that he had no business on whether he slept or not but something made him hold his tongue it was that strange vibration again you dontneed to worry only after saying those words of reassurance did severus recognize nathan feelings i dontwant you to nathan was saying but do you feel any different severus interrupted as much to stop this train of conversation as out of a new born worry perhaps his son was experiencing the same discomforts the boy shook his head no and the silence could be heard and felt severus looked around noticing then that the witches were quietly standing vigil beside their beds what do you think i doing wrong nathan asked severus couldntface the boy least of all admit that he didntknow what nathan was doing wrong after some moments he heard nathan sigh his son was no fool i here to find out severus tried to reassure the boy i need you to tell me how you re performing the spell explain how you re doing it again i doing exactly what that stupid book says he threw his arms in the air visibly frustrated severus sighed then needing patience but how did you interpret what exactly is on the stupid book his choice of nathan own words seemed to embarrass the boy i do the wand motion he said quietly cooperating and moving the imprint of his wand just like the book instructed then i say the incantation nathan said the latin words clearly and then nothing happens he added in a dry tone of voice and a grave expression severus had seen that same demeanor of dissatisfaction on nathan face before now he remembered it had been the last time nathan had visited his quarters when he d been trying to levitate a cup of tea using a non verbal spell failing and stomping angrily from the room severus rubbed his eyes tiredly as he realized that they were dealing with the same problem now a non verbal spell you wouldntknow i can see that it not working sir nathan said moodily and severus became conscious that he d voiced his thought it a non verbal spell he elaborated nathan frowned i shouldntbe saying the incantation aloud he immediately tried the spell again now silently it didntwork of course it not only a matter of speaking or not speaking the incantation severus knew of his son capabilities but was also very aware of his inexperience with magic his skills were far from those of a sixth year that was how a simple looking spell became complicated so nathan hesitated frowning at himself you were not making fun of me when you asked me to levitate a cup without saying the incantation that other day severus was disarmed by that statement that his son thought he had asked something just to humiliate him when his intentions had been the opposite showed clearly how inept he was at fatherhood i was not he admitted awkwardly you show great control of your magical abilities especially for charms and i thought you d be able to perform a non verbal spell if you tried i not nathan countered still frowning at himself head bowed i still think you are severus assured him hiding the insecurity behind his calm demeanor the boy raised his head to look up at him professor snape he started the title sounding odd to severus ears in this circumstance i tried to levitate that cup really hard but i couldn t i cantmake the spell work if i not saying the incantation i ll teach you a pained expression took nathan face a show of his lack of faith in severus teaching methods deciding to ignore the boy disrespect severus started to lecture it a matter of concentration and mind power i dontbelieve that what you ll find difficult about non verbal spells though as much as what to concentrate on and apply your mind power to spells have many layers that turn a few chosen words and wand movements into magical acts with deliberate ends severus paused to let nathan take that in what do you think when you levitate an object nathan frowned an improvement on his expression of disbelief and answered arrogantly on saying the incantation right and moving the wand correctly is that all severus insisted yes nathan answered his expression clearing reluctantly then every time you switch and flick your wand and say wingardium leviosa an object any object flies in the air unbidden is that it not any object but the one you re aiming your wand at nathan corrected that would be true for a levitating spell perhaps because we can often see what we re levitating when we donthave a delimitated subject to aim our wands at or when the target has a life of its own the level of expertise of the caster must be higher to accommodate to those new variables the same happens in transfiguration of living creatures and charmed potions nathan was looking intently at him and severus knew he was working to take all this information in souls severus went on are both living and not solid subjects aiming your wand at yourself flicking it correctly and saying an incantation arenta guarantee of success he paused again giving nathan time to follow his reasoning before asking what was on your mind when you made the cup you were levitating move in the air without looking at it i nathan tilted his head hopefully trying to remember exactly what passed that evening severus understood that his son didntknow the theory behind what he d done but theory could wait until third year what he needed was nathan natural abilities in charms to help him understand what was needed to send his soul back into his body i just asked the cup to move and hoped it would do as i asked clever boy severus thought with pride working non verbal spells asks for a similar level of concentration only in addition to imagining your soul reattaching itself to your body you need to make the words of the incantation be felt and carried as well just by thinking of them nathan frowned severus could feel his unease at the words i dontexpect you to succeed in your first attempt nathan he told his worried son understanding too well that the fear of failure had to be taken from the equation severus was also a perfectionist go ahead he encouraged nathan squared his shoulders concentrating on the difficult task before him he flicked his wand in silence his soul remained where it stood bodiless he sighed try again severus asked and several attempts followed that second one severus knew it would take more than the time of a hogwarts normal class for nathan to accomplish the counter spell close your eyes and concentrate severus instructed when he could feel nathan frustration rise what taking severus so long granger murmured you re playing with dangerous magic poppy answered i shouldnthave let him cast that spell on himself nathan needs help granger countered visibly annoyed st mungo has specialized help for such occasions i thought that you of all people would see reason ms granger what if we lose severus as well just because of your stubbornness we haventlost anyone granger said indignantly severus sighed i cantconcentrate with all this noise nathan growled why are they still unconscious then if we had sent mr granger to st mungo when i advised i sure everything would be just fine the mediwitch insisted on the argument as if there was anyone better than severus to help nathan right now really madam pomfrey i wouldntexpect you to doubt a most talented wizard as severus in a matter like this the quarrel was increasing in volume and heat and so was severus interest they had obviously forgotten that he could still hear them speaking of him severus is not a trained healer no but his experience fighting the dark arts is greater than that of any full trained healer if there is someone who can help my son it severus shut up nathan yelled hiding his ears with his shiny hands severus guiltily turned his attention back to his boy make them stop nathan pleaded with him severus flicked his wand and his words could be heard by all in the room again stop arguing well barely since they were low with weakness nonetheless the witches went silent and now circled his bed granger arriving last no doubt having checked nathan before coming to check on him how he she asked he cantconcentrate on the spell with you bickering like children he admonished granger seemed regretful and pained with his words how are you feeling she surprised him by asking in a whisper he even weaker than before that how the annoyed mediwitch answered in his stead severus attempted to sit up on the bed and prove her wrong but frowned when a little push from poppy kept him in place lying on the white pillow stay where you are stubborn wizard she told him under her breath i ll take some minutes to recover no no no more spells from you tonight mister poppy interrupted him you wouldntbe able to come back a third time oh no your magical level is as low as your physical energy severus donteven argue she right severus granger agreed with a sorrowful voice did you have the time to instruct nathan maybe i should go no severus denied her unsure of why it was so important for him that she stay out of it he knows what to do i ll rest a few minutes drink pepper up and go back to him he might wake up anytime now it just a matter of time he wanted to sit up being watched from above by those apprehensive wide brown eyes made him feel vulnerable stay put severus poppy admonished you re getting nowhere near pepper up potion what you need is a night of restorative sleep he growled but had little energy left to protest beyond that sleep severus granger told him in a tone of voice that caressed and put to rest his resolve to disagree i ll keep vigil he didntthink his sandy eyes would manage to disagree either o0ooo0o nathan had his eyes closed in concentration he was supposed to be concentrating on what he wasntsure he knew anymore but he kept trying anyway he had to get back to his life into his body take a break nathan he heard from behind him nathan didntopen his eyes nor stop his wand from moving so a hand rested on his shoulder that quite enough son he did open his eyes to that lowering his wand he looked up into his father face and knew that the man standing there wasntthe same as earlier professor snape smiled come the man tugged wrapping his shoulders into a half hug let take a walk nathan looked at his silent mother and at the bodies she overlooked she ll be fine professor snape assured him come walk with me they left the hospital wing and went through the deserted corridors of hogwarts in silence nathan had no idea to where the professor was taking him but that was of little importance at the moment feeling safe and cared for was what mattered the arm around him didntslide away until they reached a wooden door his father went through first nathan followed right behind they climbed the steep stairs a step after the other until nathan felt the wind hit him yes he could actually feel the wind blowing on the top of the astronomy tower we both need our energies recharged can you feel the wind nathan nodded still marveled at how good it was to feel the force of the air going through him he hadntrealized he d closed his eyes but he didntopen them when he finally did open your arms let nature harmonize your soul his father was saying and nathan obeyed opening his arms wide and smiling happily at the sensation of belonging after what seemed forever and yet not any time at all nathan slowly opened his eyes finding that strange professor snape looking intently back at him how do you feel much better thanks nathan answered the smile he received the man turned to contemplate the forest nathan went to stand by his side watching the grounds as well a hand patted him on the head warming his entire soul but nathan mind could only be kept away from the counter spell for so long professor snape he addressed looking up when no response came his father was frowning at the moon before looking down at him still frowning nathan forgot what he was going to say distracted by thoughts of what might have displeased the man cantyou call me something else the question threw nathan off balance i thought i i call you nathan donti maybe you could call me severus it was nathan time to frown what do you call your mother well i nathan felt uncomfortable with the question mum he finally answered and how would you call your father i professor snape couldntbe asking that he nathan closed his eyes not knowing if he could if he should in your dreams the warming voice encouraged him feeling like he was falling from the high tower nathan uttered in a strangled whisper dad his father hand brought his head to his chest in a gesture that seemed too much like a reward and nathan whole soul shivered when he felt the lips brush his forehead i have missed you son they whispered and it was like the wind had been bathed in the summer sun and short hours were spent in living dream nathan having the dad he d always wanted enjoying every minute of what he was sure to be a unique opportunity they talked about serious and silly things as if they did that on a daily basis they joked and laughed as if the sound wasntforeign to their ears it was offered and nathan took it and the memory would be engraved into his soul and cherished for eternity every step back to the hospital wing was heavier than the previous as if he were walking from clouds to painful pointy stones a hand came to smooth the lines curving his frowning face it almost over son the counter spell will work and you ll go back to your normal life his dad assured him most likely oblivious to what was etching nathan forehead with lines nathan opened his mouth to try to explain but was cut short engulfed in a tight hug two steps into the infirmary ward where have you been his mother inquired i took him for a walk he needed some fresh air his dad answered for him you left me worried she told the man i couldntleave the ward in such light sleep loosening the embrace his mother held his face between her hands critically analyzing his features you re overworking she told him a new brand of magic takes time to assimilate try to rest between attempts okay then addressing his dad she said thank you there no need for that hermione the man dismissed i have missed spending time with nathan nathan missed spending time with his dad as well even though it had been a sole night for him movement caught nathan eyes you re waking up dad it sounded as a lament his mother unlocked her eyes from his father and glanced at the bed the man stirred again you re making progress hermione nathan knew nothing about the progress the man spoke of his father intense gaze spoke words that werentfor him to comprehend to him his dad said listen to what your mother says and try to remember to steady your thoughts every time you attempt the spell i ll try nathan accepted the last minute advice i ll probably wake up when your father does his mother added know that i really proud of you honey i ll be there for when you wake up she kissed his forehead dontoverexert yourself into magical depletion she warned i won t mum when he finally turned looking for his dad reassurance nathan couldntfind him glancing at the bed he saw professor snape blinking sleepily at the ceiling he gone he sighed receiving no answer he looked over his shoulder and there was no one there either how do you feel severus i perfectly fine letting me sleep was a waste of time nathan closed his eyes wanting to disappear as well o0ooo0o under severus watchful eyes nathan tried the counter spell again severus hadntwaited for poppy approval to join his son outside the material world less than two hours into the new morning and nathan was closer to a successful attempt than severus had predicted he would be the boy must have practiced during the hours he slept he was also wisely taking prolonged breaks between attempts can you feel your mind free he asked nathan eyes closed nodded concentrated think about the reunion of body and soul he instructed another nod turn might into the incantation severus waited observing on three one two three severus stared at the clear space before him he turned looking around the ward did it work he heard the question followed by a fit of coughs and knew it had relief flooded all that he was made of accompanying the rhythm of granger sobs severus closed his eyes ready to perform the counter spell himself disoriented he blinked twice turning his face to the commotion on the bed at his left fighting nausea he stood by the bed waiting for his blurred vision to clear before taking a step towards his son he watched granger release him poppy diagnostic spells hover over the bed and finally the pale face of his son eyes alight and a grin on his lips the boy eyes found his and the grin wavered granger stepped aside to see what had caused such reaction and before severus could step away from the family reunion nathan flung his arms around him exclaiming a strangled dad a n nathan is awake yay now what did he call professor snape was it dad lol well well well what do you all think of this is nathan in trouble or is severus i d love to hear from you all 0 i need to thank ginnyw for questioning me about this moment in the story she truly a wonderful beta i must thank annie talbot and not only for filling in as a beta but for holding my hand through the months that took me to write these last chapters hugs coming next the repercussions of the d word and the adaptation of nathan outside dreamland disclaimer not mine it all j k rowling s beta readers ginnyw and annie talbot thank you very much a n chapter twenty nine the repercussions of the d word and the adaptation of nathan outside dreamland chapter 29 no return dad the tiny word reached severus ears traveled through his brain but found home only when it met his heart which skipped a beat the stiffness of his stance was at odds with his hands on his son head and back a move brought not only by reflex to the boy arms around him severus remembered that it was important to breathe i made it work dad severus had to close his eyes this time for at least a brief moment he heard the gasp from hermione beside him felt the strange constriction in his chest breathe old man peeling the arms from around him severus took his son by the shoulders the shining smile even brighter than those pleased eyes was for him and no one else it made severus almost forget where they were who was there with them and what he should be doing rest now he instructed leading his boy back to the pillow but i just woke up nathan protested you werentsleeping severus insisted an urgency growing within him it became almost unbearable when she hermione leaned over nathan to brush his hair away from his forehead and placed a hand between severus shoulder blades trapping him there i only just woke up mum the protest was more a whine now still unable to flee severus was obliged to feel through the burning weight of her hand the shakiness of the deep breath she took listen to your father honey go to sleep rest now he couldntjust stay there any longer severus backed from the bed forcing her hand to leave him in a burning path of a thunderbolt hoping that the distance would turn thunderstorm into calm winter sky breathe slowly his features were already regaining their frosty stance granger whispered reassurances to nathan poppy came back bearing potions and the back of his legs reached the adjoining bed dad simply remembering how the word had sounded like a gust of wind blowing against dark clouds disturbing his still winter sky he wasntdistant enough he wasntalone enough poppy was glancing at him while hermione whispered something over nathan at her he looked at his son face confirming that he d fallen asleep naturally this time i ll brew a new batch severus told them seemingly out of nowhere realizing that he d been actually listening to their conversation pepper up potion for his son he took his leave immediately walking fast stopping only when he d crossed the low threshold of door to his dungeon quarters severus fell heavily on the couch holding his head in his hands why pretend that there would be physical distance enough to erase what hearing his son calling him dad did to his heart still aching from the blow admitting defeat he took the flat vial from his pocket and caressed its smooth surface with a thumb its soft greenish blue content warmed him melting the rest of his feeble winter yes you made it work son closing his hand around the vial he wished sweet dreams my boy center o0ooo0o center he poured the red liquid into small vials and didnttake his eyes from his task when the door opened echoing footsteps coming closer and then stopping severus filled another vial i leaving tonight he used the ladle to gather as much of the remaining potion as possible there was one last vial to be filled one that should have been on the workbench to the left of the cauldron but wasn t severus looked around the table searching he was finally forced to lift his eyes and look at her and there it was dangling from her hand hermione offered the vial and a smile to him i wanted to thank you severus she told him looking straight into his eyes he took the vial from her hand going through the motions of pouring the pepper up potion in it stop thanking me for everything i do i must thank you whenever you do something wonderful such as saving our son soul you should be used to it by now she told him matter of factly over the sound of the ladle gently hitting the glass bottle and then the empty cauldron he could feel her smile even before he saw it clinging to her face she was leaning against the edge of the workbench looking smugly at him and he didnthave time to stop her from adding a playful dad he snorted and it was a strange noise even for him what did she expect to achieve with that hermione tilted her head studying him it seemed severus took the dirty cauldron to be washed hoping that ignoring her would act as a dismissal they had nothing to discuss i dontknow what happened between the two of you while you were unconscious but i have this feeling that this simple thank you isntenough for all you ve accomplished he frowned at the cauldron filling with water waiting to know what she would say next congratulations severus he sighed gravely turning accusingly on her to donteven start she anticipated we re clearly past that now you have to agree just she smiled fondly approaching him enjoy it severus froze in lack of attitude for only a short moment oh i ll enjoy the detentions he ll serve me he resorted to sarcasm to compose himself hermione rolled her eyes but didntseem put out i sure his ears are still stinging from the lecture i put him through when he finally woke up i still cantbelieve he cursed himself like that what was he thinking he clearly wasn t i believe things have changed though whatever made him do it it sorted out now he seemed content to be back he was all hugs and smiles and you re finally dad ignoring the reminder severus commented he has a problem with my godson maybe hermione would be able to force some sense into nathan thick head you re a godfather hermione asked oh the tone of surprise he mocked i it surprising yes nathan never commented on that well he was not surprised severus savored the tension his silence brought he knew that she wanted to ask he could feel her barely held curiosity her mouth opened and closed a couple of times if you re leaving goodbye he finally said enjoying the way her mouth decided on open she recovered too soon and frowned in indignation who your godson devon malfoy he answered nonchalantly organizing the vials in a box for transportation while enjoying the sound of her gasp malfoy it not an eleven year secret he jibed it wasntas satisfying as if she had actually been paying attention to it and her wide unseeing eyes told him that she clearly wasn t that explains a lot all the fights the detentions the hateful words she finally looked at him again you should have told me her indignation annoyed him let not go back to what should have been told granger you cannot win that argument to his disappointment she only sighed disappointment he felt irritated when he analyzed his own reaction to not getting a rise from her in response to his remarks disappointed in what as if teasing her was something he did for fun i ll talk to him about malfoy she told him and then patently held her tongue but didntleave she sighed again giving up and asking anyway is there something i should know before i talk to nathan about this detention will be tomorrow at seven now leave granger he thought but didntsay she rolled her eyes he gathered the box of potion vials and walked to the exit if she wouldntleave he would she stopped him with a hand on his arm do you think this is a good idea she questioned he looked at her at her anxious eyes there he saw her knowledge that devon would be sharing that detention with nathan severus what are your plans to take these potions to poppy he gave the hand on his arm a pointed look if you ll excuse me when he made to leave again she squeezed his arm he stared her in the eyes mr malfoy is in for at least a week worth of detentions for the stupid prank in the library all involved will be disciplined including wood brown and your little granger he explained what do you expect to achieve by joining them like this after what happened she insisted i expect them to act as civilized young wizards it cantbe asking too much especially with the punishment to remind them to stop being stupid dunderheads he hoped his vehemence would show the woman that the brats punishment was not negotiable she hesitated before releasing his arm he left at once hoping that hermione would be gone from the castle earlier than tonight o0ooo0o he ll have to take a dose of pepper up potion every day for another three days but that only a precautionary measure he recovering quickly thank you madam pomfrey hermione said you ve been really understanding throughout these days and i feel the need to apologize it all right dear the mediwitch assured hermione patting her on the arm why dontyou take him to his common room she gestured with her head to where nathan sat on the bed dangling his legs in a clear show of impatience i sure he ready hermione smiled at the matron thank you she walked to nathan then her thoughts going back to what severus had revealed to her madam pomfrey says you can leave the hospital wing nathan jumped from the bed not so fast hermione stopped him i d like to talk to you for a moment his shoulders sagged probably expecting another lecture she presumed well he was almost right in that i ve spoken to your father earlier about your problems with his godson she told him emphasizing her new knowledge of who devon malfoy really was and waited what about it nathan mumbled in answer obviously uncomfortable with her choice of subject is this why you go out of your way to get both of you in trouble because he your father godson i dontgo out of my way to get myself in trouble was his answer nathan she warned him holding on to childish grudges was never healthy he was mean and disrespectful to me before i even knew that professor snape was my father okay he the one always getting me in trouble he crossed his arms petulantly over his chest watch your tone hermione chided him mildly thinking about how to better approach the subject you realize that with him being your father godson you ll have to find a way to get along dontyou nathan didntgive any indication that he would answer so she asked again dontyou nathan he hated me first and now you hate him back is that what you re telling me nathan finally looked up at her he bit his lower lip obviously thinking of how to get away with saying yes hermione sighed and rested her hips against the bed nathan had just vacated this cantgo on nathan can you imagine what would be like if you and lily and sirius all hated each other how devastated harry and ginny and i would be i cantjust listen to all the crap language malfoy says all the time and leave it at it everybody will think that what he says is true and that i a coward and even if what he says were not complete lies the way he talks to me and everyone else for that matter is definitely wrong your father will be talking to him hermione would make sure of that nathan chuckled and hermione didntlike the sound of disbelief it wontchange anything it hasntuntil now in any case all malfoy has to do is make a pitiful face and whine and all is forgiven hermione frowned i sure it not like that nathan your father wouldntfall for any of that but uncle severus nathan whined in a mockery imitation of the other boy it nauseating mum he added the malfoy boy seemed to be as much the slytherin stereotype as she remembered his parents to be but it was still hard to believe that severus would let himself be played in such a way although hermione could remember how lenient severus had always been where draco was concerned back when she was still a student she thought it had something to do with the war and even so hermione had wanted to be as respected by severus as the slytherin had seemed to be ah she finally understood you re jealous hermione pointed out i not nathan denied with fire in his eyes why would i be jealous of that pompous albino moron it was definitely jealousy hermione was sure now she waited patiently for nathan admission it just he started professor snape always ends up calling him devon instead of mr malfoy and all is solved i on the other hand am always mr granger there is no beating that malfoy will never be punished his voice died within his frustration and disappointment hermione smiled they were so alike at times how can you expect him to call you nathan when you dontdrop the formalities yourself have you ever tried dad instead of professor snape gryffindor would never win the house cup again mum nathan said in all seriousness hermione smile grew into a grin at his son silliness no house points were taken the last two times i ve heard you calling severus dad she pointed out a faraway look crossed her son face while he no doubt remembered the moments he d shared with severus after waking up from the influence of the spell he was so young and full of dreams hermione was reminded of those times they had spent discussing the future a conversation dreaded because of the path it always took the unknown father now that she didnthave to dread nathan dreams now that hermione was free to dream herself leaving the ghosts of the past where they belonged she wanted nathan to dream as high as he wanted to she smiled and hugged him to her side yes it was time to look forward and fight for their dreams let go honey we can talk about it as we walk to the tower o0ooo0o hermione couldnthold back her smile when severus startled as he entered the room and found her there good morning she greeted with more cheerfulness than usual what the hell are you doing here her smile twisted into smirk like one of those he sometimes bestowed on her did you miss me she asked appreciating his irritation maybe a little too much it wasntevery day that she had the opportunity to catch the wizard unsuspecting immensely he sneered and finally entered his office i thought i would be rid of you by now you were once a woman of your word granger he settled behind the desk without sparing a glance her way which was just as well because hermione grin would have infuriated him further she knew she remained in silence waiting he finally growled giving her his full attention what do you want i thought i was clear the last time you asked me that severus he only glared and hermione mirth slowly dissolved into seriousness i was thinking about everything that happened this last week and i need you with me severus by my side these confessions were always awkward or so they felt that way maybe it was worse for hermione because she was admitting her need of him to him as if her tenacity up to now had been a fa ade she wanted to live through life like she had this week with severus was that a crime your side what is this a quidditch bet where i need to take sides of course he would make it an impossible task for her i mean it severus the past few days i hermione sighed being lonely was easier when she was trying before i had only the memories of working with you a distant reminder easily blown out of proportions but now now severus we re raising nathan together she hoped the way she lifted her chin would intimidate him to keep his denial to himself so his firm nod of agreement surprised her i ve taken him as my responsibility and i believe we can agree on most of what concerns nathan she bit her lip but that not all hermione told him needing him to understand what was between the lines yes it very much is granger why severus is the idea of my affection for you that repulsive she knew right there and then that she had ruined it his expression answered her and hermione stood up so she could leave while there was still some dignity remaining dontanswer she begged him not meeting his gaze i dontunderstand you he told her why do you insist upon this insanity hermione no you dontunderstand hermione agreed tired of justifying herself to him ashamed for her heart lying exposed like that she felt suddenly relived that there wasnta family meeting planned for this evening she should go home as she had promised she would last night have a nice week professor snape she nodded formally and then left hurriedly before the discomfort behind her eyes condensed into tears o0ooo0o severus sighed as the door clicked closed why did hermione have to insist on this if severus didntknow better he would actually believe his own accusation of her insanity she wasntinsane of course so what was it a religious conviction a guilty complex masochistic impulses what maybe it was all an effort for nathan what severus had once called the family crap but he didntthink that way anymore and how could he after nathan calling him dad they were family his son and him but that didntinclude hermione severus frowned nathan family included hermione but severus didn t could there be such a thing without hypocrisy he closed his research journal and leaned back on the chair looking at the closed door contemplating the woman who had just left they would interact there wasnta way around it and in all sincerity as long as she remained on topic which meant nathan he couldntclassify it as a problem a friendship then severus believed it was acceptable nathan was worth it they also shared a work interest she could hold an interesting conversation on occasion he snorted who was severus trying to fool she was the only one who had really tried to have any kind of relationship with him apart from the malfoys severus supposed he could live with her presence she was the one sacrificing something after all not him if only he understood why severus re opened the research journal there would be plenty of time to analyze granger he was sure of that he didntthink she would be going away any time soon o0ooo0o hermione apparated into the alleyway near her apartment she was crying like a foolish teenager walking blindly up the well known path to her building climbing the stairs as quickly as she could she had an annoying struggle with her keys and almost used magic to open the door almost she took a deep breath enough to steady her hands and allow her to enter the apartment whatever control she had broke the moment she knew she was safely alone to wallow in self pity hermione was beginning to believe severus when he said she was insane how could someone be rejected again and again like she had been and keep going back for more what kind of a sick woman would do that how sick sick and painful like losing her ground falling non stop when had she placed severus into such an important place in her life that she now depended on him to breathe properly a knock sounded on the door hermione wiped at her tears struggling for control once again another knock on the door more calming breaths this is ridiculous she was making a storm in a teapot hermione it was erica hermione neighbor hermione are you okay hermione stood from the couch and opened the door for her friend she must have been a frightening sight because erica widened her eyes the moment she saw her what happened is nathan okay hermione almost started crying again at the mention of her their son had she made such an effort because severus was nathan father were he not would she have gone so far in her pleading a sob escaped her and erica arms came around her guiding hermione back to the couch nathan is is fine she told her in choked tones oh thank goodness her friend sighed in relief all the while running circles on hermione back it helped your friend william came looking for you and he told me you were called away because there was something wrong with nathan and suddenly you re back after days crying i thought i donteven know what i thought hermione was calmer now she sniffed under her friend ministrations nathan was ill i was with him what happened erica inquired hermione left the couch tea she offered she knew erica well and was certain that she could confide in her but old secrets died hard i ll make the tea you go splash some water on your face put on something comfortable erica shooed her from the room and hermione could hear the noises of metal touching metal in the kitchen as she walked through her bedroom into her bathroom looking at herself in the mirror made her close her eyes only a soaking bath would do anything about that she mused hermione splashed her face anyway the water helped her clear her mind if not her bruised eyes she walked back into her bedroom and changed into something soft and warm even though she shuddered still she took a last deep breath before meeting erica again a teacup was shoved at her as she settled on the couch hermione sipped and grimaced i know you prefer sugar in it but i think the strong brew will do you better right now erica justified are you calmer now hermione nodded and then placed her cup on the low table facing the couch thank you erica sat beside her on the cushion and looked at her expectantly hermione knew her friend wanted to know what had distressed her so but was self conscious about asking hermione sighed letting her eyes close briefly i insane she confessed after some silence erica asked what do you mean i have lost my mind and with it any sense of pride or self respect hermione elaborated oh and i should mention my heart the bugger i blaming the stupid thing for all the trouble leading to my insanity men erica questioned hermione snorted is he a man i wonder could such a heartless creature made of steel and ice be called human she grimaced before giving up and letting her head fall on the cushion behind her severus she said defeat coloring her voice it sounds like a man name to me her friend commented one i have never heard from you before but a man name i quite sure hermione head dropped to the side and she opened her eyes to look at erica before saying he nathan father erica eyes widened momentarily did he has he you were crying has he never he not like that hermione averted her eyes from her friend s i a fool i i sorry i dontknow what to think it quite all right hermione assured he a rightful bastard only not like that hermione when erica stopped at her name hermione sighed and straightened up on the couch reaching for her strong tea after sipping and grimacing again she started i only met him again after nathan started at the boarding school he a teacher there it was complicated as you can imagine especially after he found out about nathan he didntknow hermione looked down at her cup at erica tone of accusation sorry i mean i suspected it was something as complicated as this but oh bloody hell erica cursed failing at her attempt of apology i know it is an utter disaster nathan is hurting severus is hurting and it entirely my fault hermione said that and hurt for the three of them it hurt even more because talking about this to someone else made her feelings for severus seem even more misplaced or mistimed at the very least they re getting along now hermione continued trying to find the good in all this nathan has called severus dad she attempted a smile do you love him erica asked and hermione heart twisted in her chest tears forming in the back of her eyes i insane was her broken answer oh my dear erica took the cup from her hand and pulled her into a hug hermione sobbed into her friend shoulder and let her frustration reign and seep through her tears stupid but liberating tears but they dried eventually leaving hermione empty but peaceful so he a professor erica said after the silence had become comfortable enough to be broken i cantsay i overly surprised he a lot like nathan intelligent stubborn and i thought nathan had got those traits from you hermione couldnthold back the smile as it grew pulling the edges of her mouth the dark hair the eyes the graceful hands she continued nathan is definitely severus son hermione surmised not that i have ever doubted it she was quick to add realizing how that last statement could be misinterpreted erica smiled accepting hermione assurances erica was a good friend she would never judge hermione even if the identity of nathan father had been completely unknown that made hermione wonder what erica would think of severus erica and she were close in age her friend had always been a font of support in matters of the heart helping hermione in her insecurities and fears regarding relationships she had had in the past could she help her access her feelings for severus this mass of confusion and pain and lightness that had taken her heart and wouldntleave hermione realized that erica had been observing her closely no doubt curious about severus hermione decided that things couldntget any worse than they already were since i saw him again i have lost control of my thoughts my dreams it like i ve been waiting all my life for this moment when i would meet severus and wake up for it was harder to explain than hermione thought love at first sight erica offered i thought so but then i not so sure anymore i losing my mind erica he says i insane and i starting to think that he is right he wrong love isntall that rational hermione you re not insane her friend admonished maybe you ve loved him since before maybe you ve never stopped loving him not even after all these years you spent apart i how could hermione explain that there had been no love involved in nathan conception there is no before erica she started severus and i were never a couple nathan we spent one night together and severus never spoke to me again not until recently and you were undoubtedly hurt by his behavior erica assumed no she hadntbeen she was the one who had run from the wizarding world from him i never looked for him either there was nothing between us surely there was something between you erica disagreed i cantimagine you spending a night with a man you didntknow we worked together i was his assistant for a couple of assignments hermione hesitated her face burning before she added he was my teacher before that erica eyes gained a mischievous shine it wasntlike that hermione said rolling her eyes i didnthave a crush on him while at school or anything of the sort wrong teacher she mumbled that last part i admire severus for his brilliance intelligence integrity he very respectful as a man and in his field of expertise he a demanding teacher and i doubt he a favorite of any of his students although nathan always liked his classes best hermione added as an afterthought and then tried to remember why she hadntseen severus brilliance from the start ah yes he had gone out of his way to be a git to harry and friends herself included he couldntstand me as a student and i resented him for that hermione admitted it wasntuntil i was out of school and working with him that i started to really understand why he was such a bastard of a teacher and then you fell in love with him shared his bed and erica stopped mid sentence as if a puzzle had clicked together in her head he married isnthe no hermione energy in her denial took even her by surprise i mean no he single i assume that there wasntmuch time for relationships in his life back then and severus is very reserved he doesntsocialize much she hadntconsidered any past love life severus might have had nor had she considered much on his life away from hogwarts he didntseem to ever leave the castle although he must do on occasion the fact that severus had a godson whom she hadntbeen aware of proved that he had a social life outside those stone walls hermione frowned was he married divorced she laughed suddenly he wasn t or he would have used the wife factor to send her away what funny erica asked clearly confused severus with a wife hermione answered still smiling then sobered he a loner who keeps anyone trying to get into his life at arm length hermione remembered the many arguments they had had regarding nathan in that light i dontthink he deems himself worthy of being cared for and you care for him but he doesntcare for me he has made that very clear more than once are you sure you re such a lovable woman hermione she smiled at the compliment i quite sure erica he said so in as many words hermione looked at the empty teacups on the low table her heart constricting in her chest i ll accept his wishes and move on o0ooo0o nathan was barely out of the hospital wing enjoying the excitement of being back into this side of the world once more able to interact with his friends and he was already expected in his father office for detention at least it wouldntbe just him this time kevin and andy were also summoned i cantunderstand why i should be in detention too complained andy all i did was tell you that you were getting yourselves into trouble now you got into trouble and i have to pay for being right stop acting like a whining hufflepuff and walk faster andy it wontget any better if we re a second late kevin told him it not that bad nathan reassured his troubled friend it ll be only for a few hours nathan felt responsible for his friends detention but there was nothing he could do now he didntknow what mood the sour professor would be in and not having to face the man alone was all nathan could think about at the moment he hadntseen his father since waking up and he could remember all too well how he d clung to the man unable to hold himself back from his suddenly caring dad how would his father greet him now would they be back to mr granger and professor snape nathan had had little time to think about all that had happened during his sojourn outside his body and for him a lot had changed his soul had changed they reached the office door which was open nathan anxiety about meeting his father again was quickly replaced by instant irritation malfoy was there nathan and his friends walked in joining the slytherin in front of professor snape desk a flick of the man hand and the door closed behind them the potions master left his seat and began a circle around the four students you re here tonight because of your uncanny incompetence at understanding and following rules some of you after being painstakingly reminded of them that last part was said really close to malfoy ear professor snape paused there and then started walking again unfortunately your lack of wit cantbe overlooked when it reaches life threatening proportions this time the last words were said directly at nathan right ear after a meaningful pause professor snape stood facing the four there are several dirty cauldrons awaiting you in the classroom since your intelligence and judgment are unreliable i cantallow you the use of your wands brainless manual work seems much more fitting dontyou agree he raised an eyebrow no one felt like answering that question the cauldrons wontget cleaned by themselves professor snape barked and the boys started for the door all at once mr granger the man called and nathan stayed behind standing close to the exit door it wasntuntil the others were gone that his father beckoned nathan come over here the use of his name made nathan shoulders lose some of their stiffness he walked back to his father desk and waited how are you feeling the question was pleasantly surprising i fine nathan answered his father watched him intently and probably attesting to the veracity of his short answer he nodded and reached for a vial of red potion on his desk drink this the man instructed handing him the vial already unstoppered it pepper up potion and you ll be taking it once a day for the next three days steam escaped nathan ears in an after effect of the potion his father nodded his approval again you ll be expected in my office every evening after dinner to take it nathan nodded thank you he almost added a dad after his thanks but didn t the new situation still made him feel a little wrong footed uncertain about how to act around the man despite what his mum had said first he was called a dimwitted moron and then he was treated to fatherly concern who was he dealing with professor snape or his dad who should he address come his father said relieving him of the dilemma and pushing him towards the door with a gentle hand you still have a cauldron to clean they walked together to the potions classroom nathan sighed as soon as he saw that he would be obliged to take the cauldron sitting on the same workbench as malfoy s nathan didntwant to disappoint his mother nor his father but he still despised malfoy for all he had done the blond boy didnttake his attention from his task as he approached and that was all the best for nathan he put himself to work as well trying to be isolated in his thoughts and although he had successfully blocked out malfoy the same couldntbe said about his dad nathan wanted to look at the front of the classroom where he would find his father the gentleness of how he had been treated earlier made him miss his dad his father freed soul he wanted to talk to that severus snape again he wanted things to be the way they had been in the astronomy tower always nathan scrubbed the cauldron and went through the many questions he hadntasked then that burned the tip of his tongue now patience it was what the man soul had asked that was also what his mother had asked of him before leaving but her request pertained to another wizard nathan chanced a glance at malfoy did he know his dad the man behind the harsh exterior nathan hoped not he wanted that part of snape for himself alone nathan took a break to rest his tired arms he was looking at his father when the man in question glanced up a few moments later and met his eyes he seemed tired nathan thought and felt instantly responsible he started to scrub the cauldron again to finish detention quicker so his dad could rest my dad nathan smiled fondly not much later a chair scratched the floor but nathan continued with his task undisturbed he sensed a cessation of movement at his side and realized that malfoy had suddenly stopped working and that fact demanded his attention nathan raised his head in time to see the pleading eyes malfoy turned onto professor snape and he was glad to find no sympathy reflected in his father gaze nathan absently scrubbed and watched the scene developing before him his father glowered at his godson malfoy lowered his eyes and began slowly to scrub again nathan smirked and immediately heard his father sigh soon the man was standing before their workbench blocking most of the light we re here tonight because you cantbe civil to one another professor snape told them nathan taking a long last look at his father tired eyes felt his guilt rise anew and drove his attention elsewhere you do realize that nothing you do will change the situation dontyou nathan saw malfoy nod from the corner of his eye he focused his gaze on his father left ear unable to meet his eyes and nodded too nathan is my son devon and i d like you to treat him as such his father told the slytherin yes uncle severus the boy agreed in a voice little higher than a whisper nathan devon is my godson and i d like you to treat him accordingly his father then told him yes sir he answered dutifully apparently too dutifully if his father intense stare told him anything nathan bit at his lower lip as uncertainness took over him once more leaving him anxious i mean it nathan the man restated i know sir i understand he tried to reassure him feeling his cheeks heating he wanted his father to move back to his desk so the awkwardness would go away nathan went quickly back to work keeping his eyes on the cauldron he hadntrealized how silent the classroom had become until the noise of work came back around him nathan sucked his lip back between his teeth scrubbing harder after what seemed an eternity he finished his work approached his father desk and said the cauldron is clean may i go sir his father attention weighed on him nathan hid his hands in his pockets shifting his foot to trace between two stones on the floor and setting his head down to watch it are you feeling well the question froze nathan movements i a bit tired i suppose very well his father conceded you may go thank you sir nathan didnteven think about waiting for his friends and to be honest he had only remembered them when he entered the dormitory they shared he took an exasperated breath thinking himself stupid for acting like a baby down in the dungeons professor snape his father his dad he could see all three in the man tonight and his head hurt nathan kicked off his shoes shrugged off his robes and was soon ready for bed sleeping this time blissfully unconscious would make him feel all right and dreaming could lead him to his dad nathan smiled and let himself go to dreamland o0ooo0o with time things came back to certain normality nathan had decided that he would follow his father lead and see how that felt he would call him professor snape and sir whenever he was addressed as mr granger and he would call him nothing at all whenever his father used his given name it made sense a few times especially before going to bed nathan would debate substituting nothing at all with dad and deal with the consequences the consequences he could imagine being in his dad arms engulfed by love and acceptance he could imagine being sent away to never be called anything other than mr granger ever again it was too risky his dad had asked him to be patient for a reason he d been patient for the first week had met his father dutifully for three days to take his potion had shared an awkward dinner with both his parents on sunday and had gone through potions class without any incident malfoy was keeping to himself probably too horrified by the idea of cleaning more cauldrons and nathan couldntcare less on the wednesday after that nathan had met his father for tea and stilted conversation that night he had ached for a chance to be with his dad again and had slept in the hopes that his dreams would stir that way and that he would be blessed with the memory of their meeting in the morning nathan had accepted that as the new normalcy of his life even after waking up feeling empty on many mornings he had tried to fill the void by playing with his friends and corresponding with the people he loved his godfather had been great at avoiding the subject of snape so had been uncle ron that hadnthelped much nathan had realized he wanted someone he could talk to about his father he had gone to professor lupin office professor lupin are you there the door hadntbeen locked nathan had peered inside to what had seemed an empty room he had decided to enter but at the same moment a door opened on the opposite side of the room and professor lupin had come in only he had been accompanied by nathan father nathan professor lupin had said visibly surprised by his presence there hello professor lupin he had greeted and then he had nodded at his father hi his father had nodded back and both professors had waited for nathan to reveal why he had been there er i was doing homework and i had this question about it his father had watched him intently and nathan had known he was fidgeting why did his father have to be in professor lupin office the very moment he had decided to look for his head of house it had irritated nathan then and it still did now i can ask tomorrow in class sir good evening he had fled before any of the wizards could object nathan was not a coward no he was pretty much certain of that fact what he d done had simply proven that he could still be patient and wait he had left and headed back to gryffindor tower and the day after that he had made up a question for professor lupin about their assigned homework on friday he had hugged his mother for longer than usual she d kissed his forehead and his eyes had fluttered shut what is it she had asked worried it nothing he d told her i missed you is everything okay between you and your dad the tiny word had hurt him but nathan had managed a smile it is she d seemed satisfied with his answer and had let go of any other probing into his emotions she might have had in mind family dinner that weekend had felt even more disconnected from reality than the preceding one it had been when he d felt his mum slipping away from her usual behavior too and had thought not for the first time that maybe he had awakened to a life in another dimension he was nathan granger but the world around him belonged to some other version of him like in the movies that would explain why dinner in professor snape quarters had been such an ordinary event that weekend there or in the great hall the experience would have been the same in nathan understanding nathan had observed his mum attentively then was she hiding something her silence usually meant that or perhaps he hadntbeen behaving like the nathan from this dimension and they would confront him any moment she had been polite as always but too quiet and the whole evening had gone by with both his parents alternatively questioning him about the most mundane things had they been trying to find out if he was who he said he was this was no supernatural movie what was going on i wontbe able to visit next week his mother had announced after the dishes had vanished why not nathan had asked his apprehension rising there is a conference in madrid next weekend she had told him and smiled william and i have a couple of presentations to make oh nathan hadntwanted her to go away but had thought of nothing better to say or protest at the time his father on the other hand all your other dates stood you up she had ignored the odd question keeping her eyes on nathan what can i bring you from spain hmmm a sword a king sword he had smiled taking comfort in the familiarity of the tradition every time his mum had to travel to some conference and leave him behind she would ask him what would be his compensation for being a good boy while she was away he had a collection of keychains from all over europe because of that a king sword she had feigned awe that will be a difficult task i assume you know that a king sword cantbe bought i might need to defy the king himself for a duel nathan had smiled at his mother antics he had been about to retort when his father had beaten him at it not advisable if your choice of knight is a muggle william can help you choose the sword mum he ll know which one to buy nathan had told his mother and earned a dazzling smile in return his father had gone mute after that and remained distant since during that week tea meeting he had been formal and colder than before if possible it had made nathan wonder but think as he might he couldntunderstand what he could have done to deserve that there was something going on and he couldntbegin to figure out what that last family dinner had been as far as his mind had gone and that hadntbeen of much help nathan hadntdone or said anything to upset his father at least he thought he hadn t he could never know with professor snape maybe he had been upset because his mother wouldntcome the following weekend it was a possibility because on sunday next nathan had approached his father at the high table at lunch should i meet you in your office or go straight to your rooms tonight he had asked he hadntknown what to do without his mother to accompany him to the meeting what for his father had retorted frowning nathan had frowned back for dinner nathan had reminded him irritated your mother is not here but i still here he had pointed out and you re here too now thinking of it that had been a rather rude way to put things but really the words had been out before nathan could think better of it nevertheless instead of an angry retort nathan had earned only a softened look from the man my quarters if you know the way i do nathan had said before going back to the gryffindor table he had thought of not going to the meeting after that but he d gone in the end silence awkward heavy defined that evening in retrospect since he d cursed himself things had gone the opposite way from where nathan had hoped they would go wishful thinking but he had wanted to smile at his dad joke around act like someone with nothing troubling him this year was starting to suck as much as the one before to prove that he was not wrong in his conclusions nathan had gone to his father office earlier today for their usual tea and had regretted it the moment he d seen the man bent over his desk almost hidden by parchments and books if you re too busy we can skip today meeting nathan had offered it had pained him then and it still did now that his father had visibly considered it he didntwant to be an obligation on the man schedule i ll take a break had been his overdue answer they had walked to his father quarters and tea had been served as usual nathan had tried to get a real conversation going but all he had gotten from his father had been grunts and one word replies his father hadntbeen there at all and his dad least of all he was nowhere to be seen completely outside of nathan reach he should have gone back to the common room but nathan had chosen a different path he had intended to go to the astronomy tower but hadntmanaged to get himself there either his steps had been slowing down until his feet had stopped altogether because his dad wouldntbe in the astronomy tower his dad was a prisoner in his father body and was currently in the dungeons nathan looked around and realized he was standing across the corridor from the big window with the most beautiful view of the grounds forest and the village of hogsmeade it was his favorite place in the castle where he always came to think undisturbed he sat on the sill and watched the wind blow the trees shaking snowy leaves in the cold evening patience patience he was sick of being patient what could have been so bloody difficult nathan knew his father could be wonderful if he wanted to it was who he was inside not for the first time since waking up nathan thought about performing the spell to free his soul again just for one night and rush to find his dad to tell him to hurry up to find a way to take control because nathan could not wait any longer he had no patience left waiting was a waste of time and they had lost too much time already being patient was getting them nowhere nowhere he touched his forehead on the glass that held most of the cold outside and watched his breath fog the view of the grounds below nathan was tired he left one leg loose dangling against the stone wall nathan was tired of expectations he was tired of having them shattered proved unfounded nathan was simply and plainly exhausted o0ooo0o severus sighed heavily i starting to think that you enjoy cleaning cauldrons the boy leg stopped its pendulous movement in reaction to his words but slowly started dangling again severus approached saying i sure you know that you shouldntbe here his body shadowed the light coming from a torch aflame on the opposite wall the leg stopped once more so all that is left to know is why you are here nonetheless doesntany other teacher patrol the corridors nathan finally looked up at him to add why does it have to always be you severus brows drew closer annoyed by his son defiance what are you doing here mr granger watching the lights of hogsmeade the boy answered turning back to look out the window again sir why he demanded because nathan answered dangling his leg again when the boy went silent severus patience ran out and he growled because what just because impertinent boy severus thought donttry my patience mr granger his son pulled his head from the window and sat facing him with what seemed to be a great effort each dragged movement nathan made was clearly an affront and severus was not pleased looking him into the face with eyes that betrayed the calm of his movements nathan said you re too patient sir standing he added i have none left he tried to flee but severus caught him by the robes not so fast severus grabbed nathan by the arm then and made him turn to look at him again when i ask you something i expect an answer dontthink you re above the rules of this school or that you are at liberty to act as you please he paused searching his son face for his reaction i wonttolerate your cheek boy i am your father and you owe me respect nathan shook himself out of his grasp now you remember severus watched nathan nostrils flare when you want me to obey you and be all respectful and friends with your godson then you re my father severus wanted to tell him to watch his tone when speaking to him but pursed his lips instead you re not being reasonable we have just spent hours together have we not you re you werenteven there the boy yelled we haventhad a conversation since the pain in nathan eyes took the air from around severus and suddenly that window to his son soul closed behind heavy lids the boy lowered his head probably trying to rein in his emotions and all severus could think of was why why was his son in pain what had he done to hurt his boy now nathan bright eyes started at him big and open please dad please nathan begged in a rushed whisper eyes never leaving severus completely melting his defenses what is it severus asked urgently as he approached his distraught boy arms surged around him halting his advance with the impact of it holding him there tightly i have been patient i have i was waiting like i said i would but i dontthink dad i just cantwait anymore please dontgo severus brought his hands to nathan hair and that seemed to relax the deathly hold the boy had on his person severus hadntunderstood what nathan was trying to say through all his babbling but realized that the boy needed time before he would be coherent and ready to be questioned again he waited outwardly immobile but racing on the inside he waited to move would mean to go and nathan had begged him not to that he had understood perfectly well but what of all the rest about waiting and patience he wouldntmove and leave his son arms but how would that help nathan severus wasntwarm enough he had never been he held the boy in the silence and hoped that he was doing the right thing he could only hope nathan turned his head from left to right on his chest but didntmake any move to release him severus took the movement as a sign to let his questions loose what going on nathan i miss you dad his son answered severus couldntunderstand what he meant by that how could you miss me he tried because i hoped i wouldntlose you i thought you would be there when i woke up but then it was like you had never been there in the astronomy tower at all severus stiffened in a helpless reaction to the mention of that place he didntwant nathan to know about the life changing events that had happened there his son could not know there was no warmth in him severus wanted the boy to take his hands off him he didntneed his child to be part of the coldness he pushed nathan by the shoulders but only got him far enough to meet his eyes can we talk the boy asked no severus thought immediately the answer must have been evident on his features you really dontremember do you how can i forget you were sleeping it was only our souls dontyou remember taking me from the hospital wing we went to the astronomy tower then severus furrowed his brows unable to connect these events that his son was narrating with the night albus you were the best the boy smiled we stood in the wind you told me stories about when you were a first year you told me about flying and the time you went through the branches of a tree because you lost control of your broom during flight class and how you had to spend the night in the hospital wing because of a broken leg severus eyes went wide while his son sniggered uncharacteristically who told you that he demanded alarmed by nathan knowledge of such episode of his childhood nathan sobered but kept a tight smile you did but you dontremember do you his smile died slowly you were sleeping for you it was all just a dream only it wasn t your soul was there with mine we were there and i can remember everything because i wasntsleeping it was the spell i remember everything it wasnta dream severus was starting to grasp some sense of what nathan spoke about but there were still many things off in all this my soul was with yours but we never left the hospital wing no not when you were there through the spell but we did when you were sleeping nathan told him it was you who explained it to me when the body sleeps the soul is free mum was there too but she didntgo with us to the astronomy tower cheap theories what nathan was telling him were only theories created and followed by the likes of sybill trelawney severus opened his mouth to point that out but stopped short of saying anything when his logic was challenged how would nathan know about his broom accident in first year i not lying to you nathan assured you were there with me in your sleep i severus started how could he believe this how could he doubt it it after curfew he needed time we should leave this discussion to a more appropriate time you should be in your bed i was hoping that you would remember disappointment it hung in the air between them growing cold as he lost his son embrace nathan eyes were just as cold as the castle air around him nathan turned his back on him and asked when do i meet you for detention sir a feeling of utter loss settled in severus heart he sighed loudly in the silent corridor i dontwant to give you more detentions nathan he stared at the back of his son head trying to decipher its content he wanted to understand what had gone so wrong why nathan felt so lost but now was not the time ten points from gryffindor he mumbled i ll walk you to your common room placing a hand between nathan shoulder blades severus coaxed him to obey heavily walking them both through the empty corridors what nathan had described was indeed the stuff of dreams as much as severus wanted to believe that all the moments he had shared with his son in his wishful mind had actually happened that severus had been able to make his son laugh it was surreal he looked at the boy walking beside him severus had dreamed that he could laugh with his son and as much as he wanted to make his dreams come true the man he pretended to be in his dreams would never be real he didntknow how to be that man severus was broken something he had accepted a long time ago nothing could fix him there was no redemption for him and he had lived his life in penance he watched nathan enter gryffindor tower shoulders heavy and head bowed and it felt like a kick in the guts severus was breaking his son as he had known he would and nathan had done nothing to deserve such punishment that was what happened to those who tried to be part of his life though as he walked the corridors alone severus realized that he walked empty because his heart had stayed back at the mercy of the small hands of his son later tossing on his bed unable to find peace when every time his eyes closed another pair of disappointed ones invaded his mind severus knew he couldntrest while the anguish remained he had known from the beginning that this time would come and he had fought with all his might against this overwhelming power severus reached a point of no return where his life depended on his son ability to be happy no more fighting there

3 the welcoming feast september arrived faster than hermione could have predicted before she knew it it was time to take nathan to king cross station so he could board the hogwarts express from platform nine and three quarters come on mum i dontwant to be late for the train whined nathan from the door i coming and we wontbe late are you this desperate to be rid of me she asked with a pained voice oh mum stop that i ll write to you every weekend we already agreed on that he said for what seemed the thousandth time i know i know she said taking her coat and helping him with the trunk soon they were at the platform and hermione was hugging nathan for the twentieth time mum i cantbreathe he said through her coat where his head was buried on her shoulder and you re embarrassing me as well he added oh sorry was all she could manage through her sobs it better you board the train now then she said wiping some tears away with the back of her hand take care of yourself remember everything i told you and you ll be fine if you need anything you send me an owl and i ll be there in a minute i ll take care mum and i ll send you an owl first thing in the morning he assured her then took the handle of his trunk and entered the train soon he found a free compartment and went to the window to farewell his mother as the train started to move i love you she mouthed to him and he sent her a kiss in return when he looked back from the window the compartment door opened and two boys appeared at the doorway is there free space for two one of them asked sure i alone in here nathan replied after the boys had stowed their things and were comfortably seated he asked are you first years too yes i kevin brown said the boy with light brown hair and blue eyes and i anderson wood but call me andy said the other boy the one with black straight hair and honey brown eyes i nathan granger nice to meet you granger are you related to hermione granger the witch who helped harry potter vanquish you know who brown asked yes she my mother he said surprised that they knew of her that was something new to him he had lived his whole life in the muggle world and even with all her mother had told him about her and his two uncles fame he only realized its magnitude after the boy reaction to his answer wow exclaimed andy she your mother how cool is that nathan had his mouth open in the verge of saying what he thought of it when he was bombarded with yet another question do you know harry potter then the first boy asked yes i know harry he my godfather actually wow exclaimed both of them making nathan flinch a little you re saying the harry potter is your godfather asked an astounded andy yes harry and ginny are my godparents added nathan waiting with an arched brow for another exclamation from his new friends but this time they just stared at him with their mouths agape he was just starting to feel uncomfortable when kevin finally shook his head and found his voice again what is he like i mean does he tell you stories about you know who and andy added does he let you ride his broom harry wasntfamous only for his defeat of voldemort after killing the dreaded wizard he took what he liked to call a vacation from all the worrisome things and became a professional quidditch player for a while before starting his auror training we dontsee each other much as i live in the muggle world with my mother but he visits us on special occasions he answered he doesntlike to talk about voldemort he paused as the boys flinched with the name and continued and i donthave a courtyard so he didntbring his broom with him he finished oh kevin said seeming disappointed and then looked seriously at nathan why do you speak his name whose voldemort s he said and the boys flinched again he just rolled his eyes yes ventured andy well he is dead and my mum always called him by his name even when he was alive uncle harry says that to fear a name is to fear the wizard himself as i dontfear voldemort i dontcare about calling him by his name he explained ignoring yet another flinch at the mention of the dark lord name you re very courageous if you dontfear him my dad told me that he was a very powerful wizard who killed a lot of people and that he returned from the dead once dontyou fear he could be back again asked kevin oh no uncle harry told me they destroyed all his soul pieces before killing him this time there nothing left he said matter of factly if you say so was all the response he got from kevin the rest of the trip passed quickly as the boys discussed quidditch and got to know each other better nathan really liked both of them at least one of his concerns about leaving his muggle school was proving unfounded he would have good friends at hogwarts if he could choose he would like kevin and andy to be in the same house as himself gryffindor he added mentally as hogsmeade approached they changed into their school robes and waited for the train to stop at the station as soon as it stopped they took their trunks and headed out reaching the platform nathan heard a strong voice calling firs years firs years over here it was hagrid no doubt his mother had told him all about the half giant he approached the immense figure and asked you re hagrid arentyou the half giant looked down at the dark haired boy and answered yeah and yeh must be a firs year do i know yeh little one no but i heard a lot about you from my mother the boy said who yeh mother hagrid asked curious hermione granger nathan supplied and a big smile filled the half giant hairy face welcome to hogwarts hagrid paused with an inquiring note in his voice nathan sir nathan granger the boy supplied nathan hagrid finished say hello to yeh mother for me nathan smiled at the half giant and said i will in a moment all the first years were near hagrid and they headed to the boats to cross the lake and reach the castle arriving at the huge oak front doors all the first years grouped at the steps and the door flew open revealing a little wizard the firs years professor flitwick oh thank you hagrid squeaked the little wizard the first years followed professor flitwick though the big door and were led into a small room and arranged into alphabetical order after a few minutes the short wizard said the sorting ceremony will start now come with me please the followed the tiny professor into the great hall glancing around the huge room in awe on a stool in front of the head table rested a dirty hat that soon started to sing its annual song as soon as it finished professor flitwick started to call the students forward artcher duncan and the boy went to the stool and put on the hat a moment later hufflepuff shouted the hat the boy took the hat off his head put it back on the stool and then headed to the hufflepuff table where he was received with applause one by one the first years put the hat on and waited for it to shout a house name kevin brown was sorted into gryffindor and a short while later it was nathan turn to try the hat professor flitwick called granger nathan nathan walked to the stool and lifted the hat onto his head oblivious of the dark haired wizard who had been staring at him from the head table since the very moment his name was announced as soon as the hat settled he could hear its voice inside his head hmm you are a difficult one brilliant mind i see a great heart and lots of courage i can feel you re very talented as well oh and ambitious very difficult all the time the hat was speaking in his head he was thinking about his mother harry and ron and unconsciously asking to be placed in gryffindor the hat seemed to listen to his subconscious pleas gryffindor eh are you sure you could be great in slytherin with your ambitions if you re sure gryffindor nathan left the hat on the stool and took off to the gryffindor table cheers greeted him as he sat down he was relieved not to have been sorted into slytherin all the other three houses would be fine but he was sorted to the best one gryffindor just like his mother and her friends from gryffindor table he watched devon malfoy being sorted into slytherin and a nervous andy wood join them after being the last gryffindor sorted that night the headmistress saluted the students and announced the beginning of the feast just then nathan felt a pair of eyes staring at his back and turned to meet them professor snape and nathan locked eyes for a moment and the boy smiled the professor response was an arched eyebrow followed by a grimace and nathan went back to his food never losing the smile what are you smiling about asked andy nothing special he dismissed i was just thinking about something my mum told me that all the food is delicious at the head table the sour potions master was picking at his food and trying to understand why the granger boy had smiled at him first years dontsmile at me when i stare at them they run crying what wrong with this boy doesnthe know who i am he thought grimacing the boy reaction to his intimidation was disgusting and intriguing ever since the charms professor had announced him as a granger severus could think of nothing else even the malfoy boy hadntdistracted him granger he thought is he related to her a nephew perhaps that was all he allowed his mind to guess he lifted his head to watch the boy once more he doesnthave that bushy hair but it isntstraight either and not brown in color but coal black the boy isntshort either he makes a good figure actually he considered curious that he couldntfind strong resemblance of hermione granger in the boy physical appearance but at the same time he reminded him of her somehow in the middle of his musings the boy turned his way again this time severus glared at him with his trademark sneer without hesitation and was answered with an arched eyebrow from the boy severus narrowed his eyes in visible fury who does this boy think he is he thought a low growl formed in his throat and mcgonagall turned his way with an inquiring face as he ignored her she followed his gaze to the first years at the gryffindor table and frowned what your problem severus already chosen a new gryffindor to torment she inquired you should at least wait until the first day of classes and give the other houses a chance she added what do you know about the granger boy he asked is he related to that insufferable know it all that you used to protect minerva oh so that what you re brooding about she said and severus narrowed his eyes once more i believe he her son as i was told by potter son he managed without showing his surprise and then added with a smirk so i haventlost my touch in choosing my favorite students after all oh severus give the boy a chance the headmistress admonished you donteven know him just because you disliked his mother doesntmean you have to dislike him as well dontmake the same mistakes you did with potter severus she added with a warning look severus went back to his food but found he wasnthungry anymore he glanced one more time in the boy direction and couldntavoid the memories that invaded his mind hermione granger son hermione the girl who tormented me the six years i was her teacher and yet he couldntavoid the true feelings remembrance of her always brought and narrowed his eyes she was a reminder of things he wanted to forget things he was forced to do during the war against voldemort oh he hated having those feelings as soon as the feast ended and all the students were in their common rooms his obligations as head of house were fulfilled and he could return to the peace of his private rooms to prepare for the following day oh how he hated the first day of classes nathan returned his attention to his friends after that demonstration from the potions professor why is he so furious he the one staring at me he thought but he soon remembered what his mother had told him about the man and dismissed his display of hatred with a shrug focusing on his new friends once more dessert was served and the feast was drawing to an end but not before the headmistress gave some warnings concerning the forbidden forest and some recommendations from the caretaker mr filch soon the first years were gathered together by one of the prefects and were led to gryffindor tower nathan was fascinated by all the things in the castle he had heard or read about most of them but it was so much more that what he imagined it was magical they stopped in front of a portrait of the fat lady who asked for a password chocolate frog the prefect said and the lady moved revealing a passage to the common room they entered and were led to their dormitories where they found their trunks by the side of the four poster beds nathan changed into his pajamas and climbed into his bed he had to write the promised letter to his mother so he could send it first thing in the morning then he fell asleep wondering what his first classes would be like it was three in the morning when severus snape finally retired to bed he couldntavoid the ghosts haunting his mind memories of days he thoroughly fought hard to forget days full of hatred and distress memories brought back to the front of his mind by professor flitwick call of a name granger hermione granger was part of a time in his life full of bad memories the worst of them actually memories of events he dreaded events that took place that blasted year albus dumbledore had died by his wand it didntmatter to him that the late headmaster had asked him to do it it didntchange what he felt when he muttered the curse that took the old man life the life of the only man who had ever really trusted him leaving him alone to face his fate and then then hermione granger of all people had trusted him after all he did even after the events that took place in the astronomy tower after he had killed dumbledore i ll never understand why she kept her trust in me he mused he had spent many hours during many nights before trying to solve the mystery that was hermione granger the girl stood against everyone and everything to prove his loyalty to albus and the true intentions behind his act no he would never understand hermione granger and i betrayed her he closed his eyes in a pained gesture what i had to do to save her from the dark lord grip he couldntforget he couldntforgive himself severus snape shifted in his bed and eventually fell asleep not the restorative kind of sleep that would prepare him for his first day of classes but a restless sleep full of nightmares from days long gone a n reviewers i love you 0 so many questions and guesses of all kind i couldntanswer to it all here the staff would kick me out 0 that why i ll

makes a decision that will change his and others life irrevocably this is the first part of a chapter that got too long to be posted as one again and is then the foundation for what comes next so if you get frustrated easily you might want to wait the next chapter post to read them as one as i intended them to be read at first also this chapter has been edited to comprise with this site guidelines on adult content if you want to read it in its entirety go to owl dot tauri dot org and look for ferporcel me or this story not only a granger chapter 30 insanity looks exchanged with his son were embedded with that evening conversation at the shadowy corridor they hadntspoken since and the magnification of that moment only grew as their silent regard of each other continued days and nights spent in contemplation days and nights spent in torture there nothing i can do severus reminded himself when his boy eyes turned from his leaving him with no answers and carrying with them only more disappointment severus wanted that expression off of nathan face but how could he accost his son and demand that he explain his wishes if all he would do was crush every single one of them there nothing i can do he reinforced mentally because he couldntdo that to his son and he wouldn t nathan would grow to understand that it wasnthis fault but severus he couldntconstrue how nathan had entered his dreams to pry and it didntmatter as long as his son knew they could never be real that there was nothing severus could do about it severus had started taking a dream suppressor that same night trying to guard those traitorous moments from nathan he meant no harm by it he simply couldntbe that man not even if he wanted to he just didntknow how there was an abyss between him and that man there fucking nothing i can do granger would arrive after her time with her muggle knight and would be no doubt too distracted daydreaming to realize that he d fucked things up with nathan again good he made a conscious effort to think i not in any bloody mood to be lectured especially since there is nothing i can fucking do o0ooo0o his mother had just arrived home she was to be in london for the night and would come to hogwarts only the next morning or so she had told him in her letter nathan had missed her this week more than he had any other which was plain stupid because whether she was at home in london or in a conference in spain or someplace else it was the same nathan felt like a baby for missing his mum especially when he looked around him and found his friends who hadntseen their parents in much longer than two weeks also his father was right there at the high table nathan looked at him and the longing was quickly pushed back what had happened wednesday night had been a stupid mistake was it asking too much that his father stay in the dungeons just once why did the man have to haunt the corridors every single night just to catch me being a silly baby that why nathan thought and felt immediately drained averting his eyes from the man he wasntgoing to let that happen again he wasnta silly baby i not a silly baby nathan asserted to himself he could pretty much erase that episode from his mind and act like it had never happened professor snape seemed to have done just that although the man seemed to almost no nathan wouldntdwell on those silly hopes even if he d caught the man watching him more than once silly hopes were for silly little babies i not a silly baby nathan was twelve not five it was time to forget about those dreams of a caring participative father the boys were talking about the quidditch finals he should be focusing on that and nathan really tried o0ooo0o hermione arrived later than she had planned her mistake had been stopping by her office on friday after almost a week of absence her external mail alone had made her skip dinner the news the internal mail brought had made her waste her saturday morning it was the old story take a leave and the graduate students were bound to damage something expensive and essential well now it was saturday afternoon and all she could do was done she strode up from the gates of hogwarts wanting nothing more than her son warmth to counter the chilly scottish weather she found him in one of the winter gardens running with other children in some form of lively game hermione chest swelled with joy and some of the stiffness gripping her shoulders eased she had been more worried than she d been consciously aware of it not as if severus was out to break nathan heart too of course she was trying to forget that severus was rather adept at breaking hearts of course she was trying to separate her feelings compartmentalize severus into father and man staying away had added to her internal fight she was doing fine she was nathan spotted her and waved hermione beamed at her sunshine and waved back he seemed contented watching him with the other kids was a balm to her worries surely nothing catastrophic had happened while she was away she didntknow how long she remained standing there watching probably for too long since now nathan was running to her leaving the game behind hi he greeted somewhat out of breath is the game over she asked hugging him briefly nah nathan answered short of breath calming he added it just tag are you going to the lab i was actually heading for the library but first i need to i going with you he interrupted and ran back to the children still playing in the garden most probably to tell them he was officially off the game he was panting again when he reached her and animatedly said let go he held her by the hand guiding her through the halls nathan had obviously missed her the knowledge warmed her heart what all the rush she asked did you bring the sword he asked back ah the sword you almost made me believe you had missed me nathan looked up at her with mirth in his eyes while they waited for the stairs no it only the sword he told her in obvious jest but then the light in his eyes was muted by something that crossed his mind i missed you too she told him then hoping that whatever had troubled her son would be appeased by her love for him she also hoped severus wasntbehind the trouble the climb from there on was made in silence hermione wanted nathan to know that she was aware of his need for support and took the steps with him enclosed in a half hug by the time they d crossed the threshold into her quarters nathan was smiling softly and she knew she d succeeded and whatever was weighing him down had been left aside for the moment if he wasntready to talk yet she would wait hermione took a package from her pocket and enlarged it when nathan reached out for it though she held it away have you done your homework been to all classes done all your readings she arched an eyebrow of course i have will professor lupin have any surprising detention to relate to me over dinner nathan hesitated then nathan she admonished outraged no no detentions he quickly amended and you werentsure her hands went to her hips no wonder she d found white hair in her fringe the other day this boy would age her before her years i am no detentions i swear maybe i should consider a visit with your head of house before delivering this gift we had an agreement you d behave yourself while i was away then i would bring you a gift from spain that was the deal but i behaved nathan assured her mum he whined if i find out that you re hiding something from me i ll take this back and you ll never see it again she delivered the package then you wonthave to take it back he said before destroying the wrapping wow hermione smiled watching her awed son i take it we ve chosen well you know you have he smiled it excalibur a replica of course and smaller than it should be charmed so it wonthurt anyone but yes it king arthur sword it perfect nathan exclaimed thank you thank you he hugged her briefly you re welcome just make sure i wonthave reason to take it from you she gave a look of warning that was completely lost in her son delight with her gift she left him to it hermione needed to dress in robes so they could head for the library and she could start prying information out of nathan please severus remain his dad still she urged silently o0ooo0o in the many hours she d spent with nathan hermione could count with the fingers of a single hand the number of times she d heard him refer to his father let alone hear him call severus dad it was discouraging in the very least she knew nathan had decided what he wanted from severus now so as much as she hadntexpected to find them rejoicing in familial love hermione hadntexpected to find nathan ignoring severus altogether the way he was either denial was all good and safe but as nathan mother she d have to step in and see to it they were all beating around the bush it seemed well maybe not all of them but she couldnttell if severus was ignoring her because she had been definitely avoiding him she d managed to stay out of his way in what she d convinced herself wasntstaying out of his way she d simply been busy in places other than his lab which was perfectly true if not actually random but now that there was no place to hide there in the great hall she d die to have a hiding place hermione wanted to kick herself for even trying to avoid him in the first place as if she could forget severus snape when under the same roof as the man oh she could go permanently blind and she would still be able to sense his presence just two seats away be an adult once in your abysmal love life hermione she admonished herself you let him break your heart now deal with it and deal she would even if she had a choice in the matter as soon as he took his leave hermione took a deep breath and followed him she had never put her needs ahead of nathan s and she wouldntstart now severus she called her voice carrying in the dungeons corridors where she got close enough to make herself be heard without shouting severus wait he didntstop but to his credit he did slow his pace down so she would catch up with him i d like a word if you please about nathan she added not wanting to be misinterpreted or ridiculed without reason she was done with his insults and humiliations her heart was in full agreement with the resolve what will it be now too few father and son moments for your liking do you want to demand that i tell him bedtime stories now while i tuck him in every night i sure have many stories i could tell him how about the details of my miserable childhood so he might feel better about his hermione could only stare the man face was red after the outburst his eyes glaring daggers at her what he barked hermione looked around at a group of students that had stopped to watch their exchange on their way back to their common room there goes the humiliation resolution she thought annoyed maybe we should take this conversation elsewhere she suggested he didntrespond but stalked towards his office she sighed and shook her head before following by the time she was closing the door behind her hermione was still at a loss of how best to deal with severus in such an explosive mood when he finally took the chair behind his desk hermione felt it was safe to ask what was that all about he didntanswer right away and hermione took that as a sign that he was at least fighting to stay in control of his temper she decided it was in her best interest to give him time before having her say she took a chair across from him and waited and it didnttake long after all but when he decided to talk it wasntto answer her what about nathan he asked hermione took her time studying his eyes before answering severus was out of sorts which was all too obvious but was that resignation that she saw did you have a disagreement because it seemed to me that he was avoiding talking about you this afternoon and after what just happened in the hallway she left at that hermione wasntfishing for apologies or anything although she thought she deserved one priorities had her needing to understand where all that had come from though maybe it was her and not nathan causing his show of temper too bad for him if that was the case because she wasntgoing anywhere until she made it clear that they would still have to discuss their son on a regular basis whether he liked or not nathan would not be affected by her bruised heart i not a seer granger i dontknow why your son hasnttold you all the details you wanted to hear about the last two wonderful weeks of his life i dontlive inside his head to know what he could have been thinking not to he glared at her but she was immune to his pettiness if that was all you wanted from me granger you know where the door is he added in an even voice hermione frowned at that no not at the implied criticism to her dealings with nathan nor at the dry dismissal it was the lack of bite that made her pause first an explosion of temper in the middle of the corridor then that odd aura of resignation and now this he seemed tired now that she allowed herself to take in his physical presence you dontseem well severus are you sick she asked and regretted the words instantly after they d left her mouth you donthave to answer of course that none of my business well if you dontknow why your son has something about you to hide from me that fine too it ll only take me longer to make him talk so i can start working on helping him with whatever is bothering him i certainly hope it ll be before he hurts himself with another curse or something but these worries were obviously not on your mind right now she hadntintended to go there but now that she had she couldntstop her resentment from seeping through her words it wouldntbode well for your free time or evening appointments would it to have to deal with your son if he got himself into the hospital wing again so soon would be such a burden she made a horrified face to add force to her sarcasm we certainly wouldntwant that poor you she finished your son is a dreamer and if that takes him to the hospital wing i might be already there because if there anything making me sick that what well maybe he not to blame after being raised by you and being obliged to listen to all sorts of delusional crap so his problem was definitely with her and not nathan well she wouldntbe staying for any of his crap she stood then well not very helpful but enough all the same good evening severus i ll see you tomorrow for dinner hopefully not before hermione quickly exited not giving a dry shrivelfig for the man growl decidedly her time away was paying off she had no qualms in putting the wizard to his place the rude git even though deep down she was still disappointed and worried that she got away with only a growl o0ooo0o nathan rubbed his stiff neck watching quidditch practice wasnthis idea of a fun sunday morning wow exclaimed andy did you see that yeah it was the potter twist all right kevin answered enthusiastically potter twist nathan questioned didntyou think so the last couple of turns were a bit too wide but then again only harry potter can pull that one out without losing any altitude nathan was frowning he didntknow what a potter twist was and it annoyed him that it seemed to be some sort of broom maneuver his godfather had invented and one he had never heard of before no less one might think his godfather would have told him all about it nathan would have wanted to know beforehand so he wouldntfeel as if he were a hermit or something there were things a godson should know snape can fly without a broom nathan froze as soon as the words left him his two best friends were staring at him then of course and nathan had no idea where that had come from he hadntintended to say anything least of all something like that something about snape he hadnteven been thinking about snape had he his friends were still staring stupid stupid he quiet berated himself er anyway it cold out here nathan managed awkwardly i going inside now i ll see you guys later he hurried away never turning back and still feeling at odds with himself what the hell his mind was playing tricks on him it seemed that was the only explanation he hadntbeen thinking about his father at all nathan was getting sick of this this minding he wanted a break he wanted a break from thinking about snape nathan didntwant to think period he sighed and his urgent stalking slowed down to subdued steps maybe he could shut down his brain with magic use his wand to turn it on and off at leisure where should he be headed for then the library yes it seemed right in the library he would find information of such a spell he would cast it on himself and be free nathan stopped in the middle of the corridor alarmed a sense of d j vu tingling all over he shivered and pulled his robes more tightly around himself it was happening again he was going to curse himself and end up in the hospital wing helpless no not the library then where to go though not the dungeons of course even if that was where his mother surely was but his father was in the dungeons wasnthe maybe even in the lab with his mum crap i thinking of him again nathan groaned he didntwant to think about the infuriating wizard who had surely forgotten all about him already his dad had given up on him he knew it he would never take control over professor snape the git nathan didntremember his dreams when he woke up anymore he d taken the fact as a sign his dad had given up how do i stop my brain nathan groaned again he was walking aimlessly now simply moving his feet and hoping his brain would stop torturing him what did his mother do when she was anxious and didntwant him to know ah yes she breathed deeply changed the path of any conversation they were having and started doing something completely different from what she had been doing up to the moment to focus on something else entirely that it nathan smiled he knew exactly where to go and what to do thanks mum o0ooo0o what are you doing up here hi mum nathan smiled lazily at her i watching the grounds hermione took in the view beyond the window her son was perched on the sill of the day was surprisingly sunny the sky a pastel rue of blue with very few clouds in it you should be outside on such a beautiful day honey she pointed out where are your friends i was with them at the quidditch pitch a while ago he answered but i cantsee the village from the grounds he added what that building there the one with five chimneys hermione sat sideways on the sill this way facing nathan to search the view ahead for the one building her son was asking about i believe it the apothecary she could see the whole village from this window the tiny houses surrounded by the whitened forbidden forest had most of their chimneys smoking and were beautiful from up here the train station was half in sight even it was a view worthy of a postcard she thought i thought it might be a floo central or something nathan said there isnta floo central in hogsmeade people come through the three broomsticks if needed but apparating is how most wizards and witches travel we arrive by train hermione nodded children dontlearn how to apparate until they re of age and to floo all of you through the three broomsticks would be impractical to say the least she reasoned a grunt was her response before the conversation was taken over by companionable silence what has you here watching the grounds she wanted to know it was pleasant up here but hermione didntthink nathan would prefer peace and quiet over games and god forbid adventures no twelve years old boy would unless there was something wrong and hermione was hoping he had a better healthier reason to be up here i making a map he told her a map hermione was relieved by the answer but only until she remembered the map harry had inherited and the amount of mischief involved in its use what sort of map she asked then a map of the village i was trying to guess what each of the buildings was for by the look of them hermione frowned in confusion nathan shrugged there arentvideo games in the wizarding world he justified and then tried a smile hermione smiled back but was far from satisfied with his answer nathan returned his attention to the grounds ahead and hermione did the same it was when an owl passed by on its way to the owlery that a thought crossed her mind would you like to visit the village she asked nathan can i he brightly asked hermione was pleased by the light in his eyes she smiled this time more genuinely yes if i take you and you ll take me wontyou he was on his feet in a swift move we can go to honeydukes then the bookshop then weasleys wizard wheezes and then easy easy hermione interrupted laughing we ll visit whatever we can before dinnertime we can eat in the three broomsticks then if you d like nathan was frowning what the matter she inquired it sunday was his short answer and hermione understood all it comprised we ll invite your father to come with us if that your worry the prospect of that didntseem to appease nathan though she wasntlooking forward to an outing with severus in tow either but she had good reasons for that nathan reasons were what worried her why wouldnthe want to spend time with severus before she could ask he spoke again i need more quills can we buy them in hogsmeade sure she regarded him for another moment then decided to hold her questions for a while longer lunch first though come on let get to the great hall o0ooo0o i not having dinner in hogsmeade severus protested again then you can dine alone because i taking nathan to hogsmeade and we ll have dinner in the three broomsticks whether you come or not the impertinent witch told him she was enjoying this he could see her joy all over her infuriating face nathan is a first year for merlin sake what an asinine idea a hogsmeade weekend for a first year he already thinks he above the school rules he hardly needs your encouragement i not encouraging anything what your problem snape are you ashamed of being seen in the village with us is that it because i not taking you at wand point so refuse the invitation so i can take my son and be off if you please i dontwant to expose nathan to ridicule you impossible woman he answered her mentally my problem is having a son who is a rule breaker he told her though which was also true we re not breaking any school rule severus and nathan knows it a special privilege that we wontbe taking him out every weekend she stopped speaking and eyed him for a moment before sighing he needs the break severus i found him all alone this morning he trying to alienate himself again and i wontjust stand watching while he succeeds that piece of news worried severus but if a distraction was what nathan needed there were alternatives which wouldntinvolve a trip outside the castle go play in the library then or in the lab you can have it for yourself this afternoon i just said we were going to hogsmeade stubborn gryffindors what do you expect to gain with that some quality time with nathan for nathan and i inviting you for him severus drank the last of the juice in his goblet shaking his head and thinking that there would be no quality in nathan time in hogsmeade where they went there would be eyes on them all judges of a boy already condemned by association should he go eyes could turn quickly into insulting words which would taint his son happiness as surely as his goblet would be refilled when it hit the table well you know where we ll be granger said interrupting his musings she stood to go and nathan fate was sealed have a nice day severus severus placed his goblet in front of his plate and it refilled instantly o0ooo0o how many of these mum nathan was asking what is it hermione had been too distracted thinking about what the hell was on severus mind she d just seen him go down the street not five minutes ago and now he was just standing there pretending that his attention was on the books on display at the bookshop across the street oh five is enough nathan collected five candies from the jar and added to their bag he didntseem to have noticed his father antics hermione had the urge to go out there and demand he act like a grown man but just thinking about confronting him in the middle of hogsmeade main street knowing he would be his infuriating self made her sigh in frustration five of these too nathan said reaching for chocolate frogs only two of those nathan she corrected him before this trip to hogsmeade became a prelude to a visit to her parents dental practice why couldntseverus just join them for christ sake should he loom in the shadows like an overgrown bat you have enough candy for a lifetime nathan she told her son before he reached for anything else one sugar quill i ve never had one before he asked fine one sugar quill he took it and placed in their bag smiling at his triumph the little smug copy of his slytherin father two galleons and five sickles the clerk announced hermione paid for their purchase and left honeydukes nathan slightly ahead of her running straight for the bookshop across the street severus was nowhere to be seen hermione tried to act as if she didntknow he was around crossing the street like she hadnta worry in the world but all the while wanting to stop in the middle of the street and call for him to show himself she didn t of course she had more control than he granted her hermione entered the bookshop instead and caught up with nathan the look of delight on his face made her annoyance recede a little it had been a good idea to take nathan out of the castle away from his worries even if only for a few hours look they have books about pumpkin juice he commented and sniggered hermione smiled at him nathan soon moved for other shelves and got absorbed by the new options in literature available for wizards severus should have been here to see this to share these unique moments with them hermione annoyance at the man came back with force just thinking that severus was in hogsmeade playing hide and seek instead of facing them like a man she was walking along the shelves touching the spines of the books and reading a title here and there all the while keeping her eyes on nathan who seemed to be doing a more detailed account of the shelves contents at the opposite side of the long room up a short flight of stairs why was severus so incapable of taking part his part for that matter he could have been up there with his son commenting on the titles and their relative quality and relevance or lack of as might probably have been the case they could have been having the time of their lives here together but no severus had to be stubborn and pass this opportunity on the basis of what exactly stupid school rules oh please only if the school had a new rule for shame because that was it wasntthat he was ashamed of being seen with them take him away from the advanced books hermione held a yelp turning startled on her heels to come face to face with the very wizard of her angry thoughts she had her wand out a reflex and almost gave free rein to the hex that had formed in her throat collecting herself she answered go there and take him yourself he had the gall to look displeased with her suggestion oh that right you can t because you re playing hide and seek she added sarcastically leave him there then but dontcome to me when he tries advanced spells unsupervised and gets himself in a hospital bed again she rolled her eyes severus mum she turned towards her son call and when she turned back severus was gone hermione fists closed in a gesture to attempt to quell her frustration with the man i want this book nathan now beside her stated she took the book from him to analyze it and took her time reading the table of contents while she fought the urge to explode and curse severus aloud when she looked up she found nathan distracted by the charmed books displayed inside a magical bubble used to restrain them hermione startled again when a book floated in front of her face it was a potions book it already paid for came in the velvet voice of that unbelievable man this is ridiculous she hissed she looked around trying to see him so she could tell him what she thought of this stupid game he was playing but he wasntvisible stop this nonsense right now no answer hermione growled low and headed for the clerk she paid for the book nathan had chosen and found that the other one was indeed already paid for let go nathan she called her son who was still observing the enchanted books we have another shop to visit before dinner they left the bookshop and went in fact to two more shops the stationer for quills and parchment and weasleys wizard wheezes for mischief if severus was in those places watching them he didntmake his presence known not even when hermione permitted nathan to have one of those noisy crackers well all the better if he didntwant to be part of their day out he should leave them well alone so it was with renewed frustration that hermione was greeted by the sight of severus snape at a small table in the three broomsticks tapping his fingers in succession on the tabletop looking otherwise completely uninterested in the world around him while not surprising his presence there was unexpected she d taken his silence after their brief exchange in the bookshop as a sign of his departure back to hogwarts oh look who decided to make an appearance hermione told him unable to hold back her irritation you re late was his answer i dontremember setting a time she retorted he glared at her as if she was in the wrong and then took out some of the bite off of his eyes to look at their son hi nathan greeted after no one else said anything severus inclined his head and hermione sighed resigned to abide for nathan sake they took seats across from the man i ve already ordered i hope you dontmind severus announced hermione minded but she kept it to herself for nathan sake this evening would be taking a turn for the worse if she had to bring nathan sake in everything she said or did hermione decided then that it was better to forget what had happened so far in the day and start this dinner as she did any other what are we having she asked painting her voice with calm and polite interest sausage and mash butterbeer for you wine for me i cantrecommend any dessert made here so i ordered none why are we eating here again charming hermione thought counting to ten to refrain from answering back thankfully their hostess decided to approach the table at that very moment i see that your company arrived professor madam rosmerta stated seeming delighted hermione knew she was more curious than delighted though oh dear hermione granger how lovely to see you rosmerta greeted feigning surprise at seeing who severus company was for the evening the hostess busied herself placing plates silverware and goblets for the three of them and who this young one is he your boy severus she kept waiting for an introduction one which hermione knew severus wouldntbe providing this is nathan madam rosmerta hermione told her oh hello little nathan rosmerta gave nathan a toothy smile a grandmother might reserve for toddlers to which she got an arched eyebrow from the boy and furrowed ones from the man across from him rosmerta chuckled with her tray supported by her hips quite a remarkable mix of both your parents you are your food will be here in no time now if you ll excuse me what was that all about nathan asked after the woman had turned and gone about her business interfering gossipmonger severus mumbled irritated she was curious to meet you that all hermione answered nonchalantly she didntwant nathan to be uncomfortable with the attention they were gathering she had almost forgotten how oppressive it could feel to be the center of attention in a public place your mother here is a war hero the brain of the golden trio who disappeared for twelve years and then came back with you the whole room is staring at us severus said ruining everything nathan looked around self conscious hermione glared at severus dinning in the three broomsticks what an enlightened idea he answered to her glare in dripping sarcasm their drinks arrived then giving hermione something not mortal to do with her hands nathan was taking a sudden interest in their shopping bags this is not going as she had planned the last thing hermione had wanted was stress and conversation laced with sharp ended words she took a swig of her butterbeer and renewed her patience to take a try for a normal conversation i didntsee you buying this potions book mum nathan saved her the trouble preparing ingredients for potions nathan hummed opening the book with interest hermione glanced severus way he was pretending not to watch nathan nursing the goblet of wine and looking bored the book is for you hermione told nathan really he asked brightly smiling at her thanks mum oh no need to thank me hermione saw the goblet stop in severus hand and knew he was waiting for her next words thank your father it his gift you bought a potions book for me nathan asked severus the man rested the goblet on the table and seemed for all the world as if he wasntpart of the conversation going on you seem interested in potion making and since your mother gave you free access to her project i thought you should as well learn the preparation of ingredients properly he said and hermione could see how it was costing him to say as much without the usual bite interesting turn of events she thought i like it thank you nathan told him with some restraint but hermione watching his face closely could see that there was more behind the polite answer severus inclined his head in a curt nod of acknowledgment hiding his discomfort behind his curtains of hair as he was prone to do as infuriating as this wizard could be he had his heart in all the right places and that was incredibly hard to ignore at that moment hermione wanted to smile at him and tell him that it was all right to feel joy at earning points with nathan she wanted and wanted to but she couldn t what she wanted was not appreciated she had to stop loving him how hard it was to stop loving him though to stop wanting things she would never get maybe she should settle for feeling happy for him there seemed to be no harm in that feeling happy why was it so hard nathan placed the book in front of her look he asked her it has moving pictures with the instructions he beamed oh very helpful she tried to show enthusiasm it shouldntbe difficult feeling enthusiastic it is a very thoughtful gift nathan didntanswer in words but his smile was quite enough for her one simple gesture from severus was all it took to make their boy smile again and severus thought he needed more to be a father severus was holding his goblet and observing her she realized she couldntsmile at him because that would unleash that hurtful beast of his defenses right back at her and ruin the moment she couldntthank him because that would make him close into himself and ruin the moment she couldntreach for his hand she couldntshow that she loved him she shouldnt love him but she could hold his eyes with hers while she pulled nathan close into a half hug and kissed the top of their son head and hopefully severus would feel included mum nathan protested making hermione smile and she could swear that severus lips twitched to suppress his own reaction their dinner chose that moment to arrive bringing hermione back to herself and she fought to keep her feelings at bay the evening took a turn for the better after that they ate to nathan enthusiastic comments about potions ingredients intervened by severus observations here and there and her own opinions on occasion it was so hard not to revel in these moments of compliancy it was like they had been doing this being a family for ages and it indeed felt natural right as if severus laying down his silverware and answering nathan curious questions had been happening in hermione dining table for every meal as if afterwards they would be adjourning to the living room where she would read while her men played a game of wizard chess as they were wont to do most evenings and later when she d tucked nathan in for the night hermione would go back and find severus on the couch two goblets of wine in his hands looking intently at her hermione was staring at severus hand holding the mostly empty goblet of wine when reality hit her she looked up to find him looking at her but not like in her daydream although he wasntglaring or sneering either it was just eyes on her until they slipped away are you finished she asked nathan yes her son answered she looked at severus and he nodded hermione didntwant the evening to end but it had to she knew it had to we should head back before it gets too late she suggested and they prepared to leave they walked back to the castle together all seeming content in the company of the others none hurrying the pace to get faster away from the chilly winter breeze they werentcold after all this was far from cold climbing the stairs to the entrance of castle nathan suddenly stopped and turned to face hermione you didnttake me to the apothecary we can go there some other time she told him now get inside it too windy to stay outdoors inside the chill seemed to catch up with them and the awkward silence that had settled was finally chased away when severus cleared his throat his soft voice wasntwarm but neither was it cold when he asked i presume you re walking him to gryffindor what had her foolish heart been expecting for her chest to constrict like that stupid thing yes sure she managed he nodded addressing nathan next i ll see you tomorrow nathan he nodded again and his robes followed him towards the dungeons stairs severus was almost there when nathan decided to reply good night dad hermione mouth opened slightly and not only air filled her chest at that moment but also joy and hope severus had stopped at the top of the stairs when nathan had called to him after a moment of simply standing there severus half turned and nodded a motion too quick for hermione to be able to gauge the feelings behind those expressive eyes before he swept down into the darkness hermione embraced nathan shoulders squeezing him close to her side in appreciation for his courage and determination she led him up the stairs hoping this was more than a truce between them all hoping this was the right beginning they d missed months earlier o0ooo0o ordering wine had been a regrettable idea his headache had receded as severus had hoped it would but on the other hand the relaxing effect wine always had on him had backfired dangerously he couldntmake himself mind too much where nathan was concerned he had been called dad again deliberately and now reclined on his armchair enjoying the warmth emanating from the hearth severus could smile and feed this odd feeling of triumph yes tomorrow will get them back to where they were before the wine but tomorrow would wait right now severus was nathan dad and was taking pleasure in every minute of it nathan was fun and smart of course severus thought smugly i he my son severus kept smiling and reliving the fine points of the evening the many smiles his boy had gave him the admiring attention that had shined from nathan eyes severus smiled contented yes he actually did being a dad was delightful he could definitely get used to the feeling a pity it wouldntbe wise in the least a pity indeed but for tonight severus would indulge actually being a dad called for more wine than he d had at dinner so he summoned a goblet and a bottle from his private storage he filled the goblet and toasted himself smirking severus was celebrating and since he was indulging in frivolous whims he wouldntignore the boy mother either oh yes he d noticed her watching him more often than not even after what he d told her more than once she should know better but if tonight was about forgetting tomorrow he would admit that hermione granger attention was good for the ego if her muggle wasntman enough to meet her needs she was welcome to want him after all she had delicious lips and compelling eyes and delicate hands and a lusciously curved body nice breasts round ass a pity she was hermione fucking granger or there would be fucking of another nature oh he could be depraved and want her for tonight yes he was a depraved bastard and maybe he should go back out to treat his desires with some easy to get woman like he d done in the past he wanted hermione perfect lips granger though not those soulless women walking the streets of knockturn alley at this time on a sunday and for that he should burn in hell he d be damned but he wanted those adoring eyes shining with desire while he had her again and again severus took all the wine left in the goblet rolling the liquid around in his mouth tasting it with pleasure it wasnther taste but it would do tonight he was giving his mind a reprieve and if it wanted her mouth to taste of wine that was how her mouth tasted he needed more wine then well into his third full goblet severus hummed and then laughed darkly at the state his devilish mind was leaving his body in randy bastard he said looking down his lap and then took a shaking deep breath making his mind we re indulging tonight old chap he finished the goblet in one gulp and stood when he ascertained himself that everything remained stationary he walked to his bedroom languidly working the buttons of his shirt as he went because tonight severus snape was forgetting the past not worrying about the future and simply giving up and joining her in insanity a n yes dear severus is a bit unstable and unreliable at least to his high standards because i see nothing wrong with letting some good feelings flow freely lol the next chapter will be up some time next week coming next nathan helps severus learn a few things about reality and dreams and severus life is forever changed disclaimer not mine it all j k rowling s beta readers ginnyw and annie talbot thank you very much a n chapter thirty two severus cantget hermione out of his mind chapter 32 awakening severus spent friday between his classroom and his office the events of the night before still disturbed him greatly and he needed time on his own to think reality had expanded to mind blowing proportions and it would take more than one day for severus to assimilate all the meanings and consequences of it denial wasntan option but to be honest neither was this madness all his life he d spent in duplicity and when he d thought this was all over and done with a new part of his life was exposed to him the part he d always wanted to play his dreams coming true severus couldntbelieve all he d dreamed had actually happened to him to his soul even when he thought about all the frequent nightmares and understood how they could have been real through many justifiable reasons it wasntthe idea that he d actually gone through all those terrors what had his face closed into a worried frown oh no what worried and amazed him in equal parts were the dreams now proven real of love and affection shared between him and his son and most worrisome of all his son mother the hermione granger of his dreams was oh merlin how in hell could he look at her again knowing that everything he d dreamed doing to her had been in fact done this was madness and the more severus rationalized about that fact and knew this couldntbe happening the less he wanted to believe reason he wanted to be insane if that was what it took to live a life of dreams a pity that severus was too proud of the grasp he had on the control of his urges to let himself give in he d been too young when he d stopped dreaming while awake it took time to believe he could dream again and not have those dreams crushed his dreams had always been crushed he ran a nervous hand through his hair sighing never in his life had he felt so vulnerable because if he went to sleep he knew by now where his mind no his soul would be taking him and there would be no way of controlling what he would be doing images glimpses of past dreams invaded his mind as if to mock and tempt him he eyed the new batch of dreamless sleep maturing on the workbench and asked himself for the umpteenth time if it was even worth drinking a dose of it could the potion work as more than a deceiver a mask that would free his randy soul even more besides to be honest with himself and severus must if there would be dreams he wanted to at least be able to remember them later such a pity he was so keen on control severus decided to go dine in the great hall maybe she wouldntbe there maybe he could buy himself some time to come up with a solution some way around this but as soon as he entered the great hall he saw hermione there and felt hopeless and uncharacteristically defeated good evening severus she greeted politely when he was taking his seat which tonight happened to be the one next to hers how was your week she asked conversationally when he settled stressful he found himself answering hermione blinked those beautiful eyes at him severus wanted to curse himself when he realized he d actually answered her aloud you need a relaxing weekend she smiled stretching her perfect lips to show him equally perfect teeth if i can help you with anything you need only ask he would have stood spat something despicable and sarcastic in refusal and left but then again why bother he wasntin control of any of these situations so why pretend he opted to eat slowly and quietly as if savoring his last meal the world he d lived in yesterday no longer existed the severus he d been all these years was a lie a shadow a puppet again now of his own wants and needs his heart desires his wishes he glanced at hermione and felt like screaming severus was really damned and he couldntblame anyone but himself this time the masks were down all right he heard the last of her words he d been staring at her lost in his thoughts of damnation yes he answered again aloud and then made a show of disinterest by looking ahead of him into the sea of faceless students severus shoved another slice of potato into his mouth to keep his tongue occupied he knew she was watching him he could feel her unasked questions hanging from her open mouth her lovely hands twitching with indecision his eyes focused on a boy his boy nathan caught his eyes and smiled tentatively more of a half smile and severus last attempt to put his mask back up succumbed then he stood leaving most of his dinner on his plate severus he looked back at her resolve on his eyes not now he told her and headed out of the great hall he was going to his quarters and there he would wait until the castle was asleep and then it will be time hermione he finished to himself and only himself this time thankfully o0ooo0o not now hermione thought to herself what was that supposed to mean what must have happened to turn severus into this unresponsive or rather unusually responsive wizard he said he was stressed and he did look worse for the wear but what could be causing it he had seemed so relaxed on sunday last he always reverted to his old gitty self after clearly enjoying something so that must be it severus was sulking hermione summoned the image of only moments before of him eating quietly beside her he d seemed distant really tired besides knowing it would aggravate him to no end she d felt like extending a hand to pat him on the back and comfort him then and she was almost leaving her own dinner to go after him now not now his voice in her head reminded her and hermione sighed severus severus she searched the crowd of gryffindors and found nathan laughing with his friends he couldntbe the source of severus misery could he somehow hermione thought it unlikely this time whatever it was hermione was certain it was something big o0ooo0o severus paced in front of the dying fire keeping himself awake every five minutes he looked at the watch expecting an hour had passed instead it was almost one in the morning was she asleep he looked at the watch again and decided he would take the risk or go mad or madder as the case may be entering his bedroom he experienced a moment of indecision about what to wear before casting the spell growling at himself for even caring severus simply lay down in the usual black teaching robes he had on and stared at the draped cloth held in place by the four posters of his bed an image of hermione naked framed by that same cloth while in bed with him over him on him was all it took for severus to chant the latin of the spell and free his soul finally now he needed only find her severus soul walked through the castle halls with only one destination in mind hermione his will took him to her quarters and by the door he hesitated this was insane he would walk through her door and then what how should he act whose part should he play severus knew the answer was himself he should be himself for the first time in many decades but what he feared was to be incapable of sustaining that role for longer than a minute this was truly insane even the door was mocking him and for a moment this ordinary looking door became a very painful door gryffindor s and lily evans was denying him forgiveness behind it severus shook his head ridding himself of the unpleasant sight history would not repeat itself so he went through and into a living room severus his name was pure joy and he froze again with uncertainty and then went stiffer yet with unease when her arms came around him the force of her welcoming energy in contact with him soul to soul was such that severus for fear of ceasing to exist held on to her tightly i missed you she told him and severus no matter how crazy the notion had missed her too he had no voice to express it though severus still thought he was about to explode hermione touched the buttons of his robe but for severus it was as if there was nothing separating their bodies or whatever was making their souls touchable you re still in your teaching robes are you sleeping over parchments again she seemed amused at the thought looking up adoringly at his face then reaching a hand to caress it leaving a trace of warmth where her fingers touched my poor overworked professor snape she sealed the words with a peck on his lips and severus almost lost the strength on his legs overwhelmed with feelings he thought he would never feel coming his way severus delved in drowning pressing his lips on hers for a kiss he would never forget the way she eagerly answered made severus whimper whatever objection he might have had completely forgotten and forgotten and forgotten hermione broke the kiss before he could stop her what is it now she seemed worried what the matter severus i need you he whispered he pulled her back to him burying his nose behind her left ear and sighing a shuddering breath you re shaking she observed severus why are you shaking what happened she pulled his head up to search his face and he let her overjoyed by being cared for worried about and that made the trembling grow more pronounced he would explode and he would cease to exist as a loved man and that made it all unimportant hermione was pulling him somewhere and severus would follow her no matter where she made him sit and he did you re scaring me she told him what wrong with you she started fussing over him and every touch of her on his soul was a wave of love severus couldnthelp moaning melting on the couch as if muscles were jelly she stopped abruptly i making it worse she sounded horrified when he felt the waves of her presence start to fade severus opened his eyes and prevented her from getting up by a hand holding her by the wrist no no his urgency would have embarrassed him if he were in a more rational state he pulled her into an embrace and gasped dontgo hermione he whispered this was much more than severus had anticipated when he decided to work the spell to meet her tonight so much more she accepted his embrace quietly for a moment then asked are you feeling better now he felt like laughing and he didnthold back it was so liberating to laugh i ve never felt better in my life he finally answered smiling at the woman in his arms she tilted her head squeezing her eyes at him they suddenly widened and she gasped you re conscious you re under the anima liberta severus held her eyes the mirth still lingering on his they kept looking at each other for quite some time analyzing the situation in its full light have you found what you were looking for her question was curious in its essence he felt so had he yes he answered them both and what are you going to do with the knowledge he looked intently in her eyes and pulled her to his lap kissing her hungrily on the mouth this was heaven to severus she was heaven to him she was straddling his thighs when her lips escaped his what kind of answer was that she insisted how long has this been going on he asked instead of answering her she bit her lower lip and severus wet his not giving her any more time than a few seconds to answer when he took hers for his with another kiss what did it matter he would rather have her silent under his mouth than answering him away from it anyway she broke away again severus stop kissing me when we obviously need to talk instead he brushed his thumb over those striking lips of hers not really aware of what they were saying they re even more mesmerizing after you ve been thoroughly kissed she averted her eyes seeming embarrassed by his comment severus knew a moment of uncertainty then which helped him sober up enough to agree with her previous statement they needed to talk he took his hands from her and instantly wanted to touch her again so he took her hands in his how long has this been going on he reiterated the question she looked back at him and visibly relaxed when her eyes took in his expression since before she started not much after we started working together in a way severus eyebrows shot up and he looked for ways to understand her wrong to make working together be last month when he read through a recipe left on the workbench of his lab and couldntresist writing a note at the margin and not twelve thirteen years ago during the war she ruined it when i assisted you with potions and the order she left his lap but didntleave his touch keeping his hand with her making him turn to his side and face her where she now sat beside him on the couch it was hard to believe that she was telling the truth severus couldntsimply believe he had been having an affair with hermione granger in his sleep for thirteen years while living miserably when awake he frowned don t she told him freeing a hand to smooth the creases between his eyebrows please donttry to understand or analyze the situation so rationally affinities brought us together and life made everything complicated as it wont to do there nothing wrong with anything our souls have an affair of thirteen years and you say there nothing wrong with anything we re not having an affair she corrected him we ve always liked spending time together and since we decided to have a son together we ve become much more than friends or lovers we re a family sharing love and growing together we haventdecided to have a son i was never given any choice about that and i cantsee how you could have chosen to be pregnant with him either severus she interrupted you re mistaken we decided everything together we agreed that nathan would bring us together that he would help me go through the terrors of the war and he agreed to help you forgive yourself for the things you were forced to do for so long he wanted to object but she stopped him again the only fact i ll agree that didnthappen the way we d planed is how long it taking us to come to terms and become the family we re meant to be nathan is suffering for things he didnthave anything to do with she looked haunted and sad and her sadness reached him like a dart of ice on the heart it hurt i sorry she apologized seeming to know that she was hurting him it just that it been a frustrating year for us all she smiled then and the pain was gone severus went fast for her lips kissing them tenderly not knowing why he couldntcontrol himself around her she kissed him back holding on to him making him lightheaded when their mouths lost contact severus eyes remained closed still feeling her i love you severus snape i love you so much hermione whispered now she was the one who was initiating a kiss bringing his head down with a firm hand on his nape attacking his mouth with her tongue and melting his sense of conscience his hands were quick to learn the way up her back into her hair and severus could answer her voracity by letting his tongue free to taste her could two souls become one o0ooo0o the wind howled and hermione woke up startled when she remembered the last of what she had been dreaming she groaned not when i kissing him she complained to morpheus she tried in vain to go back to sleep and into severus arms and when she realized her night rest was irrevocably cut short by the wind hermione sighed and put the bed covers aside since she was already awake and her dream was ruined why not go back to the arithmantic equation she had been working on o0ooo0o still lost and disoriented severus watched hermione come into the room and take the chair by the table in the corner away from him her presence didnthave the same overwhelming effect as before the air between them heavier now but she was definitely there severus wanted to feel her close again but she was a physical presence in the room and he couldnttouch her could he he approached and stood behind her chair severus glanced at the parchment she was staring at placed his nose close to her hair and inhaled deeply her scent was muted but definitely there he reached a hand to caress her arm hermione she let go of the parchment and shuddered you re in my dreams and now you dontlet me concentrate you ll drive me insane as you like to say i am already she mumbled to herself but severus knew that her words were for him he chuckled and stepped away to watch her reaction she took the parchment in her hands again and made a face of concentration severus smirked when he was about to touch her again there you are i ve been waiting for you for hours it was his son or rather the boy soul you promised me a chess match or have you forgotten at the same time that nathan seemed mad at him the boy hugged him tight severus arms came around nathan and what hermione had told him earlier was starting to come back i sorry son nathan looked up and severus could see that he was smiling i like when you call me that the boy told him it much better than dunderhead he was still smiling making of the statement a joke you re not a dunderhead severus told him seriously he felt like apologizing for every single word he had ever uttered and that had hurt his son in any minimal way the boy frowned you re sad dontbe sad you know i dontmind the things the git says he smiled again dontwe joke about it all the time the insult to his persona made severus feel better marginally he was pulled by the hand come on it ll be morning before we know it but there might still be time to play a little that made severus realize how far into the night it was and how little real sleep he would be having the spell was very draining so he had to stop his son i can t but dad the boy whined it been days i know severus said even though he knew nothing but i about to wake up we ll do this some other time i promise nathan sighed okay go wake up then the scene of the boy sulking for not having his company was oddly endearing and severus patted his head ruffling his hair i keep my promises nathan i know but it still sucks this is the only time we really have together and you sleep so little the boy grief was heavy where it touched severus soul he brought nathan head to his chest to try to comfort him we ll spend more time together awake this is another promise i ll keep son nathan looked up and smiled before holding him tight and letting him go walk me up the boy proposed taking severus hand and pulling towards the door nathan told him about fascinating and mundane things while they crossed the castle if other souls were out and about severus had no eyes to see them nathan had his full attention while the boy talked the words of hermione revelation revolved in severus mind they had always been a family severus had always loved his son and nathan had always loved him back as his father now severus knew why it felt so right and possible to feel so attached to this boy severus disentangled his hand from his son and pulled the boy closer to his side by the shoulder without losing the stride nathan instantly hugged him by the waist and kept telling him about finally seeing the house elves who served gryffindor tower cleaning his dormitory after almost a year trying to get a glimpse of the little creatures there what did they do when they realized you were there severus asked with genuine interest nathan grinned before answering they yelped like little girls and disappeared right away just as you said they would man they re loud severus wished he had the memory of the conversation in question at least he would have this conversation to cherish they were at the door to gryffindor and in this mood of dreams made possible severus decided to do what he had always wished an adult had done to him when he was nathan age he hugged his son and kissed him on the forehead stay away from trouble and never let anyone tell you that you cantbe whoever you want to be i won t dad love you nathan hugged him and crossed behind the portrait of the fat lady severus felt instantly cold and lonely he hurried to the dungeons looking for shelter and when he finally arrived back in his quarters he spent some long minutes observing his body thinking about how he didntwant to get back in there and leave this dreamland the love the happiness his family a life so much more worth living severus performed the counter spell anyway and a solitary tear ran down his face to the cold sheet beneath his head right before exhaustion took consciousness away o0ooo0o his mother was inviting him to help her in the lab but nathan was afraid his father would be there the last time they d been together away from the rest of the school had been too emotionally consuming for nathan and he was apprehensive worried about what their next meeting would bring nathan had already decided that he wouldntask about whether the man had or hadntcast the spell that night that meant he would remain in the dark unsure the only thing he was sure of was that he didntwant to get into another emotional rollercoaster anytime soon ready to go his mother asked ready was not how nathan felt but she was wearing that mischievous sort of smile she sported when she was about to try out some new theory if nathan said no he was sure he would be missing some historical monumental epic moment of great fun it seemed that he had no other choice but to take the risk of meeting his father then okay i ready he answered and his voice carried more certainty than he truly felt his mother smile grew wider and nathan smiled back what exactly will we be doing today they started together for the dungeons i think i ve finally found a way to modify the base to work more actively like the spell we ll be actually brewing something new then yes and hope it ll work fingers crossed she told him excitedly yes this will be epic fun but the moment they entered the potions master office nathan idea of having a fun afternoon was challenged by the presence in the room nathan tried to act as if nothing was bothering him hoping they could pass by the professor without interacting good afternoon the man greeted to nathan dismay he never greets us why today good afternoon severus mum was quick to answer are you feeling better his father nodded slowly watching her thoughtfully for a moment before fixing his dark eyes on nathan good afternoon nathan felt obliged to say and his father inclined his head in acceptance of the greeting before turning to nathan mother again i have a potion in the making it only taking some space on the second workbench so i presume it wontconstitute a problem to your brewing his father informed no it certainly won t she answered and then there was silence nathan didntunderstand why his mother wasntmoving to the lab but she wasn t he also didntunderstand why his father was simply watching her instead of making them move as usual i ll be in the lab then she finally announced pointing to the hidden door but not moving to go there yet his father nodded finally turning back to the papers on his desk his mother moved finally and nathan followed her to the lab he made sure the door was closed before he asked what was that all about what do you mean she asked back going about preparing the work space nathan looked to the closed door and opened his mouth to rephrase the question only he realized he had no idea how what just happened outside he tried you know no i don t she quickly answered would you carefully get the glass cauldron for me please the small one nathan frowned but did as she had asked and started working with her he didnteven notice his mind putting the strange exchange between his mother and father behind thoughts of potion ingredients and exciting experiments after a few hours had passed he was laughing at his mother disgust to the way he squished bubotubers his father decided to enter the room though ruining the mood for nathan he tried to go back to the fun they were having before anyway by squishing another bubotuber stop that his mother admonished it became clear that the fun was definitely over replaced by the usual tension and nathan was instantly reminded of how strangely his parents had been acting to one another he watched his father stir the contents of the cauldron set on the second workbench listening to the utensils tinkle your potion is starting to boil the man pointed out not taking his eyes off the potion he was working on oh she snapped into action rushing to turn down the heat she stirred the liquid a few times i ll need more pus nathan it was nathan time to startle back into action still suspiciously watching his parents his father had stopped stirring his potion but continued to watch it carefully his mother was still attending to their base only slowly now nathan squished a bubotuber and it squished loudly the sound seemed to snap the fine line of tension and now there was nothing holding the room in equilibrium his father started moving his way his mother stopped stirring the base and nathan let go of the knife he d been holding ready to apologize his father took the knife and cut the bubotuber in half cut it and then use the blunt edge of the knife to extract the pus from the halves when you make them explode like that although more fun a quirk of the man lips part of the secretion is lost the handle of the knife was offered to him nathan took it and slowly cut the next bubotuber in half proceeding to do exactly how he had been taught much better his father approved and nathan felt a surge of happiness at the approval they finished the base under the potions master watchful eyes playing with pensieves the man suddenly asked nathan mother looked up from the potion nathan observing them both with interest i trying to enhance it she told the man and proceeded to explain her project and her theories and his dad listened with attention that made the fact that professor snape was being uncharacteristically nice this afternoon undeniable to nathan maybe he had done as nathan had asked maybe he d seen what it was like when they were sleeping dreaming and had decided to be less of a git hope was making nathan heart beat faster his father hadntgiven up on him and he was trying to tell him to show him wasnthe this was perfect this was exactly what nathan had wanted since he had met his father soul a sudden urge to hug his father almost overwhelmed nathan reason the man attention shifted to him as if summoned and nathan knew that his father would be able to see in his glazed eyes the happiness and relief his dad hadntgiven up on him in any case his mother continued i think we re done for the day the base has to mature before anything else can be added i cantwait to see if it ll work she said excitedly driving his father eyes from nathan and back to her the man pushed away from the workbench he had been leaning on very well he started to gather some vials from a shelf nathan mother was also gathering her equipments and unused ingredients you could help me bottle this potion nathan nathan looked sharply up his mind unbendingly think who me at his father words the man wasntlooking at him so nathan approached slowly silently his father glanced his way momentarily take a ladle for you his father instructed nathan went after the utensil and walked quickly back to the cauldron feeling suddenly nervous about the task he was helping professor snape in the lab his dad the excitement would have been more than nathan had ever felt about anything if what this nathan paled at the sight of the liquid before him he knew that potion he knew it why did you make this potion he asked with a trembling voice why dad he couldnttake his eyes away from the cauldron full of dreamless sleep potion all nathan hopes and dreams had poured out down that cauldron and they were now in the perfect place for his father to dispose of them once and for all his mother chose that moment to reenter the room from the storage cupboard nathan made to go to her but snape held him by the shoulder i see you still have work to do she even smiled unaware i can wait until you re done if you want me to nathan before he could protest his father said you dontneed to wait nathan was just saying that he ll be staying until dinner time of course i ll be back soon to join you then she agreed and nathan could barely breathe let alone protest we ll see you later his father bid in farewell and nathan was left to his own luck he would be emotionally crushed he knew he should have screamed but where was his voice nathan the man called breathe boy his father urged and it was like a jinx had been lifted that it calm yourself a tear escaped from nathan eye no no his father said with some frustration there no reason for tears it only made nathan flood with them and arms were around him holding him gently shhh calm down son no need for crying shhh dreamless sleep nathan gasped shhh i not going to use it no nathan looked up you won t no i won t you silly boy you re fretting over nothing typical gryffindor his father said the last under his breath a tone of irritation creeping in nathan felt silly indeed and tried to recompose himself drying his face and stepping away from the man help me bottle this so we can go nathan had tried to help even with his hands feeling a bit numb but his father ended up doing most of the work soon they left the lab and went straight to the professor quarters you should drink something nathan opened his mouth to refuse but a conjured cup of tea was thrust into his hands before he could thank you he automatically said he took a few sips and felt surprisingly better his father fell heavily on the couch and sighed nathan observed him massage his eyes with the tip of his long fingers and felt sorry for overreacting he sat on the edge of the couch and waited looking at the teacup and waiting looking at his father boots and waiting looking at the blackened stones within the fireplace and waiting why do you need that potion he got tired of waiting i see you re finally calm his father observed it wasntthe answer though dad it not for my use as i told you already who is it for then for someone else who nathan insisted someone who is not me the man said dryly eyeing him with warning is it for me nathan asked even though he didntthink it was because i am someone else so it can be for me you want me to stop dreaming becau it not for you for merlin sake it seemed he had gone too far again so he went silent to wait more controlled his father started i keep these potions in stock for when they re needed i am the potions provider in this castle as i sure you ve noticed nathan nodded of course his father was making the potion for the school stock he was wasnthe yes he was nathan took another sip of tea and let it warm him he was startled when his father leapt from the couch and disappeared into his bedroom he soon came back but not to the couch instead he became occupied with something by the table murmuring words nathan couldntdecipher from where he was and he didntdare leave the couch in a little while his father intentions became clear but nathan was still confused a chess set he asked when he saw what his father was bringing with him to the sitting area he watched the man clear the side table and place the set there his father extended a hand towards him if you have finished nathan handed him the teacup suspiciously watching his father actions the man vanished it and then took the armchair next to the side table choose your army the man asked o0ooo0o hermione knocked on severus door and waited to be granted entrance she had left nathan with him not two hours ago and although they had spent longer than that alone together before tonight she was still slightly apprehensive severus wasntacting like himself this weekend she knocked again and the door sprang open on its own accord she pushed it and entered looking around for severus and nathan the sight that greeted her eyes warmed her heart and melted her apprehension father and son were heads bent over a chess board hermione approached quietly not wanting to break the high concentration level the players seemed to be in severus moved the black knight who loudly battled a white pawn down nathan watched the scene with a frown then looked up at severus with a puzzled expression and got a raised eyebrow in response nathan attention went back to the board but severus was watching her he seemed to be looking at her as if she wasntable to see him by the way his expression was open and somewhat distant he looked at her almost curiously maybe longingly if she didntknow better hermione chanced a smile and severus turned his eyes back to the board almost shyly would you care for something to drink wine perhaps he asked the chessmen wine would be nice thank you she answered and he left nathan to the game and went for the liquor soon coming back with two goblets of red wine she took the one he offered her and sipped watching severus do the same their eyes meeting for a conversation although she wasntcompletely aware of the subject a warrior screamed and the conversation was over before she could grasp it severus took his place on the armchair again and watched the black knight theatrically give his last grunt around the sword of the white king nathan hadnttaken his eyes from the board severus moved a black bishop three squares left and proclaimed check mate nathan still ran his eyes over the board probably trying to find a way to save his king but he eventually admitted defeat and overturned the white monarch taken by pawns he lamented never underestimate the silent warriors severus told him and hermione felt the truth of his words hit her heart he d know she thought he d know can we play another one nathan hopefully asked maybe some other time severus answered your mother is here and i believe it nearly time for dinner we can play after dinner then nathan she had to use her warning tone hermione knew nathan had to be excited about sharing something like chess with severus but he should know better than to be inconvenient another day severus agreed hermione was drawn to severus library while they put the game away she didnteven notice severus approach and was surprised to find him so close when he offered more wine hermione the way he addressed her scared hermione a little he was sucking her in again she was having such a hard time getting over him and he was seducing her with wine and her name spoken in velvety tones she blinked and turned from him refusing his polite offer no thank you because hermione was a master in turning anything he did from polite into flirting and severus was not a flirty wizard especially not with her the evening went by uncharacteristically slowly after that hermione awareness of the fact that she had to fight severus charms made what would have been a very enjoyable dinner with him a test of her sanity every time she realized she was enjoying herself a little too much she felt self conscious and then awkward he was being friendly trying his best to have her comfortable for nathan and she was getting his signs and decoding them with the wrong dictionary severus must have noticed her discomfort because he cut the evening short right after dessert was served you had a busy day and must be tired hermione was exhausted when she finally left nathan at gryffindor tower and went to her quarters the way severus had looked at her tonight had made it almost impossible not to drown in those eyes and give her heart away she was extremely tired of telling herself that she wasntappreciated every time the wizard seemed so agreeable to her comments and ideas earlier all the looks and hermione this hermione that god must be taunting her hermione let her head rest on the cushion of the couch and closed her eyes so tired a tremor ran from her left ear through her spine and she pulled in a sharp breath opening her eyes maybe it wasntonly her mind that was tired but also her body preparing the base had needed complex spells and precision and hermione could feel her magic asking for rest well why fight the tiredness when sleep could lead to dreaming and dreaming to hermione sighed at her complete inability to control her thoughts sleep hermione end this torture already she mumbled while going through to the bedroom to prepare for bed a n and while she sleeps lol interesting times these are 0 coming next severus finds himself living a double life again and nathan is about to be introduced to the wizarding society disclaimer not mine it all j k rowling s beta readers ginnyw and annie talbot thank you very much a n chapter thirty three severus finds himself living a double life again and nathan is about to be introduced to wizarding society chapter 33 addiction hermione went home that week with many doubts and a weakened resolve she had known it wouldntbe easy to ignore her feelings for severus but she had hoped his antagonistic attitude and sharp cruelty towards her would make it somehow easier the man she d found during the weekend at hogwarts could not have been the same wizard though severus had been almost agreeable she would even dare label him as approachable her feeble defenses were tumbling down if she hadntconfronted him on sunday it was only because nathan had been with them otherwise hermione would have made a fool of herself again professing her love for him one more pathetic time this wouldntdo hermione had to be stronger if she wanted her heart to survive this forced acquaintance until nathan was strong enough to deal with his father on his own then she could stop meeting him every week it hurt just to think of such time ever coming at least i can keep the dreams her mind tried to trick her into believing making hermione roll her eyes at herself she couldntkeep severus in her subconscious and pretend she had gotten over him severus couldntbe a man hiding in her mind hermione would be miserable and that was not how she wanted to end her days that was not how she would find someone to share life with her nathan would come back from hogwarts a grown man and that how it should be and it was time to get ready for that and severus didntwant her even though he offered me wine in such a flirty way and with that thought hermione lost another battle it was useless she needed help erica hermione thought she ll help me she stopped pacing her living room to go to her neighbor long time friend and best chance of sound advice o0ooo0o are you really suggesting i start seeing william hermione asked not quite enjoying the prospect he very much taken by you which should be what every bachelor who knows you should feel erica pointed out in another way of criticizing severus attitude and he your friend already dontyou like spending time with him well i do but no buts hermione if you want to forget an old love you have to replace it with a new one it ll be fun you ll see just give william a chance erica nodded for emphasis and contradicted hermione less than enthusiastic response to her advice i dontknow erica it doesntfeel right to involve william like this nonsense hermione friend dismissed he ll love every minute of it erica smiled and it seemed to hermione that she actually knew what she was talking about hermione sighed all right i ll think about it excellent erica clapped her hands in excitement as if hermione mind was already made the only thing hermione actually knew was that she had to stop loving severus snape every morning she woke up tangled in the tendrils of severus presence in her dreams it made her want to cry in frustration so she agreed with erica and had asked william to a dinner date she didntcare what he thought of this sudden decision on her part hermione just really really wanted to move on with her life o0ooo0o wow nathan said quietly what is it severus asked mildly confused by the boy reaction you completely missed my knight there nathan grinned moving said piece forward checkmate he said cheerfully severus frowned but then relaxed his face with a sigh it wasntas if he was seeing much of anything after two nights in a row spent with hermione in her dreams he dropped his black king and announced it getting late i ll walk you to your house just because i won nathan protested severus glared at that we both have classes in the morning he arched an eyebrow and defied the boy to challenge his authority right nathan agreed losing some of his joy severus made an effort to show some appreciation then i enjoy playing chess with you he commented while he placed his pieces in their box nathan smiled and started to help him i do too i have to think much harder than when i play with andy or kevin if i want to win it only natural it takes time and practice to achieve mastery in the game and i ve been playing for much longer than you have severus agreed and took the chess set to place it on a cupboard in his bedroom what other games do you play nathan inquired from the doorway gobstones he answered distractedly his mind now on the discomfort of having a student in his most private room son or not i ve heard of it but never played or seen anyone playing it nathan confessed completely unaware of severus discomfort i learned it with my mother when i was a kid she actually favored that over chess severus revealed leading them back to the sitting room is she a witch then nathan asked the whole situation was making severus realize how little they actually talked about each other lives during their time together and also how hard it was for him to open up and let his son in she was he answered carefully revealing more than was asked testing his own limits nathan bright as he was caught his meaning oh before the boy could make the next question severus anticipated my father was a muggle and he also died a long time ago i sorry nathan offered severus didntfeel the same way but he didntneed to tell his son that the moment was awkward enough already and the silence was making it even more so it was time to cut this evening short let get going they walked side by side through the corridors of hogwarts the students who crossed their path didntgive them a second glance and for the first time severus realized that the students didntthink it was anything out of the ordinary to see professor snape and mr granger walking together curiously severus didntfeel much differently anymore knowing that their relationship wasntsolely based on these turbulent awkward few months made it easier to accept the fact that he was the father of a twelve year old boy their souls had been connected from the beginning and severus could finally understand the seemingly foreign feelings he had for nathan they could care for each other and it was all right nathan reaction to the extra corporeal experience under the anima liberta was clear and understandable to severus now dad his son called the title sending a warm wave into severus heart do you live in the castle all the time the question took severus by surprise i mean where do you go during the holidays and breaks when there are no classes of course since severus had just told nathan something about his parents it was only natural that his mind would want to know more would severus want to reveal more though could he ever take nathan to the horrors of spinner end deciding he looked at the boy and said i usually stay in the castle it was better to leave spinner end out of nathan life for now all of the time even during the long breaks like summer nathan insisted i usually invited to stay somewhere else for a few days and sometimes i accept those invitations that seemed to satisfy nathan curiosity because the questions stopped but it caused severus to think how would it be when nathan was on summer break and away from the castle would they be apart until the next term started severus didntlike that idea very much he d gotten used to the boy presence he wasntonly nathan teacher but the boy father they were by fat lady portrait when nathan spoke again you could come and stay with me when the classes are over there plenty of space for another bed in my room nathan smiled severus was amazed by the invitation it had been so unexpected thank you but i dontthink that would work out well i sure mum wouldntmind i could talk to her for you another smile good night dad living with hermione severus shook his head to clear it of the wonderful but impossible idea and started his walk back to his quarters he would visit her under the spell tonight again severus sighed he would never get a good night sleep again o0ooo0o as much as it tired him severus continued to visit hermione using the spell that freed his soul he d told himself that he shouldntabuse it but it was getting harder and harder to go through a day without the joys only her soul could bring something completely different from anything he d ever felt when he went to bed intending to sleep a full night he closed his eyes and the absence of that energy which he didntwant to call love made him feel like he d gone to bed starving especially when he d had a trying day or had spent time with nathan severus just couldnthold back and he made use of the spell to get to wherever she was no matter how drained he d be on the following morning it didntmatter if it was a few corridors or miles away if she was in hogwarts or in london severus had always been able to find her he needed only think of her and it was like she was summoning him with that wonderful magnetism of hers one blink and the thought of her guided him another blink and he was with her wherever she was so easy so irresistible more irresistible even was getting to her early to find her still awake giving him some glimpses of her daily life before they were to meet in her dreams three evenings ago had been such an evening and he d found her reading reclined on a comfortable looking armchair in her apartment in london her peacefulness calmed him from his troubled day something that severus couldntremember ever happening in the presence of anyone else not even lily it was scary and pleasant both to realize how much her presence in the same room could be reassuring that added to the fact that she couldntsee him was addictive he could watch her expressions without reserve and every different smile the lines that would show in her face when he least expected still felt very new to him on the following evening he arrived at hermione apartment and had felt a moment of disorientation probably due to the sudden assault by unexpected music to some senses he didntknow were so perceptive severus had looked around and had found her in the kitchen area cooking in rhythm to the pleasant sound she moved with grace he had to notice a grace different than the one he perceived in her while she worked with potions she hummed and sang along quietly helping him remember her warm voice whispering closely to his ear the night before he was getting used to her voice now that it came with a number of lovely words that revolved things deep within his soul and tonight she had come to him and she hadntcome alone either severus had seen her in the great hall earlier and watching her knowing that she was unaware of the nights they d spent together had been more uncomfortable than he d predicted it made him wonder if she could remember her dreams and if that were the case what had she been thinking when she d looked back at him with those shinny eyes and thoughtful expression before greeting him during dinner nathan on the other hand was simply smiling at him sweetly and innocently and the fact that this was the first time he d seen the boy soul since that first experience with hermione in her quarters made him feel somewhat guilty his soul should have visited his son more i knew it nathan exclaimed you are using the spell he seemed happy with his findings instead of irritated as severus thought he would be i thought we could spend some time together but i was hoping you would be dreaming tonight hermione usual reproach to his constant use of anima liberta never escaped his notice but it was always quickly dismissed i needed to see you severus confessed it was so easy to be honest with her in this state when he knew she wouldntremember tomorrow i am only a few floors away as i sure you know the thought of actually visiting me has never occurred you though has it she asked with strong reproach this highly irritated version of hermione was new to him and severus was struck by the surprising force of the shame he felt for his cowardice when he d seen her in the great hall she d smiled and his first impulsive response had been to go after her and kiss her senselessly of course he soon realized he d been in the middle of a hall full of loud children and adults overly interested in the lives of others and worse they were all very much awake why are you mad at dad mom nathan censured her and came to hug severus as if to show her how she should be treating him severus smiled at his boy enclosing him in a one arm hug for a short moment and then looked back at hermione she not mad at me nathan are you hermione still glaring she walked to where they were standing and placed a peck on severus cheek of course i am she told him contradicting her attitude completely her antagonistic behavior was making him both apprehensive and amused if she were really angry at him he would have felt it right if he couldntfeel her anger then maybe her words werentreally heartfelt he smirked she narrowed her eyes at him his smirk turned into a genuine smile we have a meeting tomorrow in any case severus tried to placate her then aiming for a distraction he directed his question to nathan what were your plans for the evening since you re not dreaming nathan turned to his mother to ask we re still sticking to the plan right yes of course she answered still very much vexed he noticed it friday there snow and we re going to the grounds dontruin it hermione told severus gravely and left without waiting for them well maybe she was a bit angry after all she doesntlike surprises is all nathan told him keeping that happy little smile in place come on you wontlike it if she has to come back for us the snow covering the grounds of hogwarts was bright in the moonlight shiny even as if it had a light of its own severus walked side by side with hermione too lost in bitter thoughts to appreciate the unnatural brightness like hermione he didntlike surprises and going for a walk through the grounds of the castle wasntwhat he d planned for this evening also not on his list was spending time with a moody hermione you re still upset he decided to comment that high was his level of annoyance with her behavior well that goes without saying you re a constant source of frustration she looked everywhere but at him and it was infuriating until she added her voice lower than usual i worried severus frowned she was starting to worry him too but probably for completely different reasons worried about what he asked tentatively avoiding the word who with cost but trying very hard not to show it hermione didntanswer and they stood next to each other in silence severus realized nathan was ahead of them but had stopped also only he was busy with the snow when severus was about to take advantage of the boy distance to press her for an answer her voice reached him strangled i very concerned about you she turned to him then and what hit him on the chest were waves of something familiar but very much underneath much sharper feelings the fact that she d told him that what she felt was concern was what kept him from trembling with nerves i thought you cared for our future she added you were supposed to be building your forts nathan yelled from where he was now behind a pile of snow it called his parents attention in time for both to see him take an amount of snow from the ground ready or not a snowball missed hermione shoulder but not by far hey she quickly went for some snow to throw back at nathan and taking an already dumbfounded severus completely off guard placed him between her and nathan one snowball passed close to his left leg and the next one hit him square on the chest this was war severus ran for protection o0ooo0o panting held to the snowy ground with surprising strength by nathan severus conceded defeat i much too old for this hermione laughed picking herself up from the ground off your poor old father she told their son she offered a hand to help severus up when nathan was off him he took her hand but instead of leaving the ground severus pulled her down to him face to face with her severus held hermione firmly by the waist maybe not that old he pointed out before kissing her lips for the first time that night very satisfying would you stop that nathan asked it disgusting and embarrassing hermione ended the kiss and smiled adoringly at severus in that way he could only answer by smiling back she punched him lightly on the chest you slytherin you she said before rolling over to his side severus held a hand out for nathan help us up he told the boy nathan looked calculatingly at the stretched hand you re pulling me to the ground arentyou are you denying your old man a hand severus inquired in his best intimidating voice nathan hesitated only another second but fell for it as soon as their hands touched severus pulled nathan screaming protests of unfairness to the snow between him and hermione severus couldntremember the last time he d laughed so hard and of pure happiness one that felt permanent how could lying there in the snow with his son and woman after such a display of carefree silliness be so fulfilling maybe he knew even less about happiness than he d originally thought not much later already back into the warmth of his quarters hermione cheerfulness and talkative nature had slipped off her soul exterior with nathan back to his own dormitory severus held her on the couch next to him in contemplative silence you re still worried severus pointed out even after what we shared tonight you re still afraid that our future is in danger what future she answered rhetorically why hermione i thought i d proven that my intentions you canthave both severus she told him you cantlive in both realities forever you re torturing yourself by dreaming awake trying to be here for your family but letting us go the moment you wake up cantyou see that he knew she was right about the torture of waking up every day without them but she was completely wrong if she thought he couldntignore the pain for what he did have with them in dreams severus would never allow the certainty of what he had in dreams for the chance of losing everything i want you in my life severus not only in my dreams come to me when we re both awake come in the morning spend the day with me give me a chance to remember you the way you really are let me know how you feel about me instead of leaving me to guess on the basis of intuition alone she pleaded and he could feel her despair all too well what severus could do was to pull her against his chest and hold her tight what severus couldntdo was go after her when she was awake o0ooo0o i was thinking that we could spend a different evening and have dinner in my quarters tonight hermione said she hoped severus wouldntcatch the real reason for her request she could never tell him that she was more susceptible to his charms in his quarters now could she the way he d been looking at her as of late was enough to turn her resolve into nothing more than a lazy intent no she didntthink she could take the risk your quarters he questioned when the expected indignation didntfollow hermione felt obliged to answer politely yes just for a change to see how nathan reacts to a new dynamic nathan never herself i have no objections he agreed without further ado same time hermione felt suddenly insecure yes sure she confirmed not knowing what to do in his presence anymore she turned to go looking over her shoulder only for a quick moment before closing his office door behind her o0ooo0o why are we staying here tonight nathan questioned after seating himself on the couch to wait for his father i thought it would be good to host the dinners from time to time polite even dontyou think if you say so you know it is i taught you better than this young man so stop sulking i remember very well who had to be dragged to the dungeons for these dinners only months ago and it wasntme all right but that was then now we play chess and you donthave a chess set here no i don t but i sure we ll find something else to entertain your poor bored soul does this change have anything to do with you being pants at chess dontbe silly hermione dismissed still more focused on the paper she d been scribbling on than anywhere else she only noticed that some time had passed in silence when nathan talked again you know you re just like him sometimes he commented her interest picked she left the paper alone and turned her attention to nathan what did you say i said that you re just like my dad sometimes he repeated confirming what she thought she d heard and added he also studies and works all the time even when he talking to other people i sorry she apologized feeling chastised she left her papers on the desk and joined her son on the couch i didntmean to divide my attention she smiled apologetically i all yours now it all right no it not hermione brushed his fringe out of his eyes you need a haircut she observed he jerked away i want to grow it donttell me you want to have your father hair she frowned nathan shrugged she suppressed a sigh and reached for his hair again you re handsome the way you are there no need to change anything he jerked away again then let my hair be hermione knew it was a moot point only if you let me give you a squishy kiss on the cheek she pulled him by the hand mom i dontwant a kiss let alone a squishy one but i do come here she tugged managing to put her arms around him in a hug nathan resisted only half heartedly soon giving up and letting her have her loud way with his cheek she laughed when she noticed that he was blushing o0ooo0o severus heard the noises coming from hermione quarters when he approached recognizing her laugher he paused before the door to let his memories fill him with her waves of joy the feeling was enhanced when he could also hear his son laughing severus felt an almost tug at his soul to jump inside and join them he knocked nathan came to answer the door flushed and grinning broadly hi dad hermione was sitting comfortably on the couch but she stood promptly to greet him her shoulders stiffened good evening good evening where did the laughing woman go she didntact as if she were relaxed in his presence like she usually did when she was asleep and it made severus want to take her in his arms and reassure her her pleading eyes the night before when she d asked him to come to her when she was awake haunted him and he felt awkward denying her the comfort now i dreamed of you last night nathan told him grinning still and broke severus descend into the darkness of his soul having nightmares severus asked the boy embittered belatedly aware of hermione eyes and ears on the conversation nathan rolled his eyes of course not we were having a snowball fight on the grounds there it was again that smile so charged with happiness severus glanced at hermione in time to register her puzzlement could she remember too if she could she didntmention it i dontsuppose we could actually go outside now could we nathan asked it too dark outside severus answered hermione standing with her hands on nathan shoulders was looking oddly at him severus brought back his words for examination but found nothing wrong with them he tried to set his unease aside as paranoia but it just wouldntgo away although he was more reserved with his words from that point on joining in the subsequent conversations with care severus seemed to have little control over his traitorous eyes they went out to hermione whenever she did something that reminded him of their nights together more wine severus she offered some time later no thank you bloody wine he thought while he let go of the empty goblet the evening progressed without surprises in severus point of view but that didnttake away the mingling sensation that something had gone terribly wrong during the evening when he wished her a good night and walked nathan to gryffindor tower severus had a clue on why thank you for being nice to mom tonight his son said not wanting to make things worse than they already seemed to be severus only nodded it good to see you hanging around good night nathan severus said wanting the subject ended good night dad severus walked to the dungeons certain that he d made a complete fool of himself that night o0ooo0o granger nathan turned to the voice and saw that malfoy was walking towards him andy and kevin stopped too to wait for him nathan frowned malfoy looked determined and formal when he stood in front of the gryffindors and stretched a hand holding an envelope what this nathan asked suspiciously an invitation what else malfoy answered moodily nathan hadntmade to take it an invitation for what i told father that you were uncivilized malfoy told him disdainfully are you going to make me hold it forever nathan finally took the offered envelope an invitation for what he insisted my birthday party i hope you re otherwise occupied on the date and cantcome malfoy turned from the group of confused gryffindors and walked quickly on the opposite direction disappearing in a corner down the corridor what kevin finally reacted malfoy invited nathan to his birthday party andy answered and gained pointed looks from both friends we know that kevin dismissed what we dont know is why andy shrugged nathan decided to open the envelope his friends looking curiously over his shoulders it his twelfth birthday party sunday next nathan read to them at malfoy manor kevin added with palpable disgust yeah andy agreed he obviously doesntwant me to go so why bother inviting me in the first place nathan wondered while he returned the parchment to its envelope and put it into his book bag andy shrugged maybe he was obliged to you know your father is the head of slytherin house kevin said also shrugging are you going they walked down the corridor entered the transfiguration classroom and nathan still had no idea do you think i should go i wouldn t kevin was quick to express his opinion i wasntinvited but i dontthink i would go either way he malfoy you know andy agreed hmm nathan was too intrigued by the invitation to dismiss it so quickly professor lancey arrived and started the class forcing nathan to forget malfoy and his invitation for the time being o0ooo0o wednesday when nathan was having tea and playing chess with his father he had yet to decide what to do about malfoy invitation the day before he had finally worked out a plausible explanation for why he had been invited he was snape son and snape was malfoy godfather now all he had to do was find out if his father wanted him to go to the stupid party dad nathan called yes i was invited to malfoy birthday party should i go there he d asked his father lifted his eyes from the chessboard then he frowned at nathan an invitation you say yes malfoy shoved it at me before transfiguration on monday his father rolled his eyes before moving a pawn and saying it was probably draco idea is this party here at hogwarts no nathan answered it at malfoy manor is it actually a manor i thought as much and yes it actually a manor his father answered nathan moved a tower while he waited for his father to say something else when he didn t nathan asked again so should i go do you want to go his father returned the question i dontknow i have no idea what expected of me nathan admitted expected his father asked looking intently at him well nathan started how could he explain his dilemma without seeming unknowledgeable you re his godfather and i your son now so am i not expected to go his father expression didntchange at all for the entire time they d stared at each other nathan waiting for an answer at length his father finally answered sort of the malfoys are expecting you to accept their invitation but i have no expectations nathan felt like groaning that didnthelp him at all he decided to change his question are you going i am probably expected to go the man answered without taking his eyes from the chessboard is that a yes nathan asked losing patience with the evasive answers his father kept his head down but raised his eyes to look at him keeping nathan waiting until nathan rose an eyebrow the man sighed you may come with me nathan rolled his eyes all right he made stupid moves to end the game quickly after that nathan didntknow what sort of answer he d been waiting for but he knew that the one he got wasntit maybe he should have outright refused the stupid invitation o0ooo0o where do you think you re going dressed like this hello to you too dad nathan thought i thought we were going to malfoy party you re in muggle garments it a suit grandmother always says i look distinguished in it he offered as an explanation knowing quite well that his choice of what muggle attire to wear wasntthe issue but rather the fact that what he was wearing was muggle in the first place i thought the party was formal since malfoy is such a pompous you ll want to watch your words his father cut him his tone dangerous and then returning to the point you cantattend an event in malfoy manor wearing muggle attire no matter how formal it looks killjoy nathan thought his intention of shocking the traditional wizarding society was blasted by his own traditionalist father where are your dress robes the man asked dontsay you donthave any because i know quite well what was on the list you received with your hogwarts letter will you make me go all the way back upstairs just to change into them his father simply crossed his arms over his chest and glared nathan sighed when he turned to head out of the man quarters his father told him i ll meet you in the entrance hall in fifteen minutes and not a minute later or you ll be staying behind o0ooo0o twenty minutes later gryffindor prefect walked into the first years dormitory professor snape is by the fat lady and he doesntseem very happy he says you re to meet him there right this minute mr granger damn nathan cursed you said he d gone without you andy commented horrified he said he would if i didntshow up in fifteen minutes nathan shrugged you re dead were the prefect parting words i have to agree with thomas kevin said nathan sighed took his wrinkled dress robes from his trunk and changed carelessly into them when he crossed the common room heads turned to watch him nathan felt it was easy to ignore them in face of the apprehension building inside as his mind worried about what part of snape personality would meet him outside walk the man said upon seeing him his next words came only when they were already crossing the grounds we ll have a conversation about punctuality when we re back nathan had nothing to say in rebuttal and when they apparated to the so called malfoy manor he lost the last few words he had his father turned to him adding to his nerves part of it was due to the man critical regard but the rest was because the sight of the building ahead was admittedly intimidating uncle harry house was big the biggest nathan had been to but this house wasntonly huge but also very imposing nathan eyes focused on his father when the man straightened the collar of his robes and touched his wand to his shoulders unwrinkling the dark gray fabric under his winter coat all the time talking under his breath and frowning pay attention the man said in a clearer voice your presence will attract some attention to us and not all of it will be pleasant nathan gulped in a nervous reaction to his father seriousness you are a gryffindor nathan worry abated slightly at that observation taken as an encouragement until try to keep from acting foolhardily and making things even worse by getting into trouble an arched eyebrow completed the admonishment past the feet he was staring so intently at the clean rocks puzzled nathan the snow didntseem to fall on those they were standing on the ones that lead the way to a high ornate gate nathan heard his father sigh and felt even more out of place let get this over with the man said and headed for the gates nathan followed the house looked empty when they entered had they come to the right place a house elf popped in and the sound echoed through the marble walls professor severus sir the small creature bowed and then eyed nathan with big eyes that didntmake the boy feel any less uncomfortable the small elf offered to take their coats and only then did nathan notice the difference in his father clothes they were still black robes but there was a glamorous touch to the fabric of this set and something shone on the lapel a pin of some kind nathan had never seen his father wearing jewelry of any kind before severus what a pleasure the loud greeting almost made nathan jump he couldntsee the feet hidden under the layers of the woman green voluminous dress and i see that you brought company how wonderful her smile didntreach her eyes nathan looked straight into them ms malfoy nathan watched his father take the woman hand by the fingers and brush his lips on them nathan held back a frown nathan my son enchanted another fake smile that went without response i believe i ll find my godson in the ballroom indeed you will he ll be delighted to see you severus then looking down at nathan she added and you too of course how many fake smiles would he get that day nathan wondered as he followed the adults the sound of music and conversation finally reached nathan ears betraying that there was indeed a party going on in the interior of the manor the people gathered there turned to watch them enter and like his father had warned their presence resulted in curiosity and side conversation nathan decided not to feel uncomfortable malfoy father approached them severus the blond greeted with a smile and a respectful shake of hands i was starting to think that i d have to send a house elf after you then turning to nathan i glad you accepted my son invitation mr snape nathan took the outstretched hand but corrected it granger sir snape interceded quickly before the awkwardness in the other man eyes extended to awkward words we should find devon and deliver our greetings if you ll excuse us when they were out of ear shot snape held nathan back by the shoulder no one here will address you by granger dontcorrect them but nathan started but before he could the birthday boy found them uncle severus the boy smile disappeared when he saw who was with his beloved godfather granger nathan almost laughed looking pointedly at his father at how malfoy had addressed him when he turned his attention back to malfoy the boy looked like he d eaten rotten lemon by the face he was making surprise nathan mocked trying hard to maintain a straight face seeming oblivious to the obvious animosity between the boys snape took a package from his pocket and gave it to devon saying nathan and i want you to accept this gift in celebration of your birthday nathan frowned at how his father had included him on a gift he didnteven know about but watched everything unfold in silence for once thank you uncle severus nathan sensed his father eyes on him and forced out a small happy birthday malfoy ignored nathan he was too busy opening the package and taking the lid off the box within nathan made a great show of disinterest in what the box contained but it became a surprisingly difficult task when the slytherin ginned with genuine fondness at nathan father may i assume that you re pleased with the gift snape asked malfoy i ll know for sure when i find out what it is the boy answered without losing the easy smile i believe it ll be quicker now that you re at hogwarts snape told malfoy intriguing nathan even more nathan looked from his father to malfoy and back but they didntseem to notice him there what in the box nathan finally asked as if just only remembering nathan there his father looked down at him and said perhaps you could find out together i ll leave you boys to it but malfoy tried to protest but snape turned and walked away to where malfoy father was standing amongst other important looking wizards nathan became suddenly aware that he d been left to his own luck with malfoy what in the box he asked again it none of your business it wasntwhat my dad just implied malfoy glared at him but nathan refused to melt my godfather always gives me something potions related that i haventseen before an ingredient most times nathan frowned as i said it none of your business malfoy turned to walk away but something made him stop midway and walk back to where nathan had remained standing you have to follow me to the other room why because you do malfoy took off again and this time nathan followed why canti stay in this room nathan insisted privately dreading to have to leave his father presence because you can t malfoy snapped why did you show up at my party anyway my dad made me come i d be having ten times more fun if i d stayed to finish my history of magic essay i quite certain whatever granger just try to keep out of my way and not ruin my birthday malfoy bypassed him purposefully knocking his shoulder on his way to a cluster of boys nathan recognized three ravenclaws one hufflepuff and a den of slytherins nathan sighed why had he showed up to this damned party indeed o0ooo0o severus interacted with new and old malfoy acquaintances with minimum attention he had years of practice and knew quite well how to mingle without actually doing so he was in a circle of meaningless conversation his mind on what was happening on the adjacent ballroom from time to time severus would take a round plain vial from his pocket and take a look at the color of its content he was doing that again exactly when he heard draco voice is there something the matter draco he said hiding the vial and working on a cover for his surprise at being caught unaware one hardly sees the time pass at such enjoyable gatherings maybe draco would buy the idea that he had been simply consulting a pocket watch what was that in your pocket no such luck it seemed a potion vial severus answered revealing only a facet of the truth as he d done so well for so many years draco frowned slightly are you feeling all right severus sighed i fine he reassured it hadntbeen his intention to worry the host you were more evasive than usual this afternoon it was like you werenthere at all as if you had your mind elsewhere are you sure there nothing the matter very perceptive severus thought i am draco shook his head but didntinsist changing the subject of their conversation to something severus could give his usual share of attention instead the potion in his pocket showed that nathan wasntabout to punch or hex anyone but it didntleave severus carefree either it had gone from neutral colors to more somber ones as the afternoon advanced making severus wonder what was making his boy sad in the other room he d somehow expected more vibrant colors which would have meant his son anger thus showing severus that he would need to intervene to keep a scene from happening the sad hues he d been seeing for more than an hour instead were keeping severus even more alert it was unexpected and worrisome others joined their circle of conversation and severus was yet to add more than grunts to it he wasntso distracted not to notice when the conversation stopped altogether though severus turned to the source of the other curiosity nathan approached and locked his dark eyes bigger than how severus remembered them with his professor snape his son called eyes never leaving his as if hoping that those listening closely to their conversation were invisible i was wondering how much longer we ll be staying sir you must be young mr snape nathan seemed vulnerable when he was forced to turn his eyes and look at ms ollerton severus expected him to answer as he d done draco but what nathan said was much more worrisome i suppose i am ma am you have your father eyes ms ollerton commented thank merlin the boy didntinherit the prince nose mr ollerton added maybe louder than he d intended ms ollerton laughed at her husband tasteless joke but no one else around them joined her preferring cautious neutrality where severus was concerned he was still known for surviving the dark lord and everybody knew it wasntfor nothing severus attention was on nathan though the boy looked shyly at him pleading with his eyes to be taken home draco i afraid i ve left work waiting for me back at hogwarts it been a lovely afternoon wontyou stay a little longer i afraid it wontbe possible you re going already severus hadntseen devon approach but you cantgo you haventeaten any birthday cake yet devon pansy admonished thank you for coming uncle severus the boy said halfheartedly and then belatedly added nathan always a pleasure severus answered politely if you d excuse us he bowed took nathan and left not long after they stood just outside the gates of malfoy manor nathan put his arms around severus ready for the apparition that would take them back home severus didntapparate right away though he encircled his son with his arms instead holding him to his chest in a furtive hug he felt nathan shoulder sag and knew he d done well only then did severus apparate them to the gates of hogwarts i sorry nathan broke the silence as soon as they were on the cold scotland air with the words that infuriated severus the most severus sighed why do you apologize i made you leave before the cake severus snorted do you really think i d have wanted to stay nathan shrugged nathan look at me the boy did and severus examined him thoroughly for hexes or poisoning nathan didntprotest severus found nothing did you drink or eat something devon gave you he asked it was nathan time to snort what happened then nothing i was bored to death at last an answer that seemed more like his son seemed severus knew better than to take it as the whole story there was more to it but he would be content with any sign of normalcy that night severus went to bed only after he d watched the potion on his flat vial turn a light green informing him that nathan had fallen into a tranquil sleep his first stop after he d cast the anima liberta spell was his son quarters and he was relieved to see his soul as cheerful as ever severus was glad of children capacity to forgive and forget o0ooo0o in the middle of the subsequent week severus soul freed and conscious entered hermione apartment through the front door and was assaulted by the now usual scent of spices coming from the kitchen area severus new found addiction was to watch hermione cook he stood beside her watching her stir a pan of tomato sauce and humming with her the same tune that was coming from the living room it was the same intoxicating happiness and wellbeing of most evenings with her until he heard a male voice calling out to hermione over the soothing strains of the music and made severus turn in its direction with amazing speed shocked are you sure you dontneed my help with dinner the muggle asked her entering the small kitchen now positive she answered smiling with ease at the muggle severus eyes already big went wider yet when the muggle hugged hermione from behind resting his chin on her shoulder here taste for yourself she offered some sauce on the palm of her hand to the muggle who licked and hummed i agree you dontneed any help with dinner the muggle kissed her on the cheek and let go of her i ll set the table may i hermione laughed lightly and severus heart ached enough to make his eyes sting yes you may where do you keep the tableware she laughed again and severus left before his chest burst open missing the rest of their interaction severus had seen enough anyway his first impulse to flee and protect himself from the pain was quickly turning into loss and resentment but what struck and stayed was anger instead of going back to his body he stayed and watched it could be considered masochistic but he wanted to know needed even to understand how his dream had become such a nightmare in a matter of seconds they ate dinner in friendly conversation about their day to day affairs laughing and exchanging sweetness through their eyes hermione smiled and blushed when the muggle flattered her the muggle didntlet an opportunity to touch her hands pass it was sick but severus watched they moved to the sofa and arms were tangled heads were held tenderly severus turned his head away when their lips touched but only time enough to renew his anger and determination and turn to look ahead again watching he two kiss in heated passion clinically now severus could see her touching the muggle the way she touched him analytically he observed that she kissed the other man the way she kissed him methodically he watched she let those foreign hands slide over her hair as if they were his severus hands and she smiled and the bastard smiled back and severus finally tensed his face in disgust and decided he d wait to tell her how much he despised her somewhere she wasntsnogging a muggle behind his back severus decided he d stay and show her how little he thought of her even if it was all to disguise how empty he felt hollow bleeding through his anger and hurting in every bit of his soul he d make her listen to all he had to say about treachery severus went to her bedroom and waited there he both wanted and didntwant her to come to bed and when she entered the room he didnthave the courage to see if she was alone he remained sitting on the bed with his eyes closed and when he didntfeel it move he felt strong enough to open his eyes something instantly filled part of the hollow in his soul she was alone now it was only a matter of time until she fell asleep and severus would not look back when she howled in pain at the mercy of his cutting tongue oh dear severus he closed his eyes at hearing her sweet voice calling his name the moment of truth had come severus had his back to her sleeping form donttalk to me he rasped severus her voice was a whisper but his whole soul shivered at the pain emanating from it a hand fell on his shoulder and severus jumped to his feet electrocuted into rage over his loss donttouch me those dirty hands of yours his face might as well show his disgust for her in its twisted lines severus please why did you do this to me how could you let those filthy lips kiss you and enjoy it i couldn t in fact why didntyou bring him into your bed and finish the job because i dontfeel anything for him liar i not lying i never lied to you donttalk to me he gritted through his teeth donttry to tell me you werentenjoying every minute while those dirty hands were all over you hermione because you d be lying i saw the way you kissed him the way you groped him he showed how disgusted he felt why did you stay why didntyou leave when you saw what i was going to shut up he raged i dontwant to hear your voice severus you re a fucking liar hermione how can you betray me so lightly you said you loved me and then his face twisted into disgust you let his disgusting hands go all over you you give your mouth to him you laugh with him but it you whom i love liar a tear ran down her face i love you she whispered no you don t i tried to warn you that this was going to happen he shook his head in denial that you couldnthave both i dontwant to hear this when i realized that you wouldntlook for me shut up i knew this was going to happen shut the fuck up she did he breathed hard through his nostrils this is not my fault do you hear me it not she took a step closer and severus could feel her love for him emanating from her soul but instead of reassuring him it hurt dontgive up she pleaded feel my love fight for me severus dontlet me slip through your fingers i beg you please fight for our love he looked down at her so close to him she was and the only thing that left his lips was the breathed latin of the incantation that sent him back into his body and for the last time he promised himself that night he cried himself to sleep vowing that he would never go to hermione again he vouched to never fall in love again o0ooo0o on friday severus was at the door to her quarters at hogwarts and as soon as she opened it he came in grabbing her clumsily by the waist and swirling them both around so she was pressed with her back against the door which finished closing with the weight of their bodies besides a squeak of surprise she didnthave time to say a thing before his mouth claimed hers his urgency was breathtaking literally severus she managed when he left her lips time enough to do so she d felt the taste of firewhisky in his mouth knew he couldntbe in his right mind and yet her eyes were heavy and her hands closed tightly around his arms lovely lips was his answer before he assaulted them again tongues entwined and hermione fought to have a clear minded thought she knew she shouldntbe answering his passionate kisses but that was out of the question humanly impossible even his hand tangled in her hair at the back of her head and she knew she should not allow this to go on but his fingers felt heavenly on her scalp he came up for air again when had she closed her eyes his were half lidded god look at his wet thoroughly kissed lips you have horrid hair those sexy lips said damn she should be glad he d said that or she would never have come to her senses severus you re not in your right mind she had to put an end to it and god helped her if she didntsucceed i thought you liked kissing me he retorted too close to her ear for her body not to react severus she tried to admonish hermione holy crap she melted at the way he d spoken her name there inches from her ear before nipping at it severus you have to stop it was nothing more than a whisper but it finally made him take his nose from the crook of her neck and look at her in the eyes i dontwant you to stop she assured him but you re drunk and you would never forgive me if i let you ravish me in this state god what am i saying she placed a short kiss on his still too damn inviting lips but i want to ravish you a soft open mouthed kiss and a flick of a tongue i need to have you a pull on curly hair i need to get you out of my bloody mind sharp teeth closing on soft flesh you re driving me insane a whisper against white skin it wrong who was she trying to convince him or herself wrong he agreed his speech slurred by the alcohol and then he licked her throat she shivered and held him by the hair bringing his eyes to hers it wrong he lowered his gaze you have lovely lips he d already said that and she filed the information for later use so do you she complimented and brushed her thumb lightly over his lower lip his eyes fluttered shut she sighed why did you have to be pissed hermione pushed him slowly away and grabbed the doorknob come back when you re sober i not drunk he said lamely but left without further protest hermione closed the door and leaned on it again this time without him weighing on her good lord a n hehe drunk kisses tsk what were you thinking severus well we kind of know what you were thinking lol coming next the final blow to severus walls and another prince tale disclaimer not mine it all j k rowling s beta readers ginnyw and annie talbot thank you very much a n chapter thirty four the final blow to severus walls and another prince tale chapter 34 surrender severus was not at breakfast severus was not at lunch severus was not in the lab that saturday afternoon nor was he in his office at any time of the day hermione was as patient as she could manage trying very hard not to get her hopes too high it wouldntdo for her to go knocking on his door demanding words she didn t know he was capable of saying it wouldntdo either to throw away the balance she had worked so hard to achieve from the moment she d decided she had to move on and get over severus yes the night before had shifted some of the foundation of her carefully built balance a fact that was undeniable it was also good for her mind health to remember how completely drunk severus had been she needed to keep that in mind and remain calm centered hermione looked in the mirror one last time and contemplated her plain clothes light make up and unruly hair let go nathan and as carefree as she could hermione went to the dungeons for their usual saturday dinner hoping she would keep herself composed when she met him severus was silent and expressionless when he admitted her and nathan into his quarters hermione was reminded of how he d used to carry himself during the order meetings as he kept a calculating eye on her while talking to nathan she played his game during dinner making nathan the center of every conversation but when dinner was over you go on honey i have a few things i want to discuss with your father all right good night dad severus nodded stiffly good night mom nathan hugged her and left she was alone with severus he held himself rigidly by the fireplace looking intently at the fire hermione waited for him to say something anything he surely knew why she d stayed behind she should remain calm and rational she should wait for him to make the first move she should be patient and just wait she should but severus he looked away from the fire and fixed her with a blank face i apologize he finally said as neutral and cool as she managed hermione quietly answered i dontwant your apologies she approached him never losing contact with his eyes looking for an expression in them yesterday you yesterday i wasntmyself as i sure you ve noticed yesterday you were drunk she confirmed he nodded once and hid his eyes from her placing his hair between them again i apologize you donthave to this is not why i stayed behind she knew she was waiting in vain but she still hoped he would say something other than these polite apologies she wanted to hear from him why he d kissed her she wanted him to tell her what had made him go after her what had changed all she heard was his loud sigh i wasntin my right mind obviously my apologies arentenough for you as you re still waiting for merlin knows what he finally looked at her with some expression which was much preferable to none at all even if what the lines around his eyes showed was annoyance she bit at her lower lip while she contemplated the odds of going right to the point they didntseem promising if his angry eyes were telling her anything she risked an opening there were things you said to me last night that i believe we should discuss he shook his head in a negative gesture nothing i said last night merits discussion i was drunk and therefore last night never happened is that what you re saying his attitude was making her lose the patience she had harbored so carefully during the day i wasntin my right mind and you know it you said it already but that beside the point no it not he snapped apparently she wasntthe only one with a lack of patience at the moment she took a deep breath and calmly said something has obviously changed in the way you see me or you wouldnthave knocked on my door last night he glared she took his hostility with calm and waited he bowed his head rubbing his forehead with a hand and at that moment he seemed very tired i a man hermione you re a beautiful woman he d said she was beautiful and i have lovely lips she added he quickly looked back at her showing his surprise she smiled at him amused he closed his eyes and sighed i said that didnti twice her smile widened but she soon lost the mirth i never made any secret of my feelings for you if something has changed in yours for me i want to know what would your muggle lover have to say about that that took her by surprise she hadntspared a thought to william since the very first touch of severus fingers on her skin the night before then she caught herself and narrowed her eyes how could he know about william sharpening your spy skills she accused i d prefer if we left william out of this and i d prefer if we would he hesitated forget about last night she took a step closer to him and yet the question remains could we she watched his eyes dance on her face stopping on her lips and she held her breath thinking he might kiss her she licked them he turned away stop tempting me woman do you think it prudent to make me lose control around you do you want to lose control around me no you ve said it yourself you re a man and i a woman why cantwe be together if that clearly what we want he lightly shook his head his back still to her he was fighting it he was trying to shun her again no hermione shook her head too not this time you won t she walked around him to make him look at her her hand rested on his chest searching for his heart and felt his hitched breath he grimaced his eyes tightly shut dontfight it she asked softly please her face joined her hand on his chest feeling him shudder with an exhaled breath she held him to her listening to his heart beat faster than hers she would never let him go o0ooo0o severus tried to keep in control of his will if she doesntstep back i can t merlin i want to kiss her he fixed his eyes on the table ahead with an enormous effort he held her by the shoulders and pushed her at arms length bypassing her he looked for stability from the table feeling the wood with his cold palms and hoping the solid surface would ground him we re getting nowhere with this meeting hermione i donteven know why you stayed behind stop hiding from me she told him and pulled at his arm trying to turn him to her her voice was powerful in him and it only made it hurt more he resisted leave hermione why does she have to touch me look at me severus a whisper from hell he gave in and met the devil he mastered his emotions the best he could and hoped his eyes showed only a cruel desire to make her suffer why do you think i need to hide from you who the devil now this is me hermione look at the man capable of taking you against your will look at me and run while you still can this meeting is over her hand left his arm and came to gently caress his face he should have pushed her away when her fingers brushed his forehead but he didn t her fingers ran the path of his eyebrow drop the mask she whispered this is not you i want to see the real you severus he closed his eyes a brief flutter of his eyelids and looked back at her why was he doing this why were those fingers followed by the feel of her sincerity bringing him down he was bare to her as he d been to her soul beautiful she breathed cupping his jaw in her hand her thumb brushed his lower lip his hands gained life and his fingers were lost in her hair a thumb caressing her cheek so soft kiss me severus she offered her mouth with parted lips and he could only accept bringing his down for a light brush she sighed and he welcomed her warmth pressing his thin lips on the softness of hers for a real kiss she clung to him bringing him even closer by the nape he pulled her to him keeping their mouths moving leisurely enjoying every inch of contact until pulling back breathing into her mouth their eyes opened and met hers half lidded he felt alien in his own body it was like his dreams were mixed in a reality he didntknow of he had never kissed like that with such intensity he had never been kissed like that she has no idea what she doing to me when he felt her teeth on his chin he almost lost the strength on his knees you re insane she was smiling and sliding her hand down his neck her lips closed on his chin soothing the skin she d just attacked with her teeth she trailed chaste kisses on what was bare of his neck hermione she withdrew and severus looked down at her so dangerous so beautiful he kissed her again soundly passionately holding nothing back their tongues met and he was lost in her for life she broke the kiss dazedly confused he looked down at her and found her reluctance this is going too fast she panted maybe i should go now she didntmake a move to do as she d said held there by the connection their eyes made between their souls an eternity seemed to have passed when she took a tentative step away from his arms he let her even though he didntwant her gone she kept looking at him never turning away as she walked to the door her smile was the only thing he could see promise you ll be here when i come back she asked from the door he would he knew but he never said that aloud and his lack of answer didntmake her smile yield he couldntkeep his eyes from her until the door closed and she was gone clicking him back from the trance damn it wasnthigher than a mutter it wasnta curse either o0ooo0o dusty old books they seemed endless in this part of the library where few students ventured nathan was the only one who could be seen in there with some regularity at this time of the year he was looking for references to his past it was may but he felt like he was back in september when he d also been to this part of the library in search of his past back then he searched for a father and now he knew his father was severus snape but what did that mean exactly after malfoy party nathan had discovered that his father had a whole life outside the castle of which he didntknow much being a snape involved much more than simply being the son of hogwarts potions master his father was much respected in wizarding high society probably a member of it himself as part of being a prince that was what nathan had found out researching the pin he d seen on his father robes that afternoon a similar pin now used by malfoy too the family insignia is history of magic giving you trouble the voice of another person nearby surprised nathan professor lupin stood by the table sporting a smile on his face well sort of goblins no sir the professor took one of the books from the desk and frowned wizarding genealogy he took another pureblood traditions since when did binns change his syllabus it not for professor binns class sir frowning his head of house took the chair opposite to his this isnthomework is it no it something else nathan confirmed would you want to tell me what is it then nathan looked at his professor with confusion what do you mean sir i want to know why you re alone in the gloomy library researching pureblood traditions while your friends are all enjoying the unexpected nice weather outside nathan looked at his notes and the books sprawled around them it occurred to him that he hadntread anything about the lupin family so far sir are you a pureblood the question seemed to offend the professor i a wizard and that what matters blood status hasntmeant anything since the fall of voldemort i sorry sir i didntmean to offend you or anything you didntoffend me nathan professor lupin voice was calmer those who fought in the war are always cautious when questions like that are raised what are you looking for in these books i just want to know more about the wizarding side of my family did you know that my dad is half prince nathan smiled and then remembered his place by dad i mean professor snape of course i know who your dad is professor lupin smiled seeming somehow more comfortable with the conversation after that does he know about this research no nathan frowned it hadnteven occurred to him that his dad might have a problem with it i not doing anything wrong nathan was almost sure of that or am i that was not what i meant has it occurred to you that he might have information that is not on the books he might want to help you to be honest it hadntcrossed nathan mind to outright go and ask his father about the insignia i thought i d start with the books that way i ll have some information before i ask him professor lupin rested his back on the chair placing his intertwined hands on the desktop and looking suspiciously at nathan i not going to have to call your mother here to visit you in the hospital wing over this am i what how could researching get me there i not sure but it something i learned when i taught your mother every time i found her in the library it didnttake long for her or one of her friends to get into trouble and end up in the hospital wing you seem to have the same talent professor lupin sent him a pointed look i cannot imagine how this could get me into any trouble sir very well professor lupin stood up hopefully to leave nathan to his research try to remember to eat and go to classes between books i will nathan smiled and the professor finally left he was free to go back to other references about the family insignias he d discovered that they d been created as a means for wizards to be readily identifiable back when practicing witchcraft and wizardry in front of muggles wasntforbidden and famous wizards like merlin were highly respected for their skills it was kind of like his grandparents wearing white to work as dentists of course things had changed drastically when witches and wizards had been hunted and burned alive for their gifts they had to hide for safety and wearing the family insignia became a way for wizards to recognize each other and unite forces for protection the tradition remained throughout the centuries continuing nowadays amongst purebloods nathan had found books with detailed descriptions of what each major wizarding family insignia bore and their meaning he d found malfoy s he d found potter s and most importantly he d found prince s the one his father had rightfully been wearing at malfoy party reading further he d also discovered that the insignias didntalways come as pins but could also be displayed in the form of rings preferred by clan chiefs and of pendants usually worn by women well if nathan decided to make one for himself it should definitely be a pin like his father s magical children were allowed to wear the family insignia after they d turned twelve an age when they had a wand of their own and had already proven to be able to channel their magic through it therefore proving themselves to be true wizards and witches nathan definitely fulfilled the requirements he should be wearing his family insignia by now and the only reason he could think of for not having his own yet was the fact that he d turned twelve right when his soul had been locked outside his body because of that stupid spell or maybe the princes had to recognize him as part of the family would they the prince clan was a much respected wizarding family if what he d read was true everything nathan had found out about his prince side of the family was exciting and scary in equal parts exciting because he d discovered that the history of chocolate in the wizarding world was intimately connected to the princes own history and scary because every discovery added to his private thought that his father hadntintroduced him to his family because he didntthink nathan was up to the name isidorus prince had been a very famous wizard nathan had read that he d been the first wizard to mix magic with chocolate in the 1840 s and not ten years later he d invented the chocolate frog his apothecary where chocolate used to be sold back then became the most famous in wizarding britain isidorus had been only the first in a line of princes to find in the secrets of chocolate the means for recognition success and fortune nathan had wondered about said fortune being now in his father hands but he was quickly dissuaded of this notion by clippings reporting how his grand grandfather had sold the rights of the family chocolate secrets to honeyduke s news of any member of the prince family after that had been few and far between besides the information he d found on the late princes nathan had also found a picture of his grandmother eileen when she d still been a student at hogwarts she d been a slytherin prefect and captain of the hogwarts gobstone team she d looked very much like his father did nose and all and nathan was suddenly aware of how lucky he was to have inherited the grangers nose when eileen had married tobias she d become a snape thus ending the prince line the last reference to the name prince nathan could find was in a footnote about the birth of lisaneas prince grandson eileen snape son severus seeing the news of his father birth on the newspaper made nathan wonder if his own birth had made the news advancing to less yellowed issues of the daily prophet nathan found many references to his mother and her two friends harry and ron but only in mentions of her mysterious disappearance nathan sighed letting the papers be now that he knew that his dad wouldntbe leaving his life at the next blink of an eye nathan had caught himself in questions that hadntworried him before why had his mother taken so long to tell him that professor snape was his father why hadntthey been together when he d been born why the secret why wasnthis birth in the news why had his mother left the wizarding world hadntthey dated had they ever thought about getting married if not why not and did any of those answers explain why he didnthave his own prince family insignia yet although he didnthave answers to those questions nathan could easily remedy the last one by making his own prince family insignia he d found the prince crest on a book so all he needed was to transfigure it into a pin if he worked hard enough he could surprise his dad by wearing it to tea next week o0ooo0o severus couldntsleep since he d admitted his dreams into his waking life severus had been unable to let his conscience rest constantly haunted by thoughts of what would be hermione and nathan future with his interference in their lives every time he tried to think about it optimistically hermione ended up bound to him and miserable every time he tried to think of the worst case scenario hermione was bruised and quenched yelling at him to leave and never return each time he stopped to think about their future the worst case scenario found new ways of getting worse like now he d just spent the first part of his afternoon with nathan his innocent boy it was amazing how pure he was how carefree the child could be but now that nathan was gone all severus could think about was another boy the boy who lived an orphan growing up as a misshapen muggle hidden from his real life for protection always misguided always miserable there surrounded by the books covering the walls of his shabby house in spinner end the man hid his face in his hands closing his eyes tightly trying to make the images of eleven year old harry potter go away but they never went running away from hogwarts wasnthelping him this time either the images were still there always there imprinted on his mind eyes except now the boy looking hatefully at him wasntalways potter anymore but sometimes nathan his innocence completely gone eyes cold as stones with only hatred left severus knew he was responsible for all that he pulled at his hair wanting his mind to stop torturing him he had to make it stop severus didnteven realize what he was doing until he d opened his eyes to the sight of a wall of bricks he d apparated into a dead end between two buildings one he d used once before months ago on that occasion he hadnthesitated leaving the obscured place as soon as he d felt he d been entirely there on this occasion though he didntmove to leave trying first to understand what his subconscious was asking of him a group of loud people passed by not noticing him it for the best his mind supplied and severus muttered this is ridiculous to what he was referring it was hard to tell it could be to his inability to take action and finally leave the dead end which was indeed ridiculous it could also be a reference to the absurdity of the idea that he was coming after hermione in the middle of the afternoon to convince her that he didnthave feelings for her after what had happened during the weekend which was extremely ridiculous a group of young women passed by laughing scandalously severus growled at them at himself and finally took off following the paved walkway towards the chemistry department building of the muggle university picturing the stony eyes of a destroyed nathan he quickly left the giggling women behind gaining speed and determination with each step severus would enter hermione office and tell her that this was a mistake that she didntneed him that it was best if she left him to live his miserable life away from her he would not stay to listen to a word she said he wouldntgive her any opportunity to open her soft lips to argue he would find her tell her everything she had to hear and then run as fast as he could he shook his head to clear his mind he would find her tell her everything she had to hear and then leave quickly before she could get to him he frowned slowing down minutely worrying that maybe he wouldnthave a chance to escape before she put her delicate hands on him knowing quite well that he wouldntbe strong willed enough to leave if she touched him he would succumb then he almost physically did took away from his worries by stumbling into someone excuse me the man who d gotten in his way said it was nothing they looked at each other and the muggle instantly showed signs of recognition it wasntjust any muggle but hermione muggle severus schooled his surprise into a blank expression are you looking for hermione suspicion was written on the man face do you bring news of her son her son his primarily purpose put aside by more urgent instincts a red rage took charge inside severus inexpressive body nathan was their son not only hers and this muggle had no business asking about severus boy my son is fine severus spat not that it any of your concern as hermione boyfriend i have to disagree severus didnthave time to acknowledge the petulance of his tone taken aback by the words instead boyfriend all anger drained from his body replaced only by a cold numbness he d thought she would dispense of the muggle after what had passed between them over the weekend severus had thought she d meant to be his from then on severus left the muggle talking to himself hearing his calls but pointedly ignoring them she not mine she was never mine she wontever be mine his agile legs guided him quickly back into the dead end where he disaparated back to hogwarts and his old futureless misery o0ooo0o hermione she looked up and found william in the doorway to her office she hadntknown that he d been back from his trip to america already hermione wasntlooking forward to the conversation they would have but there was nothing to be gained by postponing it she built a smile nonetheless you re back he answered her smile easily did you miss me approaching he bent over the desk and kissed her her smile saddened she had brought him into this and now he would be hurt he took a seat on a chair across from her how nathan she found the question unexpected he wonderful thank you for asking what did his father want then nathan father she frowned yes i bumped into him coming into the building severus here no he left it was william frowning now hasnthe been to see you no a sense of dread started to take hermione chest did you talk to him briefly hermione dread got to her throat drying her mouth i asked after your son but he was rude saying it wasntmy business is he always like that yes he like that what did you say hermione felt her life was hanging on that answer well that i was your boyfriend that nathan is now my business too he said vehemently dear god she whispered holding her head in her hands hermione are you all right i didntmean to scare you he assured me that nathan was fine he was by her side in no time i fine i should probably go after him it might be important she needed to find severus as soon as possible but the kind hands on her shoulders caressing told her that she needed to put things to right here before going after severus will we need to talk hermione sadly proceeded to break his heart o0ooo0o severus he heard her voice and started severus are you there he looked at the hearth and found the source of her voice he hesitated only a second schooling his features before showing up in front of the hearth what is it she was silent as if she d lost what she was going to say the moment he d answered her call i may i come through you may not he answered tersely severus we need to talk and i d prefer if i didnthave to do it on my knees on the hard floor he made a point of ignoring her request you could come over if you prefer have you eaten dinner why shouldntyou be inquiring about your boyfriend meals please severus we need to talk i ll do it from here if needed he crossed his arms over his chest and hoped he had a bored expression to show her what he felt underneath was anger at her dissimulation all right then have it your way she said i know that you met with william this afternoon and i assuming that you didntlike what you heard from him i was dating him but as of this afternoon i not anymore if you re wondering why i hadnttalked to him before it was because he d only just arrived from a trip this morning you met with him before i had any chance of breaking up with him which i did the moment we met as if he would believe her what a ludicrous excuse she was making up second years could do better than that severus her voice was quieter say something he kept his silence you came looking for me didntyou want to talk to me i was looking for you to end whatever i thought was going on between us i dontsee the point now do you anger had finally found an escape no i see no point whatsoever to ending things between us she answered that not what i want he snorted what you want what is it anyway a lover for your lonely weekends oh for god sake of course not she retorted and then sighed heavily this conversation will take forever please come over her vehemence was still traitorously ringing resonant in his hopeful heart even more so after her renewed invitation for him to go to her if you dontwant to come to my place then at least lift the wards so i can come through she insisted with admirable calm he couldntlet her come closer to him she had always a way of making him go back in time and become a schoolboy full of hopes and insecurities no he was done with being vulnerable around her fine she interrupted his thoughts i get it we ll have this conversation on friday then have a good night severus severus stared at the empty hearth now bright in yellows and reds as a natural fire burned in it she was blissfully gone why didnthe feel good about it then severus started pacing in front of the hearth holding his chest and wondering what was making it ache so much she d said she d ended her fling with the muggle could he believe her would she be his then she not mine she wontever be mine it didntmatter severus heart ached even more she had to know that no muggle was to get into nathan life no man was to call himself her boyfriend no man was to touch and kiss her the way he severus snape did he growled chest sore unable to stop pacing he took a long stride and threw a handful of floo powder on the fire hermione granger apartment he snarled stepping through and almost losing his balance when he was ejected directly into her living room without any barriers to hold him back he looked around and found her on the couch looking intently at him dontyou protect your hearth against intruders now less disoriented and more focused he narrowed his eyes at her or are you expecting someone you she confessed i knew you d come she added visibly holding back a smile i thought it would take you longer to stop being so stubborn though what kind of game is this she sobered this is no game and i thought you knew that why were you at the university earlier anyway i assuming nathan is fine her tone was questioning and slightly worried despite the affirmative of the phrasing yes he fine he assured losing some of the anger with the mention of their son now thinking of it going after her at her workplace had been bound to worry her a terrible idea even for a selfish man like him in his desperation to vanish the horrible scenes his mind was creating he d let his will take hold of his actions making him believe that pushing her from him would help him retake the control over a situation he hadntany control from the moment he d met with her soul severus had taken off with the firm purpose of reminding her of all the fine points that made their relationship corrosive and wrong but he d returned to his quarters consumed by jealousy blind to everything else he looked at her expectant eyes and had to hide behind his hair and turn his back to her facing the bookshelves instead because he knew she d seen the thoughts playing on his face she was still waiting for him to say something i was there to talk about he sighed us she completed for him i cantdo this hermione he told the blue leather bound tome in front of him this had better end here her continued silence weighed uncomfortably on the back of his head he shoved his hands into his pockets not knowing what else to do with himself is that what you want yes he answered quickly clinging desperately to this opportunity of a way out you dontseem very convinced of that she told him if you were really interested in ending things between us you d be spitting hurtful words at my face and not contemplating my books as if they were part of a rare collection he quickly turned to face her at that nathan does exactly the same she offered in a way of justifying herself placating him with a sad smile when i say something i mean it he admonished you dontmean it do you take me for a liar you her attitude irritated him the fact that she was doubting what he doubted himself was beside the point he hated her at this moment for having the upper hand in a conversation meant to be her downfall and not his i just making a point she had the audacity to say you dontwant me out of your life you re just saying that you have no means of knowing what i want he growled dontassume you know me she agreed nodding once i only getting to know you why dontyou tell me what you want then he chuckled sarcastically then all of a sudden the hurtful words he d been so ready to throw at her escaped his mind and all that was left were the questions he d been dying to ask since her return into his life he tried to hold his tongue he truly did but i want to understand you but you re impossible to understand he accused first you go to hell and back to prove that i not a traitor for killing albus then you work with me help me deceive the dark lord are even friendly to me then i rape you severus no i ll finish he growled glaring at her i rape you and you thank me as if i ve done you an enormous favor then you give birth to my child for no reason i can possibly comprehend and then you protect him from me wisely i may add you obviously know i not good for him and then you expect me to believe otherwise i can t his voice faltered how can you actually believe i wontdestroy your lives because i will not because i want to but because it what i do i destroy lives he stopped pacing to look at her just to find her eyes calm expression kind as if he d been lecturing her on the brewing of a boring potion instead of pouring his mind and heart to her you re not listening to me he yelled accusingly yes i am she calmly said i listening to your every word your every worry i want you to know that i was never unaware of your worries your fears i just dontsee why they need to keep us apart it not as if it d all been a sea of roses for any of us up to now of course i have fears and worries too especially because this involves nathan i could never forgive myself if something happened to nathan so i gave this a lot of thought i ve never expected our relationship to be easy or smooth or happily ever after i just cantsee myself happy without you in our lives not a fairy tale kind of happy life because you re not prince charming and i not any helpless princess either but a possible and ordinary happy life of real people severus i just an ordinary woman in love with an impossibly stubborn man who thinks he should be always ready to rescue her in order to be worthy of her love the problem is i not locked defenseless in a tower i dontneed to be rescued by any prince a smirk grew slowly on her lovely lips although you are one he snorted despite of himself she left the couch and stood in front of him i honestly believe we can make this work and you d risk everything on your faith in me alone you re a fool hermione maybe i am but i not the only one am i she ran a hand up his chest and behind his neck pulling his face down to meet hers he bent to her desire and kissed her tenderly he was a far greater fool than she could possibly imagine but at least the ache that had compressed his chest all afternoon was gone we ll find the right pace she assuaged him we ll start slowly and see where it takes us what about the muggle he raised an eyebrow pointedly at her he was never a threat to you before he could argue she added i ended things with him earlier today as i told you what about nathan there was a pause where they both thought about the meaning of their relationship to their son i dontwant him involved he demanded hesitantly she agreed for now she kissed him this time a kiss too short for severus needs should i prepare us dinner now i starving so was severus so he kissed her again deeply until he was startled from his abandon by her satisfied moan and broke the kiss he felt heat rising from his chest and neck telling him that he was blushing she cleared her throat do you like pasta he nodded still embarrassed by his display of complete lack of control good she said more to herself it seemed and left him alone in the living room there brandy and whisky in the cabinet next to the bookshelf if you dontmind serving yourself she called from the kitchen he made little of her offer and followed her from the doorway he asked do you have wine she jumped in surprise betraying her nerves it calmed him somewhat it meant he wasntalone in unknown waters i she stuttered there a bottle in there she pointed to a high cabinet behind her he fetched the wine and two goblets she was dicing mushrooms and he leant on the doorjamb to watch slowly opening the bottle is the dicing to your standards professor i thought you were cooking not brewing the comment made her smile and it illuminated the room it was like the many times he d visited her in soul only as if he d left his old life behind to start anew severus longed to encircle her from behind and burrow his nose in her soft hair while she cooked he finished opening the wine instead resting a goblet for her next to the cutting board and leaning back on the doorjamb with one for himself the only sounds were that of knife hitting wooden board and his heart beating loudly in his ears he wished there would be music playing like it usually did when she was alone in the kitchen she could be humming and swinging her curvy body to the rhythm severus took a long sip from his wine and tried to keep himself from acting on the memory or having an anxiety attack do you like it hot i beg your pardon do you like chili in the sauce she rephrased the question showing him a red chili pepper yes he would need a cold shower after this evening anyway she worked with the pans while he watched what she was offering him a new life a chance to be himself after the many years he d lost it had no precedents he took another long sip of wine and thought of what was to come of them having dinner like he d seen her doing with her muggle boyfriend more wine i should go back to hogwarts he put his goblet on the counter she stopped what she d been doing to look carefully at him her eyes impossible to decipher he was paralyzed by them until she looked back down at the pan what is still bothering you hermione he watched her stir furiously it was hypnotic she stopped he looked up from her hands to her face i stay for dinner she went back to work and he stayed silently watching her he only moved to follow her to the table joining her for the meal it not as if we didntdo this every saturday she commented risking a smile his way where nathan then he asked this was completely different and she knew it she sighed severus i know what you re trying to do i trying to have dinner with you it as simple as that you re obviously thinking i have some mysterious plot going on behind your back though she looked straight into his eyes i don t she started serving him and then herself when she took the first bite he followed suit it seemed that the meal was going to pass by in absolute silence but when he was almost finished hermione put the silverware down and sighed heavily i sorry she apologized i thought we d have come to an understanding i didntmean to push you she closed her eyes after a moment your silence is killing me his tongue was tied severus was hurting her already with his inability to act like a normal man would he did the first thing his mind provided when it came to comfort he covered her hand with his her tension melted from her shoulders and it was like a calming draught to him thank you for inviting me for dinner the pasta was tasty she laughed turning her hand palm up into his you re welcome thank you for staying he asked her about living in a muggle neighborhood she told him about her neighbors and muggle friends he asked about nathan muggle friends she told him how nathan had enjoyed going to school with the boy next door his best friend for years he asked her how she d become a chemistry professor she told him about her days in the university as an undergraduate about choosing to become a researcher and later a professor all the while playing with his hand and fingers he could have stayed there forever learning about her life and every move her hand could make the conversation went on he focused on her keeping the questions going whatever piqued his interest he held to hoping she would never tire of answering with her enthusiasm and the caress of her fingers what happened when they found out she d stolen your ideas they cut her from the program after a pause she added i feel i boring you to death with all these grand facts of my life before he could say otherwise she let his hand go and look at the time he did it was almost midnight she d let his hand go and now she was leaving the table he stood as well she took their dishes to the kitchen he stepped out of the way what was he supposed to do now leave wait help she came back and stopped in front of him i had a great time she took both of his hands in hers thank you for giving us a chance he kissed her soft lips and then kissed them again and again until those lovely lips held his just as her hands were doing heaven it d been the longest he d kissed a woman and he could have continued all night long if she hadntstepped back and pulled him to the hearth you d better go it late she called for his quarters at hogwarts and the green illuminated her face he kissed her again she pushed him away smiling go i ll see you on friday he managed to steal one last kiss before the floo network took him away from her and the soft sound of her laugher o0ooo0o dear aunt ginny thank you for the toffees you sent me last week i almost sure they came from your brother shop right send me more anytime you want to andy loved them too i was wondering if you could help me with some history of magic homework i need a pin like piece with the symbol i sending with the letter engraved on it it just like a family insignia if you ve heard of them i d make one myself but i haventlearned the spells yet i tried but there always something missing on the symbol or it fades within a few minutes i hope you can help me tell lily that i preparing a reply for her last letter it should be ready by tomorrow love nathan granger o0ooo0o hermione eagerness abated when she entered the great hall and saw that both seats next to severus were already taken the closest she could get to him for dinner was three seats away on remus left good evening hermione he greeted her how was your week it was great thank you how are classes and gryffindor house she fell into mundane conversation with her long time friend while she tried to have at least a glimpse of severus from time to time trying to catch his eye and somehow communicate the students are remus was saying but stopped mid sentence to look over his shoulders how are things between you what i sorry you were saying severus i ve noticed how better behaved he seems around nathan as of late and likewise but how is he treating you he been polite hermione said managing to keep the feel of severus lips and hands on her skin to herself we still argue but i suppose there no way of getting anything from him without arguing first right remus hummed and looked at her with eyes that she found a little too inquisitive for her liking and how harry these days the abrupt change in subject caught her by surprise and made her even more uncomfortable i haventseen him in a while maybe you ll have the opportunity to catch up he ll be my substitute for the coming full moon hermione tried to keep her attention on remus from then on looking past him to severus only when they were between topics their eyes met a few times but severus was much more discreet than hermione and it was hard to tell if he d noticed her attention or not she went straight to the dungeons after dinner there was no light coming from under his office door and there wasntany light showing on his quarters either frowning she made the way back to the entrance hall noticing then the light illuminating the stone floor in front of the potions classroom she knocked enter he invited making hermione smile she pushed the door open and found him inside but he wasntalone three boys and a girl probably third years were engaged in different tasks while he sat by his desk all eyes were now on her back to work he growled low and the students obeyed with commiseration he left the desk to meet her by the door i sorry to interrupt she apologized was there something you needed he asked politely nothing that cantwait she lied on the inside her need for his touch and company was ever more urgent enhanced by the sound of his voice and the sight of him an arm length from her my evening is lost on these dunderheads he told her loudly clearly to be heard by the students if it can wait until tomorrow he added his face conveying an apology tomorrow of course have a good night severus he nodded and snapped at one of the boys on his way back to his desk hermione left before she could make things even worse for the poor students in detention she waited up in her quarters until she realized he wouldntbe coming as she d hoped she slept and dreamed of him unaware of what that meant she was again unable to sit beside him on breakfast and before she could head for the dungeons to meet him properly nathan came to her hi mom are you going to dad lab yes are you coming along his smile answered her and she resigned herself to another morning without severus touch it helped that the brewing process held her mind away from thoughts of him unable to reach the great hall for lunch she sent nathan off when he came back telling her that he d asked the house elves to bring them sandwiches she insisted that he should head to the great hall for a proper lunch but i want to be here to add the alihotsy leaves he argued you want to be here to see me handle the devil snare roots i ve already told you that it too dangerous but mom i not asking to cut them just to see you cutting them he whined again hermione only held a hand up asking for silence with the gesture she counted the last twenty clockwise turns of the stirring rod watching the potion reach the perfect color is it milky white nathan asked approaching the cauldron to look inside hermione was going to continue where she d left on her argumentation when her eyes caught sight of the man by the door who ordered this severus asked a tray of sandwiches in his hands i did nathan went to him and tried to take the tray where do you think you re taking this severus asked raising an eyebrow and not letting go of the tray sandwiches are not ingredients for this potion or are they no they re not nathan answered chagrined take them outside severus ordered but he held the tray again when nathan tried to take it why arentyou eating in the great hall to begin with we were discussing exactly that hermione pointed out mom nathan tried to argue it probably too late for that now severus said take the tray to the office and next time do as your mother says yes sir nathan left the lab thank you hermione was finally alone with severus he inclined his head to acknowledge her thanks and kept his eyes on hers the way he was looking at her the possibilities implied by that look was giving her a trill she struggled to look away back to the cauldron she couldntafford to be distracted at this moment in the brewing the potion needed stirring now she put her hands to the task stir every five minutes alternate start clockwise seven times twenty stirs he seemed to be reading from her notes she made the last turn anti clockwise and took the stirring rod carefully out of the potion i ll take over from here you go eat with nathan how many cycles to go five but lunch can wait i thank you anyway he invaded her personal space pinning her in place with his powerful eyes he slid the rod from her hand as if it were a caress i believe the sandwiches are in the office he muttered close to her ear he stepped back making her sway a little at his departure she opened the eyes closed by the power of his voice washing over her the smirk on his face told her he knew exactly what he d just done it scared her i believe i ll wait until the potion is past this stage she extended her hand asking for the stirring rod back he lost the smirk as intended go eat something and let me attend to the cauldron she didnthave time to argue so reluctantly she gave him access to the potion in a few seconds he started the third cycle of stirs she only just noticed she d been counting them when he said i know how to stir a potion i also know how to count to twenty he stopped precisely on twenty and carefully lifted the utensil from the potion i assure you that i also know how to wait for exactly five minutes before resuming the task the color is i know go have lunch hermione i wontruin your potion of course he wouldn t hermione left the lab discomfited and met nathan eating quietly in the office is dad taking care of the potion yes she took a seat reaching for a sandwich and thinking about what had just transpired between severus and her he d manipulated her played with her senses and she d responded he d been hermione sighed he d been just trying to be helpful and she d offended him with her overzealous nature of tending to her work no one would know how to take better care of a potion than severus and she d unconsciously offended him by doubting that do you think he would mind me getting back in the lab of course not honey have you eaten already yes do you want me to wait for you no go ahead dontinterrupt him if he counting stirs she advised him minutes later when she entered the lab again she found severus in the middle of the last cycle of stirs and nathan watching with attention she approached them when he lifted the stirring rod before she could say anything he offered the utensil and said it all yours he left the room in quick strides and left her thinking on how she could compensate for her lack of tact o0ooo0o severus was distant during dinner responding little even to nathan chattering by the end of it hermione felt so bad about what had happened earlier that she made nathan wait outside when they were saying their good nights i sorry for what i did in the lab it getting late he reminded her i dontwant to leave without making sure you understand i was taken by surprise the way you distracted me with your presence is terrifying i sorry i reacted badly i dontknow what got into me i nathan is waiting i dontwant to go she confessed not wanting to leave before she was sure he d accepted her apology his indefinable expression held hermione nerves like strings on a puppet i ll walk with you he said and held the door open for her to precede him into the dungeon corridor dad i walking you tonight severus simply said they saw nathan past the fat lady portrait and hermione immediately took his hand severus not here he mumbled looking around my quarters then she offered he started walking taking hermione by the hand making her relax minutely by her door he waited for her to provide them entrance and once inside hermione couldnthold her anxiety anymore i didnthave the opportunity to thank you for helping me in the lab his hand warmed one side of her face enough of that his lips met hers and hermione almost fell from relief she held onto his neck pressing her body to his thank you she combed his hair away from his face caressing him with hands and eyes do what you did to me in the lab she requested make me senseless her hands came down to his neck and chest rounding his arms from under his outer robes and reaching his back you give me too much credit he mumbled in her ear his voice entering her brain and melting it she gave him a silly smile before kissing him again you almost made me send the potion to hell so i could stay just like this holding and kissing you all day long less talking he covered her mouth with his to demonstrate how she lost herself in him feeling hands and using them to touch unexplored places until the busy silence was becoming gasping delight maybe it was time to restart the talking severus she tried touching her nose to his neck keeping her mouth out of reach he pulled her hair from her face leaving a shivery path where his thumb stroked i thirsty stepping out of his embrace she offered would you like a glass of water maybe i should go no hermione reacted i mean stay she went for his hand and pulled him to the couch stay and tell me about your week what have you done since i last saw you on wednesday he looked at her while she filled two glasses with water you want to chit chat we cantpretend we ve only just met why cantwe because my memories of you wontspontaneously disappear from my mind well technically i could erase them but you understood what i mean we ve known each other for longer than a couple of days the circumstances are different we re different he raised an eyebrow to disagree she offered him a glass of water which he accepted are you trying to tell me that you haventchanged at all in the last ten years she took a seat next to him to wait for his answer do you sincerely believe i not the man you met when you arrived at hogwarts from the look on his face hermione could tell that he was deadly serious about the question i not the girl you met twenty years ago as much as i sure you re no longer the man i met when i was that girl boys and girls often change men and women though there a certain point in life where the deeds cantbe undone and life will follow as a series of consequences mine was always an out of control train killing and harming everything that ever tried to change its course she thought his words over you might be right but there are no buts but she went on we re always offered new paths to choose from and even if they dontseem all that different from one another we still have the choice to change you did that i did that we ve changed even if i agree that we re different people our past will always be the base for who we are now if you hadntbeen potter minion you wouldnthave become the woman you are today and who would that be completely insane entirely too trusting overzealous on behalf of others but not yourself an overachiever she was smiling at him how flattering he made a mocking bow and who are you she asked without thinking much of it and belatedly realized how much she was asking he averted his eyes before the silence chilled them hermione moved closer and took his hands in hers may i he didntgive her permission but he didntforbid her either i dontclaim to know you as well as i long to she smiled trying to warm him and his cold hands you re different from the man i met during the war before you interrupt me i ll let you know that you re still as forbidding unfair deliberately cruel and brilliant as ever but back then you seemed somehow incomplete i dontknow what was missing but after these past crazy months i dontthink it missing anymore maybe it because we ve spent more time together or it was just the impression you left on me when you were under such severe stress during the war i not sure i do like this version of you better though my turn i forbidding unfair deliberately cruel and brilliant she laughed and what else he inverted the hold she had on his hands and looked intently at them nathan changed me he admitted the mention of their son in such an important way made her heart expand he completes me too she freed one hand to clear his eyes by placing his hair behind his ear you and nathan do she kissed him tenderly and cuddled to his side he welcomed her into a one arm hug pulling her to him she ended up dozing off that way taking the heat of his body for blanket and his heartbeat as a perfect lullaby hermione hm wake up she tried to obey his voice rubbing her face on his chest it was so nice no she told him if she woke up now the dream of him would disappear and she would miss him so badly hermione she opened her heavy eyelids and smiled sleepily when he didntdisappear i awake he pushed her hair aside and placed brief kisses on her lips and forehead go to bed he helped her stand i ll see you in the morning she walked with him to the door and held him by the hand before he could leave i miss you already he kissed her and left disappearing into the darkness of the corridor o0ooo0o there was the usual commotion in the great hall when harry potter came in with headmistress mcgonagall nathan smiled and waved at his godfather who waved back on his way to the head table i love it when harry potter fills in for professor lupin kevin commented so do i nathan agreed he couldntwipe the smile from his face on her letter aunt ginny had told him that his godfather would bring his prince family insignia it had finally arrived after the morning classes nathan stopped by the defense classroom where he found his godfather fixing some duel dummies he knocked on the opened door harry looked up nathan his godfather smiled beckoning him come in i almost done here he fixed another dummy where are your friends i told them i was making a stop before heading for lunch and i think they thought i meant the library harry laughed a true granger nathan smiled at what he took as a compliment i ll just lock the office and we can meet them downstairs has aunt ginny sent something for me nathan was too anxious to wait yes in fact she has i had almost forgotten it in the office i ll be right back harry came back with a little box here you have it nathan opened it right away and was amazed by the beauty of the work aunt ginny is really good with transfiguration he commented what is it harry approached to look a brooch he looked puzzled at nathan arentyou too young to be going after girls girls now it was nathan who was puzzled oh no this is not for a girl it s nathan almost told his godfather what the insignia truly was it for a history of magic assignment ah i see and what does it mean it a really old wizarding tradition i read a book that dated the existence of it back to merlin era merlin really harry circled an arm around him and pulled nathan out of the classroom with him all very fascinating i sure but we d better get going if we want to get to lunch before the food is over nathan smiled satisfied his prince family insignia was perfect and he had it right in time to wear it for tea with his father this afternoon o0ooo0o nathan entered the potion master office gryffindor robes adorned with a traditionally slytherin pin hello dad good afternoon nathan i finishing these essays but we ll go to my quarters soon take a seat what are the essays about salad it seems it ll never stop to amaze me how stupidly creative some dunderheads can be when asked to research chinese chomping cabbage his father answered what in merlin name is a bok choy it a chinese dish with cabbage snape raised his eyes from the essay to look at nathan surprised i like chinese food he shrugged smiling suddenly his father eyes went from inquisitive to scared as if he d seen a ghost what that on your robes he asked nathan urgently letting go of the quill and getting on his feet it a prince family insignia nathan smiled happy that his plan of surprising his father was working so well it just like yours did you like it take it off what take it off nathan stared at his father in disbelief why i have all now nathan he obeyed taking the pin off without knowing why something he d prepared as a pleasant surprise could have incited a totally opposite reaction on his dad give it here nathan did his hand slightly shaky where did you find this who gave this to you i it was who came the angry voice of his father only now louder uncle harry brought it the man was out the door before nathan could even start explaining he went after the man trying to keep up with him as they climbed the main stairs dad he called trying to make him stop dad when they reached the right floor nathan took off running ahead of his father nathan go back to my office nathan ignored the order and kept running uncle harry uncle harry he called trying to warn his godfather of his father ire uncle harry harry finally appeared on the corridor nathan run uncle harry inside nathan pushed his godfather back into the office and had to make a pause to breathe use the floo he took another deep breath he coming after you who what going on my dad run nathan i think i told you to go back to my office oh no it too late nathan lamented what the meaning of this snape dad uncle harry only brought the prince insignia to me he didn t stay out of this nathan his father dismissed addressing harry he accused are you trying to corrupt my son to put him against me i have no idea what you re talking about but i dontlike your tone snape nor the way you re talking to my godson dad please he has nothing that you could never forget the half blood prince fiasco is one thing but to use my son to get your little revenge on me was somewhat unexpected even for you potter snape wand made its way to his hand so did harry s nathan eyes went wide it all happened too fast at once his godfather cried drop the wand snape his father flicked his wand incendio the pin bearing the prince insignia fell to the stone floor like a piece of wood burning with angry flames nathan gasped watching wide eyed to the destruction of what he d worked weeks to prepare with the help of aunt ginny as a surprise for his father dontmess with my son again potter the snarled voice of his father warned or next you ll be the one burning let go nathan harry placed himself in front of nathan protectively he not going anywhere with you snape what was that what did you burn the prince family insignia nathan found his voice his eyes fixed on where the pin had burned to ashes silence rough and heavy fell over them both men suspended by nathan quiet words i dontunderstand he looked up at his father a tear running down his face you destroyed it but i you re not a prince his father told him vehemently potter used you to get to me and for that he ll pay you ll never be one of them you ll never be a prince mind reeling nathan gave little notice to his father explanations i asked aunt ginny to make it for me it was supposed to be a surprise for you a good one nathan still didntknow where his plan had gone wrong he looked at where the insignia had burned again i sure it was just like the one you wore at malfoy manor it was the prince insignia i sure of that you took him to malfoy manor harry asked snape and was ignored nathan looked back at his father you re a prince i canthave been wrong about that what are you trying to say that you had the insignia done that this was your idea and not potter s his father started towards him stay where you are snape harry warned snape wandlessly disarmed harry shut up potter stopping in front of nathan he asked why did you do this i another tear overflowed from his eyes but his dad put it away before it ran down his already damp face i just wanted to be part of your family nathan confessed realizing what had been his real reason behind wanting to wear the insignia his father shook his head they dontdeserve you you re not like them and if it within my power to keep things this way i will nathan couldntprevent the hurt from showing on his face no no this doesntmean you re not my son my only family you re a granger and you can be a snape if you want to but you re in no way anything like those despicable princes nathan shook his head still not believing this could have gone so wrong he d done his research he hadnteven thought his father could react so badly to a insignia he wore supposedly with pride nathan bit his bottom lip to hold a sob be useful potter get us some tea the boy needs tea he was being guided to a chair by strong hands and it angered him i dontneed any tea nathan shrugged the hands off stop treating me as if i were a baby son i didntmean to scare you i not scared he countered of course you re not the man agreed lower you re angry nathan couldntdeny that with the same vehemence so he chose to let the comment go without response i cantlet you wear an insignia of murderers and muggle haters believe me when i tell you that there no glory in the prince name nathan you re not like them and i dontwant you to even think about it again do you understand they invented the chocolate frog they were famous potioneers why it not worth it nathan wasntconvinced if it such a bad thing to be a prince why do you use their insignia i his father hesitated looking at harry we re going back to the dungeons to finish this conversation there the man pulled him by the arm nathan shrugged it off again i want to know dad snape closed his eyes i unlike you son am one of them this doesntmake any sense nathan argued and pain made its way back into his face i not a good man he made to take nathan arm again but returned his hand to his side come with me please why do you think you re not a good man nathan please you re always looking after me even before we knew you were my dad even when i do something wrong mom told me about how you ve always protected her and uncle harry realizing where they were and who was there with them nathan directed the question to his godfather isntit true uncle harry didntmy dad protect you all yes he did harry answered eyeing snape strangely his father sighed i dontknow what you ve heard about me all these years but the truth is not pleasant what truth do you hate muggles i have nothing against muggles are you a murderer the man pinched the bridge of his nose as he tried to formulate his response when the unlikeliest thing happened no he not harry potter answered he one of the heroes like your mother and i stay out of this potter he a moody and cruel hero but a hero nonetheless so he shouldntwear the prince insignia if it meant for murderers nathan reasoned with his godfather for merlin sake i your father not him he has no say about any of this if you continue to wear the prince insignia i ll have to wear one too nathan explained i forbid you it how it works tradition dictates that i can only wear the insignia of my ancestry you give me no choice but to wear the prince insignia donttry me on this nathan your impertinence wontbe tolerated on this matter i believe we have an impasse harry interrupted when nathan had his answer ready to deliver potter we ll think better over tea harry kept saying i ll have a tray delivered would you like some biscuits nathan yes please so it perfectly fine if he offers tea his father mumbled following them to the armchairs tea was served biscuits were eaten and the silence was loud we still have an impasse to settle what do you suggest we do about it nathan harry inquired nathan looked at his father eyeing harry with clear anger i suggest my dad stops wearing the prince insignia then directly at him nathan added you re not a murderer dad and you re not a muggle hater either you re a hero severus potter his father snapped when nathan thought that would be his father only word that he would never agree he gritted out an annoyed fine nathan smiled thank you a n severus is trying he truly is it just that it so difficult for him poor man at least hermione and nathan know him a little better and can see through his insecurities 0 coming next the end of nathan first year and the start of severus family life disclaimer not mine it all j k rowling s warning this story takes place in the future and contains hbp spoilers be warned beta reader snarkyroxy thank you very much a n fourth chapter wow 0 today classes include potions and dada let see what kind of student nathan is chapter 4 the first classes nathan after taking a wrong turn in the corridor leading back from the owlery entered the great hall late for breakfast he spotted his friends and went to take a seat by them failing to notice a pair of dark eyes observing his every move hey nathan where were you you re late asked kevin the moment he joined them i went to the owlery to send a letter to my mum and got a little lost how did you find the owlery asked josephina a fellow first year with long black hair and green eyes oh i asked some third year boy he answered i cantremember his name he served himself some eggs and buttered a piece of toast can you pass me the juice please he asked kevin and thanked the boy before serving himself a goblet they chatted animatedly for a while before professor lupin their head of house and defense against the dark arts teacher approached with their timetables here you go nathan he said handing him the parchment thank you professor nathan said with a smile he had heard many stories about remus lupin when he was younger he knew the teacher was a werewolf and a good friend of harry he was also a war hero for his role in the order of the phoenix fighting against voldemort nathan had met lupin once before when he visited harry on his godfather birthday their first class was double potions and soon the conversation around him turned to professor snape i heard he is really nasty with gryffindors a girl commented my brother said he killed a student because he exploded a cauldron in class he was a death eater you know added another girl and all the students listening widened their eyes save for one nathan who started laughing a third year who was listening as well stared at nathan in disbelief do you think it funny he asked in a reprimanding voice i dontknow about the student that exploded a cauldron but he definitely killed the previous headmaster oh i know that nathan assured them and nonchalantly returned to his breakfast when he felt the students still staring at him in disbelief he raised an eyebrow and asked what what repeated kevin you knew we d be having classes with a murderer and you think it funny well he not really a murderer nathan said that i dontknow but i really dontwant to be late for his class have you finished nathan said andy getting up from his seat at the table quite was nathan answer shoving a last piece of buttered toast in his mouth and getting up from his seat as well the group headed to the dungeons where the potions classes were held they entered the classroom and found some slytherins already there they took their seats and waited minutes later professor snape entered the classroom and the door banged loudly making some students jump in their seats with his black robes billowing after him he went to the desk at the front of the room and took his seat behind it without a glance at the students he started taking the roll call pausing when he read nathan name to look at the boy and also at malfoy s for the same reason snape finished calling the names and finally looked up at the whole class you re here to learn the subtle science and exact art of potion making he began i have lost my hope after thirty years of classes filled with dunderheads that any one student let alone an entire class will understand the beauty of a simmering cauldron and the magic lying within the silence was absolute in the room after he finished his speech not a student had taken their eyes off the potions master and they followed him as he left his table and started walking between the desks granger he said suddenly what the difference between doxy eggs and biting fairy eggs none sir doxies and biting fairies are the same creature they can be found in magical forests and their bite is mildly venomous their eggs are ingredients for the antidote nathan explained to an astonished class the only one that seemed unimpressed with the answer was professor snape so you are an insufferable know it all just like your mother he commented can i presume that you ve already read the textbook from cover to cover twice sir the brat he thought then smirked and said aloud well then i must warn you that despite all the knowledge you memorized from the book it wontbe enough for your success in my class mr granger nathan smiled at him and answered calmly i know sir snape narrowed his eyes at the smiling boy in front of him what wrong with this brat he thought and then addressed the class in general open your books to page sixteen and prepare to brew the potion i want a phial with a sample of the disasters you create on my desk at the end of this class he gave then some information on the anti boils potion they were to make as they proceeded to prepare ingredients adding them one by one to their cauldrons snape swept around the classroom watching every move terrorizing every student with his dark stern presence he criticized everyone even the slytherins but took points only from gryffindors the only one that seems to be enjoying the class was nathan much to snape annoyance he stopped behind the gryffindor and stayed there for longer than he did the others not a flinch not a trembling hand not a hesitation when he cleared his throat just smiles and giggles he giggling snape couldntavoid the frown that creased his forehead in disgust how dare he is there something amusing about your potion mr granger he snarled no sir so were you laughing at me then he said softly in a most dangerous tone of voice oh oh he had to think fast never sir i was just remembering something funny and he managed before being interrupted five points from gryffindor for lack of attention in brewing mr granger snape hissed before the boy could finish his excuse and the rest of you back to work snape snapped at the others who had stopped to listen to the exchange the class was extremely quiet after that nobody else wanted to attract the wrath of the potions master they turned in their phials at the end of the lesson and left the dungeons as quickly as possible except nathan who took his time collecting his things snape stared at the back of the finally retreating gryffindor with an unreadable expression on his face in the halls the first years were talking about their impressions of their first potions class whilst heading for the defense classroom the man is a terrorist said andy he keeps prowling around like a beast ready to swoop in and attack he creepy added josephina quietly that was when nathan caught up with them kevin looked at him curiously what were you laughing about anyway he asked nothing really i was actually remembering something funny my mother had said to me once nathan answered and couldntsuppress smirking with the thought you re strange sometimes admitted kevin the truth was nathan had been laughing at snape or more accurately at what his mother had once told him about snape the potions master did everything she said he would do asked a difficult question reprimanded nathan for knowing the answer and hovered about trying to intimidate and confuse him becoming angry when he was unable to do so it was too much not to laugh he did enjoy the lesson though potion making was one of the few magical things his mother had taught him and he loved brewing healing concoctions with her everything professor snape had said was fascinating some wrong corridors and stairs later the group reached the defense classroom just in time for the beginning of the lesson professor lupin was already at the front of the room waiting for the last students to take their seats the professor waved his wand and his named appeared on the blackboard then he said good morning class i professor lupin and i ll be teaching defense against the dark arts moving to the front of his desk professor lupin proceeded we should begin with what considered dark arts and what not who can tell me the name of a dark curse since the fall of voldemort more than a decade ago the dark arts were not a subject of hall conversation and few knew about dark curses anymore so no one volunteered an answer then professor lupin called nathan the cruciatus curse sir he provided correct five points to gryffindor said lupin and then asked of him why is this a dark curse nathan it one of the three unforgivables it targets the nervous system of the victim causing severe pain and ultimately irreversible brain damage it also demands the caster to really desire to cause the pain he finished very good nathan five more points to gryffindor the feeling behind the curse is what makes it dark arts it demands something of the caster he explained does anyone else know of another one devon malfoy was now eyeing nathan with mild interest he didntthink the boy would know anything about the dark arts his father had taught him some of it and he too knew all about the unforgivables devon lifted his hand yes devon said lupin the imperius curse sir he said and added without waiting to be asked and it also one of the unforgivables correct five points to slytherin said lupin the imperius curse is used to command the victim to do anything asked by the caster the last unforgivable since we re talking about them is the killing curse the first two curses mentioned can be countered but not the killing curse he added a hand flipped into the air and professor lupin addressed the owner yes josephina if the killing curse cantbe countered how did harry potter survive you know who attack she asked well harry potter was protected by his mother love because she died to save him it was a very special occurrence he answered they continue to discuss what was and what was not considered dark arts and soon the lesson was over they bid farewell to professor lupin and headed to the great hall for lunch at the gryffindor table the first years sat together and talked about the classes they had been to so far how do you know all the answers to the teachers questions urged kevin serving himself a sandwich from a large platter yeah and where did you learn all those things about dark curses added andy oh it nothing really i must have read about it in a book or something he said dismissively but then stopped and added no i think my mum told me about the curses or uncle harry did i cantrecall oh of course you were raised by heroes mocked andy what about that slytherin malfoy asked adam a muggle born fellow first year he knew a lot about the dark arts too well his family is known for their involvement with the dark arts said andy they re a very traditional wizarding family purebloods if everybody knows they perform dark arts why dontthey arrest them adam asked because nobody could ever prove it nathan said but there nothing wrong with knowing about dark arts as long as you dontuse it i dontthink malfoy would have ever cast a dark curse he added they finished their meal and left the castle for greenhouse one where they would have their first herbology lesson the afternoon classes were all exciting except for history of magic though the subject was interesting its ghost teacher professor binns was really boring after dinner nathan and the other boys headed to the common room where they sat in chairs near the fireplace some boys were playing wizard chess while others were playing exploding snap and some were having quiet conversations after a while and with heavy eyes nathan bid goodnight to his friends and climbed the spiral staircase towards his dormitory he changed into his pajamas lay down on his bed and was asleep in no time his first day of classes had been both exciting and tiring and the first of many others that were yet to come for he had seven years ahead of him before his graduation day a n i hope you liked the classes nathan sure did but i not so sure about snape 0 i want to hear from you devoted readers please read and review 0 answers to the reviews from chapter 3 can be found on my lj check the link on my profile coming next hermione receives a letter and nathan has some work to do in the library but got stuck with uncalled company disclaimer not mine it all j k rowling s warning this story takes place in the future and contains hbp spoilers be warned beta reader snarkyroxy thank you very much a n chapter five people 0 some letters exchanged between mother and son and some distracting incidents in the library chapter 5 incident in the library the first saturday morning after nathan departure to hogwarts saw an anxious hermione pacing the living room of her apartment they had agreed he would send a letter every weekend and she couldntavoid the anticipation she was feeling where the owl where is it she thought as she paced the room thoughts of what could have happened during this whole week her son had spent in hogwarts haunted her is he okay is he adapting to the wizarding world has he made friends already are they good friends at that thought she remembered the malfoy boy and sat on the couch frowning slightly i hope he is being careful around malfoy like i told him to then she shuddered as her real concerns surfaced from her inner thoughts she closed her eyes and sighed what does severus think of nathan does he notice him at all is he treating him like he did me when i was a first year she mused i hope they donthate each other she voiced to the room and then rose from the couch as a brown owl appeared flapping its wings as it landed near her she fretfully took the letter from the bird and went to a chair near the window ignoring the owl much to its annoyance she tore open the envelope and took the parchment folded inside dear mum my first week at hogwarts has been amazing the other gryffindors are great friends especially kevin and andy the teachers are very good and i love the magical classes i ve already used my wand in charms and it really worked it seems that it was really a good choice for me we got to levitate a feather and i was the first one to do it professor flitwick said i a natural and gave me house points i think i really good at charms the pretentious little prat she thought with a smile in her face she was proud of her son success with charms she continued reading but my favorite subject is potions we had to brew a remedy for boils on our own it was the best class of the week even though professor snape took house points from me for lack of attention when brewing she frowned so he being his old nasty self will he ever change she asked mentally and went back to the letter i was paying attention i swear he was hovering behind me and i was just trying not to laugh at his attempts to make me hesitate on the ingredients i was adding just like you said he would i think he heard me and asked if i thought the potion was funny i said i was laughing at something i remembered just then but he took the points anyway her mouth dropped open after those words nathan was laughing at him oh my god that must have infuriated him she thought then with a smirk added out loud serves him right for attempting to misguide nathan he really nasty with the students but i liked his class the most the other students were really afraid of him even before the first class they were all talking about how he was a death eater and saying that he had killed the other headmaster but i not afraid of him you told what he did and why and i believe you a notch of pity caught in her stomach poor severus people wontever understand all the things he had to do and the decisions he had to make she thought sighing hermione was well aware of the kind of things he had to do and the decisions severus had to make during his life one such difficult decision had saved her life once and she respected him for his courage and strength i must remember to tell nathan how brave severus was during the war he might be able to change the others opinion of their teacher besides that i learned how to change a match into a needle in transfiguration about dark curses in defense about soil properties in herbology about constellations in astronomy and about goblin revolts in history professor binns is the worst teacher but the others are all pretty cool it getting late and i think i should sleep now i ll have to wake up really early tomorrow to send you this letter i know you ll be expecting it first thing in the morning i hope you re fine at home i miss you very much and i know you miss me too i dontwant you to be sad so find something to do during the weekends go visit uncle harry love you nathan love you too son she said in a soft whisper fighting back tears she really missed him she sighed and folded the letter at least he didntmention malfoy she thought as she left for her study to find some paper and pen to write back her son after lunch nathan left for the library in search of some references to add to his potions assignment the other boys went to the grounds to play in the sun but nathan preferred to finish his essay first and play later he took his school work very seriously something he had learned from his mother entering the library he quickly searched for an unoccupied table at the back of the room he didntlike noise when he studied he placed his book bag on the table and headed for the potions section but never reached it a noise coming from the end of a dark aisle between two shelves distracted him he heard a shriek ignoring a sound like that was against his inquisitive nature so he followed it carefully so as not to alert anyone lurking there of his presence he found three boys in slytherin uniforms threatening a hufflepuff first year he approached the boys and recognized one of the slytherins as the boy from the book shop malfoy despite his attempt at discretion they heard his footsteps and turned to see who was there having been discovered nathan squared his shoulders in a defiant pose what are you doing leave him alone nathan demanded mind your own business gryffindor and tell anyone what you saw and you re next threatened one of them the two boys accompanying malfoy were older than nathan probably third years nathan couldntleave them to beat the boy though he moved closer to the group and held his thirteen inch ash with dragon heartstring core wand at the ready malfoy saw it and took his wand in his right hand as well what are you going to do granger i not a feather you can levitate malfoy said with a smirk shut up malfoy he spat and then he looked to the older slytherins leave the boy alone or you ll see what else i can do with my wand besides levitate feathers he said in the most dangerous voice he could muster followed by a smirk of his own he didntknow any useful hexes for a duel but he wasntgoing to back down now he wasnta person to take threats lightly but before any hex could escape a wand a tall dark figure appeared behind nathan i dontbelieve it prudent to hex other students in the library mr granger professor snape said in a cold voice explain what going on here by that time devon had already hidden his wand up the sleeve of his robe and with an innocent face he said he was threatening to hex us sir one of the other slytherins added we were just helping this boy he was threatening to beat nathan was outraged with the accusation how could they he thought glaring at the slytherins i was not he bellowed they were threatening the boy when i came in professor they re lying are you denying you had your wand out to hex them then mr granger asked professor snape no i not i was trying to make then leave that boy alone he said between gritted teeth well that will cost you ten points from gryffindor and a detention mr granger to be served with me on wednesday after dinner is that clear professor snape said in a deadly voice he seemed to be enjoying having a go at the impertinent gryffindor but sir he tried to argue speak another word and i ll make it twenty points and a weeks worth of detention hissed the professor nathan knew it was a lost battle and didnttry to argue the point with the potions master his mother was very clear on this aspect of the dreaded professor nathan nodded acceptance and asked can i go now sir i have to finish my homework you may was all the response he got thank you sir he said and he left the aisle between the shelves glaring at the other boys when he finally got to the potions section he searched the shelves for books he could use for his essay muttering to himself under his breath why did professor snape believe them was it because they were slytherins it cantbe he mused slightly shaking his head in denial disappointed with the potions master professor snape wouldntbelieve them just because they re slytherins and i not would he he thought gravely while searching through the tomes on the shelves well it was their word against mine after all and professor snape is an honorable man he pondered aloud and they were three and i was alone this train of thoughts relaxed him a little until he remembered his detention and sighed gravely i already have a detention and it just my first week what mum going to say about that he thought saddened mum will kill me he admitted aloud and then left for the table where his book bag was carrying three books with him professor snape had taken care of the situation dismissing the slytherins and sending the hufflepuff to his common room he was taking himself out of the library when he heard someone murmuring his name near the potions section it was the granger boy he stood behind the bookshelf across from the one where nathan was standing to watch the boy nathan was perusing the shelves with a scowl on his face talking to himself professor snape wouldntbelieve them just because they re slytherins and i not would he yes i would he admitted mentally with a smirk in his face but the smirk slowly melted into a surprised expression with the boy next words well it was their word against mine after all and professor snape is an honorable man what i an honorable man not the greasy git bastard not the dangerous death eater not the cold blooded murderer he was at a loss for what to think where did this boy get these ideas from he thought then and his answer came with the next words he heard mum will kill me miss granger he realized and the ever present frown was back on his sallow face snape watched the boy walk back to his table with some books then he left the library and headed towards the dungeons he hated remembering that nauseating gryffindor golden trio and especially miss granger he hated what he had to do with her back in the war it was one more thing his conscience tortured him with the pain was even harder to endure now that he realized what she told her son about him honorable man miss granger he chuckled without mirth at the thought very honorable indeed he added sarcastically to no one in particular the rest of the day went uneventfully back in the great hall nathan met his friends for dinner so how was your day at the library i believe all the fresh air and sun did you good joked kevin nathan chuckled at the joke you can make fun all right just dontcome to me with your sad excuses for essays tomorrow night i wonthelp you he said i didntsay anything nathan said andy you ll help me right i ll think about it he answered nathan served himself some mashed potato and roast beef the others were serving themselves as well when a group of slytherins passed by their seats shrieking in mock derision pointing at nathan it wasntme professor they were threatening the boy professor they re lying professor they left for their table laughing what was that all about asked kevin eying the slytherins with suspicion nothing important said nathan in a nonchalant tone without lifting his eyes from the plate in front of him they re just mocking me because i got detention over something they did he added with a shrug what andy reacted with indignation you ve got detention exclaimed kevin but who gave you detention and why professor snape gave me detention because i threatened to hex some slytherins in the library nathan explained with a tone of finality oh andy reacted i sorry about that the gryffindors stared at nathan in disbelief but then went back to their food after realizing their friend wasntgoing to say any more nathan finished his meal in silence glancing at the head table he saw the potions master talking with the headmistress what will he make me do during detention he mused professor snape looked out across the great hall caught the boy eyes on him and smirked nathan smirked back for a moment and then stood to leave the great hall he bid his farewells and left heading back to gryffindor tower professor snape frowned at the boy smirk and kept his eyes on the retreating figure until he disappeared from view you might be smirking now boy you ll see the bastard i can be during detention he thought and stood up to leave as well the sunshine broke through the curtains hanging from nathan four poster bed waking him up he swung his legs over the bed yawning and stretching his arms in a lazy move sunday was a lazy day standing up he went to the bathroom and looked at his reflection in the mirror frowning a little his hair was starting to look greasy at the roots he brushed his teeth and took a shower when he went back to the room drying his hair with a towel he found his roommates waking up as well good morning he greeted and received some grunts in response he smiled at his sleepy friends are you coming to breakfast yeah yeah we re coming answered kevin getting out of bed and leaving for the bathroom from someone who just got a detention with the most vicious professor of hogwarts you re really cheerful this morning it cantbe that bad nathan answered i ll wait you in the common room he said leaving the boys to their morning rituals it didnttake long until he saw his friends coming down the spiral staircase with sleepy faces come on it sunday cheer up guys what are we going to do today nathan said animatedly i was thinking we could start with breakfast and go from there what do you think said andy they left the common room laughing and headed to the great hall there werenttoo many students there yet sunday was the perfect day to sleep late especially at the beginning of the term the sun was streaming in through the windows of the great hall as they took their seats at the gryffindor table and served themselves of some breakfast they were in the middle of their meal when a flock of owls invaded the hall owl post a brownish owl landed on the table in front of nathan with an envelope tied to its leg nathan disentangled the paper and gave the owl some sausage from his plate the bird took flight once more and left the hall nathan opened the letter it was from his mother dear nathan it so good to hear you like hogwarts and that you ve made friends already it took me some time to adapt and i was worried you d have problems as well i want to know everything about kevin and andy in your next letter i glad you re taking to magic easily but dontfool yourself charms and transfiguration are very difficult subjects and you ll have to study hard to excel in them you ll have to study hard in potions too i know you like it but professor snape is really hard to please and what outstanding for the other teachers is only acceptable for him nothing comes easy i know he thought the hard work speech was well known by nathan his mother constantly reminded him that things never happened without hard work he continued reading her letter by the way i believe when you say you were paying attention to your potion and i sure it was a perfect brew but if you dontwant to keep losing points during professor snape class dontlaugh at him i know he a great teacher but he can be really nasty when provoked and you wontlike to be on the receiving end of his nastiness or you ll be losing more points than you ll be able to recover with the other teachers or worse you ll get more detentions than harry and ron i dontthink that what you want right too late mum he thought with a snort i already the subject of his ire and have a detention he kept reading i was sad to know your friends fear professor snape for his past what he did during the war was really important for the light i glad you stood ground for him and i want you to keep reminding your friends that he a good and honorable man you donthave to change their minds but you must do your part respecting him is the least we can do not easy not easy mum he thought he wasnthappy with what his friends kept saying about professor snape past either he knew the potions master had helped harry and saved his mother more than once during the war the house is really empty without you i miss you so much i promise i ll try not to be so sad i ll find something to do during the weekends dontworry dontforget to write to me and if you need anything just owl me it doesnthave to be a saturday i love you mum he had a sad smile on his face after finishing his mother letter i miss you too mum he thought nathan folded the parchment back into the envelope and pocketed it he went back to his breakfast and his friends conversation trying not to be home sick let take a walk around the lake suggested kevin when they were all finished eating sure nathan replied let go then said andy standing from his seat and

much your participation on this one was priceless a n chapter six yes 0 nathan tries his best to be prepared for professor snape detention will he get out of it alive 0 let see chapter 6 detention nathan woke up earlier than usual on monday he had letters to take to the owlery and he wanted to be prepared for the detention he was to serve with professor snape he had decided to send one letter to his godfather harry potter and another to ronald weasley his mother had written on her letter that uncle harry and uncle ron had got many detentions when they were students they should be able to tell him what to expect from the potions master as soon as he saw the owls depart with his letters he went down to the great hall for breakfast he had just enough time to eat before going to the dungeons for double potions arriving for the class he entered the cold classroom and took a seat at the same workbench he did last week right in front of professor snape desk nathan was preparing for the class taking his book parchment quill and bottle of ink from his book bag when professor snape stormed to the front of the classroom and tuned around on his heel to face the class without further word the potions master waved his wand and a list of ingredients appeared on the board then he addressed the students today you ll be brewing a simple calming draught open your books to page twenty three and follow the instructions he bypassed his desk making for the chair but stopped in his tracks when he realized the students hadntstarted the task and were staring at him well not all the students he contemplated rolling his eyes at least the granger boy is working didntyou listen to what i said what are you waiting for start working now he admonished the class started moving with amazing speed startling from their trance professor snape finally reached the chair behind his desk and shifted his attention from the frightened students to the pile of seventh year essays from time to time he would leave his position to walk around the tables perusing cauldrons from behind the students backs to their utter terror do you know what a cube is miss parks he asked in that cold voice of his y yes sir hesitated josephina then what part of cut the ginger roots into cubes didntyou understand he inquired start over miss parks cauldron after cauldron student after student professor snape spilled his venom taking points from gryffindor when he reached nathan desk he eyed the potion only to see it was the perfect purple shade the boy was talented he could admit it but not aloud too thick mr granger next time do try to stir the correct number of times he felt himself obliged to say though the consistency of the potion wasntthat far from expected nathan looked up at this and met snape eyes for a moment they just stared at each other until the boy rolled his eyes professor snape narrowed his own but said nothing he finished his frightening round and went back to grading essays the students finished their potions and bottled their samples before leaving the dungeon classroom nathan was collecting his things when the potions master called his name from the desk at the front of the room mr granger meet me in this classroom at seven on wednesday for your detention he said and then added i wonttolerate tardiness yes sir was his answer and then nathan left trying to catch up with the others who were heading to the defense class the next morning found nathan in the great hall eating breakfast when a number of owls invaded the bewitched ceiling of the room two birds descended towards him they carried the answers from the letters he had sent the day before to harry and ron he disentangled the parchments from the birds legs and they left the table flying away from the hall through the high windows nathan started opening the first letter ron s it read hey nathan good to hear from you i just hoped it could have been in better circumstances so detention with snape i cantblame you i know how much of a bastard he can be donttell your mother i writing such things nathan rolled his eyes at ron observation and continued reading now answering your question i believe he ll make you clean up nasty cauldrons for the night without magic terrible i know but believe me when i say it could be worse now good luck boy and do try to avoid getting into trouble around snape he can make your life a living hell just like he did ours have i congratulated you for being a gryffindor i think not so congratulations regards ron weasley clean cauldrons the muggle way so that it he contemplated after reading ron response maybe uncle harry has something else to say he thought opening the second letter dear nathan it good to hear from you i happy you re getting along so well with your classmates why did you get detention with snape write telling me the whole story will you if he being his old nasty self with you just like he was with your mother and i let me know and he ll hear from me why does he think i canthandle professor snape he mused at his godfather words now if he didntchange his style and i dontthink he would have he ll probably make you scrub filthy cauldrons until you can see your reflection on their ends his other favorite sadistic sport is making students prepare nasty ingredients like extracting pus from bubotubers or something i think he ll choose the first one though as you re a first year i hope i have been some help if snape starts giving you detentions for no reason at all just tell me okay he ll answer to me love harry well bubotuber pus or filthy cauldrons it gonna be a delightful evening nathan lamented sarcastically who are the letters from he heard andy ask uncle harry and uncle ron he answered a letter from harry potter asked kevin suddenly losing his interest in his breakfast to hear what his friend famous uncle had to say yes i wrote to them to ask about professor snape detention and what did they say asked andy well they think i ll have to scrub filthy cauldrons the whole night nathan sighed scrub like without magic asked an outraged kevin that what they say nathan confirmed resignation in his voice well do remind me never to get in trouble with professor snape will you the boy commented and went back to his plate nathan sighed again and resumed his meal as well by tomorrow night he would be prepared for his detention wednesday at seven professor snape heard a tap on his classroom door enter he said good evening professor the boy entering the room greeted he didntbother to acknowledge instead pointing with a sharp incline of his head to two filthy cauldrons on a workbench near his desk where he sat with a book in his hands clean them until you can see your reflection he said with his velvet voice with a smirk he added without magic nathan said nothing just reached for the brush and started scrubbing the boy remained quiet while he cleaned the first cauldron when he was starting the second he spoke why did you assign me detention sir why did i assign him detention what kind of question is that he thought i thought you were smarter than that he answered the boy was still looking at him so he rolled his eyes and added you were attempting to hex another student mr granger you even admitted the intention now go back to work i donthave the whole night but the boy didntcomply wasnti clear snape thought why didntyou assign detention to the other boys too they were threatening the hufflepuff nathan said he furrowed his eyebrows together at this is he questioning my judgment five points from gryffindor for disrespect mr granger now go back to work i wonttell you again he said between gritted teeth i will sir defied nathan i just want to understand why you re always picking on gryffindors and never on slytherins why dontyou ever take points from them that did it snape was on his feet and in two long steps was mere inches from nathan towering over him the boy didntflinch and met the professor glare with an inquiring eyebrow this made professor snape growl i wonttolerate this boy you show no respect you re here to scrub cauldrons because you deserved it now stop testing my patience and start cleaning this cauldron now this time the boy obeyed and snape went back to his book nathan cleaned the second cauldron in silence when he finished nathan approached the professor desk without taking his eyes from the book the potions master said out the boy didntmove snape ignored him for a while and then sighed heavily what does the boy want now he even worst than his mother lifting his head he glared at the boy and said with more force are you deaf i said out professor nathan started i didntmean to disrespect you with my questions i sorry he s apologizing he thought though his expression showed no surprise at nathan words my mother told me you had to favor the slytherins back when she was a student because of the war the boy continued i was just trying to understand why you do so now as well he finished i sorry anyway the mention of miss granger annoyed him he remembered the boy words in the library about him being honorable and it just served to irritate him more i ll stop this nonsense right now he thought i dontknow what your mother told you about me but i assure you she doesntknow me as well as she may think i donthave to explain my actions now or then to anyone not to you not to your mother not to anyone he was livid now get out of my classroom he growled staring at the angry potions master for a moment nathan could do nothing but obey he turned on his heel and went to the door that led to the dungeon corridor he never answered my question he mused maybe if i really earnt house points he would award me with them maybe i not doing enough to earn them mum was right professor snape is a difficult man to please reaching the door he turned and glanced the man way with the challenge of proving he was worthy of his teachers praise nathan said good night professor snape and left for gryffindor tower he didntwant to believe the potions master was unfair favoring his own house above the others he just had to prove it the man left alone inside the classroom had now lost his interest in the book he was reading severus was deep in thought over the things the boy had said why am i still favoring the slytherins above all others it not like i need to anymore why do i do it then he thought before regaining control of his own mind because that how it is because you are professor snape the greasy git head of slytherin and that what you do he countered frowning at himself snape sighed he hadntbeen concerned with these matters since ever why i am doing it now he mused granger he said between gritted teeth he closed the book with force stood up and left the classroom heading for his quarters even as snape strode the corridors he couldntstop thinking about nathan questions try as he might he couldntsee reason in his actions he d never before felt the need to justify his unequal treatment of his own house even to dumbledore who turned a blind eye knowing his precarious position now though he had no answer for his continued bias beyond that what i do because that what i ve always done somehow that didntseem adequate reason anymore a n nathan survived 0 i hope you liked the chapter i want to hear

house points from none other than professor snape disclaimer not mine it all j k rowling s warning this story takes place in the future and contains hbp spoilers be warned beta reader snarkyroxy thank you very much a n chapter seven 0 nathan is after some house points from none other than professor snape well at least he has a plan 0 chapter 7 wanted points nathan spent the weeks following his detention observing the potions master attitude during class he kept notes of every point professor snape awarded or took the corners of his book and parchment sheets were full of numbers names a g or s and words such as right answer bad chopping good brew and cauldron explosion he had notes for at least three weeks worth of potions classes the same kind of notes were all over his defense texts as well he was similarly observing professor lupin head of gryffindor house for comparison matters now nathan sat at a table in the common room near where kevin and andy were playing wizards chess he flipped through his books and classroom notes organizing the information he d collected into a points chart when kevin while waiting for andy move in their game interrupted his work what are you so caught up with nathan you re going through the pages of these books like crazy taking notes you cantbe studying at this rate he stated i not studying nathan answered filling yet another line of the points chart it some independent research i working on he added without taking his eyes from the parchments on the table that caught andy attention what you re working on independent research along with all the homework we ve been assigned he said shaking his head lightly you should try chess some day nathan he added contemplating the board for his chances after kevin last move yes you could play a match with me after i finish with andy kevin added with a playful smile he ll not last long anyway i appreciate the invitation but chess is not my game nathan answered while turning the pages of his potions book until he found another side note to add to the chart what are you researching anyway asked andy after moving a reluctant bishop into battle with the opponent knight i evaluating the differences between gryffindor and slytherin head of house behavior concerning house points nathan stated and was rewarded with an arched brow by andy while kevin snorted in amusement you re a weird guy nathan what would you gain from such research house points asked kevin sarcastically in fact that exactly what i expecting replied nathan i trying to understand what professor snape most awards points for and doing the same with professor lupin that way i ll be able to come with a plan of action to make both of them award gryffindor as many points as possible he explained matter of factly that a great idea said andy enthusiastically we can make the slytherins lose as many points as we win too and take the lead in the house cup he added with a mischievous grin yeah yeah said nathan dismissively as soon as i finish the points chart he added letting his annoyance with the interruptions show in his voice the two boys went back to their game and nathan to his chart he wasnttelling them all the reasons for his research on these particular professors though i ll prove he doesntaward points only to slytherins he thought an hour later found kevin and andy engaged in a game of exploding snap with josephina and her best friend anna nathan was finishing his points chart seated at the same table i done he stated all he had to do now was add a totaling line at the end of the chart and analyze the results and so he did taking his wand and pointing it to the parchment he uttered totalus and frowned at the result professor snape didntaward any points to gryffindor he acknowledged mentally and it not a common behavior of head of houses because professor lupin awards points to slytherin so what wrong nathan asked kevin seeing his friend distress i need more information nathan said not wanting to believe his conclusions it must be a coincidence taking another careful look at the points chart analyzing the specifics of each awarded point nathan realized professor snape prized good potions and correct answers the most well the gryffindors arentthe best brewers of the class he admitted mentally and they re too afraid of him to volunteer answers to his questions he wasnta volunteer himself and it was a crucial matter on the points awarded you had to volunteer to answer the questions the good potions points were another matter nathan was an excellent brewer and his potions were always perfect that was a disturbing conclusion does he have something against me is it me then the thought saddened nathan maybe it because of my mother he thought reluctantly to himself he wanted to dismiss that line of thought so he needed more information the potions master couldntbe treating him differently because of things that had happened more than a decade ago professor snape hated harry and ron and his mother for being harry friends he doesnthate me does he nathan shook his head i need more information before i can conclude anything nathan collected his papers and books from the table at which he d been working he needed to talk with someone who had known professor snape for more than a month nathan looked around the full common room and rested his eyes on a group of seventh years seated near the fireplace the head boy he thought enthusiastically he perfect he a good student disciplined he ll know approaching the seventh year students nathan called mr cornwell do you have a minute the head boy looked up to find the first year is it something wrong mr granger he asked nathan no i just have some questions if you dontmind he answered the older boy excused himself from his friends and gave nathan his undivided attention very well mr granger what is it that you want to ask i wanted to know if you have ever won any house points from professor snape nathan said not wanting to waste the head boy time with small talk professor snape cornwell asked surprised by the boy question snape doesntgive gryffindors house points another seventh year who was listening to the conversation answered he only gives points to slytherin the git pretend you have some respect for professor snape please admonished the head boy is it true asked nathan wanting cornwell confirmation of the boy accusations yes it true professor snape is very hard to please the older boy answered and he a greasy git that hates gryffindors added the other seventh year nathan would have intervened with the boy slander of the potions professor if the revelations hadntaffected him so deeply so it true professor snape favors slytherins he couldntavoid the melancholia that hit him nathan was very disappointed with professor snape the man his mother was always adamant was so honorable and deserving of people respect thanking the seventh years nathan went back to the table his book bag was resting on and left the common room for the boys dormitory he prepared himself to sleep but felt he couldn t his mind was racing with thoughts but before he finally fell asleep his expression wasnta sad disappointed one anymore but one light with hope next monday morning nathan entered the great hall for breakfast with confidence he had worked through the weekend and had a plan he was sure would make professor snape give him house points his fellow gryffindors just didntknow how to do it that was the conclusion he had got after analyzing the points chart over and over he d start with the first phase of his plan today he d volunteer to answer the questions he d read the text book for the lesson twice as well as some additional texts he d found in the library he was prepared and he knew it he ate his breakfast chatting animatedly with his friends he glanced once in a while in the direction of the high table meeting a mirror of his dark eyes glancing back at him snape was scowling of course but that was his normal behavior the gryffindors walked their way through the dungeon halls the potions classroom was cold despite the mild temperature outside nathan took his usual seat and prepared himself for the class and professor snape arrived a few minutes later sliding his tall figure towards the front of the room with his black robes billowing after him the lecture started and with that the potions master questions nathan had his hand up on every single one providing precise answers that would make his mother proud yet it seemed not to be enough for professor snape adequate mr granger was the most positive appreciation nathan got from the potions master at the end of the class professor snape was beyond annoyed with nathan can anyone tell me why i should not combine these two substances the professor asked nathan hand was in the air as soon as his teacher finished the question anyone insisted snape nathan was almost on his feet by then professor snape had his jaw closed tightly and his fists clenching alongside his body he hissed the resident know it all seems to know the answer do enlighten us mr granger nathan was taken aback by the potions master tone and the potency of his venomous glare but answered firmly they are a base and an acid respectively combined they ll form a salt and the side product would be water which would ruin the potion at this point of the brewing the boy was confident that was a perfect answer and it couldntbe found in the assigned text book he only knew the information because he had been working with other books too nathan watched his teacher expectantly this one deserves at least five points he thought correct but incomplete was professor snape comment incomplete incomplete the disappointment was written on nathan face he let his weight fall back on his stool and just stared at the potions master in disbelief incomplete the class was dismissed shortly after that and nathan took himself out of the dungeon classroom accompanied by his classmates andy was close beside him while they headed for the defense class where did you learn all that nathan he asked it doesntmatter does it nathan answered acidly professor snape didntgive me a single point for all the questions i answered he threw his hands up in front of him in a gesture of disappointment that okay nathan said kevin patting him on the shoulder he just a greasy git who hates gryffindors you werentless brilliant because of that did you see malfoy face not a hundred points would be worth more than the expression on that slytherin faces he added grinning yeah that was priceless agreed andy patting nathan on his other shoulder that helped a little nathan had to admit his friends were trying to make him feel better and that was great and although it worked on the surface deep down inside he was hurting professor snape was unfair and hated gryffindors or he hates only me he sighed inwardly at the thought they were just entering the defense classroom when he decided to let it go for the moment and concentrate on his other classes professor snape entered his classroom prepared for another annoying first year gryffindor and slytherin double class the potion he had assigned for today wasnteasy for their level of skills and he expected at least one cauldron explosion he reached the front of the room and started lecturing asking his first question he didntbother to look at the granger boy to see if he had his hand up to answer he chose the first slytherin who waved his hand instead another question and now he glanced the boy way to smirk at him while choosing another student to answer but realized the granger boy didnthave his hand up at all that intrigued him last class granger was so annoying snape was reminded of the boy mother the insufferable know it all and then today mr granger was back to the way he was at the beginning of the term self absorbed and contained he asked another question more difficult than the previous one trying to instigate the boy to volunteer an answer but got nothing not containing himself anymore he approached the boy and paused in front of him with a smirk forming on his face and said what happened mr granger didntread the chapter today and i thought you were a know it all just like your mother there let see what you re made of little granger he thought still smirking i know the answers sir i just didntthink you want me to give them you seemed a little annoyed with me last class nathan answered frankly snape was so surprised with the boy sincerity that it showed on his face for a moment until he was able to control himself again regaining his blank outward demeanor that betrayed no emotions the fact that the granger boy could unsettle him was annoying and with pinched eyebrows he said five points from gryffindor for your impertinence mr granger somewhat recovered after the points lashing snape turned his attention back to the class and waved his wand making the instructions for the potion appear on the board he instructed the class to start brewing and sat back at his desk to grade some papers never leaving the class unattended this potion could be especially disastrous when brewed by dunderheads and he wasntgoing to take any risks from time to time he would leave his desk to walk between the workstations perusing the cauldrons after taking some points here and there he reached granger cauldron the potion is perfect he dared admit to himself the boy was at a more advanced stage than his classmates he was at a particularly delicate stage of the brew actually snape looked the boy hands chopping slicing and measuring the ingredients and was impressed with his ability his movements are very precise and fluid he thought mesmerized by nathan graceful movements when he tried to take nathan attention from the potion he realized how concentrated on the task the boy was the boy is really talented he caught himself thinking he went back to his desk and his papers but every once in a while he would spend a few minutes observing the boy work he was now officially intrigued by nathan granger the boy acted so differently from class to class he was definitely and officially a mystery some time later nathan stirred his cauldron clock wise one last time perfect he thought with a smile he had finished brewing and was really satisfied with the resulting liquid laying inside the cauldron he bottled a sample and cleaned his workbench just then he looked around him and realized he was the first to finish the potion great i the first to finish and the brew is perfect he thought eyeing the bottle carrying his sample proudly he took the vial and walked to the desk where professor snape sat grading papers the potions master looked up from his work and started to say what are you doing out of your but stopped after catching sight of the bottle on nathan hand i ve finished professor nathan said leaving the bottle on the desk he hovered a little before heading back to his stool he wanted to know what professor snape thought of his potion the potions master looked at nathan at the bottle and then back to the papers he was grading you re free to go mr granger was the only thing he said he dismissing me what about the potion it perfect and he not going to say anything nathan sat there in astonishment it took him a few moments to gather his thoughts before leaving the classroom with long strides slamming the door after him he was furious he strode through the dungeons not even noticing his surroundings his head was still in the potions classroom he passed by professor lupin who noticed something was amiss nathan is something wrong shouldntyou be in potions right now asked professor lupin i was dismissed sir said nathan lupin could see the boy was livid well i never saw a student so angry for being dismissed from professor snape class before did you explode your cauldron or something asked lupin observing the boy with interest no i just finished my potion earlier than everyone else and he dismissed me nathan stated in a way that left professor lupin no doubt he was annoyed with the potions master he couldntthink of a motive for this annoyance though he started walking towards his classroom and the boy still lost in his thoughts followed and it a bad thing because lupin trailed out wanting the boy to explain my potion was perfect and he didntsay anything he just dismissed me nathan said throwing his hands in the air to show his irritation over professor snape actions the head of gryffindor had a knowing look on his face when he said and you were waiting some recognition for your good work right lupin was used to it by now every year he had one or two gryffindors angry with snape for his lack of recognition of true talent well yeah my potion was perfect it was worthy of at least five points to gryffindor answered nathan indignation clear in his tone of voice his black eyes shining with the strength of his emotions he was really pissed off professor lupin smiled at the boy nathan you have to understand that professor snape is not the kind of teacher who distributes points to gryffindor however it doesntmean he didntappreciate your good work in the classroom but why is it because he head of slytherin asked nathan you re head of gryffindor and you give points to all houses including slytherin he added that true nathan but you ve got to understand that professor snape thinks differently than i do he believes gryffindors work harder when they are challenged while slytherins need recognition the defense professor explained nathan snorted do you think he right sir he asked shaking his head in amusement well i dontuse that specific technique but i cantdeny it works fairly well on his classes he been teaching for a long time nathan his class can be dangerous sometimes and he has to be in control or something pretty bad can happen professor lupin said seriously nathan was silent absorbing the information it made sense lupin seeing nathan was taking his words continued you shouldntbe disappointed if professor snape didntaward you house points he ll praise your good work in other ways i believe the fact that he dismissed you earlier today is one of them that statement got a lifted eyebrow from nathan and how is that he asked curiously professor snape could have made you stay for the rest of the class and asked you to write an essay or something but he decided to dismiss you it not a common practice coming from him nathan i almost convinced that it equivalent to ten points lupin said with a smile nathan responded with a smile of his own professor lupin was right the potions master could have given him more homework or something that calmed him a little they were in front of the defense classroom by now nathan took a seat and reached for a book to read before the class started professor lupin left the boy to it and entered his office smiling a n okay every person that leaves a review will be awarded with a hundred points to your house so dontforget to write your house name on your review well as

moon and something is happening in the forbidden forest disclaimer not mine it all j k rowling s warning this story takes place in the future and contains hbp spoilers be warned beta reader snarkyroxy thank you very much a n chapter eight already 0 someone covers for lupin during the full moon and something is happening in the forbidden forest what now let find out chapter 8 forbidden forest hermione apparated out of her apartment as the end of the morning was approaching she wanted to stop by her office before meeting harry and ginny for lunch hermione had some data to collect at the muggle university where she worked as a professor and researcher even on a saturday the grounds of the campus were filled with young students enjoying the nice day reading playing or just hanging out she crossed the grounds from the hidden place she used for apparition and entered the chemistry building heading for her laboratory the image of the students under the trees reminded her of the weekends at hogwarts she always liked the atmosphere of the castle especially the grounds the lake the trees the gardens she walked through the corridors of the university but her mind was on the corridors of the castle where she had lived for almost seven years and on nathan too she received a letter from him earlier that morning and again the main topic was severus snape she was starting to get worried about nathan interest in severus of course her intentions were for nathan not to hate his father but she didntthink nathan would get so so obsessed with him that was the word obsessed nathan was always devoted to everything he puts his heart to his favorite subject while he was still at muggle school was chemistry so it was only logical he would like potions so much he used to help hermione to prepare some simple potions at home and she could see nathan was talented for the art even then maybe that was just it an aptitude for potions her mind went back to data collection when she reached the laboratory she took some notes increased the hydrogen pressure of the complex system on the workbench and when she was sure everything was fine left the building to apparate again it was now time to meet her friends arriving at the backyard of number twelve grimmauld place hermione found young lily on her broom hello lily i see you re practicing your quidditch maneuvers very good she praised thanks aunt mione the girl yelled from her position up in the sky hermione entered the house through the kitchen door and met ginny who greeted her with a hug hermione you arrived already hi ginny i a little early i know i had to stop by the university before coming here and i guess i overestimated the time i would spend there is harry home already hermione inquired yes he just arrived he with ron in the drawing room ginny offered and after giving some other instructions to dobby led hermione from the kitchen to meet harry and her brother the women entered the room and were greeted enthusiastically by the men oy mione i thought i wouldntsee the day you d visit us again ron said hugging her harry came next she will come more often now that nathan is in the wizarding world right mione he said hugging her as well they sat on the couch and chairs near the fireplace and hermione answered you re probably right harry now that nathan is at hogwarts i think i should be more involved with the wizarding world again good because i was just convincing harry here to come to my next quidditch match ron said and the animated conversation filled the room until dobby announced that lunch was ready hermione helped ginny with the kids and they were soon eating in the basement kitchen they talked about the many activities they were involved with until harry commented on a case of contaminated potion he was working last week that brought the topic of the hated potions master into the conversation are you sure snape wasntinvolved ron teased harry who glared he was among my suspects harry answered with a smirk and everybody started laughing but hermione talking about snape how did nathan go with his detention ron asked hermione what detention she asked back oops i guess you just got nathan into trouble ron harry said what detention asked hermione again eying both men in turn well hesitated ron and then added under hermione deadly glare nathan served a detention with snape i thought you knew when what for hermione kept asking now very irritated with nathan the potions master and the two men at the table as well how do you know of it when i don t she asked now with a pained expression why would nathan hide this from me what else is he hiding her mind was rushing with doubts take it easy mione it nothing like the things we received detentions for i sure we just found out because nathan owled us asking what snape detentions were like it been a while now so just calm down harry assured her when hermione asked again in a more controlled tone of voice this time second week ron answered without a second thought what exclaimed hermione losing the little control she d managed before he got into trouble after just a week there what on earth did he do she was almost screaming in her indignation and rage now calm down hermione harry tried again glaring at ron you re overreacting mione harry and i served detention in our first week one year if you remember the flying car incident and we were never expelled ron said between bites ignoring hermione reaction to his words and added it was probably snape trying to make the life of a gryffindor miserable and it just happened to be nathan this time ron is probably right hermione ginny agreed why would nathan hide this from me then hermione inquired with that pained look again what did he do anyway it must have been something really wrong if he didnteven bother telling me his mother she added it nothing of the sorts hermione he must have said something snape didntlike and you know how nasty the bastard is harry said with a pointed look i dontknow harry hermione said shaking her head in refutation i thought nathan was getting along with professor snape he seems to even like his classes she commented and added as an afterthought maybe he likes it too much for his own good nathan is always writing about professor snape classes and assignments i just thought it was because he likes potions so much but now she broke off shaking her head again she wasntsure of anything anymore nathan wasnttelling her everything and it was a disturbing revelation what if severus discovered the truth about nathan and didntlook for me and what if he told nathan of it and nathan was hiding it from me what if nathan discovers somehow that severus is his father her mind was filling her heart with uncertainties her desire was to leave everyone here and race to hogwarts she needed to know what was going on there the lunch came to an end and they adjourned once again to the drawing room but hermione kept her mind with the two men of her life back at hogwarts nathan and severus harry brought her mind back realizing she wasntpaying attention to their conversation hermione you shouldntbe so worried about the detention it not the detention that making me worried harry she admitted with a sigh it the fact that my son is hiding things from me that is making me worry he knows he can trust me we have a very open relationship at least i thought we did but now she broke off he probably didnttell you because he knew you would be disappointed i dontthink he would hide things from you hermione if they were important said harry patting her on the shoulder you re right harry i just overreacting we ve never lived apart before and not knowing every single detail of his life is hard for me she admitted revealing only part of her feelings she wasntgoing to say a word about severus it all right hermione i think i can understand what you re feeling i dontknow how i ll react when lily and sirius leave for hogwarts as well harry said sympathetically and added let me tell you this i ll be at hogwarts to cover for remus and i promise i ll clear up this whole detention thing and tell you everything afterwards what do you say thank you harry i d appreciate that hermione answered with a sad smile and then frowned adding please tell nathan that he ll have to answer to me for that omission will you i will harry assured her the full moon was approaching and it was time for another defense substitute professor to appear at hogwarts true to the student predictions headmistress mcgonagall stood from her seat during dinner and announced as you can see professor lupin is indisposed he ll be back after the full moon but until then the gryffindors may come to me if in need of their head of house and the defense against the dark arts classes will be covered by mr harry potter that piece of information brought some noise back to the great hall at every table students turned to each other to comment on the famous wizard with excitement nathan was happy about the news that his godfather would be at hogwarts of course but his reaction didntcompare to the boys and girls around him the gryffindors were cheering wildly professor snape was rolling his eyes at the excitement of the students every year it was the same it just took an announcement that harry bloody potter would be coming to hogwarts for the students to show the full power of their hormones even his slytherins but the worst were the gryffindors at lunch the next day harry potter entered the great hall through a side door accompanied by headmistress mcgonagall chatting animatedly he took the seat at her left and tried to ignore the excitement of the students over his presence severus was already occupying the place at professor mcgonagall right as usual when they arrived wontyou greet your fans potter snape said sarcastically i sure they would be delighted with a wave from the hero if you want to see the students cheering snape maybe i should take you with me to the ministry so i can change their minds and put you in azkaban i sure the students would celebrate for a week harry retorted enough stop this nonsense right now mcgonagall said from between them i wonttolerate you sniping at each other for the duration of mr potter stay they were still glaring daggers at each other but said nothing else harry took his eyes from the potions master to take in the hall as always the students were looking at him with admiration and after that exchange with snape curiosity as well harry found nathan in the sea of gryffindors and beamed at him nathan beamed back and both started eating lunch was over but the great hall was still crowded even on a nice sunday the students didntwant to leave before harry potter every once in a while they eyed the chosen one until harry got up from his chair to leave he didnttake the side door though he descended the platform on which the head table stood and crossed the room towards the gryffindor table he stopped by nathan and put a hand on his godson shoulder how are you nathan everything all right he asked everything is fine uncle harry i glad you re here nathan answered with a smile nathan jerked when an elbow hit him on the left side of his rib it was kevin harry smiled uncle harry these are my friends kevin brown and andy wood they ve been driveling over their meals since you arrived nathan said glaring over said friends harry laughed nice to meet you boys harry said still smiling are you related to oliver wood andy do you remember my father andy asked in awe of course i do he was captain of the quidditch team when i joined harry said i know my father told me everything about it andy said well send him my best harry said and then taking his attention back to nathan said i was thinking you might like to join me and hagrid for some tea later sure what time nathan asked at three at the entrance hall harry asked okay nathan agreed see you then harry said squeezing nathan shoulder in a show of affection see you in class tomorrow he added to the other boys and left harry potter remembers my father how cool is that andy said nathan rolled his eyes at his cheerful friends they left the great hall shortly after harry and headed back to gryffindor tower nathan met hagrid by the entrance hall at the appointed time harry wasntthere yet he greeted the care of magical creatures teacher hi hagrid ello nathan are yeh comin for tea as well the half giant asked with a smile yes uncle harry invited me nathan answered at that moment professor snape entered the hall coming from the dungeons and headed to where they were waiting for harry good afternoon hagrid snape greeted i in need of your services my supply of unicorn hair has run out and i ll need it refilled for my classes this week snape said totally ignoring nathan presence sure prof ssor snape i ll get yeh some tomorrow evening hagrid answered that will be too late for tomorrow morning classes cantyou fetch some tonight professor snape insisted i sorry prof ssor but i have some school business to run in london hagrid said well i ll just change the schedule of tomorrow classes then snape said and with a slight inclination of his head left the hall for the dungeons just as harry arrived hey nathan hagrid he greeted sorry i late minerva kept me a little longer than i expected he added no problem harry the half giant assured him and they left for the castle grounds and hagrid hut how was tea with harry potter josephina asked as soon as nathan entered the common room everybody in the room turned their attention to him at that nathan paused and then with a frown answered it was okay not that it concerns any of you his glare made the staring gryffindors go back to their business even as a first year nathan was respected among his gryffindor fellows for his connections with the golden trio he was the famous hermione granger son after all nathan spotted his friends in a corner of the room and went to join them hey nathan you ll tell us right andy asked of course he will andy we re his best friends right nathan kevin completed okay nathan sighed resigned to his fate what do you want to know what did you talk about andy asked bringing his chair closer to listen first uncle harry and hagrid were talking about ministry things really boring nathan said trying to discourage his friends interest and after that kevin asked it failed well he wanted to talk to me about my detention my mother discovered it and she was really mad at me nathan said still reflecting over his godfather words he had disappointed his mother that it kevin asked disappointed yeah pretty much it nathan answered the boys went back to their homework but nathan had already finished his leaving him time to think about what his godfather had said he had to fix things with his mother he had disappointed her and now had to come up with something to make her proud of him again his mind was racing that was when he remembered a conversation he had listened to earlier he looked through the window the sun is setting perfect he stood up abruptly which called his friends attention back to him where are you going andy asked i need to get some potions ingredients i ll see you later he answered already reaching for the fat lady to leave the common room he met only a few students wandering the school on his way to the entrance hall but nobody seemed interested in the boy rushing past them not even when he opened the big front door that led to the grounds he left the safety of the castle and strode directly to the borders of the forbidden forest nathan wasntlying to his friends back in the common room he was there to fetch some potions ingredients what he didnttell them was that said ingredients werentfor him but for professor snape he would find a unicorn herd and take some of their hair back with him that a brilliant idea i ll make professor snape give me house points and my mother will be very proud of me for getting points from professor snape no doubt and with that in mind he entered the woods finding the unicorns wasntsupposed to be hard they could be found in clearings they lived in herds and their white hair shone in the moon light nathan had read all about it walking in the woods was proving a little harder than he expected though the trees were getting closer and closer together as he advanced deeper into the forest the shorter branches were scratching him and the shadows the trees made were blocking most of the light provided by the full moon shining on that early evening he didntstop though he kept advancing until he found the first clearing but no unicorns were there not to be deterred he walked even deeper into the forest looking for the creatures until he finally found them resting in the third clearing he reached nathan was mesmerized by the unicorns he had never seen such beauty before read about yes but not seen he stood there for some time admiring the creatures until a sudden movement scared them away from the clearing nathan was startled from his stupor then and looked around searching for the source of what had frightened the unicorns but saw nothing he fully entered the clearing then wanting to pursue the creatures and that was when he saw it three giant spiders appeared entering the clearing from the opposite side to which the unicorns had left it nathan didnthave time to scream he took off in the same direction the white creatures had gone he ran as fast as he could through the thick tangled trees the spiders were behind him and he kept running not wondering where he was going not caring if the branches of the trees were hurting his skin until a branch cut his leg deeply and he fell to the ground the spiders were still coming his way he could hear them he got up and resumed his running even limping and bleeding as he was nathan was just managing to keep ahead of the giant spiders until he stumbled on a salient root and hurt his left ankle he screamed from the pain fell and lay there in the bed of decomposing leaves all his strength gone breathing hard that it he thought a tear leaving his eye he was fighting to stay conscious as weakness abated him after all the blood he d lost kevin and andy were in the great hall finishing their dinner they got tired of waiting for nathan to come back and had left the common room in the hope of finding him in the library but didn t they entered the great hall thinking they would find him there already but he wasntthere either supper had ended and there was still no sign of nathan where do you think he is andy asked i dontknow he said something about potions ingredients i thought he had gone to the dungeons or something but now kevin answered maybe snape killed him i dontthink he likes nathan very much mused andy with a horrified look dontbe silly andy was kevin retort his voice not very convincing they decided to approach the head table and tell professor mcgonagall they didntknow where nathan was hello boys is there something you need the headmistress asked the approaching gryffindors yes headmistress nathan didntappear for dinner and we cantfind him anywhere kevin informed that called the attention of the man seated at mcgonagall left did you look for him in the library asked harry yes we did mr potter andy answered i was with him earlier this afternoon i saw him entering the castle harry was now talking to the headmistress well did you see him this afternoon mr wood mr brown she asked the boys yes he was back from his meeting with mr potter but then he left again saying he needed some potions ingredients and we haventseen him since kevin said that piece of information brought the man on mcgonagall right into the conversation previously he had only been listening feigning disinterest i didntsee him in the dungeons today snape stated where did he go then asked harry somewhat rhetorically that was when professor snape stood up and addressed the headmistress we need to start a search through the grounds and the forest what do you mean harry asked do you know where he is i think the stupid boy got winded by his foolish gryffindor bravery and went to the forest to fetch unicorn hair snape said and cursed under his breath how can you know that for sure professor mcgonagall asked nervous now he heard a conversation i had with hagrid earlier today i didntknow the stupid boy would want to get the blasted stuff himself the potions master answered already leaving the great hall right behind him was harry potter who didntwant to waste any more time with whys and hows either they would have time for that later they were in the grounds in an instant and at the borders of the forest in another i ll take this trail that leads to the right you can take that one to the left harry said and was gone before snape could come up with a retort snape growled after potter demand but obliged taking the track he had pointed out he illuminated his path with the light from his wand tip with whispered words snape performed a locating charm that pointed deep into the forest why i not surprised he murmured irritated before starting to follow it soon he reached the clearing where nathan had met the unicorns he frowned the locating charm wasntpointing to a trail but to a close knit thicket of trees something is not right he thought and followed that direction with more urgency the boy had definitely gone that way the broken branches were enough evidence snape stopped in his tracks when he spotted something in the ground blood he realized confirming that the granger boy was indeed in trouble snape was almost running now he followed the blood trail which was longer than he expected when the amount of blood was increasing snape heard a scream granger he acknowledged and began running flat out in the direction from which the sound had come soon he found who he was looking for and then he saw the reason for the boy scream three giant spiders were trying to get to the boy on the ground snape flicked his wand and aimed it at the spider closest to the fallen body but no words escaped his mouth a red light filled the darkness and hit one of the spiders which started to contort helplessly the other two were hit with the same mute hex from subsequent flicks of severus wand with the spiders now subdued and harmless snape passed by them and knelt by the boy on the ground he cursed the boy stupidity once more as he eyed nathan measuring the extent of his injuries the boy had only minor scratches and cuts but for an ugly one on his right leg it was bleeding hard mr granger snape said in his strong voice he got no answer and tried again now shaking the boy shoulders mr granger nathan slightly opened his eyes but closed them again almost immediately damn gryffindor snape cursed under his breath before calling the boy once again this time by his first name nathan nathan opened his eyes again and found himself conscious enough to acknowledge with a weak voice professor snape and then added after a sharp intake of breath i knew you would come nathan words were not lost on snape he was expecting me to come for him he realized with a flicker of something in his chest mastering his emotions he asked can you stand the biting tone of his voice all but absent he noticed and frowned at himself no was nathan whined response my ankle snape put his arms around the boy and lifted him from the ground as he stood from his kneeling position nathan let a pained sound escape at the sudden movement snape started walking back to the edge of the forbidden forest carrying nathan the boy wrapped his arms around snape neck and rested his forehead on snape shoulder stay awake granger you lost too much blood snape said when he realized that the boy in his arms was closing his eyes yet again he increased his pace halfway to the edge of the forest they met a very worried harry potter i heard the scream is he okay he asked catching his breath he has injured his leg and lost a great deal of blood snape answered not breaking stride to address the other man let me take him harry said it not necessary potter i ve got him snape answered i ll take him from here harry insisted reaching to take nathan from snape arms it all right uncle harry a weak voice said professor snape saved me nathan added and closed his eyes once again stay awake boy snape snapped once more nathan opened his eyes again and tightened his grip on snape shoulders the three of them kept walking towards the school when they reached the edge of the forest snape turned to harry potter alert the others that i found him i ll take him to the hospital wing harry hesitated for a moment but then complied snape reached the front door and walked straight to the infirmary madam pomfrey was already waiting for them put him in that bed severus she instructed snape did as he was told ever so gently and stood aside he has lost a great deal of blood he falling in a hypothermic state he informed the mediwitch thank you severus now give me some space so i can work properly poppy snapped he complied but didntleave the ward his mind was on the boy lying on the bed he preferred me over potter why i saved him yes but still he couldntrationalize on the boy reasons he was lost for words and seemingly for thoughts as well he walked even farther away from the bed when harry came in with mcgonagall snape was now standing in a shadowed corner of the ward observing the mediwitch work how is he harry asked he ll be just fine mr potter madam pomfrey assured him he has lost some blood and fractured his ankle i ve fixed it already she added and tipped the contents of a potions vial into nathan mouth what that for harry asked it the blood replenishing potion now let me do my work the mediwitch snapped at that moment the fire on the hearth flashed green and a woman swirled out of it where my son hermione asked and didntneed an answer nathan she spotted him on the only occupied bed of the ward and walked to it not even madam pomfrey could stop hermione what wrong with him she asked with tears in her eyes brushing nathan black hair back from his forehead he ll be fine hermione harry said wrapping an arm around her and taking her out of madam pomfrey way what happened i received a message saying my son was injured how did this happen she asked watching the mediwitch work on nathan he was found in the forbidden forest mcgonagall spoke up we dontknow yet what he was doing there who found him hermione asked looking at harry snape harry answered averting his eyes from hermione s silence fell upon the ward the tall figure with blood stained black robes who remained unnoticed in a shadowed corner of the room didntsay anything either snape was watching the woman that had surged from the fireplace with curiosity she was physically changed a mature woman he noticed frightened for her son and fiercely protective of course he concluded she a gryffindor after all where is he hermione broke the awkward silence i dontknow probably back in the dungeons harry said i want to see him hermione stated that declaration made snape body stiffen he didntwant to meet her he couldntface her what for harry asked to thank him of course she answered snape heart was aching the last thing he wanted was hermione granger thanking him for anything i dontdeserve your kindness miss granger he thought or anyone for that matter but especially not yours he closed his eyes trying to get some control of his emotions i could call him mcgonagall offered i d like that hermione said gratefully madam pomfrey had finished healing nathan superficial injures and hermione approached the bed once again he saved you more than once now she told the unconscious boy in a low voice stroking his face with the back of her hand it wasntlow enough though snape had heard and was now frowning when did i save the boy before he couldntrecall i didnteven know she had a son until this term started he mused professor mcgonagall approached the fireplace and threw in a fistful of floo powder calling the potions classroom but got no answer she tried severus office to no avail at last she called for his private quarters but no one answered there either the headmistress turned hermione way and said i cantfind professor snape maybe he patrolling the corridors hermione nodded severus released a breath he didntknow he was holding visiting time is over madam pomfrey said returning to the ward some time later mr granger needs to rest and he wontwake until tomorrow when the effects of the mild sleeping draught have worn off she added i not going anywhere hermione said poppy glared daggers at her harry knew that look from the mediwitch all too well come on mione we ll be back first thing in the morning you heard madam pomfrey he ll be sleeping the whole night he said taking his friend by the shoulders you can have a room here for the night hermione mcgonagall added and the three left the infirmary madam pomfrey retreated to her office at the end of the ward the only ones left in the room were snape and the sleeping boy severus approached the bed and stood there for a moment what does your mother mean he asked the sleeping figure i never saved you before he stayed there some time yet observing nathan chest rise and fall with each breath before leaving the ward as well he didnttake the corridor that led to the dungeons though he didntwant to be found instead he decided to truly patrol the corridors he had too much on his mind to even think about sleeping tonight his feet took him to the only place he hadntentered since he had returned to hogwarts after the war the astronomy tower a n yeah i know i ve already been told it a cliffhanger but i sure you can wait until my next update right

hermione secret who how i ll tell you chapter 9 meetings the next morning the first rays of light filtering through the windows of the hospital wing fell on hermione sitting in a chair by nathan bed they couldntexpect her to leave her baby while he was confined to a hospital bed she had spent most of the night watching her son sleep and thinking of what had made nathan go into the forbidden forest was he dared by someone was he lost was he running from someone who had tried to harm him she had finally fallen asleep from exhaustion some time during the early hours of the morning nathan opened his eyes and didntrecognize his surroundings his eyes traveled the room until his gaze found the woman in the chair beside his bed his mother she was sleeping uncomfortably by the angle of her head nathan tried to call her but coughed instead waking her anyway you re awake thank god she said standing up from the chair to wrap her arms around her son you scared me nathan dontyou ever do that again i sorry mum he answered his voice muffled by his mother embrace how are you feeling hermione asked loosening the embrace to check every single inch of nathan body stop fussing mum i all right nathan protested yes and you re lucky to be too she said forcefully what were you thinking nathan going into the forbidden forest at night alone she questioned showing how angry she was now that she d confirmed he was all right do you have a death wish or something you almost got yourself killed i really really sorry mum i was just nathan couldntbring himself to tell her what he was doing in the forest it seemed so silly now that he was thinking straight how stupid of him to go there alone he should have known better i sorry he repeated in a low voice what were you doing in the forbidden forest hermione asked i was how would he tell her i come on nathan i donthave all day she insisted nathan sighed i was after the unicorns he managed why nathan why were you after unicorns at night in the forbidden forest alone hermione emphasized showing how short of patience she was nathan knew it was better to tell her now i was after the unicorns to collect some of their hair i knew professor snape snape why is it always professor snape nathan his mother interrupted angrily he bit his bottom lip i know it was silly now but it seemed like the perfect plan at the time i sorry he admitted yes it was a silly thing to do nathan hermione said bringing her hand up to rub her eyes she sighed he saved me nathan said in a low voice after the silence had stretched longer than he felt comfortable with professor snape hexed the giant spiders and carried me here when i couldntwalk he continued staring at his clasped hands lying over the white sheet he is a remarkable man hermione added in a smooth low voice giant spiders you said acromantulas oh nathan do you know how close to death you were please promise me you ll stay away from the forest no matter how fascinating an idea you have hermione asked crushing nathan into another fierce hug i begging you she implored looking him in the eyes without letting him out of her arms i won t mum i ve already admitted it was a stupid idea i dontintend to be twice as stupid and do it again nathan assured her good she placed a noisy kiss on his forehead freeing him from the embrace because stupidity doesntsuit you no it doesn t nathan agreed smirking at his mother he knew she was still mad at him but it seemed that her relief was greater than her anger he was relieved too his mother was right he had escaped death because of a miracle and its name was snape he was happy at his luck noises coming from the door of the infirmary drew mother and son attention from each other you re awake said harry approaching his godson bed so up to telling me what the hell you were doing in the forbidden forest by yourself not really nathan answered he didntwant anyone else pointing out how stupid he had been he was after unicorns harry he wanted to take some of their hair for potions hermione filled him in i already knew that that how we got to him in the first place snape remembered a conversation he had with hagrid about it earlier today and suspected that nathan could be in the forest after overhearing it harry said so professor snape knew i was there for the unicorn hair nathan said as realization struck him professor snape believed he would be stupid enough to try to fetch the ingredient himself god how embarrassing i ve made a complete fool of myself he added hiding his face in his hands yeah you did harry agreed why did you do it alone that what i dontunderstand dontyou know that the forbidden forest is dangerous you should have taken someone with you for backup one of those friends of yours maybe hermione was eyeing harry in disbelief harry is that the best advice you can give him to take someone with him you re supposed to be his godfather not his best mate she admonished okay you re not to enter the forbidden forest again not even with your best friends harry told nathan and the boy rolled his eyes at his godfather i ve already said that i dontintend to go in there again okay i won t nathan assured them once again the fact that professor snape knows of my stupidity is punishment enough to even think about doing it again he thought that was when he realized he hadntbeen punished for breaking the school rules yet i dontthink i ll see the grounds for the rest of the school year anyway i ll probably be in detention until summer he said sarcastically you re probably right harry agreed and nathan sighed as the time that breakfast would be served in the great hall approached the castle gained life once more with students all around the three occupants of the hospital wing hadntnoticed the boys lingering by the infirmary door murmuring to each other hermione was the first to acknowledge them are you looking for madam pomfrey she asked from where she stood by nathan bed er no said a nervous kevin we re here to see nathan ms granger hermione smiled at the boys then you must be andy and kevin come in she encouraged hey guys nathan greeted his shy friends who were approaching his bed slowly hey nathan we just wanted to see you before classes andy said mum this is andy and that is kevin nathan introduced this is my mother hermione granger he added unnecessarily we know nathan kevin affirmed extending a hand he said nice to meet you ms granger andy followed suit we heard you were in the forbidden forest last night andy said curiosity evident in his voice yeah i was but i dontwant to talk about it now nathan answered pointing at his mother with what he thought was a discrete flick of head but what ah andy was cut by kevin elbow hitting his ribs you must be tired now we understand kevin said quickly while andy rubbed his ribs madam pomfrey entered the infirmary by the small door that led to her office good morning mr granger i can see you re much better than the last time i saw you she said and started casting diagnosis spells over nathan much better indeed i have to go to the great hall for breakfast harry said to hermione and to the three boys added i hope to see you in my class later today if he eats his breakfast and still feels well after that poppy answered for nathan who rolled his eyes why dontyou walk with me boys harry asked and was answered by two enthusiastic smiles harry smiled too and gave hermione a quick kiss on one cheek before leaving the hospital wing in the company of the gryffindors mother and son ate their breakfast together they talked while waiting for madam pomfrey to release nathan which finally happened a couple of hours later hermione accompanied her son through the castle corridors and halls with a sense of nostalgia she really missed hogwarts her second home stopping in front of the fat lady portrait hermione gave nathan another hug and kissed the top of his head i miss you so much be a good boy and stop getting yourself into trouble okay she said playing with nathan hair nathan smiled then thank you mum he said and giving the password to the portrait he disappeared behind it into gryffindor tower hermione had one more thing to do at hogwarts before going back to london she had to find severus snape miss granger presence at the school had disturbed severus more than he wanted to acknowledge she brought back memories of the worst year of his life he had spent many hours in the astronomy tower before getting back to his quarters in the dungeons last night he hadntentered that part of the castle since the day dumbledore died the day he had killed him but last night he had returned to the place he had just stayed there watching the full moon and the stars that surrounded it torturing himself with things long done long gone long lost could he have done things differently he certainly could he had come up with dozens of possibilities for that night events and all of them ended with his death not dumbledore s not potter s not malfoy s only his death yet he had lived to comply with albus request he had killed the man who had trusted him with his very soul and had buried his honor in that white tomb together with his only friend a little more than a year after that severus found himself being redeemed from his atrocious crime by the wizengamot potter was right he should be in azkaban with the remaining death eaters that was his place with cold blooded murderers not in a school teaching innocent children and then there was hermione granger the one responsible for all of it she had trusted him when no one else would she had contacted him after he had left hogwarts that night she had brought him back to the order meeting and had explained and proved his loyalty to dumbledore even after the old wizard death in spite of that he had once more proved his honor was buried that night he had killed dumbledore she had trusted him as much as albus had and he had broken her trust he had violated her he had hurt her in order to save her oh how he hated himself and his damned choices even more because she had never blamed him on the contrary she had prepared his defense for his hearing she hermione granger had freed him from azkaban where he belonged and now there was the boy nathan granger she kept telling her son how honorable he severus snape was how much of a hero he was and all that crap the boy was supposed to be afraid of him the cold blooded murderer of the dungeons and not feel comfortable in his classes in his detentions in his arms the boy was so desperate for his acknowledgement that he was willing to risk his life to receive praise from him him the greasy git and it was all her fault he had passed by the infirmary after leaving the astronomy tower and had found her there sleeping by her son bed he hadntentered the ward not with her there he had watched her from the small window in the door she had slept at hogwarts to be with her son and that had made the rest of his night a living hell he was still avoiding her the next morning he was in the middle of a double lesson the very same one her son should be attending if he wasnttrapped to a hospital bed because of her he added mentally yes because it all her fault it all hermione granger fault snape was brought back from his musings by the sound of a pestle hitting the floor he stood from his chair and growled at the unfortunate student now is it so difficult to hold the utensils while using them mr bucknall five points from slytherin for your incompetence surprise was on the face of every student in the classroom what wrong with him andy used the lowest voice possible to ask kevin who was seated just behind him i dontknow and i dontwant to find out either if he taking points from slytherin like that kevin answered in a whisper the class passed in absolute silence and without any more incidents no one wanted to get on the wrong side of the potions master at the best of times let alone with him in such an awful mood you have ten minutes to turn in your samples clean up your mess and disappear from my sight snape said to them all when the class was ending the students did as they were told as fast as they could no one wanted to be the last to leave the classroom and be left alone with snape in the worst mood they had ever seen when the last two students were hurriedly leaving the room hermione granger appeared at the doorway so you re still here snape said in acknowledgement of her presence i was looking for you before going back to london hermione said entering the classroom and walking towards his desk where he sat he stood up and started to collect the vials the students had left on his desk you found me he said in a dry tone of voice hermione was observing the man in front of her she hadntseen him since his hearing at the ministry more than eleven years ago the father of her son yes i did she said a little lost for what to say now that she was in the same room as him her hesitation was irritating him further she could end this torment right away he thought but continued to ignore her i wanted to thank you for what you did yesterday hermione said watching his hands while they worked placing the vials in the crate now resting on the desk in spite of having been waiting for this snape felt as if he had been punched her words making him sick he stopped pretending he was busy you donthave to thank me it my duty to protect the students he said without taking his eyes from his desk i know but i want to thank you anyway she insisted taking a step closer to where he stood snape lifted his eyes and looked at her she was different from the last time he had seen her as he had noted last night he felt uncomfortable with the way she was looking at him and lowered his eyes resuming his task if you ve said what you came here to say you can go now i very busy he said dismissing her hermione lowered her head too also uncomfortable with the man in front of her but for completely different reasons i ll leave you to your work then good morning professor snape she said softly and turned to leave he didntanswer just lifted his head to observe her leave when he couldntsee her anymore he sighed and loosened the grip on the vial he hadntrealized he was crushing she is gone on the third floor nathan was waiting for his friends by the defense classroom he spotted them at the end of the corridor they saw him and smiled increasing their pace to reach him so you re back greeted a happy andy yes madam pomfrey said i could go back to classes nathan said that good but you were lucky to skip potions professor snape was really scary today kevin said that piece of information left nathan uneasy do you think so too andy he asked well yeah you should have seen how he treated bucknall for letting the pestle slip he took points from slytherin and called him incompetent a slytherin andy said in exasperation well that not good thought nathan his mother had made him promise that he would look for professor snape and apologize for his idiocy and he d agreed he wanted to apologize as well even knowing he would be punished hell he even deserved the punishment that too bad because i ll have to see him later he said why is that asked andy i have to thank him for saving me yesterday nathan explained he saved you i thought harry potter did kevin said surprised with the news no professor snape found me and saved me from the giant spiders he also carried me to the hospital wing because i couldntwalk you should have seen how he hexed those spiders nathan couldntdisguise his awe wait a minute you re saying that snape the same snape that teaches potions the slytherin bastard saved you a gryffindor that doesntmake any sense exclaimed a confused kevin nathan rolled his eyes that the only snape i know he said matter of factly at that moment harry potter entered the classroom from the side door that gave access to lupin office seeing nathan seated with his friends he smiled and said i glad you could make it to my class nathan his godson only smiled in response well i dontthink an introduction is necessary let start with the lesson then we ll be learning some defensive block spells today take out your wands harry instructed the class was quiet looking at him intently he sighed okay fire away what do you want to know he asked in resignation every time he came to hogwarts to cover for lupin it was the same all the students wanted to know was about his heroic acts how was it facing you know who a girl in the front asked and everyone strained to listen to the answer it was something i had to do so i did voldemort wasntgoing to leave me alone while i lived so i had to destroy him he explained did you really use the killing curse asked a slytherin yes i did was harry short answer nathan knew his godfather didntlike talking about the war so he raised his hand yes nathan harry acknowledged a little surprised why did you stop playing quidditch and become an auror nathan asked harry smiled at his godson in a sign of gratitude i thought it was time to put my defense against the dark arts knowledge to use and that what we are going to do now wands out the class progressed to the defensive spells then snape hadntshown up for the meals in the great hall he didntwant to see anyone else that day he was now sitting is his poorly lit office waiting for curfew to make his round of the castle before retreating to his quarters to try to forget this blasted day the sound of hermione voice thanking him was still playing in his mind along with the things he had heard yesterday in the hospital wing he wouldntask her of course but her saying he had saved the boy at least once before was puzzling him he tried to recall every single boy he had helped in all those years there werentmany and he still couldntfigure it out he shook his head purging the thoughts from his mind he didntwant to think of it anymore he tried once again to concentrate on the third year essays he was grading he had managed to finish a couple when he heard a tap on the door he lifted his head from the parchment and cursed the interruption enter he growled the door opened and the figure of a boy was outlined by the torches in the corridor as the figure advanced into the room snape recognized him granger he spat that was all he needed to complete the infernal day another meeting with another granger good evening professor snape nathan greeted all snape wanted was to get rid of him as soon as possible what do you want he asked impatiently i want to apologize nathan said in a low voice he moved with hesitation avoiding snape eyes his unusual shyness betraying some of his feelings snape sighed what wrong with these grangers he thought but then noticed the boy attitude or lack of it actually is he ashamed he smirked then you should feel ashamed of your idiocy i thought you were more than a stupid reckless gryffindor but it seems i was mistaken you re just another dunderhead he saw the boy physically flinch for the first time it didntplease him as he had thought it would and he frowned i sorry nathan said with his head down i was a troll of an idiot and i here for my punishment sir he here to be punished that was a confusing thought no one ever comes to my office seeking punishment unless they were sent here or dragged here who sent you here he asked then no one sir nathan jerked his head to look at the potions master in confusion so why did you come do you want me to punish you snape asked more than a hint of his sarcasm in his voice no one else has more right sir nathan answered firmly you re the one who saved me from the spiders and carried me to the hospital wing it only logical that you should be the one to punish me he added that declaration made snape arch an eyebrow fifty points from gryffindor and a month of detentions he stated nathan didntutter a sound in protest do you think that will suffice he added with a smirk if you re asking if it ll keep me out of the forbidden forest then yes but if you re asking if it will compensate for my idiocy then i should just as well spend the rest of the year in detention sir nathan said his eyes shining in the hearth light snape noted the rage in the boy eyes and couldntstop himself from admiring nathan wit i think i can skip the sermon then he said vaguely amused my mother covered that sir nathan assured the potions master perhaps but she is only one parent what about your father snape asked nathan fidgeted for a moment averting his eyes from the professor snape noticed and came to his own conclusions he is a muggle then i understand no sir i nathan trailed off not knowing how to explain perhaps it would be better to stick with the truth i dontknow who my father is he said in a very low voice hoping snape wouldnthear him but snape had heard and he was frowning you don t snape said almost as a reflexive response to the revelation he doesntknow who his father is his mind was trying to process that information miss granger doesntknow who her son father is that seemed impossible of course she does he admonished himself mentally the know it all would know the father of her son wouldntshe his mind ramble was interrupted by nathan but there always someone to fulfill his role when discipline is concerned this time it was uncle harry snape just sat there staring at the boy in barely disguised disbelief nathan was starting to feel some discomfort although he was used to the situation he always felt uneasy the first moment people found out he didntknow the identity of his own father almost as if reading snape thoughts nathan said my mother knows who my father is of course but she wonttell me realizing his opportunity and only hesitating just a little he asked the potions master you knew her when she was a student here sir do you remember if she dated someone in her seventh year and then he added in a sarcastic tone trying to cover for his nervousness i know she dated uncle ron but i most definitely not a weasley snape was examining nathan carefully now the boy said nothing else and just stood there these were the kind of puzzles the potions master liked to solve no the boy was definitely not a weasley he eyed nathan as if seeing him for the first time he observed his slim form tall for an eleven year old and his long fingers he let his eyes travel from the boy hands to his face square chin full mouth nicely outlined nose and coal black hair and then his eyes met the blackness of the boy s it seemed as though he was staring into a mirror and snape finally confronted his remembrances of that year and everything he was seeing in this boy standing in front of him his eye widened no he said little louder than a whisper nathan didntmiss the strange look that crossed his teacher face but only said it all right professor no one seems to know except my mother he now felt exposed he didntwant to stay there any longer he went to the door leaving a frowning snape staring after him i ll see you tomorrow sir good night he said just before closing the door behind him snape was still staring at the place where the boy had been standing moments ago as if still seeing him there he closed his eyes and every similarity between nathan granger and himself played in his memory like he was viewing a pensieve nathan working in his classroom nathan arching his eyebrow at him during the meals nathan eyes and hair and slim hands no no no he roared the last negative as he was forced to acknowledge what was now blatantly obvious he was nathan father he covered his face in his hands how could she do this why would she do this she kept a child of a he was suddenly finding it hard to breath his chest was aching his eyes shut tightly he abruptly rose from his desk knocking the chair back behind him he clutched the ink bottle sitting on the desk how could she do this to me he roared and red ink stained his office door as the bottle shattered he rested the palms of his hands on the corner of his desk searching for some balance and lowered his head he was feeling sick he tried to breathe again but it hurt he hurt with every intake of air with every thought i ve ruined her life and suddenly his legs couldnthold his weight anymore and he fell to his knees gripping the desktop with white knuckles images of the night hermione had been captured by a group of death eaters were playing in his mind he could see it as if he was there all over again a group of four masked men two clutching her by each arm while she fought in vain to be released entered the gathering of death eaters reunited by the dark lord he could barely disguise his terror for the girl as she was thrown forcefully to the floor he could see the satisfaction on voldemort distorted face potter number one groupie what a pleasant surprise he had said in that reptilian voice snape had put his mind to work on a way to save her without exposing his position as a spy after all he had been through to keep it but couldntthink of anything he watched in concealed horror as the dark lord cast the cruciatus on her and as her screams penetrated his mind he knew he had to find a way to save her voldemort had declared that she was of no more use to him after thoroughly ransacking her mind for valuable information he had seen his opportunity then when a death eater approached the girl on the floor already unfastening his trousers he had to do it if he wanted to keep her alive so he did he broke from the gathering that had formed around her and proclaimed she is mine he had to remember that it was the only way he unfastened his belt opened his trousers and knelt by her she met his eyes with her tear strained ones and he averted his eyes from hers to concentrate on the task at hand he had to do it if he wanted to save her life he pulled her closer to him with force and his body met hers he moved inside her and with every stroke he felt a piece of his soul escape his being she spilled silent tears while he violated her the assembled death eaters were enjoying the show nonetheless and when it was over they were hungry for more that was when snape clutched hermione arm hard and brought her to her feet with him they approached the dark lord and snape said i want this mudblood for myself my lord the snake faced creature seemed to consider his request for a moment the others were waiting in expectation why do you want her snape he asked then she tormented me for six years my lord i want her as my personal slave revenge my lord he answered and tightened his grip on hermione arms to show he was serious voldemort seemed to like the possessive display you can have her snape but you have full responsibility for her if she escapes you die of course my lord snape said and lowered both of them to kiss the hem of voldemort robes i ask permission to leave my lord and he had left the gathering with hermione apparating them both to his shabby house at spinner end he took her to one of the small rooms on the second floor of the house and examined her for any serious injury she hadntsaid anything since he had first touched her he had healed her minor cuts and bruises as best he could trying not to touch her any more than necessary draping a threadbare blanket over her still form he made to leave the room for a moment he had his right hand on the doorknob when she decided to break the silence thank you he had frozen in place upon hearing those undeserving words coming from her mouth he had closed his eyes for a moment and had left her in the room only coming back to bring her food and some books for the remainder of her stay he couldntface her and yet today the consequences of those actions had just left his office a child his child a rape child rage built in his guts escaping from his eyes when they snapped open once more glowering in the fire light he rose from his kneeling position taking his anger out on his desk in an attempt to lessen his frustration if he felt he couldntforgive himself before now he just wanted to bury himself with his honor and albus dumbledore in the white tomb by the lake hermione sat by her desk in the study in her apartment unaware of the man raging in his office back at hogwarts she had left the castle soon after she had spoken with snape that morning her work at the university had kept her mind away from the day events but with no distractions now she couldntavoid them anymore severus had saved nathan not knowing he was saving his own son a freak of destiny she thought seeing snape had brought back feelings she thought she didnthave anymore she had felt uneasy in his presence the fact that she bore a secret of catastrophic magnitude didnthelp matters in anyway he hadntchanged much from the last time she had seen him not physically and not in his behavior from what she had learned from nathan the way he treated her in the classroom was yet more proof of that why canthe accept gratitude she mused he always comes up with the done my duty speech she shook her head the image of his hands working with the potions vials came to her mind then he still skilful in every movement she thought it reminded her of the first time she had seen snape in that first potions class back when she was just a first year his passionate speech the way he manipulated the ingredients and utensils it reminded her of nathan she sighed her secret once again haunting her the fact that she had met snape after such a long time had brought the night she had been captured by the death eaters to the front of her mind it was a painful memory that haunted her dreams and made her wake up with tears in her eyes while conscious though hermione had no dread at the remembrance she was thankful for severus presence at that gathering for she would be dead otherwise he was the most courageous man she knew his courage had exceeded all her expectations that night she had already been resigned to her fate of being raped and killed when she heard his voice saying she was his when he had knelt by her she knew what he was going to do and though she was scared she also trusted him she knew he hadntliked it any more than she had but he had done what he had to do to save her life and she thanked him for that she knew he regretted what he was forced to do by the way he treated her afterwards the nine days she had spent as his guest he had barely directed a word to her he didntlook her in the eyes or spend more than the necessary time in the room he had arranged for her he had permitted her access to his extensive library but she had never met him there even after the war had ended during his hearing they had exchanged very few words by then she already knew she was pregnant and had decided not to tell him he would never have permitted her to continue with it and she wanted to have the child she had promised herself that she would tell him when the pregnancy achieved the point where no abortion could be made safely but hadnthad the courage the same happened when nathan was born and the secret haunted her even now but through all of that she was left with nathan the most precious gift life could have ever given her she longed for the day she would be able to tell him about his father but feared the day would never come what she saw today at hogwarts wasntvery encouraging snape didntseem to have changed at all how could she face him she didntknow the night she had spent on the chair by nathan bed was starting to get to her she was tired and her back ached she stood and left the study for a most deserving bath she had to catch up with the work she had neglected to attend the headmistress call tomorrow will be a full day she thought a n angst i know but it has to be like this i hope i hadntoffended anyone with that little scene well now you know
