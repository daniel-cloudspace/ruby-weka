 shattered moments by rurouni star part ii in what i ve come to call the twisted timeline series the first was out of time i hope this one has a few surprises in it and that everyone enjoys it at least as much as the last because this is where the meat of the story is now that we ve gotten past the preliminaries get ready for your obligatory dark angst ridden rs fic yay also i realize that i made a lot of people wait a very very long time for this and i am very sorry school was simply put hell this year luckily next year is going to be almost laughably easy because of it i probably overly pleased with myself and overly optimistic but there you are i hope everyone enjoys this one because now that i reread it i actually did myself thanks for all the reviews and even the bugging to get the sequel done i did sort of need it p prologue nothing of course begins at the time you think it did lillian hellman hermione dear you ve got a letter from one of your friends the so named girl groaned blinking awake blearily and rubbing at her eyes she looked about in the dark room for her lamp flailing about a bit and managing to knock a glass of water to the floor in her movements crookshanks asleep on top of her yowled unhappily as he was displaced in her efforts hermione gritted her teeth as she found the switch and ran her fingers through her hair ron or harry whoever it was was going to be very sorry indeed for sending an owl at this time of night if her mother werenta night owl pardoning the pun of course she d probably have been in a great deal of trouble she stumbled down the stairs blinking in the sudden light and trying to focus her vision on her mother she was holding something in her hands cupped something that resembled a little tennis ball with feathers glued on dive bombed her hermione screeched while her mother looked on with amusement it seems fond of you the older woman remarked hermione managed to catch the excited owl with effort and turned to frown at her mother you could ve warned me she said sourly then yipped in surprise as the owl in her hands nipped at a finger hooting happily she looked down at it frustratedly i getting to you she told it crossly when she looked up again her mother was smiling gently hands in the pockets of her cotton robe it cute isntit the woman said hermione snorted the mottle feathered bird struggled in her grasp as she endeavored to untie a letter from its leg i d use a different word but sure her mother was still staring at it with a kind of wistful expression on her face do you think we ought to get you an owl hermione the girl blinked pausing in her efforts and looked up in surprise whyever should you want to do that she asked confused and slightly defensive i have crookshanks you know the brown haired woman held up her hands in a conciliatory manner mouth curled upward in a strangely mischievous smile that hermione couldnthelp but think looked wrong on a parent figure nothing against your cat of course she said i do love him you know that it just that owls seem so useful and i canthelp but think you could find a rather pretty one hermione inwardly groaned the woman she was supposed to see as a mother but usually ended up treating like an older best friend loved animals of all kinds but when it came down to it she always ended up taking care of them while her mother monopolized their affections in her uncanny way crookshanks unwittingly proved her right as he slunk out from the door sourly moving toward her mother the woman knelt down and let him into her lap right in the middle of the hallway cooing as he turned over to let her rub his stomach oh be that way then hermione muttered to the ungrateful cat crookshanks ignored her as she went back into her room with the owl tightly in hand she closed the door behind her with her foot ignoring tiredly the mess of water on the floor and sitting down on her bed to pull the letter free this was probably ron new familiar he d been talking about getting a one after scabbers had disappeared hermione froze as she saw the handwriting on the outside the tight curled letters that said hermione the thought hit her belatedly that harry and ron had both already written at least once and that she d already sent harry his cake and present a giddy kind of relief took her as she hurriedly unfurled the scroll ignoring the bird who was now bouncing about her room like a tiny tornado she d been so worried when sirius hadntsent anything though she had tried to convince herself there were reasons in truth she d half feared he d forgotten about her unlikely or brushed her off as a minor concern all too likely but here here was the evidence that she d not been forgotten or pushed aside she scanned the letters eagerly looking for news on the man she d helped hide at hogwarts the year before h i sorry i haventbeen able to write before now things were rather hectic while i was trying to find a hiding place luckily i dontthink anyone spotted me so far naturally i canttell you where i am though i will say i d come here for vacation any day you ll be happy to know that buckbeak been changed back and settled into a forest somewhere on the continent incidentally i wouldntworry about his hunting instincts he seemed to adjust just like you suspected immediately took off after some rodent or other when we set down i wish him all the luck in the world i hope your summer is going well have harry and ron been writing regularly i wish i could get harry a birthday present but i somewhat badly placed to do so you ll have to get him something very good for me and let me repay you when i get back there was a brushed surface where she could barely make out that something had been written then sanded over unsuccessfully then scratched out altogether hermione blinked but moved her gaze farther down to where the writing continued what kind of schedule have you made yourself for next year i hope you re not taking twelve classes again there only so many times i can bail you out on principle hopefully you wontbe needing that timeturner again in fact i would really advise you to drop some classes if you still require it moony told me before i left that no student has ever used one for two years running i afraid i have to go now but write back if you can the owl knows the way back you can go ahead and name it if you want as i haventbothered to yet best wishes s hermione bit her lip rereading the letter more closely this time he d purposefully included the last part about the timeturner of that she had no doubt but why he would bother to worm it in so casually she couldntdetermine perhaps he really was just worried about her dropping dead from the strain she shook her head too tired to think seriously about it on any level the girl stowed the letter in the drawer next to her bed then eyed the still jittery owl warily as it settled on her lap looking at her with wide unblinking eyes you mind staying here for the night she asked it it hopped once hooting happily and going to nip her finger she drew it back hurriedly and smiled in a forced way that okay she told it let just settle you in for the night if you go back to mum i sure she ll give you something to eat she probably shouldntfoist the energetic thing off on her mother but the woman was usually all too willing when it came to animals except when it came to the dirty jobs hermione opened the door for it to fly out then picked up the glass on the floor and set it empty onto her bedside table the spill would need a towel obviously but she was really feeling very tired biting guiltily at her lip hermione wiped the water up with her spare blanket inwardly vowing to put it in the wash in the morning she crawled into bed then and turned out the light drifting into a restless kind of sleep the golden timeturner glimmered untouched on her dresser shattered moments by rurouni star you ve got questions i ve got some answers some 1 why is he blond which he are you talking about i was making a little snide reference to a malfoy related person in the crowd all those inbred pure blood families there had to be one snicker 2 hermione is pretty sure the imperius memory is real she remembers sirius trying to alter it himself as well as his shying around the subject which is why she wrote her letter of course 3 i ve got three more sequels to iron out any subplots that dontfinish in this one lol i in no hurry actually i ve got them all planned out as to what goes where in what year but shh i not supposed to tell you er right 4 harry is a lot more unsettled he doesntknow that sirius isntreally after him he doesnthave as many people to count on and he had no one to talk to about his scar dream at the beginning he feels as though he has to work harder to stand on his own which is why he resisting harder 5 harry thinks there something wrong with hermione but he not sure what and she already asked him politely to stay out of something once and being hermione she can always plead the insane by way of schoolwork bit 6 george ah george i keep saying that because he plot centric and yeah important so i cantever say very much about him 7 there already a bit of a twist in the visions but it hard to catch you ll hit yourself on the forehead later if i do my job right 8 and hedwig was probably not intercepted she wasntsporting any injuries or being hissy chapter 9 the delegations look not mournfully into the past it comes not back again wisely improve the present it is thine go forth to meet the shadowy future without fear henry wadsworth longfellow monday morning there was a notice about the delegations from the other schools it said they would arrive on friday cutting short her last period hermione found she really couldntcare about the shortened class all things considered not only was it insignificant in the long run it was also potions double at that ron echoed her sentiments almost immediately and harry gained a spring in his step as they walked to herbology directly after in care of magical creatures however hermione lost any euphoria the announcement might have given her draco malfoy was standing alone on the other side of the clearing poking at a blast ended skrewt with a stick i ll be right back she muttered tightly to harry and ron they looked after her with alarmed expressions as she strode over to the pale haired boy anger in her steps you she said and though it wasntloud her target looked up at her with a smirk me he agreed what is it now buck tooth he had barely a moment to react before her wand was sticking into his stomach you modified my memory hermione hissed the smug expression disappeared his eyes widened and for once in his life draco malfoy seemed speechless you could be expelled she said quietly eyes flashing furiously the only reason i haventsaid anything to anyone mind you is that you helped me once malfoy seemed to regain his composure slightly then and he stood straighter i saved your wretched little hide you ungrateful mudblood he told her with a sneer i suppose you remember what other wonderful ideas my father was having at the time she flushed at the memory still hazy of being commanded to shine lucius malfoy shoes you didntexactly stop him did you she gritted out i dontsuppose you ve ever been under the influence of an unforgivable malfoy stepped back abruptly and grabbed her wrist tightly the tips of his fingers dug through the cloth to pinch her skin dontpresume anything about me mudblood he bit out slowly i came back and looked for you which is more than anyone else in my position would have done now put away your little wand and go back to class and if you ever his eyes flashed tell anyone about that particular event is he bothering you hermione came a cool welcome voice from behind them she turned her head to see harry and ron standing very close behind her harry who had spoken had his wand out and very clearly pointed in malfoy direction malfoy let her go with a hateful glare quite the opposite potter now if you ll excuse me class is starting hermione found herself in an awkward position as he brushed past her angrily what the bloody hell was that all about ron demanded hermione rubbed at her arm looking at the ground he had looked for her why should she believe him he was probably just trying to keep her from telling anyone nothing she said finally hating herself for it i thought i heard him say something and after that she refused to talk about it 000000 friday potions class while shorter than a double block seemed even longer than usual snape kept hovering about their cauldrons sneering at their work and making discouraging noises that sounded potentially fatal hermione found to her chagrin that she d been so busy trying to ignore malfoy that she d added a pinch more sulfur than she d needed to snape gloried in pointing it out and docked her points for it as she quickly balanced the mixture by the time the hour finally came for them to walk out to meet the delegations students were fidgeting restlessly in their seats and at least four of them had gotten detentions for horrible defects in their work neville of course was an old standby his cauldron melted into a little puddle at his feet and had to be roped off to later be cleaned up specially snape overly hooked nose was twitching irritatedly as he snapped for them to leave it was obvious he was unhappy about the disruption of the arriving delegations but hermione had the strangest feeling that it was something more and that she really ought to know what it was she shoved the thought away as they rushed out to the front of the school to watch the foreign students arrive it turned out to be a bit of a wait actually at five minutes seamus next to them began to fiddle with his cloak pin parvati sulked at professor mcgonagall back while fingering the butterfly clip she d been ordered to remove from her hair soon hermione herself was staring boredly at the back of a sixth year hufflepuff head she almost missed the call one of the boys made spotting the speck in the distance hermione ron hissed poking her in the side with his elbow look her eyes followed the line of his pointing finger she squinted as she strained to see what he was talking about then she looked a bit to the right and saw it it well whatever it was it was coming closer by the second hagrid who had at the last minute decided to come down to watch let out a sigh like a bellows the moment the giant blue horses came into view arn they beau iful hermione however found she was much more interested in the giant carriage they were pulling it landed lightly in front of the school but came to a slightly shuddering stop afterward one door opened followed by a student that pulled down some very gaudy golden steps hermione wrinkled her nose she d always despised public displays of grandeur no matter how necessary they might be sometimes ron let out a low whistle as the first large foot appeared hermione decided during the proceeding events that she didntvery much like either beauxbatons or durmstrang headmasters she wasntsure what she d been expecting precisely probably two little carbon copies of dumbledore with twinkling eyes and mysterious manners it was interesting though not as interesting as ron seemed to think that viktor krum was still a student when she d seen him at the world cup he d seemed much older perhaps because he had been wearing an international quidditch uniform instead of a school one at first she found herself soured on him because of his star treatment but that was soon replaced by a strange kind of vindication as she saw him subtly push away his headmaster with his trademark scowl hermione decided vaguely that he might be a likeable person after all not that it much mattered as she probably wasntgoing to even talk to him oh please shut your mouth ron she said peevishly as his jaw dropped open harry grinned at her from his other side as they began to file back into the great hall for the welcoming feast just as hermione was about to follow the crowd however her eye caught on a tiny speck of brown rocketing over the crowd toward her what the very familiar feathered little ping pong ball hit her directly in the chest she gasped in surprise and risked a quick glance at harry and ron they were walking away from her oblivious hermione closed her robes over the excitedly chirping owl as they walked inside then she snuck away to a bathroom on the right side hurrying herself into a stall and carefully allowing the owl into her cupped hands she tried to pull a rolled up parchment from its leg geronimo hopped about with alarming regularity however and it took her a while to finally calm the thing down long enough to snatch the letter from it with trembling fingers she unrolled her reply it was disappointingly short and incredibly infuriating you re keeping dangerous secrets as well i should point out i kept a disturbing incident from you that wouldnthave helped much i d say we re more than even i afraid i cantwrite much at the moment i slightly busy i hope you re well and that was that hermione crumpled up the parchment angrily then took out her wand and incinerated it for good measure how dare he it my memory she hissed he has no right geronimo hooted sadly at her looking at the ashes on the floor he was probably disappointed he wouldnthave anything to take back hermione felt a tension headache beginning at her temples and she massaged at them with clenched teeth she gave the owl a scathing look he doesntget a reply she told it go on back if you could talk i d ask you to tell him from me that he a bloody git geronimo blinked without comprehending and she let her head fall against the stall door with a groan just go she told it with a wave of her hand the owl chirped and nudged at her hand reluctantly she stroked it along its head it cooed happily and she found herself calming down slightly as it nuzzled into her touch fine she muttered feeling a little better come on and i ll get you something to snack on she hid the owl inside her robes again continuing to stroke it to keep it calm and left the bathroom to head for dinner it wasntas bad as she d thought it would be slipping in during dinner everyone was much too preoccupied with everything else going on and she decided that her excuse would be that she d slipped back to the commonroom thinking she d forgotten something but as it turned out harry and ron hadnteven noticed her absence viktor krum was sitting next to harry and ron along with the rest of his school delegation trying not to feel incredibly furious hard as she was already halfway there hermione stalked over to her usual spot and threw a glare their way harry at least had the decency to look slightly guilty as she picked up a piece of buttered bread krum looked up surprised as she reached over his shoulder his brows knit together i haff not taken your seat i hope he asked in a heavily accented voice sounding genuinely concerned hermione tried very hard not to snap at him dontworry about it she said in what she hoped was a relatively even voice i ll find another she added with a scathing look ron way his face was rapt with admiration he didnthear her oh for goodness sake she muttered looking about the table for a free seat geronimo inside her robes began to hoot unhappily luckily no one seemed to notice in the din of the hall seeing no free seats she expelled her breath sharply i ll just eat in the commonroom then shall i krum made as though to get up but at that moment someone called her name we ll make some space dontworry fred said from across the table she tried not to seem too relieved as she pulled herself over to him even as she became unnerved at the slightly older crowd about she realized too late that she was now sitting between the twins george on her other side turned around suddenly to talk with lee jordan fine then she muttered tartly beneath her breath she slipped a bit of bread to geronimo as she turned her attention to fred thank you she said i didntreally think it wise to budge up ron big idol fred was grinning insanely at her probably not he d sulk for days then inexplicably he shoved something into her hand many somethings they were round metal and gold now that she opened her hand you he said blissfully are a genius hermione blinked you donttell me you ve sold it he said happily lots of it hermione put her head in her hands how many and to whom she asked miserably fred shrugged canttell you that but i thinking professor snape going to have a very bad week and gryffindor no doubt going to lose a lot of points she muttered back her stomach grumbled at that point and she decided to push it out of her mind she would deal with it once it happened just as she was reaching for a bit of casserole however the food disappeared hermione cursed in a very un hermione like way thankfully no one seemed to hear geronimo let out a miserable noise and she let her breath out through her teeth be right back she said to fred getting quickly to her feet as dumbledore began to walk toward the front before he could ask why she was out the door again hermione nibbled on her bread irritatedly as she let the poor bird free it flew out a window into the cool night air and she resented it suddenly for not having any worries other than feed me and love me her list of people to hit over the head was growing by the minute some of them hadnteven offended her yet as she looked inside and saw that dumbledore was speaking she decided that she was tired enough that it didntmatter blast the rules and all but she was going back up to her dormitory and going to bed yes that sounded good shattered moments by rurouni star oh crudmuffins answering time donahermurphy aka she who asks the unanswerable questions the locket is a locket with pretty music ye es and krum is also krum george gets shown again here and sirius really strikes me as that kind of person i right you re wrong go back to your daily life and stay out of mine even to people he actually likes all your other questions are so unanswerable you re incorrigible kou shun u there was a line that gave me inspiration for the table switching thing it went something like this psst budge up hermione hurry oh it too late they ve gone over to the slytherin table not verbatim but it made me wonder a little especially if krum caught sight of harry scar without hermione blocking it miranda your name is the same as my best friend s coincidentally so just because of that i ll answer all your questions fully sirius is talking about a couple of secrets she kept from him among them the fact that the boggart turned into him that she seeing future things etc he obviously doesntknow what these are but he rather quick on the uptake so he knows they re there snape bad mood is snape not getting the job again and also having to see karkaroff again as it was in the actual book krum and hermione will not get permanently together and neither will ron hermione because i personally dislike those ships too krum and hermione may end up going to the ball together but that just a fun sirius hermione jealousy opportunity rita may or may not end up in a jar depending how it gets written i honestly dontknow yet athenethegrey ooh but you did mention the f word horrible well fleur does exist she just not as noticeable yet i dontknow whether she ll end up playing a big part or not but she there and yes hermione is awesome at that by now mostly because i hate typing out things that have already happened so everyone enjoy the chapter and know that you will get little of import out of me these things happen in their due time after all er in some time anyway chapter 10 the four champions a thing worth having is a thing worth cheating for w c fields as it turned out she had a bit too much homework to go straight to bed quite a bit hermione cursed her timeturner her situation and even her father for giving her his type a genes crookshanks sitting by the fire stretched lazily and gave her what had to be the cat equivalent of a smug look ooh she told him i have to find something for you to do all day he being a cat did not respond a few minutes later the rest of gryffindor piled through the door causing her already magnificent headache to intensify harry in particular stopped to sit next to her silently while ron drifted up the stairs like a lovesick little girl though she might might have been a little overly critical he cleared his throat uneasily after the rest had disappeared er hermione didntlook up from her arithmancy book harry sighed he was talking about the wronski feint he pleaded in a pained voice hermione turned her page though she hadntread all of the last he said he would teach it to me sometime her teeth clenched and she closed her book a bit more sharply than she might should have please go upstairs before i say something i shouldn t she told him harry let out something that sounded like an erp and complied hermione was left alone with her books and her cat and her stupid timeturner her stomach gurgled again she sighed and decided that her homework might possibly be able to wait until the next morning you seem a bit hungry a familiar voice observed dryly hermione jumped her book tumbling from her lap she looked up to see george weasley regarding her with a more serious expression than she might have expected and was that food she breathed forgetting for the moment that she was extremely unhappy with him he shrugged and passed her the small covered basket in his right hand hermione pulled the still deliciously warm meal from it and took a large bite of chicken george eyed her with a frown you re insane i think he said after she finished the quick meal she glanced up at him questioningly he gestured at the edge of his mouth and she wiped a bit of gravy away from it why do you say that she asked george sat down in a nearby chair you skipped a speech by dumbledore and dinner but still hermione leaned back feeling a bit better about her horrible evening it been a long day she said then as though realizing who she was talking to for the first time why are you even talking to me i thought you were ignoring me george blinked surprised really i thought you were ignoring me it took hermione a second to work this out but she came to the conclusion that it didntmuch matter who was ignoring who she was still quite unhappy with him or well should have been before she could open her mouth however he spoke i think i understand what you meant though her mouth closed her brow knit in confusion george turned to look at her peculiarly what did he ask you to do he asked her it hit her a moment later what he was talking about lupin he asked me to take out my wand george continued quietly and then he asked me to point it at the little golden scales on his desk and i did a strange lump appeared in her stomach hermione swallowed it hit me he said then in a slightly trembling voice that fred was right behind me he could have asked me to point it at him and i i would ve done it too hermione closed her eyes and let her breath out slowly you might be surprised she told him i dontthink you would have george was silent for a moment i guess i sorry he said finally he got up then and she heard his steps up the stairwell hermione pulled her feet up to her chest and leaned her head against the chair contemplating 000000 when hermione woke up the next morning she realized she was still in the commonroom chair her back immediately twinged as she sat up alerting her to the fact that she was probably going to be sore for the rest of the morning sighing she collected her things and slipped out the portrait noticing as she did that it was rather early in the morning drat her internal clock she decided that she might as well get her homework done and perhaps come back later for a quick nap the library of course was empty of course madam pince gave her a warm look as she walked to one of the tables setting her things down clearly she thought all students should have been doing what she was doing but then hermione thought moodily all students didnthave ten classes of homework to do the timeturner had been wearing on her slightly it was true the added work was fairly bad though the problems with the visions which may or may not have been linked to the timeturner were incredibly mild this year she didntknow whether to be thankful or not it was while she was looking through hogwarts a history for some history of magic material that she came upon a very disturbing passage death toll of only one of the three contestants to an extra potent misfired stunning hex the other contestant from durmstrang claimed accidental firing but when the matter was further looked into the hogwarts contestant gave pensival evidence to the contrary hermione swallowed flipping back to the index and then to the next incident of the triwizard tournament she scanned the page with mounting foreboding death because of a failed fire protection charm most likely due to a panic attack official cause of death was written as third degree burns on the face and extremities oi hermione she gasped and choked back a startled shriek jumping up and banging her shin against the study desk she d been sitting at a sharp pain on her thumb alerted her to the fact that she d managed to get herself a paper cut er sorry about that fred said sheepishly but good thing you re here wanted to talk to you about something george was standing behind him looking fairly uneasy hermione became wary what is it now she asked you know i never agreed to helping you more than that once strangely this didntdampen his spirit in the least yes well i was actually wondering about something else you might ah just help me a tiny bit with some research she gave him a stony look waiting for his purpose to become clear perhaps you might know where i d figure out how to get over an age line he finished looking decidedly shifty hermione frowned why on earth would you need to know how to get over an age line she asked fred smiled innocently research he repeated his twin behind him smacked his forehead with his hand there an age restriction on the tournament entries george said seventeen you missed it but you enter by putting your name in the goblet fred looked scandalized by his brother blatant disregard for his lying george he said sounding betrayed hermione lips thinned i think it was a very good idea on dumbledore part to put the age line there she said i assuming it was him george nodded looking fairly unconcerned by his twin unhappiness with him i told you she wouldntdo it he informed fred why dontyou just do the research yourself i dontthink you should enter hermione interrupted feeling slightly queasy either of you or or anyone for that matter they both looked at her as though she d gone crazy people have died before she said in a small voice fred rolled his eyes oh come on he said that was ages ago besides you dontthink they d actually set us things that would kill us they have before she said and it wasntalways the challenges sometimes it was the other students fred was taking this much too lightly for her sanity and george lord george was looking just as enthusiastic which really frightened her dontyou dare she said i ll i ll tell mcgonagall who really set that dung bomb i ll tell snape about the fred hand slapped over her mouth quickly shush he said in a panicked voice madam pince isnt that far off she pulled away i will she said fiercely i haventever threatened you two with anything you ve said to me before but so help me i will fred crossed his arms you wouldntdare he said we ve got just as much on you george raised his hands leave me out of that one he said quickly hermione had the impression that he wasntkeen on incurring her wrath again quite so soon fred sighed frustratedly well i ve got just as much hermione felt her nails dig into the desk edge well there something you ought to know she snapped i really dontcare what you say about me because i care more about someone life than a stupid detention fine then fred said fine she retorted and fine he finished grasping for words he spun on his heel with a red face stalking away george stayed to contemplate her with a strange face yes well he said erm hurriedly he pulled his wand and grabbed her wrist muttering something he grinned at her quickly then stalked off in imitation of his brother hermione blinked and looked down at her unblemished thumb well well i could ve done that she said to herself trying to find her anger unfortunately all she managed to come up with was confusion she didntnotice that she d gained a curious dark haired spectator from the other end of the library and even after she left she truly believed she d been the only one there 000000 when breakfast time arrived she hurried down to pick it up not wanting to miss another meal she remembered belatedly that she technically had no seat and that her safety and identity as a human being with four separate limbs might be in jeopardy should she risk sitting next to fred again she ended up standing at the end of the table nibbling on her lip nervously oddly viktor krum caught sight of her and waved her over ve are missing someone today he offered though it really is no trouble ve could sit vith the slytherins hermione made a face and sat down in the offered seat feeling much more generous toward him than before i wouldntwant to she said darkly i wontcondemn you to it he laughed at this and she decided that after all viktor krum was a decent sort of person just as she was moving to take her breakfast however her good mood disappeared fred george and lee jordan were all walking confidently toward the goblet in the middle of the hall krum watched them intently probably weighing possible competition now that she thought about it he d probably already put his name in hermione clenched her hands as she prayed mentally they stopped just short of the gold line on the floor students had stopped to watch with bated breath well fred muttered no time like the present and he stepped forward over the line hermione shoulders slumped slightly bang fred flew backward into lee blinking george face turned comical as he edged backward from the line a pop sounded throughout the hall next and fred was suddenly looking down at a long white beard silence and then fred began to laugh i might have warned you mr weasley dumbledore said stepping toward the staff table with twinkling eyes though you might consider keeping the beard it is very nice george helped his brother up with one last longing look at the goblet before they left for the infirmary hermione let out a breath she hadntknown she was holding it makes me vonder what those two vould use a thousand galleons on krum observed hermione blinked as she realized that he had just hit on the exact reason they d wanted to enter in the first place of course fred and george had wanted to enter their business she felt slightly guilty at the sudden thought but decided she stood by her earlier decision wordlessly she began to eat her breakfast she did indeed end up taking her short nap though it wasntquite as short or as peaceful as she might have wanted it if her soul existed it surely had to be a tattered thing by now i so sorry george how did that make it any better he tested her grip on his hand and found it tight he looked at her with a slightly curious expression i think i going to follow him her breath caught you but it ll be with a bang he told her he rose easily then smiled at her and ruffled her hair like he used to george gave her a wink on his way out the door but all it did was make her want to cry when she woke up hermione felt if anything more tired than when she d gone to sleep a strange dream was receding into the depths of her mind and even as she tried to understand it it disappeared completely frowning turning to look at the time she gasped she d missed dinner she d missed the goblet hermione stumbled from her bed toward the door hoping ron or harry would be able to tell her who they were she noticed even before she got downstairs that there were many more people in the commonroom than normal cheers and laughter were erupting from below hermione smiled to herself there was a gryffindor champion then what a turn of luck as she exited the stairs though she caught sight of fred weasley and her smile disappeared instantly fred face was clouded he was looking at her with a mix of anger and hurt she blinked and backed into another student wondering if he was still angry about her reticence in helping him with the age line so he said loudly come down to celebrate hermione rubbed at her arms celebrate what she asked feeling uneasy did angelina make it fred glared at her and she felt her brows knit in confusion he turned away however and hermione found herself left in the dark so how d you do it asked someone from behind her she whirled about to see george leaning against the wall looking as though he d been brooding for a while do what she asked i really dontknow what you re talking about i just woke up get his name in the goblet that what george insisted with a faintly annoyed expression look you donthave to hide it from me we both know you re the brains behind everything harry does harry hermione said what does this have to do with harry she blinked then looked around speaking of which where is harry i d have thought he d be celebrating too you d think so george agreed mildly seeing as he one of the champions hermione stared at him for a moment then broke out laughing george face turned surprised even as she began to talk you re having me on she said fred idea i take it to get me back for not helping him when his expression didntchange she blinked oh you didntseriously expect me to believe harry somehow got himself across the age line and beat out all those older students besides which he would tell me at george now troubled face she began to doubt you are joking hermione said uncertainly george slowly let out his breath you didnthelp him hermione thought to say something to this but found her voice was no longer working when it finally did work she said i i think i need to sit down george blinked as she began to slide down the wall he moved forward to steady her but got there only a moment too late hermione put a hand to her head feeling if possible even worse than before awkwardly george sat down next to her er fred thought you d done it he offered said all of that stuff about it being too dangerous threatened him and all then helped harry in hermione turned her head to glare at him of course i wouldnthelp harry in she hissed it the last thing i d want to do he too young we haventeven covered half the spells the champions needed to survive in the last competitions george cleared his throat uncertainly then ah d you think harry might ve done it himself before hermione would have given him a direct answer to the negative of course harry hadntput himself in did he think he was stupid but of course he had been stupid before i ll get back to you on that hermione said she rose unsteadily to her feet then grabbed the rail and hurried up the stairs to the boys dormitories harry she yelled knocking heavily on the door harry open up that door this instant hermione heard a murmuring voice inside very quiet she lifted her fist to knock again but the door lifted away before she could bring it to bear with one look at the boy that had answered the door hermione knew he hadnteven contemplated the idea of entering himself harry she said breathlessly what all this about i ve just woken up and george says you re one of the champions harry grabbed her arm and pulled her inside shutting the door behind her as he did so hermione realized something where where ron she asked god forbid he didntget himself chosen too harry jerked his head toward a bed its hangings tightly shut and hermione walked over to it quickly ron she said are you getting dressed or something no response oh for she pulled aside the bed hangings to see a fully dressed ron weasley staring resentfully at the ceiling would you stop that hermione asked him impatiently we have to talk about this ron looked over at her what ve we got to talk about he asked harry the fourth champion congrats and all can i go to bed now you re a great help hermione snarled at him you ve got no idea what this means have you harry had sit down on his bed now looking shell shocked ron was ignoring her again half the champions in the last triwizard tournaments have died ron she said i dontcare what safety precautions they say they re taking harry much too young to be competing so ask him why he put his name in then ron told her hotly grabbing the bed hangings and pulling them shut again with a snap hermione clenched her fists then quite deliberately she pulled her wand and swished it through the hangings they disappeared with a pop you she said are going to listen to me i know this seems like another thing happening to harry but for god sake ron try and remember what kinds of things happen to harry quidditch seeker ron fired off sitting up suddenly youngest one in a century hermione a basilisk a turban wearing freak dementors and a mass murderer she interrupted him fiercely and lord voldemort if you ve forgotten ron stared at her hermione flushed suddenly and put a trembling hand to her mouth since when had she been able to say his full name you ve really changed hermione you know that ron said hoarsely there was silence for a very long while finally though ron deflated fine he said i dontthink harry put his name in the stupid goblet he said then looking over at the so named he scowled and drew a hand through his hair hear that harry hermione sighed in relief then we just need to figure out who did it and why could ve been fred and george ron muttered resentfully bet they d love doing something like that to me believe me hermione said quickly it wasntfred and george ron shrugged i ve really got no clue it could ve been any number of people harry sighed i not really sure i want to know hermione froze suddenly understanding something ron had said before wait she said the fourth champion arentthere three ron still looking annoyed began to explain shattered moments by rurouni star first mandatory hbp non specific jabber i finished mine in 5 hours which is not as good as one of my friends who did a 2 5 hour run all in all great book but lots and lots of bombshells i was gaping by the end and i so hated hermione characterization in there nothing else to be said er yes second question answers 1 i wouldntdream of putting hermione in the tournament harry is the one with the blood and all so it seems stupid to put her in there instead of him despite the fact that this is a hermione centric series harry is still the one fighting voldemort 2 i may be making hermione a little too capable but i cantstand writing sappy stupid teens i happen to be one myself and while a good deal of us seem to act that way according to the majority of hp fanfiction i certainly don t so yes hermione is a little more capable and in the name of canon i claim butterfly effect p 3 the fight is somewhat prevented ron may sulk a bit but i cantwrite him well because of his irrationality the real reason the fight didnthappen i cantget into the head of someone acting so stupid ron bashing sorry 4 donahermurphy thank you for the flattery it ll so get you everywhere p 5 i see magical power as a matter of part practice part understanding hermione has a natural knack for understanding complicated concepts the second and is good at retaining knowledge she may learn a few spells early but it about the same as looking in a book if she picks them up it only because she already has the ability to do so chapter 11 preparations worry is a misuse of imagination dan zadra at breakfast on sunday the first thing hermione noticed was that the durmstrang students had moved from the gryffindor table to sit with the slytherins secondly she noticed that there was an empty seat directly between harry and ron feeling a little warmth in her heart she sat down into her niche and immediately felt better despite it all ron who seemed to have regained his indignation on harry behalf was scowling at the durmstrang students they only came over in the first place because krum saw harry scar he muttered handing her a slice of buttered toast hermione hadntknown this but decided it didntreally matter all that much the short of it seemed to be that she d misjudged viktor krum there were more important things in the long run for instance i ll be right back she told ron and donteat my toast professor lupin was just coming in the door looking slightly haggard the full moon had been only two days prior hermione he acknowledged what can i do for you she scowled but not at him i was wondering whether you d sent the news off to your friend yet she said intentionally vague lupin frowned he hasntsent me an owl in months he said once he got it into his head to chase down peter wait he what said hermione surprised lupin sighed i ll talk to you after breakfast in my office he said as hermione sat back down in her seat frowning she noticed her toast was gone ron whistled innocently 000000 at first she didntsee him despite the fact that he was sitting at his desk perhaps it was because he was once again so tired he could barely sit up straight two days after the full moon indeed sit down lupin said have a cup of tea hermione despite the fact that she d just had breakfast did just that sirius was supposed to come back to stay in london during the school year lupin said suddenly hermione coughed on her tea caught slightly off guard she d expected him to make a bit of small talk before launching into more serious matters perhaps he was simply tired so he didn t she asked cautiously setting the teacup down lupin sighed no of course not think who we re talking about here hermione snorted point taken he was spotted in albania her professor continued which when coupled with what we ve learned from harry makes me believe he must be trailing peter as i mentioned before hermione tried and failed to hide her apprehension but you dontthink he d really i mean he a hunted wizard and going after peter would just put him in more danger he couldntexactly go to the local ministry if something happened which means absolutely nothing to him lupin finished quietly he stared down at his own untouched tea pensively hermione let her breath out in a huff well as soon as you owl him about the tournament he ll rather have come back wonthe she said peevishly if he cares all that much about harry lupin raised his eyebrows at her if you think you can get through to him then by all means try he been sending back my letters unopened thus far hermione felt her face turn cloudy a knot had grown in her stomach as lupin talked she d just sent back her only real link to sirius what if he wouldntaccept a different owl worse what if he did something reckless as lupin was obviously fearing i going to the owlery she said someone got to make him see some reason dontworry too much lupin said tiredly he a grown man he can take care of himself at her raised eyebrow he cracked a smile and also harry will be in the news at some point that reassured her more but she still wrote him a letter as politely as she could manage while still being furious with him 000000 the following week was possibly one of the worst in the history of hermione attendance at hogwarts right up there with being petrified by a giant snake and tortured by the cruciatus later she would reflect that harry had probably had an even worse week but she wasntfeeling particularly generous at the time the incident in question happened to be in double potions on friday this one not cut short at all as there were no handy delegations to greet it all started with the slytherins like most things did they d apparently found someone in their house with the required brains to enchant glowing badges all with the intent to humiliate harry from his expression she assumed it was working with one scathing look at malfoy hermione grabbed harry arm and attempted to pull him to his seat ignore him she whispered he not worth it malfoy said something she couldntquite hear though and suddenly ron was standing up with a snarl and harry was turning around more quickly than she could stop him they were facing him with drawn wands and hermione looked once to the ceiling pleadingly before moving to stop them ron shrugged off her hand as she tried to urge him back and harry quite blatantly ignored her go on then potter malfoy whispered eyes glinting malevolently you may as well get one good hit in before you croak survival rate not that high in the tournament hermione straightened and resisted the urge to pull her own wand i imagine you d be too frightened to enter even if you were of age she told him malfoy eyes flicked to her and he raised an eyebrow i imagine you should stay out of matters you dontunderstand mudblood the insult had really lost all meaning to her so it was quite easy to shrug off but as always harry and ron reacted badly raising their wands there was a flash of light something hissed through the air slamming her in the jaw before she could shield herself and a pain began to grow in her mouth by the time it all cleared malfoy and harry were standing perfectly unharmed across from each other but crabbe and goyle each sported some very nasty open boils on their faces and hermione hermione could feel her teeth growing she let out a gasp but her upper teeth bit into her bottom lip painfully and she cut it off abruptly ron seemed to be the only one to notice his fists clenched and he looked between malfoy and her as though unwilling to leave harry alone in his company the classroom wasntlooking like a very safe place to be either as it had now divided into gryffindors and slytherins all twitching as though they were dying to go for their wands thankfully parvati moved to take her arm and steer her out the door hermione might normally have worried about leaving such a tense atmosphere behind but she was currently busy being utterly humiliated why are you outside of class snapped a horribly familiar voice as they rounded the corner hermione looked up to see snape towering over them menacingly just coming from some unspecified meeting to start class she tried very hard not to whimper hermione got to go to the hospital wing parvati said she got hit by something malfoy threw snape looked about to stop them so parvati added he and harry got into a duel this shut the teacher mouth and hermione even through her embarrassment felt like stomping on parvati foot snape now looked as though christmas had come early get out of my sight he growled quickly then hurried off toward the door as parvati began to pull her along again he awfully predictable the other girl said pleasantly dontworry he would ve found out anyhow there the small matter of crabbe and goyle having giant boils on their faces hermione groaned but it came out as more of a muffled mmph 000000 when hermione got back to the dormitory she had utterly perfect teeth she nearly burst with the need to find harry and ron and see if they would notice but peculiarly neither was in the commonroom remembering suddenly that harry had probably gotten into quite a lot of trouble on her part hermione sat down heavily in an overstuffed chair and closed her eyes between him being in the tournament and trying to defend me and sirius going after peter like mad the tell tale throbbing of another tension headache began to surface as she remembered all the reasons she really wasntsupposed to be this happy at the moment well not that she was very happy now so her eyes flew open and she stumbled out of her seat george weasley was walking through the door looking at her interestedly it occurred to her that she hadnthad the time to talk to him seriously for a good long while hermione sighed miserably and rubbed at her temples fully aware that it wasntgoing to help her in the slightest harry didntenter himself she said we really dontknow who entered him for that matter george frowned as though weighing the truthfulness of her statement hermione felt a horrible wrench in her chest and she found herself holding in tears of frustration since when did i ever lie about anything so important she asked him but it sounded more as though she were begging him at this point you know i not that petty george he looked over at her surprised and she thought that perhaps he looked a little ashamed at himself now aw come on he said looking a little panicked dontcry i didn t hermione felt her features tighten as she stopped herself i wasntgoing to she gritted out at his overly relieved expression she wiped a hand down her face you re an idiot she told him i leaving she was already through the door when she heard him say surprised when did you get your teeth fixed hermione strangely her headache disappeared by the time she reached the library she was smiling very slightly 000000 hermione worrying didntexactly decrease over the next few weeks but the rush of homework added into the always problematic timeturner tended to take up most of her brain space quite apart from what people seemed to think about her she wasntvery good at keeping everything organized in her head that was what planners were for and she certainly wasntgoing to put remember to worry about mass murderer anywhere on her list no sirius didntowl her back she was torn over how she ought to feel about this on the one hand she really didntfeel like talking to him but on the other and much more prominent side of the coin she chewed her fingernails down to the bleeding point whenever she had the time to imagine peter casting the cruciatus on him not that petty lord maybe she really was when she thought about it in the meantime she discovered much to her woe that harry had had a very misleading article written about him very misleading indeed why granger a nastily familiar voice called across the hall to her one day i never knew you and the potty were so close i feel horrendous for your children though buck teeth and glasses cantyou just imagine it hermione let her breath out in irritation and tried to ignore malfoy it didnteven register until her next turn of the timeturner that he had teased her about harry instead of ron as was his usual misinterpretation her wonderings were answered however when she got to her last period of the day with harry and ron ron scowling slid her over a colorful looking daily prophet page from the moment she saw the name rita skeeter she felt a horrible sense of foreboding harry has at last found love at hogwarts one hermione granger a stunningly pretty muggle born girl who like harry is one of the top students in the school hermione frowned only two out of four she said annoyed how horrible of her two out of four ron said she decided to take it with some humor i not in love with harry and i ve never before been accused of being stunning ron mouth dropped you shouldnt that is oh please she said waving a hand i perfectly mediocre and quite proud of it that was somewhat of a lie but then every girl had to dream it seemed to satisfy ron to some extent however because he fell silent for the rest of class time slowed down for the remainder of the time between then and the first task of the tournament hermione spent her extra time in the library alternately worrying about sirius who still had not responded and trying to decide how best to prepare harry the problem of course was that they had no idea what the first task was by the saturday before the task the best she had come up with was to go over a long list of spells they d already learned and practice a few new generally useful ones until he was too tired to continue and then some if she could manage it arentyou going to hogsmeade though harry asked her when she mentioned this to him hermione scoffed you think a bunch of candy is more important than you living through this stupid thing she asked him besides i donteven eat the sugary kind she politely ignored his utterly relieved expression and took him to an empty classroom to prepare they worked their way steadily through the syllabus from first year up hermione skipped the spells she was certain he knew already and the ones that would generally be useless such as showering and hair braiding charms by the time she got up to their current level of knowledge he was already wearing out harry she said sternly as he lackadaisically beckoned at a pillow to float over to him it ignored him what he asked blinking tiredly it only seven she said i ll let you go in another thirty minutes or so but the summoning charm is really very useful and if it ll mean the difference reminded of the dire situation harry relented and gestured more forcefully at a quill on the other side of the room accio quill he said it raised itself from the table and slowly but steadily moved through the air and into his hand that good she said and she meant it let practice on getting your speed up though if there something charging you for instance all right harry said with a shudder we ll work on my speed by the end of the thirty minutes which had somewhere along the way turned into an hour and a half harry was making things zoom around quite easily hermione had just decided to see how far she could stretch his newfound determination with another spell when a knock sounded on the door er is arry in there came hagrid scratchy voice slightly muffled hermione yawned suddenly despite herself and walked over to open the door hagrid did indeed stand beyond looking slightly nervous but nonetheless very excited hagrid harry asked catching the pillow in his right hand oh yer practicin the giant man said closing the door behind him well i ah dontmean ter interrupt no no harry said with a hasty look at hermione we were just finishing she opened her mouth to protest at first but found herself suddenly unable to speak as she saw a tiny feathered shape suddenly ping into the glass window that hung over the doorway see harry said moving toward the door we can talk somewhere else er away from the practice room he turned the doorknob and pushed the door open with a creak hermione felt her heart stop as the tiny owl bolted past him toward her unnoticed geronimo flung itself into her chest chattering excitedly even as the door closed behind harry with a resounding slam he was holding a letter in a very familiar elegant script shattered moments by rurouni star this is a long chapter it ll have to last you because i going out to visit relatives until wednesday which incidentally does not guarantee that i will post on wednesday either also starting the sirius countdown two chapters from here he shows up questions are all answered in this giant paragraph firstly no one knows who hermione will go to the ball with yet as it hasnteven been announced of course that not what you were asking but that your answer anyway as for sirius he may not notice anything at all about hermione because of the way he shows up horrible tantalizing hints and i end on cliffhangers because i am an evil evil woman or possibly because i get tired and go to bed you re free to believe what you like chapter 12 the hungarian horntail challenge is a dragon with a gift in its mouth tame the dragon and the gift is yours noela evans hermione heart thudded loudly in her own ears as she stared at the letter that was clutched in her hands she forgot to breathe for just a second the blood in her ears sounded like an ocean waves crashing and ebbing strangely in the sudden silence of the room slowly as though in a dream she slid the small paper open there were only two sentences written and no signature i coming back get harry through the first task she stared at the paper for a moment dumbfounded well just what she and lupin had both been hoping for he was giving up on peter and coming back and he was going to be near harry again hermione fingered the letter nervously though and stared at it as though waiting for another few sentences to materialize such as yes i fine or i sorry i didnttell you lucius malfoy cast an unforgivable on you possibly i ve been a stupid jerk please forgive me well so that last one wasntso likely she had dreams too though hermione sighed and scratched geronimo underneath the chin i ll send something back this time she said quietly the owl cooed beneath her fingers 000000 as soon as hermione came down to the commonroom the next morning she noticed that harry was sleeping in one of the armchairs by the fire what she noted second was that he was still in his original robes suggesting that he hadnteven gone up to his dormitory in the first place had he stayed out the whole night with hagrid she moved closer to the chair brows knit with some inexplicable worry hermione stretched out her hand and tapped him very gently on the shoulder harry his eyes shot open so quickly she let out a panicked squeak and leapt back harry blinked then grinned apologetically light sleeper he told her hermione smiled back weakly so why are you down here he looked confused for a moment before enlightenment appeared on his face dragons he said hermione rubbed at her forehead trying to make sense of it all at a much too early hour of the day dragons she asked what about them harry sighed that the first task hagrid showed me even though he wasntsupposed to i ve got to fight a dragon hermione what am i going to do her mouth went dry but they they wouldn t dragons she wanted to add a dramatic but you ll be killed to the end but it probably wouldnthave been very good for his confidence he fell back into the chair looking glum i dontknow what they re doing but i ve got no idea how to fight a dragon they re immune to just about everything do you remember anything from defense against the dark arts hermione shook her head the only countermeasure in the textbook was run away she paused are you certain you have to fight them harry blinked no he said no i not i think we just have to get past one hermione narrowed her eyes and thought very very hard perhaps harder than she d ever thought in her life get harry through the first task there was no room for failure none at all she would have to do some research we re going to the library today she informed harry for once he seemed to take those words with relief rather than resignment 000000 after five hours straight in the library where had the time gone and very little progress hermione was desperate to find something i wish i could ask hagrid about all those books he has on dragons she said to harry confidentially but if anyone ever found out yeah harry muttered slamming a book shut and earning a dirty look from madame pince i dontwant him in trouble he already helped enough hermione nibbled at her bottom lip nervously staring at the sentence in front of her but not really reading it wouldntit be nice if you could just figure out a solution in a crystal ball for me harry mumbled under his breath half jokingly but hermione breath hitched could i not in a crystal ball but if she could remember how he d survived it once had this happened to that other her and the other harry she wasnteven certain things had changed at all if she could somehow trigger the damn memories god this is hopeless harry sighed letting his head fall onto the archaic book in front of him carelessly i may as well just die right here shut up harry hermione said in a hiss feeling her stomach go queasy at the thought dontyou dare talk like that even joking i was only joking hermione he muttered into the pages sounding alarmingly unconcerned she tried to block him out searching her memory for the times she d remembered things true things about the future how did they start what set them off i wish i were playing quidditch instead he sighed miserably that at least i know how to do what hermione eyes widened accio harry say it with me yes that was what she had taught it to him for harry she breathed you re a genius he looked up at her blearily i am he asked is it going to save me hermione felt her face break out into a shameless grin yes yes it is 000000 hermione didntactually sleep that night though she had the feeling that harry wasntsleeping much either he was probably up filling ron in on the gory details of his game plan her stomach twisted in worry when she got up early the next morning and she wondered inwardly if even harry was this worried for himself in point of fact he had seemed quite relieved to have a magic solution handed to him he seemed to think that hermione was infallible but what if she was wrong what if she hadntbeen drilling harry on the summoning charm for this purpose what if it had been class help or something for the owls later no no that couldntbe right this felt correct it was the right way it had to be maybe she could help him with fire protection charms tonight though the properties of spongegrass miss granger she sucked in her breath and looked up at professor sprout it absorbs caustic liquids she responded cautiously hermione let out a relieved breath as sprout beamed at her good good miss granger as usual she really needed to stop worrying her father had said it wasntgood for her stomach when harry got out of his own lessons by dinner hermione took him and ron aside and told them she was going to help harry with fire protection charms that night ron looked tempted to opt out when she mentioned using him as a test dummy but he stood a little straighter a moment later and nodded his assent hermione thought she had never been more proud of him before perhaps excepting the chess match in their first year i wish i were as good at these as wendelin the weird harry muttered to himself partway through at which point both hermione and ron looked at him in surprise you paid attention in history of magic ron asked him no he doesn t hermione said with a frown that wasntcovered in the lecture in was in summer homework harry confirmed i was eating ice cream at the time it just stuck with me you do summer homework ron asked but this time he was grinning hermione rolled her eyes and gestured them both back to their places in front of the commonroom fire my hand is going to be red for a week from this mate ron grumbled at harry you owe me it was true that harry hadntyet gotten the hang of the fire protection charms hermione wasntsure what it was there wasntanything wrong with the way he was holding his wand and his inflection had been drilled to perfection over the course of an hour she tapped her fingernails on a nearby table frustratedly maybe maybe try really emphasizing the last bit we tried that already hermione ron said guardedly well well yes but we could try again harry sighed look maybe we re all just tired he said i ll bet i pull it off better tomorrow you are willing to bet on that hermione observed frustratedly what if this thing breathes on you harry there no way anyone could act quickly enough death because of a failed fire protection charm most likely due to a panic attack she remembered with foreboding the passage she had read and her fingers clenched about her wand in worry hermione ron said and she realized she was trembling his glasses were broken and she knew he had to be able to see if he was going to get back up and fight but he wasntgoing to fight he was tinted green he wasntmoving and he wasntever going to fight again get up harry get up i dontwant you to die harry she whispered i really really dontwant you to you forgot to activate it a voice interrupted from behind her she stiffened in surprise feeling someone behind her fred there this tingly feeling you get when you cast it fred said in a voice thick with thought erm you really have to feel it to know what i mean but you have to turn it inside out at the end harry blinked i thanks george fred hermione corrected automatically fred harry amended then how on earth did you know that he asked her hermione blinked you know i dontknow fred sighed from behind her and patted her on the shoulder before moving toward his dormitory you were right he muttered as he passed looking almost sick to his stomach i wouldnthave wanted to face a dragon hermione realized with a sinking in her stomach that fred had been listening much longer than she d first thought hey ron said and she turned about in surprise to look at him he was holding his hand in the fire wiggling the fingers happily harry looked tired but satisfied thank god hermione sighed to herself 000000 the first task came very early and very nervously for hermione in no time at all it seemed classes were gone and they were walking out to the stands to settle and wait ron found her on the way from ancient runes and they sat together in silence as bagman came out to announce how the challenge was going to take place he used vague terms such as creature contestant and measures of evasion but knowing what he was referring to was infinitely worse than trying to guess good old crouch right on time someone muttered nearby she moved over hurriedly to let fred and george in next to them crouch she asked blankly looking at fred what about him what he doing here he blinked he one of the judges didntyou pay attention at all during the welcoming feast you mean george said from his other side nope not at all she left early remember hermione remembered belatedly that she had missed much of the introduction on the tournament itself the welcoming feast the choosing of the names they d brought out a slightly plump but still vicious looking dragon in a muzzle a gasp went up in unison as the large group of wizards charlie among them tugged it out gently it seemed to be in some sort of trance probably due to the muzzle hermione had read up on the gear dragon tamers used george from fred other side sucked in his breath you ve got to be kidding me he managed so fred hadnt mentioned it to him well rather hard to do actually since he d only found out the night before harry got it in hand she murmured over to him she wasntsure whether he d actually heard her or not but she had no time to find out shush up ron hissed the first person coming out they all instantly quieted at this the noise in the stands lowered to rushed hisses and whispers as the first champion emerged shakily hermione wasntsure whether to be relieved or even more nervous that it was cedric diggory the tamers had taken the muzzle off by now and the dragon seemed to have come back to itself behind it had appeared a nest of eggs one glinting gold amidst the rest oh no she thought suddenly none of the other champions know about the dragons cedric seemed to have figured out a course of action however for he was pointing his wand at something indefinite and chanting hermione squinted her eyes even while her heart began to race was that transfiguration what kind of transfiguration would get rid of a dragon a cute little dog appeared in place of a rather large rock and hermione groaned that an interesting way to tackle it bagman was saying i wonder if it ll actually work hermione frowned as the dragon seemed to waver in indecision cedric was now standing stock still while the dog cocked its head at the threatening figure before it it just had to be black she thought with a huge sigh letting her head fall into her hands miserably tell me when it over she said in a muffled tone i cantwatch there was the sound of wing beats and then a burst of flame something down below thudded sickeningly that some maneuver there bagman bellowed sounding amazed i didntknow dragons could move that fast ouch ron hissed next to her that had to hurt hermione parted her fingers with trepidation but didntnotice the field at all instead she saw fred knuckles white against each other as he clenched his hands on his legs he looked terrified well it looks like our champion got his egg anyway but he going to need a few hours with a medic let me tell you fred looked about to throw up er what happened hermione asked timidly the dragon went for em both ron said those things are uncanny god i dontknow if even the firebolt ll go fast enough what if it just snatches harry right out of the sky scuse me fred gasped he bolted from the stands suddenly white faced hermione blinked looking after him worriedly george moved over with a sigh he dead scared of dragons he told her in a low voice dontknow why it must be from when he visited charlie in romania that once hermione remembered the way fred had looked the night before and suddenly understood it a good thing he didntget into the goblet hermione said with a shiver what if he d been the one out there on the field george stared down from the stands silently and hermione had the feeling he was agreeing with her i so sorry george hermione shuddered that particular memory never became easier to deal with the beauxbatons student was walking out now to meet a green ferocious looking dragon hermione had barely paid attention to the students from beauxbatons but she noted now that their champion looked strangely familiar not surprising everything was beginning to look strangely familiar these days and she seemed to get d j vu every other minute but this time she had the feeling she really had seen her like before it had to do with the blonde hair she decided perhaps this girl had malfoy ties she realized a moment later that she was wrong though the girl fleur was her name began to sway her wand snaking in strange circles before her hermione raised her eyebrows a veela no but very very close bet she ll do well ron was saying dazedly hermione decided not to comment on his tone but it did indeed seem that fleur would get her egg the dragon scaly eyes began to close as it weaved about with the wand the next moment it thudded to the ground in a sound sleep i must say i haventseen that one before bagman was saying in a hushed voice very very enchanting george let out a slight snort and hermione followed his gaze to bagman place in the stands he seemed to have fallen asleep himself a moment later looking irritated bartemius crouch stomped up to the announcer spot and shook him violently awake er yes where was i bagman muttered definitely part veela fleur moved slowly toward the dragon nest to get her egg but as she was stepping carefully over the dragon snout it let out a small snort of flames she clapped a hand over her mouth to stifle a shriek and stumbled backward a good deal of her skirt had burst into flame and she had to sit down to beat it out before finally soaking the whole thing with her wand the dragon snored on happily its tail thudding peculiarly back and forth as though it were a dog fleur limped over to the eggs and picked the golden one out quickly before stumbling over to the medical tent the dragon handlers seemed very happy to re muzzle this particular dragon as it slept peacefully on through the process hermione saw the scores this time as she wasnthiding her head like a frightened little girl fleur got fairly good marks from most of the judges but as she had been hit they were lower than hermione might have expected i wish fred had seen that one instead she muttered george said nothing but hermione had the feeling he was agreeing with her there only two more ron said from her other side the next one got to be harry charlie and the others were pulling out a large sinuous red dragon now its body curling and twisting as they did so apparently no muzzle existed that would sufficiently calm it hermione winced as it snapped its tail violently toward charlie who leapt nimbly out of the way with a practiced movement hermione could only imagine how mrs weasley would react at home having his hand point to mortal peril i hope this one not harry ron amended looking a bit pale what about krum hermione wanted to say but she knew it was a bad time to bring up that particular facet of the problem in truth she wouldnthave wished this creature on any one of the champions it looked even quicker than the last two the idea of duck footed krum out maneuvering it would have been laughable if the situation werentso serious the idea of harry on his broom trying to keep out of its way reminded her all too much of a mouse and serpent she suppressed her shudder at this and watched with a nervous knot in her stomach as the third champion came out of the fenced enclosure krum hermione tried not to feel too relieved at this development and found she d partially succeeded she was worried about the bulgarian as well and well why not with everyone else she had to worry about these days i bet krum will do well ron said confidently sounding as relieved as she had felt at first he got in the tournament after all hero worship apparently expanded one expectations beyond the credible george gave a low whistle as krum approached the dragon who was eyeing the champion in a sickeningly still position as though getting ready to strike once he came into range i hope he got an idea what he going to do the twin said beneath his breath bagman commentary sounding in the background krum stopped where he was and seemed to consider the thing before him for a moment hermione hand clenched helplessly as she saw the dragon pull back to strike she realized in that instant just why the dragon bothered her so much in particular it reminded her very much of the basilisk the way she had seen it in that splinter of a second before she had fallen into shady dreams of vicious phantoms and monsters that she couldntrun from someone poked her in the shoulder and she realized she wasntbreathing he got it in hand george said stop looking like you re going to keel over hermione tried to oblige him as she looked down at the field krum had hit the dragon with something between the eyes it was thrashing about in pain and confusion krum was running now ducking its whipping tail and going for a flash of gold between the eggs he came back out with the golden egg in hand just as the tail hit where he had been hermione winced at the splat of eggs hagrid would have given him a zero after that hagrid was not judging though and karkaroff in particular gave krum a perfect 10 hermione supposed it was believable as krum hadntgotten injured at all himself meanwhile the tamers were working furiously to catch the thing again charlie finally pulled his wand with a heavy sigh and fired off a stunning hex he was quickly echoed by the others and the dragon went down quietly didntwant it damaging the rest of the eggs i d bet george observed hermione had very little knowledge of the area so she took his word for it the tamers brought out their final creature then and she swallowed it was a pitch black dragon and it looked incredibly large to her eyes its eyes were yellowed and narrow and its tail sported a row of wicked looking spikes this dragon too was struggling and making a better job of it than the last the tamers muscles strained on ropes holding it in place as it entered the stadium at first she thought it might have been her imagination making it seem even more formidable but then she realized that the entire stadium had gotten louder in excitement they all knew who was coming out of that fence this time last one she said to ron with a tightness in her chest this will be harry he nodded not taking his eyes off of the fence where harry was supposed to come out a moment later he appeared obligingly looking very small and nervous though it might have been hermione imagination harry began to walk resolutely out to meet his opponent wand out hermione began to chew on the inside of her cheek as he cast the fire protection charm and raised his hand the dragon watched him with evil eyes hunched over its eggs from where she was hermione couldnthear the words he yelled but she knew what they were anyway accio firebolt she held her breath this was it the true test of everything they had drilled on everything they d spent days trying to beat into his head what if it didntcome at all what if it was too far it was all harry now there was just nothing she could do to help him hermione slumped in relief as she saw the broom speed into his hand obligingly brooms had always loved harry for no clear reason she could decipher it certainly wasnta sense for fear like horses harry was probably trembling like a maniac at the moment he rose sharply into the air jerking to the side as the beast took a bite at him hermione let out an involuntary squeak of fear at which point both ron and george were forced to look at her with surprise ron and amusement george oh shut up she muttered despite the fact that neither had actually said a word but it meant quite a bit to her when george patted her comfortingly on the shoulder harry was swerving and diving with the speed of a falcon now a common sight to any who had seen him in quidditch before but today he seemed even faster as though he was more keenly aware of what he was doing the dragon was becoming frustrated with him snapping just seconds behind him at the air at one point it let out a burst of flame hermione held her breath as she waited for it to clear then saw that harry had neatly dodged it slowly he rose farther into the air until the stubborn dragon fluttered its wings just a little to rise into the air after him harry dove hermione hands went to her mouth he d forgotten about the tail it was snapping back at him like a horse would hit a fly and he was reeling back slightly was that blood he kept going insistently though and scooped up the golden egg from the rest of the pile the whistle blew charlie moved first rushing out to stun the dragon without prelude it snarled angrily as the others followed throwing red beams at it by the dozens after what seemed like an eternity the thing went down and the tamers as a group hurried to pull it back into its holding area hermione shot to her feet immediately rushing down to the field she wasntsure whether the other two were following or not but at the moment it didntmatter from where she d been sitting it had looked as though harry had taken a full on torso hit from the tail she pushed past the flap of the medi tent quickly looking about for harry figure she saw fleur resting her leg on a bench and cedric well that was best not to think of but harry where harry she asked pomfrey quickly is he in the back the older woman scowled he not come in here he probably gone up to the stands hermione turned about without a beat and gasped to find herself facing the object of her search head on harry blinked as she backed up quickly working for her breath hermione she put a hand to her forehead and caught her breath then leapt to throw her arms about him without a pause thank goodness you re all right she gasped i thought well i thought you had gotten very hurt it hit you straight on in the chest harry blinked again no it didn t he said hermione stopped and stepped back from him noting as she did that ron and george had finally caught up with her in the tent but she said weakly i clearly saw it hit you you flew back oh harry said understanding on his face i guess it might have looked like that i was just pulling back from it there no mark hermione it missed by inches i ll be the judge of that madam pomfrey said in a business like tone rushing him over to a table off with the shirt dear harry winced in embarrassment but did as she asked hermione saw as he did so that indeed there was no mark on him all right go get your scores pomfrey said with a scornful emphasis on the word scores as though all young people risked their lives on a daily basis for them but go and get something to eat straight afterward or you ll get yourself sun sick harry muttered a quick yes m and leapt off the table grabbing his shirt hermione noticed as he did a tiny glint of gold on his chest she stopped for a moment expression concentrated then hurried after him shattered moments by rurouni star questions 1 glint of gold a glint of gold what does that mean huh huh tell me now i want to knoooow answered in the chapter 2 as for ron yes well he still part of the now doubtable trio so he going to get some time i just dontlike trying to write him as him too much he a brat 3 eh fred not so much a hero as a penitent jerk omg you so helped harry try to get himself killed sort of deserves something bigger than a little sorry 4 hagrid hmm what oh i dontknow smile and i will make you wait you horrible woman but you ll probably figure it out on your own before i let it loose and then i ll start banging my head on my computer screen in exasperation when i read your theories it how these things go and as for suspense i only taking a leaf out of j k book hopefully i ve been trying to use parts of her writing style as it fanfiction i finding things i like and things i dontlike 5 george ah george i ve said that before haventi well i repeating myself and yes you silly people sirius comes in the next chapter i mean really he only an insanely important part of the story psh chapter 13 a twitch in time time is just something that we assign you know past present it just all arbitrary most native americans they dontthink of time as linear in time out of time i never have enough time circular time the stevens wheel all moments are happening all the time robin green and mitchell burgess northern exposure harry scores were by far the best in point of fact the only judge to count him off at all was karkaroff who sent a very sulky looking seven into the air ron seethed for hours afterward but harry seemed to be in high spirits it was only once they got back to the dormitory to find a slightly pale looking fred waiting that she realized george was gone there was no help for it at the moment though hermione had something she had to do harry she said come here he obliged her easily just as the first students began to pour into the commonroom harry hermione said i dontthink you actually dodged the dragon harry blinked why would you say that hermione hooked a finger onto the chain hanging around his neck and pulled the tiny golden locket appeared from beneath his shirt i think this did something she said seriously harry looked down at it as though seeing it for the first time his brow knit i i forgot that was there weird their conversation was interrupted by two butterbeers thrust between them drink up george said with a grin you earned it mate harry grinned back and took a long gulp from the drink hermione eyed hers suspiciously for a moment one never knew when one would regret eating something around the twins but took a small sip herself it warmed her from the inside out and she felt her tension falling away slowly as harry went to sit down in an armchair and relax well let go george said once she had finished hermione blinked in surprise go where exactly the kitchens of course he replied we ve got to go get enough food for the whole commonroom it might have been something about the drink or something about harry death defying day or even something about george expectant expression hermione said yes 000000 so george said cheerily as they exited the portrait hole as though they werent out after curfew and they werent going to go pilfer a good amount of food from the kitchens exciting day yes hermione found herself thinking back over it interesting yes most definitely interesting dumbledore been hinting something interesting is going to happen at hogwarts the letter sirius hermione realized that in all the chaos she d forgotten to owl him and let him know harry had gotten through all right he was probably biting his fingernails down to the skin just like her hermione hello anyone home george waved his hand in front of her face and she realized she d stopped in the middle of the hall sorry she sighed i just have so much to think about sometimes i go off on my own george looked her over slowly and she had the unnerving feeling that he had begun to put things together again he went back to walking i guess i just worrying my head off about everything she murmured there s well there just so much going on lately so you re worried about harry george asked as he turned a corner well yes hermione said frustratedly i cantthink of another one of my friends whose life seems to be constantly in danger i swear he a trouble magnet and i always the one cleaning up for him she stopped as she realized what she was saying that was unfair of me wasntit she sighed george shrugged ahead of her just depends on your point of view i guess it not like anyone set you down and said you take care of harry in a way it is a little unfair to have to take it all on yourself ah hermione thought ironically but someone did ask me to take care of him but george continued stopping at the portrait of the fruit basket that what friends do he reached out toward the pear and wiggled his fingers it began to laugh a high squeaky laugh and she smiled suddenly george she started and you need to relax he said you dontrelax enough would sir and miss like some apple pie a house elf squeaked as they entered wiggy has some cookies take some cookies and some hot chocolate hermione groaned and hid behind george belatedly remembering that she d promised herself she would never come down here again george grinned broadly however and took what was offered could we get some trifle too hermione crept away from the concentration of elves that were now pushed in all about george she almost felt bad about leaving him with the snacks for the other students sakes not his but the entire dragon thing had just about drained her she lowered herself onto the floor in front of a fireplace in the corner and set her head dully onto her knees staring into the flames sirius he didntmove at her hesitant call he was laying face down on the kitchen table there were bottles on the floor some broken and the smell of alcohol pervaded the room he probably snoring she thought suddenly disgusted hermione sat down across from him despite the fact that he hadnteven acknowledged her presence she plucked at imaginary dust on her nightclothes and drew her knees up to her chin staring at him harry really looks up to you she told him knowing he couldnthear and here you go setting this kind of example for him miss miss is you all right hermione blinked her eyes drowsily and looked up a house elf was standing next to her she couldntreally say he was looking down at her as he was just barely her height while she was so curled up but he did seem concerned the house elf eyes widened as she looked at him miss is harry potter friend he said in an awed whisper miss was in the hospital wing petrified yellow staring eyes she started stumbling to her feet dobby remembers the elf nodded miss looked very lonely all alone hermione belatedly realized that she knew this elf not by his face but by his name dobby she asked arentyou the one that almost got harry expelled dobby moaned oh but it was for his own good miss harry potter was in grave danger so you work here now she said dazedly somewhat ignoring him dobby beamed professor dumbledore told dobby he could work at hogwarts he even said he said professor dumbledore pays dobby for his work this last came out in a voice tinged with guilty pleasure there nothing wrong with that hermione said with a frown everyone else gets paid for their work so i dontsee why you shouldn t oi hermione george called from the doorway time to go hermione smiled at dobby and held out her hand he stared at it puzzled until she grabbed his and shook it my name is hermione granger she said it nice to meet you dobby blinked then shook her hand back rather more excitably dobby is very glad to meet you too hermione granger if you ever need anything please tell him hermione what are you doing george had come up behind her struggling with a mountain of food packages she laughed and moved to help him with them and only cast one last glance over her shoulder at dobby before george kicked the painting shut hermione looked around at the large surplus of packages wondering momentarily how they were going to carry them all an idea came to her then and she carefully set her own down to the floor pointing her wand at them legatus she told it firmly march to it the food packages rose off the ground and george raised his eyebrows from behind his own stack getting an idea hermione turned to him put yours down too she said i ll get those he obliged her and she repeated the spell then follow him back to the commonroom she ordered the food pointing her wand at him it worked to her surprise the packages began to cluster about george as though waiting for him to move what you re not coming he asked i have to post a letter hermione said it probably better for you to get back with all of that though so i ll sneak over on my own sneak she thought with a shudder what a perfectly awful word george eyed her for a moment fine he said i guess i can save you a cookie or two dontexpect more though gryffindors are heavy eaters hermione smiled in a relieved way and nodded picking up the hem of her robes and moving around the corner it worth a few house points to let sirius know harry okay she thought to herself though i d really rather it not come to that hermione tried to remember how to be silent she was sure she d learned at some point but either her ears had become very sensitive or she was simply not managing it on inspiration she pointed her wand at her feet and murmured quiete the noise stopped as hermione later slipped into the owlery with a careful hand on the door she thought involuntarily of the horrific events that would take place should the weasley twins ever actually pay attention in class a vision appeared in her head of utter pandemonium she gave a slight shudder and grabbed an owl treat from harry tin already feeling guilty though the chances of him noticing were slim to none hedwig she said with a sigh seeing that the owl was already awake i so so sorry i really ought to get an owl oughtnti the owl seemed resigned however as she lifted her front talon obligingly hermione held out the treat first and allowed hedwig to take it in her beak then she walked to the door to set a chair carefully against it and set herself down to write well nothing like short and sweet because obviously obviously she was still annoyed with him s harry got through the first task all right she stopped and began to blow on the ink that would be enough but her hand continued to move as she thought of how relieved she d been and how well he d done that what friends do george had said she sighed and wrote out another paragraph he actually did better than all right he was best out of them all the task was to get past a dragon and collect an egg nerve wracking from the stands let me tell you it probably is best that you werenthere worrying like me i suppose harry ended up summoning his firebolt and diving for the thing in a way you re the reason he came out in one piece i take back everything i said about it being a great big present it was very useful hermione hesitated for the moment on whether she ought to tell him about the locket and her suspicions but she supposed she could talk to him about it in greater detail once he got back instead she wrote i hope you re doing all right where you are h she contemplated adding a post script that said and i still angry with you but decided it would be too childish considering the circumstances you re wonderful hedwig hermione said as she tied the letter to the owl leg sirius should be much closer by now dontworry hedwig took off a second later and at the same time hermione heard a rattling from the door oh no her hand went instinctively to the timeturner i could get out of it but that would be really wrong it wasntentrusted to me to break rules with a hot fiery pain streaked through her head and she let out a muffled cry the timeturner dropped from her hand hermione only barely remembered to throw herself beneath the desk quickly as the sudden headache made her squeeze her eyes shut in pain as the pain in her head slowly disappeared hermione realized that no one had come through the door slowly cautiously she looked around the side of the desk the door was still closed but there was no chair hermione got to her feet in surprise and rubbed at her forehead in confusion an owl hooted at her from its perch she looked over and nearly fainted hedwig the snowy owl ruffled her feathers in surprise at her appearance and hermione walked over to her quickly hedwig shuffled on her perch suspiciously as though waiting for her to to send a letter not now hedwig hermione said in a dazed voice but well i ll be here in a moment i ll need you then the owl let out her breath all at once and settled herself irritatedly hermione stared down at the timeturner i must have jerked it around too much she thought it probably turned accidentally feeling horribly guilty but very relieved hermione slipped back out the door to the owlery only to leap against the outer wall quickly as someone entered the hall she shrank against the wall as far as she could wondering whether it was still past curfew her eyes widened as the figure came into view me she pulled back even farther despite the fact that she knew she wouldntbe seeing herself naturally the other hermione came to the door and pulled it open quietly shutting it behind her the sound of a chair against the handle whispered through the door to her ears the thought hit her that whoever it was that was going to push their way through the door was going to appear in a few minutes she had until the other her finished writing the letter and sent it out nevertheless as she hid herself across the hall hermione thought on the disturbing event that had just occurred the timeturner doesntgo back any less than an hour hermione moved into a shadowed corner and pulled her robes closer about her hoping the black would make her blend in enough there were no windows in this hall and only a few guttering torches lit it hopefully it would do she hadntlong to wait very soon the sound of a slight person footsteps echoed back to her a shadow came into view and began to walk furtively toward the owlery not a teacher then came the thought it was at this point hermione became truly frightened her fingers clenched about her wand she tried to remember how to sneak up on an opponent if need be catch them from behind sirius had said you ll want to start with a stunning hex naturally but if it misses follow up with a disarming curse before they can draw on you the person face came beneath a torch fairly close to her and hermione swallowed feeling light headed crouch she shrank back even farther into her robes not liking the angry contortions of his expression he strode up to the owlery quickly and tried the doorknob it jiggled but did little else hermione knew that at this moment she was diving beneath a desk and clutching at her head it almost gave her a headache of her own remembering locked crouch muttered to himself didntknow they locked the owlery here he turned about sharply on one foot and began to walk away from the door hermione felt herself stiffen as he passed her once more but he didntturn to look at her a few minutes after his footsteps stopped echoing down the hall she felt her muscles relax somewhat hermione got to her feet shakily then stumbled back to the corner she needed to turn at footsteps still silent she tried to walk slowly tried to convince herself she wasntbeing followed that every tiny sound behind her wasntcrouch or filch or someone or something even worse predictably she failed a few seconds after turning the corner hermione broke into a dead run footsteps silent on the stone floor her heart thudded so loudly in her chest though that she was certain anyone might be able to hear it when the fat lady portrait finally came into sight hermione threw herself toward it thankfully chipping clodbury she gasped out all right then dear the woman sighed sleepily opening up for her hermione slipped in hurriedly and shut the portrait immediately behind her darkness greeted her as she turned around the only light in the room was a dimly flickering fire in the fireplace it threw shadows of the furniture into frightening relief on the walls the commonroom was quiet and empty normally hermione would thank whatever god had been watching over her that she had no one to explain herself to but at the moment she found she would much rather deal with someone else than be alone in a silent room like this she shuddered and rubbed at her arms moving toward the fire cookie hermione let out a breathless screech something that probably sounded like a badly working telegraph and fell backward onto the rug pointing her wand at the speaker with both hands george blinked at her all right then i ll take it if you dontwant it she remembered belatedly that he d promised to save her a cookie contrary to his words george set the cookie down on the table next to him and got up to offer her a hand hermione took it feeling incredibly stupid and still somewhat shaky all right he asked she nodded slowly and pulled herself up hermione realized she was still shaking as she collapsed into a chair let me guess george said throwing himself back into his own seat filch snape hermione shook her head trying to regain her breath mcgonagall he asked dubiously cr crouch hermione corrected feeling slightly sick george began to nod knowingly then as though just realizing which name she d said his eyes opened wider and his mouth fell open crouch he asked why would crouch be sending a letter at this time of night more importantly hermione said between deep breaths why is he even here george frowned well he was here today to judge i suppose he might have stayed the night he doesntseem the type to accept one of dumbledore invitations hermione said and i suppose he might have been sending something work related we know he a workaholic hermione sighed maybe i overreacted she said to herself george seemed dubious of himself but they were both much too tired to think on the matter further shattered moments by rurouni star yes sirius comes in this chapter and because i made you wait so very long shameless fanservice really i not having you on for once lastly school starts almost immediately after i post this therefore the updates are going to go way down i so sorry i wish it could be different believe me i wish but school is school and it hates me chapter 14 bitter medicine it is easier to forgive an enemy than to forgive a friend william blake hermione woke in an armchair for the second time in recent memory feeling dirty and disheveled and strangely warm she blinked and looked down at the blanket thrown on top of her eyes attempting to focus when had she fallen asleep why had she you d better go to sleep hermione lupin told her he probably not going to come back tonight if he hasntalready she stared at the door pensively trying not to hear him not going to come back the words were too foreboding she didntwant to listen no no that wasntlast night she felt a chill despite the blanket and threw it from her quickly rubbing at her eyes she had simply drifted off to sleep in the long silence after her and george conversation yes it was still somewhat dark outside hermione had to stumble about a little in order to fold up the blanket and find her wand inside her robes she cast a few freshening charms and sighed stretching her arms above her head she supposed it was late enough to go to the library 000000 it was in transfiguration that the day took a turn for the worse i sorry professor harry managed beside her i dontknow that i heard that right could you please repeat it mcgonagall scowled at him and adjusted her glasses the yule ball potter you will be needing a date as you are going to be in the opening ceremony hermione sighed and let her head thud to the desk this brought complications the sudden spurt of feminine giggles behind her confirmed her worst fears it was a girly occasion not that she wasnthappy to use her robes and all she had desperately wanted everyone to see her in them if only for a little self esteem boost but the idea of having to hear about this dance all the way until christmas she shuddered even as harry groaned oh shut up she thought in a burst of exasperation at least you donthave to dress like a girl for the blasted thing what was more she was sure harry would have no problem finding himself a date whereas she was probably going to have to go alone that is all i have to say on the matter mcgonagall sighed disapprovingly then in a voice she probably thought no one else could hear we have enough teen drama about without adding fuel to the fire as usual hermione completely agreed with her as they left the classroom harry sighed i doomed he muttered hermione eyebrow twitched and why is that she asked him other than the fact that you re supposed to be dead in a few years time why dontyou worry about more important things damn it i dontknow how to dance he said in misery ron from behind them chuckled perk up mate he said i dontthink any of us do it not like you ll be alone hermione frowned and crossed her arms i know how to dance she said stiffly ron stifled a rather unkind snicker what did you learn that from a book too she felt her face flush well she said if you re going to be like that about it hermione stormed away ignoring the fact that their next class was together anyway i was going to offer to teach you too harry behind her groaned again 000000 by the end of the day hermione found herself so glum at the prospect of trying to get out of the entire yule ball fiasco that she almost missed the tiny speeding owl as it flew toward her as it was the poor thing banged into her forehead as she was walking back to the commonroom hermione fell backward against the wall in surprise books and papers flying everywhere as she tried simultaneously to get back up and to pull her wand geronimo hooted dizzily and she looked down to see him tottering uncertainly about by her ankles oh she managed are you all right came a familiar voice hermione looked up in alarm one hand scooping the tiny owl behind her skirts here then i ll give you a hand up george offered extending his right hand hermione blinked dazedly for a moment before grabbing it and hoping geronimo would stay behind her he steadied her as she teetered dangerously and hermione suddenly noticed that he was very warm and solid hmm it had to be the yule ball it was sending her so very out of touch with the rest of the world er hermione she blinked then quickly backpedaled as she realized she was still holding george hand sorry she said i just still a little shell shocked i guess thank you by the way george shrugged suddenly looking uncomfortable he flicked his wand carelessly without looking her in the eyes and hermione found herself faced with a neat pile of her belongings slowly she took the stack from him wondering at his strange attitude so george said clearing his throat er you you heard about the whole thing today the yule ball announcement hermione asked he nodded slowly yeah sort of unexpected huh hermione shook her head slowly no i should have expected it i read up on the tournament after all i guess she struggled to find the words i guess i somehow thought they wouldntgo through with the yule ball this time for some reason maybe i thought it was different george seemed so surprised by this that he was temporarily speechless after the silence stretched on a bit with one awkwardly puttering owl nudging her leg hermione smiled at him and patted her books with one hand thanks a lot george she said i d better get going though lots to do i ll see you about he opened his mouth as she picked something else up and turned around to go but seemed to think again about whatever he d been about to say yeah he said finally i ll see you once she was around the corner though hermione opened her hands to look at geronimo who blinked back at her woozily he had a tiny tiny note attached to his leg barely a scrap really she slowly unrolled it her breath in her throat i ve returned it said please see me tomorrow hermione drew a deep shuddering breath tomorrow why tomorrow had he been expecting her to get the message late that night she bit her lip and looked around once before turning about to stride in the other direction telling geronimo to get something from the owlery no matter the reason she had too many questions they werentgoing to wait for tomorrow most of all though she couldntquite admit it to herself she wanted to see him she wanted to know he was all right but as she turned the last corner she found herself irrationally stopped at the wall her heart sped up nervously as she slowly lay a hand against the cold stone the strangest thought had occurred to her what if he had changed what if he didntcare about her anymore what if that was why his letters had been so few and so curt she swallowed what if he just doesntwant to see me anymore it was a stupid thought considering he d specifically asked her to see him the next day but it lingered none the less footsteps began to sound from far away though and hermione found herself forced to choose quickly she touched the corner between the walls whispered the password and pushed herself through with tightly closed eyes a dull red glow sprang up before her closed eyes hesitantly she opened them the fire was going high and warm but the room was otherwise completely dark the corners flickered in shadow and the flames crackled softly in the silence and laying on the couch as she stepped around to look hermione caught her breath his chest was softly rising and falling beneath a ragged cloak drawn about him he seemed entirely dirty too pale too skinny just as she remembered him being the first time she had met him in only two months time sirius black had undone every bit of the year of effort she d expended on his behalf hermione stepped toward him some strange part of her aching horribly at his appearance something slick and slithery caught on her toe she looked down and saw the invisibility cloak pooled in a silver heap on the floor next to it was a worn fluttering piece of parchment she picked them up numbly depositing them on the table he looked so tired any thoughts she d had before of waking him and demanding answers disintegrated as she stared at him taking in his strained face with its shadows and cuts slowly hermione knelt down beside the couch and looked him over he had a few bruises and scratches all about but most especially his right arm seemed to be cradled against his chest it was bruised of course but otherwise something seemed very off about the way it was placed on closer inspection hermione was horrified to note that there was a slight bump near his wrist where a bone was pushing at the skin why didnthe get anyone to help she thought in a panic that definitely broken he should have asked dumbledore god he should ve asked me despite this thought it occurred to her that she hadntthe skill the knowledge or the materials to heal a broken bone hermione worried at her lip for a moment before stiffening as a thought occurred to her the map i have the map and the cloak almost immediately she scrambled for the silver cloak still hanging on the table she whisked it over herself and in the same movement pulled the parchment inside its folds i solemnly swear i am up to no good she whispered hurriedly staring impatiently as the lines of the castle spread out in front of her 000000 lily lily don t dontwhat tell you the truth about you and your other horrible little friends tell you exactly what it is you all need to hear you dontknow what you re talking about of course i do she screamed angrily you re just like the rest of your family sirius black you just changed your colors so you could pretend that you were better sirius groaned as he awoke feeling anew all the damage he had managed to accrue during his little vacation his head was throbbing from lack of food beating in time with his aching shoulder he d meant to get some food but it had somehow slipped his mind once he d lain down his arm was numb with a hoarse curse he stumbled off the couch one hand going to hold the other carefully there was a moment of clumsiness as he realized he was under a blanket no a robe much too small to even cover him it slid to the floor even as he collapsed back onto the couch heavily he spat out a few more creative adjectives before realizing that the room was still empty and still quiet but the cloak and the map were gone just as his mind was attempting to put things together a faint scent wafted toward him sweet and very familiar hermione this didntmake him feel any better at all he let his face fall to his hand where he slowly rubbed at his face then flinched at the feel of bruises well it wasntas though he d never been in worse condition quidditch and all right keep telling yourself that sirius groaned and reached out for his wand he really should have taken care of the little things earlier but he d been so bone tired after a few minutes of work on the lesser cuts and bruises he slowly stumbled to his feet and over to the right most corner of the room where he summoned a sudden spout of water over himself no need to look like snivellus he thought to himself attempting to find some amusement in it he repeated the spell a few times then added some soap and a bit of lemon for good measure by the end of his self made shower the floor was near flooded with a last sigh he spelled up most of the mess and leaned his good arm onto the couch arm still soaked despite the horrible effort it had taken the exertion was well worth it he almost felt human again he could really have gone for some food though and maybe the assurance that his arm wasntgoing to fall off a sudden squeak of terror from the air sent his exhausted body into action before he could think rationally sirius lunged forward just as the invisibility cloak flew upward to reveal two rather familiar feet slipping on a puddle the landing jarred his arm so hard that he accidentally said something he probably shouldnthave after all he d done his best not to curse in front of hermione as she was a little young and still impressionable though he couldntsee much of anything there was a hand on his chest and a soft warm figure attached to it hermione let out a tiny confused breath as she tried to sit up her hands caught on the material of the cloak however and then slid out from under her completely subsequently her chin came into direct contact with his rib ow a little eep escaped the air i so sorry she managed more carefully extracting herself this time he noted as she stood that the air was wobbling a little bit as though he were looking at a heat wave interesting she peeled off the cloak quickly and threw it onto the back of the couch then offered him a hand up he took it with his left and hauled himself up carefully i got you a potion out of the hospital wing she said quickly rummaging about in a pocket for it madame pomfrey wasntthere it closed for the evening but flitwick almost caught me because i wasntpaying enough attention she was babbling but sirius couldntmanage to make his mouth work to tell her to stop the image he had kept with him the fourteen year old with books in her arms and frizz in her hair had changed you ve grown he managed finally that stopped hermione short for a moment he thought he saw her beam at him but the expression if it had even been there at all was quickly replaced by horrified concern here she said shoving a vial at him then no wait she said as she snatched it back eat first or you ll throw up she gestured at something near the door and he realized belatedly that there was a hoard of floating packages following her in numbly he allowed himself to be led back around to the couch then pushed back onto it meanwhile hermione made little concerned noises and sometimes sounds of incredulity as she looked him over for injuries he flinched when she came to his right arm but she had apparently already known about the break she gently lifted it hissing in sympathy do you know the spell to set bones she asked him i knew it at one point but i i ve forgotten sirius stared at her as though he were meeting her for the first time hermione he asked slowly she blinked yes she asked he shook his head slowly and then he began to laugh a full hearted incredulous laugh hermione stood up straight at this a hand on her hip excuse me she said in an offended tone if we re going to laugh about my short comings perhaps i ought to wait to treat this he waved his other hand in acquiescence but found it took him another half minute to stop laughing i think i ve missed you he managed hermione relaxed slowly yes she said softly you know i i really missed you too it been too long and then she said something else and his bone cracked into place his eyes widened and he tried to say something she probably wouldnthave approved of but he found he had no breath hermione put her hands to her mouth oh i sorry i didnt that is i meant to do it quickly so you wouldnthave to worry sirius took a large breath and groaned next time just tell me he found he couldntfault her though when she summoned a baked potato from the other side of the room and plopped the plate in his lap 000000 as much as she wanted to it was too hard to start asking questions while he ate words were puttering about in her mind why did you go after peter how did you break your arm why didntyou write though he was finished with his food she pushed the questions away again and handed him the vial which he took in one swallow he needs sleep first off she thought then i can ask him which side of the family gave him the stupid gene not that he would understand what she meant most likely as for herself she couldntunderstand why she was crying a quick glance his way showed her that there was no danger of his noticing which was more than she could have hoped for his eyes were closed but she could tell he was still slightly awake is harry doing all right he asked drowsily hermione swallowed a strange feeling jabbing her in the stomach she tried to keep her voice even as she said yes he doing fine he worries me he smiled faintly and it was strange to see how it smoothed away all of the accumulated worries on his face good her eyes drifted downward to the new cast on his arm and she bit her bottom lip it tasted like salt the senseless tears still hadntstopped you worry me she sighed continuing the unsaid thought but if sirius heard her slip up his only response was a deep content breath that seemed to point toward sleep hermione lengthened her robe and carefully wound it around him the bone mending potion was quick and painless but as it drew on the body own reserves it took a lot of energy and it pulled down the immune system and if he happened to catch a cold involuntarily her hand went to his forehead to brush a wet lock of hair away from his eyes yes that the reason feeling suddenly uncertain she stood up quickly and somewhat unsteadily and fled shattered moments by rurouni star long chapter long long long and a long time in coming sorry but the next one will be a while too school is first unfortunately edit hey guess what sixteen sixteen the seventeen alas was not a shot at legal age but the result of too much homework and too little sleep and me being horrible at math ta da magically fixed and many thanks to kou shun u chapter 15 the bug that bites the worst i enjoy convalescence it is the part that makes the illness worth while george bernard shaw sleep as usual came late and badly for hermione she was in fact beginning to suspect some kind of insomniac disorder but that would naturally have to be dealt with later once she was returned for the summer psychological problems were unsurprisingly best left to the muggle specialists saint mungo had such a handful with its magical maladies that the more common lack of sleep was almost laughable by comparison of course the bigger problem with sleep was that hermione spent the entire night staring at her ceiling wondering why she had suddenly felt so incredibly unsure around sirius black it wasntas though she didntknow him well or as well as anyone might know him as she d spent an entire year plotting things in his company and it wasntneedful for her to worry about him he was a grown man as lupin had said yes she remembered to herself and they had both silently agreed that the idea of sirius taking good care of himself was laughable so she was worried about him that much was and had been true for a while but that didntso much explain the little leap in her stomach when he d recognized her age as horrible as he d been feeling it didntexplain why she felt that strange urge to shake him every once in a while and tell him how stupid he was wait hermione returned to the first thought how old was she her battered mind still calculated the answer fairly quickly at thirty six hour days instead of twenty four for nine months out of the year excluding weekends she blinked tiredly about one point five years times the constant add in fourteen sixteen i sixteen the answer shocked her so badly that she spasmed in surprise and nearly fell off of her bed that cantbe right she thought that that one year before graduation that would make me the same age as george again she went back through her calculations and again she came up with the same number oh oh hermione whispered sitting on the edge of her bed and putting her face in her hands the cold metal and glass hourglass skimmed along her arm until it reached the end of its chain it came up short then dangling outside her nightshirt this thing she slowly lifted her face from her hands a finger ran along the chain until her hand clasped about the glass it all this thing fault everything hermione stared at it in her hand turned it over examined it for flaws or chips something to tell her it wasnt correct wasnt right but nothing was different nothing about this stupid timeturner was different at all she lifted it up above the edge of her bed playing with the idea of simply shattering it to pieces right then just to see if things would change or if they would maybe go back to normal her vision swam lifting above the ground teeth gritted eyes wide and watching waiting for it to smash she hissed in her breath and pulled it back from the edge then realized belatedly that it was wound about her neck and wouldnthave even reached her knee that right a part of her whispered you need it hermione threw herself back under the covers and pulled them over her head shivering 000000 morning came much too slowly with an ache behind her eyes and a tremor in her body and in her stomach twisting hermione sat up abruptly at the feeling and stumbled from her bed a hand over her mouth parvati already up let out a small sound of surprise as her roommate bolted out the door to their room in her pajamas oh god oh god oh god ron was sitting downstairs with harry both half awake she ignored their half hearted g morning s and darted toward a trash bin in the corner a few moments later her stomach muscles stopped holding in and her dinner came up ugh harry and ron realized on her third desperate heave that something was wrong she heard hurried footsteps coming toward her and the two stopped behind her hesitating because of course they wouldntthink of something useful to do like for instance holding back her hair she steadied herself with a hand on either side of the bin and groaned in misery i dontfeel good ron being ron gave a nervous er obviously he said d you er need anything harry asked in what he must have thought to be a helpful tone oh just shove off hermione managed feeling unaccountably angry next time one of you is sick i ll stand and watch too harry was silent a moment while ron let out a whistle good thing being sick hasntgiven you a temper eh hermione she held her response in check only barely i ll get your homework for you i suppose harry offered quickly dragging ron off by the arm i think i know most of your schedule he stepped out in a hurry leaving an empty room and a despairing hermione i hate being sick she managed wiping at her mouth although to think of it how long had it been since she d been truly sick years it seemed excepting the occasional cold she d always thought of her immune system as excellent considering she ate right stayed on top of things got enough sleep ah well well darn the ache behind her eyes throbbed as though to emphasize the point feeling all around disgusting hermione staggered her way to the bathroom behind the stairs to wash her mouth out she had just splashed a bit of water over her face and stretched her hands out blindly to look for a towel when her hands came into contact with a warm body instead you could use my robes i suppose george said helpfully but then i might be rather attached to my state of health at the moment so it d probably be impolite hermione gritted her teeth ron was right george noticed aloud you ve got no sense of humor when you re sick are you quite done she demanded because as you ve so astutely observed i am sick and it would be a shame for me to throw up on you he looked annoyingly unperturbed hermione supposed it was because she wasntthe type to throw up on people all threats aside except maybe malfoy yes that would be amusing it was in the middle of this rather pleasant daydream that george said something rather unexpected want me to stay hermione head snapped up and she stared at him as though he d grown another head wh what george drew up his hands defensively you could ve just said no well no i guess not that i dontappreciate it she hastened to add seeing a strange change in his expression i just i can get along on my own i not handicapped and i d rather you not miss class george snorted of course you can get on by yourself it not about that curiously he shifted feet and dropped his eyes to the ground i just thought you might like a bit of company it no fun being sick by yourself after all hermione found herself temporarily speechless during this time george handed her a towel to wipe her dripping face with after a moment she swiped it over her face and pondered a haggard smile made its way to her face despite her best efforts you are willing to wait on me hand and foot yes george didntmiss a beat i figure that ll entail all of fetching a book for you as you cant eat his easy grin told her he was still joking hermione pursed her lips and shuffled past him to the staircase i ll get into some cleaner things then and perhaps i have some stomach medicine about why you only had to ask george said with a suspiciously innocent look 000000 pomfrey was not having a good day there was a first year boy sitting in front of her with a wand stuck clear through his arm crying at the top of his lungs behind him on the waiting bench were a fourth year slytherin and sixth year hufflepuff that looked as though they d cast the entire first four years worth of spells at each other and again there was an idiot seventh year who d tried to apparate within hogwarts and splinched his finger off somewhere for the effort didnt anyone read hogwarts a history pomfrey frowned then shook her head hermione granger must have come in recently she poked at the wailing first year boy sternly commanding him to be silent when that didntwork she swiped her wand once and the sound simply stopped coming he blinked surprised probably hadntlearned the spell yet and if you dontstop moving about so much we can remedy that too pomfrey told him acidly sit still the boy obediently stopped moving a few moments later the wand was free and the damage was being assessed bone damage muscle damage nerve damage yet another one for the night pomfrey was in the middle of trying to force the awkward boy into a bed when the most unwelcome sight she could have imagined today or ever really popped up in her doorway dear pomfrey fred weasley cried how wonderful it is to see you on this fine morning the tone was overly cheerful considering he looked rather pale and unhealthy pomfrey felt a tiny shudder go through her as she turned her back to him to stuff the first year into bed what do you want she asked suspiciously as she turned around wand at the ready fred opened his mouth as though to say something appropriately witty but covered his mouth quickly and ran toward the nearby bathroom spitting over a toilet pomfrey slowly let her wand down and sighed putting a hand to her forehead a stomach bug lovely soon every student in the school would be laid up in her ward and if fred weasley was the first it certainly did not bode well for her state of mind after a moment he came up and wiped at his mouth then went to gurgle a bit of water pomfrey took another look at the three students on the bench she decided tiredly that she ought to get rid of the immediate danger with red hair first let have a look at you then she said as he came out looking even worse than before oh no fred said rubbing at his forehead i just came for some anti nausea potions if you ve got them potions pomfrey said as in more than one good lord if george weasley was sick as well for just a moment she let herself feel sick as well fred sighed dramatically miss granger is laying across the chairs of our commonroom absolutely miserable i insisted upon getting her a potion to ease her body as she refuses to come up here herself he leaned in as though telling a secret and pomfrey leaned back warily germs could spread so very easily and if she were out of commission the school would descend into havoc you know fred said conspiratorially she already starting on her homework for next week he straightened then smiled again perhaps i ought to stay up here though i imagine i might get better more quickly under your expert care pomfrey nearly dropped the wand in her hand no she said then a little more controlled no i dontbelieve that will be necessary mr weasley you and miss granger merely have a small bug it will pass on its own in fact perhaps you two should keep each other company in your commonroom i will alert your teachers to your absence fred beamed at her why you always have such marvelous ideas 000000 george returned with two vials in hand one quite empty already hermione looked at him suspiciously as she downed part of her potion saving a bit for later you didnttell me you were sick as well she accused feeling somehow cheated it was one thing for him to offer to stay as a friend but another to be staying because he was sick too george shrugged and fell quite wearily into the chair opposite her still smiling despite it all yes well it made you feel special didntit hermione felt her face begin to burn i well that completely he was eyeing her with such amusement that she finally found the ability to finish her sentence nothing of the sort she managed george pulled on a folded blanket and swept it around himself then with another amused look he picked up another and stood from his seat it dropped onto her stomach and he raised his eyebrows suggestively should i tuck you in too hermione grabbed at the blanket faster than he could continue she curled her legs underneath her as she pulled the blanket to her chin what are you doing anyway she asked suspiciously george stepped back to rest a bit against his chair why i waiting on you hand and foot though of course there are two hands and two feet involved a thoughtful look came to his face perhaps we ought to say hands and feet instead hermione waved her hand at him weakly oh sit down george you know i didnt mean it i was joking with you he chuckled and slowly sank down into his chair pulling it around toward the fire how on earth would i know that you of all people was making a joke he asked i thought you were serious all the time why one might say you re improving through the influence of good company hermione curled into her blanket feeling a little hurt despite the fact that it seemed all in good fun she must have been silent for too long because george looked over at her after a second you all right he asked did the potion not agree with you it does that sometimes i fine she said shortly all the while thinking that she would later regret her tone it wasnt george fault that she was sick far from it in fact he was keeping her company george rubbed at his face looking somewhat confused did i say something the first thought she had was to put off the question somehow but for some unknown reason perhaps the light headed feeling the potion was giving her or the fact that she was feeling guilty for snapping at him she felt the words come out anyway i d like to be funny she said hesitantly but it not what i good at i haventgot any illusions about where i fit into everything here george his eyebrows knit and where is that he asked sounding a little concerned hermione leaned back into her pillow so he couldntsee her well well i the bookworm you know the walking encyclopedia magic charming and witty arentexactly in the job description and i guess i know i not ever going to be that way i need to be serious it just how i am george let out a slow breath i didntreally mean anything by it you know she pushed back into her pillow a little more yeah her eyes were a little wet but luckily she was feeling tired enough to just go to sleep before anything could reveal her george wasntdone though he seemed to be trying to say something difficult something slightly private perhaps you know he said struggling with each pronounced word you ve got plenty of people that like you the way you are i mean not just for facts and books he sat up a little straighter at the edge of her vision there a lot of people that would do just about anything for you harry and ron and pretty much all the family he hesitated me and fred too we would hermione felt a great desperately happy sob grow in her chest but she swallowed it down do you remember at the cup she said suddenly no it was after you said someone had to make sure we didntget ourselves killed she knew he was frowning somehow perhaps it was just a subtle change in the atmosphere i remember you seemed offended or something that was a long time ago hermione no she said hurriedly i mean that i guess i sort of feel that way about you too all my friends at school sometimes i feel like no one really paying attention to everything that happening outside and sometimes i feel like you really shouldnt like maybe i should do it for you george shifted so that he could see her face again hermione found it somewhat discomforting nothing important been in the news recently hermione he said softly unless there something you know no she said carefully it just a feeling then something happened every year this year doesnt seem like it likely to be different especially with all the unusual things going on unforgivables the tournament the ball for the second time in only a little while george looked about to say something important hermione closed her mouth waiting expectantly in the end though he merely turned over to sprawl across the chair and close his eyes hermione watched him for a while the firelight on his face it made him look very kind somehow she couldntforget though he was smart he was very very smart and every time he listened to her he gained more information and one of these days he just might figure everything out she waited longer than she might have earlier with this revelation and when she was utterly certain he was asleep hermione got to her feet and crept toward the portrait slowly she pushed it open just enough to let her through her heart was pounding at the thought of george waking and demanding some kind of explanation though he wasntreally the kind of person to do that the portrait closed behind her without a noise and hermione began to walk as slowly and silently as her panic would allow she rubbed at her arms glancing about as she went feeling horribly exposed as she walked the castle in her flannels they werent indecent of course but there was something about being seen in one nightclothes that made one horribly embarrassed hermione hoped that everyone was in class malfoy especially oh lord if he had the chance to say something to her like this she came to the secret corner at this thought thankfully and hermione felt so incredibly relieved that she immediately whispered the word and slipped through it had not occurred to her that sirius was going to see her like this the so named man looked wearily up from the couch he was laying on and immediately his face took on the strangest expression she d yet seen on it it was as though a hammer were pounding on the inside of his lungs and he was trying to keep his mouth from opening to let the air out a choked kind of half laugh was his reward for all this effort hermione gritted her teeth and immediately remembered all the reasons she was angry with him sit she hissed and you better have a good explanation for for everything sirius didntlook serious enough for her he was still coughing suspiciously i will not let this turn into a discussion of my sleepwear i will not let this turn into a discussion of my sleepwear oh screw it who am i kidding hermione clenched her hands into fists so tight she was amazed her bones werent creaking i sure you have worn worse than plaid she managed in a barely controlled quivering voice sirius coughed again but she could see that he was beginning to control himself again it was the pink he said in a similar voice though the emotion he was holding back was quite different i never imagined you d lower yourself to it hermione almost went for her wand before realizing she didnthave it it hadntoccurred to her to move it from her robes to her pajama pocket instead she settled for throwing herself into the chair and glaring at him with such an intense look that he finally relented i went after pettigrew he agreed with the unstated question seeming much too light hearted about the situation for her tastes considering he still sported a cast on his right arm and a fading bruise on his neck hermione didntrelent in her stare until he continued it was worth it if someone could stop him from reaching voldemort sirius reasoned leaning back into the couch cushions besides which i pretty well expendable at this point i was the best person for the job hermione felt her anger liquefy it slid sickeningly down into her stomach where it coalesced into pure dread what what was that she asked choking sirius sighed as though he were dealing with a thirteen year old again perhaps he had forgotten by his own words she had grown if i ever found at this school sirius explained patiently dumbledore will be forced out whether they can prove he knew about it or not i no good as a spy no good as a ministry employee or even a teacher i can still hunt down peter and that what i doing thoughts whirled around dizzyingly in hermione head doing he was still doing it had dumbledore sanctioned this had he told him he was expendable she stood up furiously opening her mouth you it was as far as she got instead of giving him a scathing and articulate verbal beating on why his being useless was patent nonsense and if he ever went after pettigrew alone again she would personally tie him up and leave him in the room in the dark with no firewhisky she ran to the bin and threw up the food she hadntknown still existed she felt angry tears prick at her eyes as she coughed weakly into the bin that was not how it was meant to come out sirius would never have listened to her before he was him but now it was even less likely than before and if he went out and died because he thought he was useless the angry tears finally turned into something more substantial hermione wondered miserably why all the most terrible things in life always decided to happen to her at once instead of nice and spread out like normal just as her sniffling stuttering mind began to come up with a bizarre theory about this involving time travel and karma she felt a gentle tug on her scalp her hair was lifted carefully away from her face and she felt the monstrous ball of misery in her stomach slowly lessen sick sirius asked from behind her sounding surprised hermione wanted very dearly to wipe her tears say something sarcastic and sob into him all at the same time unfortunately she was rather busy doing the one thing she really didnt want to do when she was done he sighed and handed her some water hermione gratefully swished it around in her mouth and spit it out then drank down the rest she wiped her mouth with her collar and sighed feeling suddenly drained i didntmean to upset you sirius said finally pulling them both back over to the couch where she collapsed tiredly it just the logic of it sitting here doing nothing it made me think of it all honestly can you think of anyone else with as little to lose hermione wondered momentarily when he d made it his life work to confound the people who cared about him she turned her face into the pillow beside her and decided she was much too sick to try and work things out for him but that she was going to do it anyway what about the other people that care if you die she said quietly sirius shrugged laying across from her on the other side of the couch there only three people who even think i innocent he said and harry she said you want to leave him to that horrible family of his forever never even let him know he has a godfather sirius was silent for a moment she knew he was thinking more rationally now while he claimed to have thought it out in reality he had been looking for a reason to go out heroically and not feel guilty she knew you selfish bastard she cried sobbing so hard her body heaved with every breath you knew he smiled that was a low blow sirius commented unhappily unaware that hermione had just hugged the pillow to her so hard that the stuffing had split a badly done seam and inwardly she thought for harry he ll live but for me he just pretends it was a harrowing thought a selfish compulsion took her to storm out of the room like a seven year old but hermione found that though she dearly wanted to follow up on the impulse she simply could not move it was like waking from a horrible dream and failing to come back completely on the first try at any moment she was sure she would jerk so suddenly she would fall from her place on the cushion i got him sirius said abruptly and the jerk did take her hermione gasped and felt the feeling reenter her limbs she would have probably fallen just as she d thought if sirius hadntsnaked his arm out to stop her i got him hermione he said his eyes gleaming with the murderous vengeance he had been mistakenly imprisoned for she felt the breath catch in her throat it was a horrible vicious side of him she d never seen before for the first time since she had first been caught in the hall in her third year she was afraid of sirius black he released her suddenly and she scrambled back into her corner of the couch trying not to be too obtrusive about her escape his eyes were normal again though the edginess was still there but the reason for it was gone fleeing would be wrong at this point sirius rubbed at his face i mean to say he muttered i trapped him he only human now he cant transform i had to get close enough to him it how i broke the arm an auror was snooping in the area peter antics made them think i was there in albania albania hermione thought suddenly the terror in her mind breaking slightly harry vision the paper so you you figured it out then hermione managed finally trying to re establish the ease she d held in his presence just moments before sirius looked at her strangely hermione he said quietly look you should probably go back to your common room rest up a bit i ll be here a while but she had been thinking and in thinking she d discovered that she didnt want to go back even that horrible gleam in his eye the relish with which he spoke of wanting to kill peter it was part of him it was the part he had so carefully kept from her the part he hadntthought she could handle she really would be a child if she left now and he would never show her again no she said you need to understand something even without harry you re worth something a lot you shouldntgo putting a calculated worth on your life hermione swallowed and turned to face him look him straight in the eye you might be pardoned you might go off and start doing all the things you ve ever wanted to do you cant just throw all that away because you dontwant to face up to the things that are coming he opened his mouth to protest but she spoke first i ve seen it you re not avoiding the work you re avoiding the fear you think you really dontcare anymore but you do and and i do too and that she thought was much too close to some other queasy unnamed feeling inside her sirius coughed making the uncomfortable even more so he rubbed at his forehead that not right he muttered though he sounded unconvincing hermione said nothing but wondered whether it had been the wrong thing to say abruptly he stood up and walked across the room shuffling around through a small bag he came out with a little package but didntcomment on her curious expression until he had sat down again the small package was tossed to her unexpectedly and hermione being herself missed it by a yard she sighed and pushed herself over the edge of the couch to snag it it was wrapped in brown paper and tied with string hermione held it for a moment wondering whether he meant for her to open it sirius seemed slightly embarrassed by it in actuality i forgot to leave it with crookshanks he said explaining his expression i should have sent it with the owl i suppose but i kept forgetting it dawned on hermione that this was probably a christmas present she hesitated only a moment snatching a look in his direction before carefully pushing the thread from the paper and pulling it apart newspaper crackled a little and she blinked as a glint of silver caught her eyes it was a somewhat large tasteful ring twisted from two pieces of metal knowing that it was probably expected she tried it on her hand and found that it would only fit on her thumb ah sirius muttered i suppose i can find something else then i like it hermione interrupted quickly her face turning somewhat red it not something i d normally get his mouth twitched upward probably not one like this he said it was phrased a little oddly but when she looked at him for clarification he shrugged you d have gotten one that fit hermione plucked at her pajamas a little feeling suddenly uncertain i didntget anything for you she said i well you werentthere and i was more than a little angry sirius shrugged again revealing that they were both a little uncomfortable with the situation it fine he told her it wasntanything big in any case hermione privately disagreed and decided that she would spend a little more on a present for him this year that was assuming he didntrun off again before christmas you ll tell me if you plan to leave again she blurt out suddenly next time he shifted to lay his head back and she knew he was still very tired if i can it was the best she would be able to get out of him sighing she stood and stretched walking over to the door then thought of her timeturner it probably wasntthe best idea to use it now of all times but it was important that she get back before george awoke hermione pulled it from her shirt thinking sirius across the room sucked in his breath so you do still have it he accused hermione pressed her lips together yes she said but it not up for discussion her mind made up she turned it over once the room blurred shattered moments by rurouni star school continues to be icky but i finally pounded this one out i hope it well received i must let you all know my brain is utter mush it just not in any kind of condition to be keeping all the loose ends and questions together in my head despite multiple lists for help there however i soon going to be on break and i ll hopefully have time to get out one or two god help me more chapters tombadgerlock i should mention actually that harry hasnttold either ron or hermione about the egg this time around yet donahermurphy i so sorry to disappoint george just isnta punctual kind of person betty yes i have problems with liking george hermione too considering how horrible i am at sticking with pairings it might yet go somewhere ah no i didntjust say that chapter 16 unplanned solution contrary to general belief i do not believe that friends are necessarily the people you like best they are merely the people who got there first peter ustinov hermione blinked awake from a sleep she hadntknow she was in she sat up quickly panic blossoming in her stomach then very quickly hit the floor again as her head spun throbbing in pain she tried again slowly this time the blood rushed to her face and she wobbled on her knees she was outside the room that much was clear but it was hard to tell what time it was since the corridor had no windows hermione lifted herself to her feet frowning what had happened she d given the timeturner a flip and then the memory didntcome no matter how hard she tried to remember that usual feeling of mercurial vertigo there was absolutely nothing there a memory charm she thought with foreboding but no that was a different feeling altogether a cloudy head slippery sensations instead there was a total blank where her memory ought to have been what could do that hermione shook her head trying to ignore the creeping fear that sirius had been right 000000 the commonroom was empty and almost dark the sky outside could have been black for minutes or hours as far as she knew hermione in an unusual gesture of piety prayed that she hadntbeen out too long i would love a watch she murmured to herself kicking off her shoes if it wouldntbe utterly useless to me she sat down heavily in the chair by the fire thinking of time turners and stupid stupid azkaban escapees curiously the one that should have concerned her most was the one that ended up being shunted to the back of her head instead she found herself wondering on sirius when had he decided he wasntworth as much as anyone else had it always been there had she been too young to see it before or had something recent happened to shake his faith in himself come to think of it how much did she really know about sirius black hermione seized on this thought amazed she hadntaddressed it properly before he had been friends with harry parents with lupin and pettigrew as well but what about his family pureblood he d said and not very good people truly that was where her knowledge of his history stopped because from there there were thirteen years in azkaban a shiver shot down her spine the room suddenly seemed unbearably cold despite the fire and hermione pulled her legs up to her chest to offset it what could she possibly understand of azkaban she d only ever felt the full presence of a dementor once to compare it to thirteen years guilty without trial alone in the dark with only madness and vengeance for comfort there was no comparison she stared into the flames their flickering casting shadows like twisting creatures on the floor in front of her azkaban somehow she felt she could put together a picture of the place despite the fact she d never been there perhaps the simple concept was enough or perhaps perhaps she really had been there what was it sirius had first said to her yes perhaps a little taller fuller and no one that been to azkaban could look so young had he truly seen her a shade of the person hermione would become an older woman with the shadows of guilt and loss in her eyes a knot grew in her throat she had seen that hermione or at the very least the one she feared to be they re going to die and it all your fault if you had tried harder no you haventtried yet but you won t they d be alive dontyou understand a boggart but what if it were somehow true hermione clutched the timeturner tightly in her hand pressing her teeth together involuntarily her eyes had forgotten to blink as they stared into the fire and now they were tearing what if i just cantsucceed she whispered trembling the shadows in front of her surged suddenly and a hand landed on top of her head hermione jumped her breath loose in her throat the very shade of her failure was standing behind her staring blankly accusingly hermione do you want your homework she coughed then took a deep breath harry was looking at her with confusion not accusation he was outfitted in quidditch gear he d probably just gotten back from practice harry she said in a voice slightly higher than normal what if everything just going to happen i mean what if we cant do anything about it she swallowed you dontthink that true do you if he had been confused before he was certainly more so now have you been reading a bunch of depressing novels again he asked suspiciously setting down a sheet of parchment with little numbered items on it maybe hermione said laughing suddenly at herself and deflating a little anyway harry shrugged i still think it doesnt matter if it true it true and there nothing you can do about it if it not it not a typically harry opinion besides it not like we have the opportunity to find out he chuckled divination a load of bunk we all know that except when it wasn t hermione didnteven want to bring up her own brush with true predictions it was hard enough to think that divination held even a little utility unfocused as it was anyway harry continued cheerfully i screwed up today deflation charm pretty badly so i was going to ask if you could help me a bit flitwick told me to practice for homework hermione eyebrow rose that pretty bad he almost never assigns extra practice what did you do harry grinned sheepishly i popped the balloon wouldntbe so much of a problem but i think he going to be using animals for the final hermione shuddered at the thought of course i ll help you harry nothing like a good cause i figured you d say that 000000 hermione discovered of course that harry had only managed half her classes for all that he d thought he d got them all her teachers were all quite understanding she was only glad that harry knew about potions she was willing to bet that snape would have put a big fat red mark on anything she turned in late within the week things settled back to normal hermione began to find her way back on top of the precarious pile of homework she had committed to harry successfully deflated a balloon without popping it and things suddenly seemed much more satisfactory in general worries of course quickly intruded on this sense of well being her first was a concern with george since her disappearance from the commonroom he hadntsaid anything about it though she d talked to him in the halls an optimistic person might have believed he had simply thought her in the library hermione was not an optimistic person her second problem was an eventual need to talk to sirius once more things seemed to have become a bit strained since he had returned a by product of his idiotic behavior naturally or though she didntwant to think of the possibility it was a valid one hermione had grown by a year since seeing him last sirius hadntreally changed all that much but it was easy to assume that she had changed quite a bit it was she reluctantly considered a possible part of the sudden uncomfortable air between them just as hermione began to plan out her approach to these particular problems another one hit quite unexpectedly the yule ball the whole thing came to her attention in a very strange way actually hermione would never have imagined for example that she would be asked to the yule ball in the library or well at all she happened to be quite busy trying to find some more positive theories on time travel when a low cough made her look up in surprise hermione had to keep herself from suspiciously covering the pages of her book by reflex of course the true surprise was the person standing in front of her i could not help but notice viktor krum said uncomfortably you are in here very often hermione blinked setting a bookmark between the pages of the book and moving it unobtrusively behind another stack of less specific volumes the library has a lot of resources for doing homework i told she said with a slightly sour tone she hadntquite forgotten durmstrang departure from the gryffindor table krum winced a little and she felt slightly guilty for her tone perhaps it was a little harsh to judge him based on the entire school actions what are you here for she asked more politely at this krum held up a slim novel a muggle classic from the small section dedicated to such things she felt her eyebrows raise despite herself he was holding a copy of the trial far be it for her to comment but she d been under the impression that it was an incredibly depressing story the side of her mouth quirked i usually read lighter than that but to each their own krum looked down at the book as though he d never seen it before he was acting strangely stilted not surprising considering they d talked for a grand total of perhaps an hour the entire school year and vat vould you recommend he asked sounding genuinely interested hermione chewed at the inside of her cheek thoughtfully she didntactually know very much about krum so it would be rather presumptuous to recommend a book but of course she would the count of monte cristo she said uncertainly they donthave it in the library but i remember the muggle studies teacher had it on her shelf i sure she d let you borrow it i vill ask her thank you he hesitated as though unwilling to leave just yet hermione felt a little irritation rise in her she still had quite a bit of homework to do and he was only really prolonging an uncomfortable silence if you vould not mind krum said suddenly i vas vondering he cut off looking very lost indeed yes hermione said slowly trying to be encouraging instead of impatient do you haff an escort for the ball he said hermione had thought it an awkward silence before but no this was awkward silence are you are you asking me to the ball she said disbelievingly krum coughed again moving a hand to scratch at his head then deciding against it at the last minute and moving it to his pocket i understand if you are going vith someone it is fine hermione regained her sense just in time oh oh no no i not it just took me by surprise is all i sorry another uncomfortable silence followed belatedly hermione realized she was supposed to answer um why she inwardly winced it probably hadntbeen an incredibly diplomatic way of putting things krum though looked almost relieved the champions must haff partners to dance vith he said and i did not vant to ask someone from slytherin you seem very ah sensible i do not know the word his face turned troubled though she felt a little peeved at being considered only because she was not a slytherin hermione could understand the sentiment and as it was highly unlikely that she would be asked again i have no other plans she said and it does sound like you re in a bit of a jam i ll go with you then his face melted with relief that is very nice of you hermy own hermione ignored the mangled name but as he bowed nervously and left the library it began to dawn on her that she was going to have to dress up after all oh bother the rest of the reading on timelines did not get done 000000 the surprises werentover with for the week either she was sitting in the common room with ron attempting to beat him at wizards chess so he would open his charms book when his king toppled over and rolled off the board very mysteriously ron looking highly irritated and not at all amused glared at someone over her shoulder ha ha very funny a hand offered back up the rogue piece from behind her it ought to be a new move in chess george said sounding amused trip the king when he not looking the king itself muttered something nasty in a squeaky voice as ron replaced it on the board at least it better than fred old armageddon move ron said scowling hermione let out a small laugh trying to imagine fred and george playing ron at chess he d probably gotten all his practice off of either charlie or percy well now that the game finished is not ron protested we ve got to ask ourselves an important question my dear brother george said what that ron asked suspiciously trying to move his charms book somewhere hermione would forget about it got a date for the yule ball yet george asked he did so in a tone that clearly stated he didntbelieve his younger brother capable of such a thing ron frowned not yet no i ve got someone in mind though hermione blinked this was certainly news to her what you mean the french beauty queen george snorted my chess moves will get sanctioned before she goes anywhere on a date with you ron turned red and hermione knew george had hit the mark that not necessary george hermione said with a frown i protecting my little brother from cruel cruel rejection he replied blithely then how about you hermione found yourself a special friend hermione rolled her eyes of course i haven t george she stopped abruptly i actually yes though she couldntsee george behind her she was under the impression that he and ron had both blinked simultaneously oh come on hermione ron said a moment later looking amused you dont have to lie to look good here neither of us has dates yet either hermione frown deepened excuse me she said but i telling the truth i really do have a date ron sighed poking at a bishop to get it moving hermione he said the ball is a ways off i telling you you donthave to pretend she stood up sharply her knees hitting the table the pieces fell to their sides a few of them scattering from the table her face had turned a little pink i telling the truth she said again trembling with indignation george whistled from behind her armageddon he said sounding impressed hermione turned around angrily you believe me dontyou george he was busy staring at the chess board and didntmeet her eyes sure hermione who is it she swallowed hesitant um good lord they really wouldntbelieve her if she said viktor krum she didnt believe it herself see ron said triumphantly i knew it hermione turned around to fix him with an icy look i was just thinking of whether i ought to tell you or not i suppose i won t now ron snorted yeah all right hermione tell the minister of magic i send my regards hermione felt her face bunch up into a disgusted look ron ugh yeah fudge isntreally a looker is he agreed george sounding a little more upbeat if your mystery date suddenly cuts out i suppose i might pick you up hey hermione he added clearly also not believing her now hermione blinked ron fumbled with the pawn he was carefully resetting had had george just asked her to the ball as well no he must have been joking she went back to feeling indignant look i have a date she started and i sure he perfectly good looking and charming and all george said but should he disappear just before the ball for some reason i ll pick you up sixish hermione clenched her fists would you quit joking like that she demanded why is it so hard for you two to believe i might have been asked to the ball before you because you re always in the library ron suggested having completely reset his board now the charms book had disappeared without a trace because i cantthink of anyone in particular that might ask you george said honestly fiddling with the king he d somehow picked up again hermione felt her mouth drop open i dont believe you she said her voice raising a few semi tones into the screech worthy area she picked up her bag next to the table and threw it over her shoulder angrily moving to storm off toward the staircase what george said sounding confused i only meant i haventheard oh shut up hermione called back she slammed the door to the dormitory behind her parvati looked up at her in surprise from the bed where she d been doodling on her homework er something interesting happen that i missed she asked cautiously hermione threw her bag to her own bed judiciously ignoring the way the mattress suddenly sagged in the middle from their weight ron and george dontthink i have a date to the yule ball she said throwing herself after them parvati paused her pen hovering over the paper do you she asked sounding interested hermione glared at her why is it so hard to believe she began but parvati held up her hands in surrender i didntknow she said honestly who is it hermione stared at the top of her canopy simmering hermione parvati asked oh all right hermione said testily krum there was a pause really parvati asked sounding amazed wow i thought he was going to go with someone from durmstrang apparently not hermione said coolly trying to ignore the excess of amazement look donttell anyone all right i probably shouldnthave told you either parvati quill began to scratch on the parchment again lips sealed cross my heart hope to die yadda yadda yadda but really good for you hermione she only paused once more thoughtful although hermione steeled herself for the inevitable disparaging comparison perhaps to fleur or cho chang or parvati twin i thought someone else was going to ask you parvati admitted this was not what hermione had been expecting what she said all anger fled for the moment despite her irritation at other peoples assessment of her love life hermione herself had thought it incredibly unlikely that she would get asked to the ball by anyone other than neville longbottom i cantsay anything else parvati said if you haventfigured it out it better just to let it lie but parvati hermione protested i told you about krum didnti parvati looked at her meaningfully yes and i promised i wouldnttell about it i didntmake a promise on this one but it would really be mean to say since you re already going to the ball hermione sighed i suppose i understand that but it going to bother me now parvati began to hum to herself tough luck she said with a smile shattered moments by rurouni star yes indeed it been a while though not as bad as i might have thought this chapter is slightly short i think but probably better than nothing now i may have questions very very soon these questions will include things such as why the hell did hermione say something like that or why is sirius being such a jerk or why arentthey madly snogging yet as to the last one i afraid i wontbe obliging you for a very long time yes that confirmation you may take it as such however the first two i have often held that a good story has human characters and as you may have noticed humans get angry over irrational things take a point of view they know to be wrong and in general make very large mistakes especially in the form of impassioned arguments also hormones p minstrel91 firstly krum was very interested in taking hermione to the ball for her own sake this will get revealed soon enough also parvati was talking about george naturally she would have gotten it through katie through ginny through lee through fred or whatever particular chain you may be thinking of rheniel this is a sb hg and is listed as such but gw hg will be playing a huge amazing part in the whole thing you shall see wevvles thank you very much i was very happy about just about everything you said but most especially about the i dontexpect you to answer that part because you were quite right in that i cannot answer that particular question language warning for those who care this chapter contains a few ve ery choice words you have been warned chapter 17 contention we rarely think people have good sense unless they agree with us francois de la rochefoucauld if hermione had been expecting sympathy from sirius she certainly didntget it i hate boys she said shortly as she pushed into the room or men or whatever they re calling themselves these days sirius blinked and sat up from where he d been dozing on the couch you do realize you re speaking to one of the breed he asked sounding amused she gave a little harrumph and dropped her bag in front of the fire maybe you can enlighten me on the complexities of the male mind then sirius coughed suddenly as though she d said something funny his mouth reformed the word complex but he quickly settled himself back on the couch again and what is it that ron the weasley twins harry et al have done this time hermione frowned at him you re not at all helping talking like that you know he shrugged i only put it in order of the usual he explained a rather unapologetic smile threatening to break out on his face she sniffed and pulled her books out if you re going to be like that then i ll just start on my transfiguration merlin knows i going to have to be ahead on my winter homework if i going to the ball magic words sirius sat up abruptly the twitching corners of his mouth now still ball he said quickly so one of them asked you hermione yawned nibbling on her quill sirius was quite the old woman when it came to gossip it came from being shut away so much of the time she figured or perhaps he d just always been like that but it just another of our little teen scuffles sirius i sure you re not interested she fought back a grin why my dear hermione he said looking overly pained i always care about your problems i am the very soul of caring i care like a saint like a martyr oh all right already she said dropping the quill having done no work anyway and turning back around to look at him are you quite done he spread his hands i could go on if you like hermione decided quickly that she didntwant to explore the full extent of sirius black vocabulary for another fifteen minutes krum she said viktor krum the durmstrang champion and then not quite knowing why she suddenly cared that he know it she said you know the quidditch seeker we saw him at the world cup the change in sirius face was almost frighteningly sudden it went from perfectly open and familiar to very closed off and cloudy you told him no though didntyou he said slowly is that you were fighting with ron hermione brow knit no i was fighting with ron and george because they didntbelieve i had a date jerks she added still feeling slighted by the entire episode sirius eyes focused more keenly on her and for the first time since saying yes hermione began to wonder whether she had somehow made a mistake that sirius said in a low voice was a very stupid thing to do hermione she gaped at him how so she demanded suddenly defensive he perfectly nice and it not like i ve anyone else to go with have you lost your mind sirius said incredulously leaping to his feet he from durmstrang i dontknow how their reputation holds up today but in my day they ate muggleborns for breakfast brunch tea time and dinner hermione stumbled to her feet feeling the need to be closer to his towering height durmstrang is an upstanding european school she said and for your information the continental countries passed a pan european muggle protection agreement ten years ago oh i sure he sneered bet they even framed it with a little ribbon they still dontlet muggleborns into durmstrang do they he was probably unaware of the truth of this statement but hermione had to admit in some far corner of her mind that it was a fairly safe assumption to make for the moment however she stood on her tiptoes to stare him in the eyes so you want me to go demand he get his school policy changed she asked in a louder voice what more do you want him to do he picked me over the slytherin girls oh wonderful for you sirius yelled not even pretending toward civility anymore picked over the slytherin purebloods must be your proudest moment hermione hermione mouth fell open in astonished fury in the next instant sirius was reeling back onto the couch having been violently pushed there by two solid hands on his chest so sit here by yourself for all i care she yelled back face undoubtedly red with tears stinging at her eyes he looked gratifyingly shocked at her behavior enough so that his mouth delayed its inevitable opening while she fumbled for her timeturner if hermione had been harry or ron she would have spit a last epithet at him as she jerked the thing end over end luckily she was not sirius returned to his senses belatedly but instead of attempting to get in the last word his face turned almost nauseatingly funny and he did something quite unexpected he lunged forward to grab at the chain of the timeturner hermione wondered what he meant by this until she felt herself come apart 000000 she came back to herself somewhat after what must have been a split second nothing but in the infinite moment that followed hermione saw a thousand things swirl around her colors images incomprehensible people and gibberish and possibilities tossed about within showers of glittering sand her fingers sifted gently through a pool as she watched unable to close her eyes cantaccept that he has to and out again her hand came back to her and her frame of reference shifted back to normal so that the world became even more dizzyingly fast her eyes squeezed shut all at once hermione the sand was trickling onto her forehead who was it george voice whispered hoarse hermione tell me she opened her eyes black hair grey eyes a worried turn to the mouth not george what the hell happened sirius asked her are you all right hermione groaned her head suddenly throbbing in tune with his voice no oh ouch she realized belatedly that she was spread across the couch a pillow under her head water had been carefully dripped onto her face she felt it dribble off as she attempted to rise sirius pushed her back down frowning no he said don t i need you to stay here for a while hermione frowned remembering his last words to her why on earth should she listen to anything he had to say from here on out it had undoubtedly been meant to be an ironic statement considering the more amazing triumphs sirius had been told of but at the time his words had hit much too close to home that was indeed the reason viktor krum had given for asking her to the ball and though it was possibly the most demeaning reason she d ever heard for being asked to a dance hermione had thrilled in it at the time guiltily being forever compared to those purer than she was very tiring having to prove herself over and over never quite being accepted for herself she couldntcount the number of times she d stared at the ceiling of her bed thinking how simply unfair it all was and being picked for once over the rest by a dark famous widely desired person had made her feel more gratified than any of the house points she d received for propping harry up in his hardest hours for the simple reason that it had been her no sirius had been horribly sickeningly right and she hated him for it i going for some water she said coldly pushing herself to her feet and ignoring the sudden pound of blood in her head right here he pre empted her setting a glass in her hand his own eyes were hard it seemed neither had forgotten the preceding conversation hermione set the glass down slowly refusing to look away from him different water then she said feeling openly petulant for once sirius was not her keeper things were very much the opposite in point of fact hermione he said warningly but she had had enough of people looking down on her in the past few days and instead of staying to listen to him she walked briskly toward the door she slowed though just for a moment at a strange lack around her neck hermione turned around to glare at him i need my timeturner she informed him i going to have classes again after break sirius narrowed his eyes dontbe an idiot i taking it back to dumbledore he ll get your classes reduced i sure and that as they said in the proverbs was the last straw accio timeturner hermione snapped loudly it flew directly to her hand the cool glass flush against her palm without giving him another chance at protest she stepped straight out the door and started off for the commonroom 000000 sirius black was not a patient man he was not an understanding man usually either he understood these faults in himself but hadntever bothered to correct them more important things had always seemed to be going on in his life hermione granger though was usually quite patient quite understanding and quite intelligent therefore he found himself both confused and infuriated by her sudden lack of all three traits viktor krum had never shown the slightest interest in her so far as he knew granted it wasnt much but he was somehow certain that he just would know if that were the case no his sudden request was more than just suspect added to the fact that he was not only from durmstrang but durmstrang champion it made the entire thing much too neat to be real and he was amazed that hermione couldnthave seen that immediately how on earth could she have blindly accepted such an offer perhaps he had been harsh but damnit that was his usual prerogative where was her excuse he clenched his hand as he stared at the empty doorway where she d disappeared timeturner wound into her hand and that that thing he had seen it happen he could have sworn just for a second that hermione had well he wasntsure what she had done only that instead of flashing away as she usually did she had lingered for that sickening length of time her face frozen between fury and sudden panic all other problems had fled his mind at the time instead of giving her a biting phrase to think on for the rest of the night he d lunged to grab at the hand with the timeturner instinctively flipping it back around the other way before more sand could fall she hadnteven reacted to his touch just folded like a paper doll d j vu all over again he d been near paralyzed at the sight of her laying bone white and limp in his arms that had been done and done badly he still cursed himself regularly for his late arrival in her third year and now he was cursing himself for standing like an idiot that bare extra moment it was unforgivable inexcusable to make the same mistake twice so somehow in between his anger at her his hatred of that tiny golden hourglass and his anger at himself he managed to deposit her on the couch and pull the offending object off her an immediate improvement in her color made him only more determined to take the thrice damned thing back to dumbledore privacy or no but he d stayed to make sure she was all right to make sure she would wake up this time and it had led to his standing here in a doorway empty handed fuck fuck fuck fuck sirius slammed his open hand against the wall beside the door and gritted his teeth against the pain he had been planning on leaving as soon as he saw her again made certain she was coping those plans had abruptly disappeared a swish of light material and the crumple of paper and the room was once more empty 000000 thankfully neither parvati nor lavender had been in the room to witness her very undignified entrance hermione stumbling crying angry had hit the bed hard and slid to the floor in a little childish heap for what must have been the hundred thousandth time in her life the words not fair flashed through her mind it wasntfair that he treat her like that or that he yell at her or that she yell back or that she lose her self control so utterly it wasntfair that he be right slowly she clambered onto the bed to thrust her head into her pillow her face brushed metal clamped in her hand and she pushed herself back up with effort i hate you she whispered to the timeturner and though it had shown itself capable of many many other things it did not respond wiping the tears from her face she pulled the chain over her head with a shudder the tiny weight about her neck was like a grotesque piece fitting smugly into place she couldntget rid of it not until she knew until she learned how to stop these horrible things from happening more emotional than she could ever remember feeling before hermione buried her head in her pillow again and tried to will her hiccups to stop unfortunately everything simply stopped all at once and before she knew it she was waking up and it was dark and she had forgotten her bag with a cry somewhere between dismay and humiliation hermione leapt off the bed to unsteady feet stumbling across the uneven stones and out the door down in the commonroom torches flickered quietly on a soft murmur of voices she stole down as unobtrusively as possible wondering as she did so how on earth she was going to face up to sirius again to ask for her homework hermione the voice was not entirely unexpected at this point anything that could happen to her at all was bound to she turned around knowing she looked horrible yes she asked ron looked at her with such utter remorse that she felt her stomach plummet even further look i know we must ve said something bad i sorry hermione despite the sudden urge to throw her arms around him and confess everything hermione merely shook her head and laughed a little i not upset about it anymore she told him dont worry you re off the hook he shifted uncomfortably his ears a little red well that not all it you re not looking good again hermione she swallowed i ll get through it i have one nervous breakdown a year you know it ron though being ron patted her awkwardly on the back i bet it didnthelp though so sorry he scratched at his head and um you left your bag down here george found it hermione froze i i did she asked not daring to believe anything of the sort had she really she d gone there with the express intent of talking to sirius making amends ha and it was entirely possible that she d gone and forgotten no she had definitely taken it with her there had been talk of transfiguration george sitting in the corner raised his eyebrows substantively as she approached you all right he asked looking uncharacteristically concerned hermione shook her head in a very definite no you found my bag she asked tiredly has it got all the books george stared at her a moment then laughed disbelievingly looking like that you ask about your bloody homework he muttered sounding only halfway amused he offered up the bag though and hermione took it wordlessly taking the stairs slowly back up to the dormitory everything was there so in a very hermione fashion she restarted her winter homework and fell asleep on top of page three hundred sixty shattered moments by rurouni star a note this wasntoriginally going to be in here as i tend to shy from writing too much sirius pov in a hermione centric fic but as donahermurphy so kindly asked and everyone been waiting so damn long i figured i d add it in forgive me for any triteness as i hurried this one together for an in between after writing 19 the two are going up together and 19 seemed more important chapter 18 half a secret the secret of life is to appreciate the pleasure of being terribly terribly deceived oscar wilde sirius did not sit down in one of dumbledore overstuffed chairs neither did he partake of his lemon drops or watch the paintings as they went about their various daily routines instead he paced with a nervous furious energy unable to stand the thought of sitting and waiting like a good dog you never listen came phineas nigellus voice from above the headmaster chair i told you to get back underneath that cloak you re not the only one privileged with the password in you know sirius spat something at him that made a few of the other paintings wince and one of the more conscientious ladies cover her ears well nigellus said sounding more distasteful than genuinely affected i begin to wonder what exactly you learned at that potter fellow house obviously someone over there spoiled your vocabulary this did worse than nothing to curtail his anger in fact sirius could feel it rising to horrible levels and only the thought that dumbledore would never listen to him again if he destroyed nigellus stayed his shaking wand hand i learned more there than your descendants could ever have taught me sirius said instead his voice trembling with barely controlled rage they could have taught you plenty if you d bothered to learn nigellus said with strangely glittering eyes you just refused to see anything past your little mud caked view silencio the voice was not dumbledore s but it was one almost as unsettling the painting glared over sirius shoulder its mouth stopped moving after it realized the futility of trying to speak the quiet in the room dragged on stifling and still sirius continued to stare at the painting unwilling to turn around the paintings are only bound to give good advice to dumbledore came lupin sad and weary voice dont listen to him sirius he only trying to provoke you into something stupid sirius felt his clenched fists tremble i dontrecall asking for your advice either moony he spat the nickname out not much liking its taste anymore another tired silence took the place of the first but lupin did eventually speak again i deserve that he said every word and more i cannot recall a more wretched time in my life than when dumbledore told me the truth not even after james he trailed off into the paths of memory sirius had traveled uncountable times the flash of a sickly green floating mark above a beloved house the frozen faces of people not meant to lie in death i dontreally care how you felt about it sirius lied his deepest instincts begging him to go and embrace his old friend and find at least one trustworthy companion still alive and whole my most wretched times dontbegin to compare to a little guilt trip how long moony tell me again twelve years he obliged quietly and how many visits moony it was unfair he was being unfair again and he hated himself for it and he couldntstop none the answer was given in a whisper and he knew that whatever crazy aim he d had with this conversation it had been accomplished lupin had already flayed himself alive uncountable times for his mistake it was wrong of sirius to continue to persecute him for something with such logical reasons behind it he turned around feeling confused and wrong and there were tears in his eyes too from something he d thought long buried remus he managed i lupin looked old he looked tired and old and though he d always looked older than himself he d never been meant for this perfectly weary and patched persona and sirius remembered belatedly that he had promised himself many years ago that he would always always protect his friends and never let them be hurt he d thoroughly broken that promise now slashed it to tiny bits and pieces lupin moved forward though and pulled him in for a hard hug sirius felt the years turn back to azkaban and his wild hopes that remus unnatural way of understanding things would make him come running to get him freed he had imagined so many times that lupin would push his way into the cell and demand to know why no one had seen the obvious deception and tell them all that sirius could not possibly be guilty it hadnthappened azkaban had drawn on and on and on and he had lost his hopes and felt his deepest darkest fears peeled back to be revealed dear old moony thought he was a murderer he thought he d betrayed everyone and that had hurt almost as much as if he d actually done it i dontknow what i doing anymore moony he admitted shaking i dontknow you used to know everything lupin choked it not right what happened i d take your place in a heartbeat padfoot god knows my life isntperfect but i d give it all up to you if i could such words from lupin werentright either nothing was anymore he shook his head savoring the warmth of a human only moments more before pulling away you know i dont mean it he said i always always used to say things i didntmean i still do it i sorry moony i really am it not something to take for granted lupin told him in a quiet voice there a grave difference between someone putting dye in your shampoo and what i did and finally sirius let himself fall into one of those deceitfully comforting chairs wishing he d been able to have this conversation at some later date before he had to dredge up all his fury to deal with dumbledore it was hard to get anything through to him when one was calm he would lead you and twist things so that everything seemed so damned illogical and you felt stupid for asking in the first place you could only try to bulldoze him with a firm purpose in mind and a hard enough manner that he d take you seriously damn i wish things were simple again sirius muttered with a hand on his face they never really were lupin told him wearily you just made them that way by being stubborn sirius looked up i about to do it again he informed his old friend but i not involving you this time just get going and i ll we ll talk later i promise lupin mouth quirked but it was only a tip of the hat to old times nothing was better at all i would really advise getting under that cloak he said lackluster karkaroff and maxime both know the way in and snape sirius grit his teeth against the name snape teaching at the school never failed to raise the hairs on the back of his neck of course this was perfect for his need at the moment and hermione sheet white hermione dying dead hermione green tinged like james or lily yes that would be sufficient you ve always been so smart moony he said haltingly pulling the cloak over himself things had changed it would take time for them to feel comfortable again never in the ways that mattered lupin sighed staring at the seemingly empty room he turned to leave unhappy but stopped for just a moment to call back take care padfoot staring out from james old cloak stolen but perfect sirius could only shake his head and laugh 000000 it took dumbledore a full hour to appear in his own office but as per usual he knew of sirius presence before sirius knew of his phineas nigellus says you ve something important to tell me he said gravely moving over to his desk and sitting heavily sirius glared at the empty portrait above dumbledore desk before sweeping the cloak from his shoulders phineas nigellus talks a hell of a lot more than he ought to he said especially for someone under a silence spell i was obliged to remove it dumbledore apologized though sirius knew he was only acting for his benefit nigellus was one of his most important advisors sirius trained this glare on dumbledore now feeling for once that it was not the petulant grimace of a child he had his reasons god damnit and dumbledore was going to listen for once i see you do have something to talk about dumbledore said quietly hermione the name came out horribly forceful a normal person might think that sirius was angry at her and he was slightly but that wasntthe point dumbledore however knew the subtle distinction she has been doing very well from what i can tell he said sirius slammed his hand down on the desk it rattled the golden instruments precariously dontgive me that he said angrily we both know the truth or a really screwed up version in my case she getting pulled apart dumbledore sighed leaning back in his chair and looking strained she made the decision on her own sirius he said you may not believe me when i say i did not exert any pressure on her but i did not you re right sirius said with narrowed eyes i dontbelieve you you d do anything as long as you thought it was for the best dumbledore looked up at him he looked with that penetrating glance of his and he probably saw more than he would ever tell what if it is for the best dumbledore asked softly how can i distinguish between her and anyone else if she is willing to take on the burden she a child sirius said frustratedly she cant make that kind of decision how do you expect her to understand what it would do to her parents what it would do to harry so it truly is about harry dumbledore asked in that familiar terrible logical tone of voice that meant the conversation would end in his victory you care about him above everything else sirius swallowed feeling a dread seize him how can i not he asked he you know he harry dumbledore sighed his eyes dropping to the slowly rotating gyroscope on his desk his next words came with palpable difficulty i understand that you have come to care for miss granger as well it natural that you should you have been through trials enough together his eyes glimmered behind the spectacles on his face and sirius knew that it wasntjust the light of the room but what if you had to choose between them sirius felt his breath stop how no that was impossible but no it was all too probable how could he not have even conceived of the possibility that such a situation had been created you his voice was hoarse and he knew he sounded like a man frightened beyond his worst fears you cant be serious dumbledore hand moved slowly to halt the gyroscope in its spin being magical it did not clatter to the desk as it ought have done but his fingers were white on its golden surface what she is doing is dangerous dumbledore said in a tone barely above a whisper and she is aware somewhere within herself that the possibility of her death cannot be discounted you cantcount on that sirius managed she cantreally know without a doubt i tell you dumbledore said in miss granger harry has found a friend the likes of which he cannot imagine she has done more for less before the full moon sirius said in a shaking voice and wormtail the timeturner has a terrifying potential dumbledore agreed quietly and i do not understand it completely which makes me even more hesitant to accept this vein of action what action sirius asked what is it she doing dumbledore shook his head forget this conversation mr black he said forget everything i have told you you can think as i can of any number of reasons miss granger would keep this secret from you and it will only make things harder for her if you persist where she is unwilling that not right he said blankly his head dropping to his hands none of this is right no dumbledore agreed sadly it is not but went the unspoken addition it is for the best shattered moments by rurouni star er wow i think that the quickest greatest response i ve ever had i love you by the way so here we go hopefully this will answer a few questions speaking of which this and the next chapter are the two that gave me the most trouble the burrow despite being chock full of magic and having a ghoul in the attic can be a surprisingly boring place chapter 1 the brief summer the beginning is always today mary wollstonecraft shelley something was biting her lip hermione groaned and sat up rubbing at the sore skin the little owl hopped off her face with an approving hoot and she glared at it fine i got it message she turned to look at the clock near her bed and bit back a growl of frustration six am insistent little thing arentyou she muttered as she stumbled out of her covers toward the parchment that still lay on her desk admittedly her handwriting was not going to be beautiful in the early hours of the morning she gave it her best shot s i can easily understand your delay in writing i did say if you could thank you so much for taking care of buckbeak i know that must have been a bit of a hassle ron and harry have been mostly regular but summer is summer after all i ll make sure to get harry something good and i ll even leave him something else without a name if you want though i dontsee why you should need to get him anything at all after the firebolt he adores it she paused as she tried to find the best way to approach the timeturner matter admittedly she probably wasntawake enough to do this right but she did anyway i am taking extra classes this year but i shouldntneed to use the timeturner much at all dontworry i know my limits this year your owl is a menace and my mother is in love with it i hope you re happy write back soon h she blinked as she realized belatedly he d asked her for a name then she added p s i calling the beast geronimo the so called owl was currently blinking at the parchment curiously as she rolled it up intending to affix it to his leg as she moved to attach it though he hopped away with a playful hoot fluttering his wings a few times i need to get this out hermione told it annoyed she made a grab for it but it again hopped backward would you sit still she hissed geronimo was now having the time of his life however and was going unabashedly for the door why was the door open hermione shook her head thinking to herself that she d definitely closed it before she d gone to bed and ran to shut it before the owl could make its escape thankfully it closed just before the owl could get out and hermione shot her hand out to close her fingers around the tiny ball shaped owl it hooted obliviously happy even as she tied the letter to its leg and pushed it insistently out the window get going she shooed it see if he ll give you something to bring back happily the thing disappeared into the rising sun and hermione went back to bed 000000 truthfully she d had a pretty good summer the extra arithmancy had kept her both busy and fascinated and her supposed fourteenth birthday was coming up her parents usually had a nice quiet dinner at home with her favorite cake letters from harry and ron had been if not frequent often enough and now she had reassurance that sirius was safe so why did she feel so suddenly edgy her uneasiness was temporarily forgotten when she received the news that ron wanted her and harry to join him for the quidditch world cup her mother agreed reluctantly she d wanted to spend more time with hermione she said before she went off to school but her father seemed interested at the idea of a wizarding sports championship as long as you bring some pictures back he said then with a glance at her mother some of the moving ones if you can hermione grinned of course dad she said packing took her a rather short amount of time she d long since mentally revised what she would have to bring with her to hogwarts and she d only paused a moment when her eyes caught on the golden hourglass still sitting on her dresser she would have to wear it there was no way to pack it safely enough in her trunk one of hermione most dreadful fears was that it would break her fingers reached out hesitatingly to brush the glass while she held her breath the voices had completely gone away she realized quite suddenly why hadntshe realized it before she d been busy she d not wanted to think on it would putting the thing back on restart them hermione bit her lip she had to do it the visions and the voices were important to whatever her other self needed to change if she just gave the timeturner up she would be condemning herself and others to things she didntwant to imagine all in one motion she moved her fingers to close around the object tightly pulling it from the dresser she waited cautiously nothing happened hermione let her breath out and looped the chain about her neck tucking the tiny hourglass under her shirt something unfathomable clicked into place inside of her like an old friend come home so familiar was the sensation in fact that she didnteven notice it hermione went down the stairs lugging her trunk behind her her father caught her with a smile picking up the trunk himself and helping her down dontforget to write he told her we always love hearing from you she smiled back i ll send you a letter at least once a week she promised at the door her mother and father kissed her goodbye as always her mother was in tears have a good year she sniffled as crookshanks rubbed up against her leg in farewell and hermione dear say hello to your friends for us wontyou hermione tried very hard to hold back her own tears yes mum she said i ll say hello she gave them each one last parting hug before stepping outside her door and closing it behind her the street in front of her was empty in the high afternoon sun and silence rang in her ears hermione looked about the neighborhood slowly a strange sense of loneliness hit her all at once and she wiped at her eyes to keep the moisture there from building up crookshanks mewed grouchily as she hesitated he got up on his hind legs to paw at her wand okay okay hermione said dontget impatient sighing she rolled her trunk to the street and held out her right arm wand in hand she wasntreally sure what to expect she d only had harry strange recounting and ron reassurances to go by therefore it was a complete surprise when a low hum filled the street and a screeching sound came from around the corner hermione eyes widened and she stepped backward crookshanks standing behind her primly yowled unhappily as she tangled her legs on his and hit the pavement a large double decker bus whirled into view in front of her just as hermione held a cautious hand to her scraped elbow the bus doors opened and she blinked at the man that leaned against the side wall lazily knight bus he muttered halfheartedly not bothering to elaborate in any way hermione took this to mean he wasntthe same person harry had met she pulled herself to her feet with a wince and rolled her trunk on for herself with a confused glance at the man who paid absolutely no attention to her problems with it the doors slammed shut behind her as she got on and crookshanks hissed at the driver as his tail was nearly caught in them there were more important problems though to take into account the bus was beginning to move and not slowly either 000000 hermione a red haired boy was saying shocked you look absolutely awful what happened she glared at fred or george and crossed her arms she meant to upbraid the group of young weasleys gathered outside for not properly warning her but any anger she might have felt evaporated instantly as she caught sight of the house behind them it was for lack of a better description absolutely fascinating is this the burrow she managed flabbergasted her eyes were glued to the seemingly stacked up house layer upon layer of rooms and windows the colorful house with the walkway to the front reminded her of a technicolor cartoon ron frowned what that supposed to mean he asked her indignantly nothing hermione responded quickly it just i mean it amazing hermione jumped slightly as someone touched her shoulder from behind i charlie said a voice behind her it nice to meet you in person hermione she turned about with a smile nice to meet you charlie he would have been slightly more intimidating than his photo had he not been smiling broadly charlie was very tall though not quite as tall as ron and quite heavyset his face was covered in freckles like most of the family and his brown eyes sparkled with the unknown quality she d very rarely seen come out in sirius she shook his hand noting his strong grip and felt herself settle into a comfortable half familiarity with him charlie had written to her before in the matter of norbert and she had always thought he sounded like a very decent person bill not here yet ron voice came from beside her he going to get here in a bit after he smoothes over some kind of last minute thing with some old guy tomb ah yes george said feigning great knowledge on the matter the traps me and fred installed there last time we were in egypt must ve gone off his grin gave away the very obvious fact that he was lying i d hate to see your tomb ron murmured with a shudder hermione privately agreed with him as fred and george looked at each other with smiles of inspiration on their faces fred pulled a tiny notepad out and began to jot something down forebodingly where percy then hermione asked suddenly realizing that not everyone was accounted for off at the ministry charlie said with a wink working on top secret stuff ron stifled a snort while george let out a loud cough that sounded very much like cauldron bottoms hermione frowned i do wish you wouldnttease him so she said to ron ignoring the others he going to do a lot of good for someone with all that knowledge ron looked very much like he wanted to say something sarcastic but just as he opened his mouth a loud pop split the air and a red haired man apparated just in front of them stumbling a bit he was bleeding from a cut just beneath his right eye dad charlie said in alarm rushing toward the new arrival what on earth mr weasley moved back a step and rubbed at his cheek ruefully where a trickle of blood had begun to travel its way down to his chin dontworry he reassured them hastily it was just an out of control hat rack honestly the things people will enchant these days a hat rack attacking people hermione said before she could stop herself feeling scandalized that completely irresponsible what was the trigger coming in the door without saying your name mr weasley said to her not without a trace of frustration in his voice then without waiting to hear her response he was obviously very tired he turned back to the boys i going to bed will you lot take care of hermione for me there was an immediate murmured assent which made hermione feel slightly warmer come on then george told her as mr weasley disappeared into the house me and fred have things to do he stopped then rephrased himself carefully with a look back at the others i mean we re glad to see you hermione but you want to try to make an attacking hat rack now she muttered dryly not without a little humor in her voice fred beamed grabbing her by one arm and dragging her forward right in one no wonder everyone says you re so smart hermione knew blatant flattery when she heard it but she let it go she d been much more lenient with fred and george since stealing their map she noticed belatedly that charlie and ron had grabbed her things and were carrying them in after her she made to protest but ron gave her a look that dared her to try it her mouth shut with a snap fred and george lugged her into the kitchen an amazing whir of activity and magic and color that made her feel immediately at home her eyes roamed almost hungrily about the room taking in all of the things that the weasleys must have taken for granted by now the broom of the non flying kind she could obviously tell was sweeping the floor industriously on its own it moved aside to let her pass then continued its peculiar job as she passed fred muttered something amusedly about jinxing brooms to attack people she could swear she heard percy name in there as well george immediate agreement only made her more nervous it was then that her eyes alighted on the clock hanging on the wall she wasntentirely certain what time it was and her watch was in her case hermione blinked as she saw the hands of the clock and stopped without realizing it they had names on them the whole family it looked like it took her a moment to read them mr weasley fred george charlie and ron were all resting on the home space of the clock ginny written ginevra was currently shopping along with mrs weasley hermione gasped as she caught sight of bill clock hand it was pointing straight upward at mortal peril fred george she said in a panic look bill clock hand it s the two looked where she was pointing but didntreact quite as she d expected again george said sounding at once both impressed and envious that the third time this week fred sighed bill always gets the good jobs hermione mouth fell open for the second time that day what she nearly screeched what are you talking about it says he in danger fred and george exchanged amused glances before looking back at her shall i fred asked his twin congenially no said george i think i shall he grinned at hermione my dear dear fourth year bill is almost always in mortal peril he a curse breaker it part of the job hermione felt something inside her shirk at the idea of always being in mortal peril but arentyou worried she asked in a small voice i mean i surprised your mother hasntasked him to get a different job fred shrugged she tried believe me still tries every time he comes home in fact but he not yet died which he likes to point out george got a slightly more serious look on his face at this which surprised hermione momentarily bill never been one to do anything other than what he wants he good at the job and someone got to do it after all hermione sighed and deflated as ron and charlie entered with her bags i guess i shouldntget involved in it anyway she admitted shame faced her hand going instinctively to the time turner beneath her shirt to make sure it was hidden it just the thought of either of my parents in mortal peril i dontthink i could be calm about it no matter how many times it happened happened so quickly she felt the blood drain from her face abruptly and felt fred and george eyes grow intent upon her she hoped they would chalk it up to a vivid imagination you ll be staying with ginny i think ron interrupted apparently unaware there had even been a conversation or a significant pause on hermione part i ll i ll show you where it is if you like he sounded uncertain as though she might for some reason refuse that d be wonderful hermione said quickly with great relief at the opportunity to escape she was one of the few people that had recently become aware just how intelligent the twins were and there were just a few secrets they could not know that no one could know in actuality ron smiled with a relief of his own as he showed her up the stairs but hermione being slightly distressed and out of tune completely missed it shattered moments by rurouni star chapter 19 a day without studying it is impossible to enjoy idling thoroughly unless one has plenty of work to do jerome k jerome hermione heard nothing from sirius for days and this suited her perfectly well if the idea of facing him had before been uncomfortable it was now unthinkable the next day she woke late to an empty commonroom and quickly cloistered herself in the library with her books and homework she refused absolutely refused to think about sirius and what he might say to dumbledore and why she felt a little sick to her stomach at the thought that he might be angry with her yes she would not think about it that being why she was still staring blankly at her titled parchment half an hour after she d entered the library with a groan she let her head fall to the table not for the first time and certainly not for the last time she wondered why sirius seemed to have taken up such a large part of what used to be a fairly simple life are you haffing trouble hermione sat back up with a blink at the familiar voice uh for some reason it had nothing to do with sirius words at all at all she was suddenly stuttering at krum no she finished quickly i just cant concentrate it seems he nodded sympathetically and she noticed strangely that he was looking for lack of a better word groomed today vell it sometimes helps me to go walking during such times he suggested hesitantly vould you like to do so his voice carried the unmistakable suggestion of with me at the end a muffled gasp from behind krum sent hermione eyes from his figure a few girls were standing together now whispering to each other furiously ah wonderful you might have problems with your fan club if i do that she suggested sardonically pointing toward the group krum turned around to look at them as though he d never seen them in his life perhaps he hadnt he didnt seem too self aware if she did say so herself he had certainly never been so while she was watching excepting perhaps the quidditch world cup his face came back to her confused does what they think matter so much hermione blinked at this thought spoken aloud caught off guard that had been perhaps the last thing she may have expected from him i she stumbled well no not really he smiled in a relieved way and she found herself suddenly wondering why a person with such a very different personality was going to durmstrang at all well why not then she asked herself shutting her book with a snap and putting it back in her bag it not as though i managing any work anyway krum moved forward to take the bag before she could load it onto her shoulder though still smiling that strangely relieved smile hermione feeling her face heat in an equally strange way stepped out nervously from the desk to walk beside him the small gaggle of girls stepped off to the side as they passed whispering even more furiously but for once hermione paid them absolutely no mind as she stared at krum trying to figure him out i haff read this book a little he said as they exited into the hall the count of mont i cristo it is very good hermione looked down to see a familiar well worn copy of said book in his hand to her surprise there was a bookmark sticking out at least two thirds of the way through i glad you like it hermione said genuinely pleased that he had listened to her suggestion at all i wasntsure it would be your taste no no it is perfect he reassured her with a smile it was a smile different from the way harry or ron smiled at her a little more gentle and strangely focused at the same time hermione found herself floundering through her words as they discussed the book unnaturally inarticulate at the unfamiliar feeling of being that focus she found to her surprise that viktor krum was actually quite an intelligent person his words didntcome quickly but the ideas behind them were always insightful and well thought out as though he were a spectator on the world forming opinions as it floated by hermione found she d enjoyed their conversation a little too much by the time she returned escorted to the fat lady portrait it was already eight and very dark i haff enjoyed this afternoon krum said with a slightly dazed expression perhaps you should leave the library more often hermione blushed at this if it had been said in a different tone by a different person she may have become irritated but she knew he was saying it in good faith i i think so actually she confessed i enjoyed it as well he coughed nervously and after an awkward kind of silence hermione spoke well well i should be getting in then curfew is soon i think krum nodded at this and cleared his throat yes there was another slow hesitation before she found the courage to turn her back and face the portrait um fairy lights she said sheepishly the fat lady who had apparently been avidly eavesdropping the entire time winked at her as she opened up hermione slipped into the commonroom with her bag weighty on her shoulder her brain turned to utter mush she had blatantly ignored homework and worse she had liked it so dazed was she by this realization that she didnteven notice george and ron playing chess in the corner and by extension she completely missed ron raised eyebrows and george shocked expression d you know ron said in surprise as she went up the stairs i think she might have been telling the truth before george blinked then inexplicably he shoved himself up from the table and disappeared out the portrait 000000 the week seemed to go by in a blur after that hermione spent most of monday and tuesday in the library working on her homework and glancing up every few minutes in what she might have thought to be a surreptuous way wednesday krum came back and stumbled through a request for some other book recommendation which she quickly obliged she liked him it was a strange kind of thing to decide after agreeing to go to a dance with him but she did he was surprisingly intelligent and well spoken and his slow relaxed way about it was refreshingly different compared to her normally hectic life and what was more he was polite there was such an utter dearth of this particular quality in her life that she found it very valuable especially at the moment but whispered a voice in her head you also like that he makes you feel special it sounded suspiciously like sirius and besides what was wrong with feeling special in a good way and not in that responsible for keeping her stupid friends alive way nothing there was nothing wrong with it except she thought guiltily as she picked through hogsmeade except that she was beginning to think that he really did like her for more than her non slytherin status that he d asked her to the yule ball with genuine intentions and while she did like his manners and his ponderous momentous intelligence every time he looked at her with that strange smile in his eyes a pang went off in her stomach how was it possible for her to end up leading him on when there had really been nothing there to begin with this thought was in her mind even as she slipped off to hogsmeade in some of her more normal clothes in order to get her late christmas shopping done it was more than a little daunting exiting the secret passage in honeydukes cellar by herself with no invisibility cloak or map to help her but hermione managed it despite herself and made up for her slightly guilty conscience by buying her friends a great deal of candy there ron in particular had eaten through his entire supply of sugarquills hermione bought him more despite the fact that she knew he was nibbling on them in classes christmas spirit and all that the twins were another matter fred well enough she d been able to get her hands on a copy of potions and you and exploding things too with which she was sure he d be delighted george though for some horrific reason she couldntseem to come up with anything satisfactory for him the best she d been able to do was a few boxes of trick exploding snaps and while it wasntan overly cheap present it still felt lacking to her the last person on her list was of course the most confusing sirius hermione found herself sitting in front of a fire in the three broomsticks sipping a butterbeer and trying to ignore the glint of silver on her right thumb she wanted to say that it was inevitable that they would figure things out and continue their strange friendship once more sirius had said some horrible things and that she could forgive but many of them had also been true and her pride seemed to rear its head every time the thought occurred that a christmas present would be a good first step on her part toward reconciliation and viktor is a nice person she thought heatedly her hands clenching in her lap he cantgo judging people preemptively like that his whole life she looked down to find her other fingers worrying at the ring though and a resignation came over her of course she was getting him a present he d helped her out on numerous occasions and even though he wasntalways the perfect human specimen he had been through a hell of a life not to mention he d saved her life in the long run this was probably a petty thing probably she grit her teeth against the thought and rose leaving the money for the drink so what was it sirius could use her mind hit on a possibility 000000 did you hear what roger davies the lucky bastard hermione rolled her eyes at her book as she walked into the great hall for dinner it was christmas eve and all anyone seemed able to talk about was the student who d snagged fleur delacour for a date i swear she gritted as she sat down beside harry and ron if one more person so much as mentions that girl ron turned utterly white and harry eyes grew large behind him wrong thing to say he mouthed what is it hermione asked confusedly er uh nothing nothing ron managed hermione raised her eyebrows unconvinced let eat he said with a sudden false cheer looking around harry leaned over to whisper in her ear he tried to ask her to the ball tomorrow ron she said indignantly despite harry protests you have a date dontyou he winced pausing with a chicken wing in his hand i know hermione you werentthere though you dontknow she i swear there something weird about her harry beside him was nodding well when we were weighing wands she said her grandmother was a veela hermione mouth curled in distaste ah veela ron looked somewhat better at this revelation so i guess i couldn t ve helped it he said half to them and half to himself hermione tried not to laugh too loudly as she poured some soup into her bowl ron had probably wanted to ask her somewhere in the back of his mind the weird fourth of fleur had just given him a little push in her opinion on the subject of champions harry hermione said how are you doing on your next task any progress harry paused with a spoonful of potatoes nearly to his mouth he seemed to deliberate a lot over his answer yeah i think i ve almost got it he said after a moment just a little while longer i figure hermione smiled that good harry i guess you ve finally learned how to buckle down without me over your shoulder he laughed a little at this while ron looked cross and muttered something about singing day planners harry began to bolt down his food in record timing immediately afterward though and he rose to leave early harry she asked quizzically gotta do something he said enigmatically before rushing out the doors of the great hall hermione brow knit but she went back to her dinner quickly she hoped it wasntsomething severe he d forgotten like dress robes he d bought some hadnthe yes she seemed to recall him saying so dress robes oh oh she was going to the ball she would be wearing her dress robes hermione felt her face grow warm from simultaneous delight and embarrassment parvati had promised before to help her look her best and though she d scoffed at the time well perhaps a little help from someone with expertise in the area wouldnthurt after all who are you trying to impress sirius sarcastic voice sneered in her head the delight faded replaced by apprehension as she walked up to bed she didntknow 000000 hermione had to get up early the next morning to banish her presents beneath the commonroom tree but she allowed herself a sleep in afterward much past the other students crookshanks joined her without reservation by the time she got down harry and ron had not only opened all their presents but also started in on the candy she d given them oh hermynee ron called with a mouthful of chocolate frog fanks for the chocolate she shook her head and yawned making her way slowly down the stairs then with suspicion she looked around where are fred and george she asked their presents are still beneath the tree ron shrugged still sleeping i guess he said having swallowed the chocolate i dontreally want to know if they re off somewhere else actually usually ends up bad for everyone involved hermione frowned at him but sat down and curled her legs beneath her to start in on her own presents she found herself surprised at her number of presents harry had gotten her a book on standard level foreign charms it was good of him to remember she d been asking about something of the sort at the library ron had gotten her a stock of taffy continuing on his firm quest to make her eat as much sugar as possible while out from under the tyranny of her parents speaking of whom they d sent her a few new muggle novels she d been dying to read as well as a rather shocking amount of money hermione pulled the note from their package noting that it was in her mother neater handwriting dear hermione merry christmas we hope this finds you well it rather hard to find your way into diagon alley to use the post without a wand you know it so different having you away from home this year not that we re trying to make you feel guilty about staying just saying that you better come home next year mom things have stepped up at the office because of the christmas onset of customers and we ve quite a bit more money than expected and since we re so proud of your grades this year and all your extra hard work we figured a little bonus was in order for you as well dontspend it all on books as admirable as it is to be reading all the time you need to get out more perhaps you could get one of those flying broomsticks and get some exercise your father just wants to see one when you come home mom we sent all your relatives cards with the owl in the bottom of the package we love you and miss you and dad is eating your slice of pumpkin pie dontworry i ll get him to make more so we can send some mom have a wonderful rest of the year mom and dad she smiled feeling a little ache in her chest with their letter she did love hogwarts and she was happy to be in the unique position of staying because she d been asked to a ball ignoring the part where harry was probably going to be in danger somehow someway and she couldntleave without feeling like the world would collapse into anarchy in her absence but she did miss her parents dearly it was a drastic change from seeing them every day being able to ask how their day had gone at the office hearing about the more crazy patients usually she was simply so busy that thoughts of home didnthave time to crop up not being home during the holidays though had made her slightly homesick again oh hey harry told her you ve got a present from fred and george then after a pause maybe we ought to clear the area before you open it hermione rolled her eyes it was much too likely that the present was indeed trapped but she decided she would simply take it out of one or both of the twins hides if something happened harry handed her the small gold and red box and then promptly removed himself to the far wall slowly she pulled on the red ribbon that tied the box shut the bow slithered into a single line and disappeared suspiciously hermione pulled off the top of the tiny box an official looking paper unfolded itself from the box and stopped in front of her to float there were only two words on it sign here an x and a line followed hermione brows came together in confusion no explosion harry asked from across the room ron poked his head out from behind the couch no no explosion hermione affirmed still puzzled a quill flicked her on the head stinging her ouch she said in surprise then hey stop that the feathered end had begun to tickle her under the chin with much vigor hermione batted at it giggles beginning to escape her despite her best control har ry ron help she found herself on the floor gasping for breath as the quill went for that damned vulnerable spot behind her ear they looked at each other seeming to think about this for a moment dunno ron said doubtfully what if the quill explodes harry nodded looking concerned it the kind of thing they d do you jerks hermione managed twisting in her attempts to get away from the thing i ll make you explode harry grinned to show it was all in good humor all right all right he acquiesced moving over to make a grab for the quill it turned on him immediately rubbing itself under his nose harry sneezed violently stumbling away and falling unceremoniously onto the couch hermione pulled her wand then pointed it straight at the quill that enough she said breathlessly the quill shivered in the air for a moment then fell directly to the ground harry rubbed at his face and tried to sit up that wasnta spell he accused her as though distraught that hermione would use her wand for anything else no it wasn t she said slipping her wand back into her pajamas that was the halt command she walked over to the inert quill picking it up and turning back to the paper how d you know that ron asked throwing himself onto the couch as well hermione shrugged lucky guess she said analyzing the parchment for any suspicious marks or spells in actuality the tickling quill was something fred had asked her to tweak a little earlier that year it hadnt taken all that long the twins were perfect on most of their spells it was just getting the effects to stop that they usually had trouble with the command had been hermione input and she d half expected it to have been changed focusing on the parchment though she couldnt seem to find anything out of order it looked official and it was in good handwriting she couldntseem to puzzle out anything more or less than a ministry document lacking any other words of course that in itself was somewhat dangerous well she said uncertainly to herself they wouldntsend me anything bad for christmas would they possibly ron told her they ve done it to me course they thought i was going to find it as funny as they did sighing hermione grabbed the parchment and signed her name the parchment popped away with her last dotted i but the quill remained perhaps they d given it to her after all she shrugged and added it to her goodie bag to be taken upstairs she could always ask them about the signature later hermione ginny voice came from upstairs parvati says she needs you hermione frowned checking the time it wasnt even late afternoon and the yule ball was going to start at eight why on earth would parvati want her now her mi one ginny whined get up here before she tries to rework my makeup again with a sigh hermione rose from her seat picking up a sling of presents to carry up to her room harry and ron eyes were on her back as she went and ron opened his mouth as though to ask her who she was going with but he closed it before the words could come out hermione went to her dorm room door and hiked her bag of gifts on one shoulder then she took a deep breath and knocked shattered moments by rurouni star a comment on the quote it doesntquite fit not quite but it stuck in my head as i was writing the chapter so i finally caved and put it in also fyi there is a rather large bombshell in this one if you know how to read it correctly which i certain at least a few of you will in the meantime you re now going to wonder where alcohol enters into all of this smile chapter 20 the yule ball drunkenness is nothing but voluntary madness seneca are you coming hermione standing just behind the door hermione contemplated doing that the idea of running to her bed and hiding beneath the covers the rest of the night was warring with her prior plans and beginning to win out you go parvati said with a push hermione stumbled a little her dress robes barely swishing through the door before it closed ginny at the bottom of the stairs let out a loud squeal hermione winced but felt her anxious excitement grow nonetheless it perfect she gushed oh just wait you ll knock everyone socks off i dontknow about that hermione interrupted nervously making her way carefully down the stairs she made a quick mental prayer that she wouldnttrip over her own heels at some point during the night parvati rushed past her perfectly balanced ooh i way late she said i hope harry not too mad hermione shifted uncomfortably against the rail as parvati reached the portrait i dontthink he will be she said just now taking in the fact that harry was going to have a date parvati shoes clipped out the portrait but she poked her head back in a moment later viktor waiting outside she called to hermione in a sing song voice letting out a slight giggle a moment later ginny raised her eyebrows at hermione and made a shooing motion her stomach clenched into a knot what if he doesntlike it what if we clash or something i should have prepared better she realized belatedly that she d walked herself out of the commonroom and into the hall she recognized krum from behind noting his sharp black and red dress robes going together might not be too bad but they didntmatch like parvati had been gushing about her and harry krum turned around and she swallowed hard he d always been neatly groomed but at the moment he was looking darkly handsome in a way that just couldntbe healthy his face lit up and she nearly forgot to breathe her my own he said in surprise you are truly he seemed to forget himself and he shook his head murmuring something in bulgarian that sounded fairly impressed hermione felt a hot blush creep up her cheeks and hoped it wasnttoo obvious i um you too she managed not certain what to make of it his eyes didntleave her face as he walked over to her he offered his arm and she took it dazedly his warmth seeped through to her bare arm and she took comfort from its solidity despite their time together she d never actually touched krum she realized he was smiling at her now that strange smile that always turned her brain to mush ah i haff almost forgotten he said suddenly you know how to dance her my own she blinked searching for her voice it seemed to have deserted her along with her mental functions um she said articulately he seemed worried about this response they say the champions must dance first he told her but if you do not vish to oh no she said quickly no i know how to dance i sorry it no problem his face cleared in relief i did not vish to make you uncomfortable he told her they told me only tonight hermione made an effort to smile reassuringly it ll be fine she told him as long as we stay away from harry she thought to herself remembering that he d told her he didntknow how to dance she had to direct him to the great hall as he d not quite learned the layout of the castle yet but once they reached the crowd in front of it krum took the lead and steered her carefully through the chatting couples the floor was very conspicuously empty though the music was playing no one wanted to dance socially if it meant going out first it seemed hermione looked around instinctively for harry and ron and saw them sitting together at a table near the back the patil twins were looking uncomfortable as per the room current atmosphere while harry and ron were perfectly oblivious acting as though they were merely having dinner in the great hall well not her problem tonight hermione unconsciously clutched krum arm closer as the slightly colder air hit her arms apparently the ice sculptures couldntrely entirely on freezing charms you may borrow my coat if you vish krum said concernedly to her she felt her blush return and shook her head quickly just as mcgonagall made her way over to the center of the dance floor if i may she called tapping her wand on an ice swan ahem the room went silent not needing much encouragement at all that better mcgonagall said now then in the spirit of the yule holidays i would like to extend a very warm welcome to our guests on behalf of hogwarts it has been a pleasure having you and it is encouraging to see so many of you mixing with those from other schools her eyes seemed to be picking out the champions pre emptively so that hermione was not surprised at her next comment the yule ball traditionally starts with a dance by the champions and their escorts so if i may have the four champions and their dates on the floor hermione swallowed as krum began to walk out feeling slightly queasy at the sudden attention everyone was giving her was it really so incredible that she might be going to the ball with him she felt overly conscious of her awkward steps in the heels trying not to so clearly envision herself tripping and taking the rest of the champions with her krum let her arm go once they reached the far side of the floor but quickly took her hand and shoulder blade his frame was strong if a little clumsy she felt her nervousness ebb slightly as she realized she would be able to follow him he smiled reassuringly at her and she felt herself smile back the music then mcgonagall said behind her tapping her wand again this time at the orchestra they wouldntmake us dance viennese waltz hermione thought suddenly wildly no they couldntpossibly expect that of us viennese waltz was a hard dance she was utterly certain she wouldntbe able to do it just as utterly certain as she was they would play one just because she was so frightened of it the music that soon started though was not a viennese waltz to her relief it was a waltz but a very normal one anyone could do a box step and they d certainly kept that in mind krum took a first hesitant step on time and hermione went with him rotating a little bit he paused for a hesitation as though starting easy for her she appreciated the gesture though it seemed unnecessary she felt herself relax into his lead and the following box step went just as easily soon he gained confidence and they started sweeping down the floor in alternating half boxes you follow very vell he told her with some amount of surprise hermione smile widened i glad she told him i haventactually practiced with a person before this did surprise him i cannot tell he said and she felt he was being honest it made her glow with a greater pride than anything she d heard about her dress robes soon they were passing up both cedric and harry though roger davies seemed at least competent and fleur was back leading him expertly other couples began filing onto the floor and krum started to maneuver her between them nonetheless someone else soon bumped into her she turned her head to apologize and paused momentarily taken aback sorry about hermione george eyebrows shot up into his hairline er hello george hermione said before she slipped through a gap in the crowd and lost sight of him again inexplicably she found herself straining to find him the rest of the song who had he come with anyway hadnt he been missing a date when she d talked to him she didntsee him again during the dance but she did catch sight of harry who was now doing an almost passable job of a box step parvati didntseem to know the difference and looked positively ecstatic to be doing anything resembling a real dance at all well done harry she mentally congratulated him the song ended on a sweet drawn out note and krum brought them to a halt vould you like a drink he asked her looking once more dazed a pang of guilt went off in her stomach um if they have punch i suppose she said he nodded and escorted her from the floor before making his way toward the fountain hermione moved to sit down but was thwarted by a sudden grab at her arm long fingers dug into her skin pulling her back toward the floor she knew even before the hand grabbed her shoulder blade that she was not going to much enjoy this dance the whiff of expensive cologne and the flash of pale white skin told her as much granger malfoy said turning her about and leading her strongly into a more advanced move i wasnt aware you d learned to dance it wasnta compliment more of a stiff conversational move what are you playing at she hissed eyes darting around to check for harry or ron if either of them saw her dancing with malfoy of all people there would be an ugly confrontation in the middle of the floor i wouldntworry about your friends malfoy said blithely catching on to her worry they re concentrating on dancing or drinking i d expect he talked easily while he led obviously he d been expertly taught nothing less from a malfoy and your friends she asked with narrowed eyes he pushed her through an underarm turn and she stumbled a little as someone nearly collided with her when malfoy caught her again she found herself in a rather more tight position owing to the growing crowd it was not something she relished it almost acceptable to be around you with him as your escort malfoy said in her ear but other than that you look uncomfortable enough to make it a bad gesture on my part hermione tried to pull away but he was much stronger than he looked his hand on her shoulder blade held her in place just what i was talking about he said with a cold smile so what do you want she asked him trying to keep the disgust from her features other than a partner who knows how to dance he asked casually i thought i would tell you to stop your little head trips or at least not talk about them he spun her in place something she d definitely never done before and she felt her throat tighten what do you mean she asked thinking of the timeturner warm against her chest under two layers of cloth she had wanted so badly to take it off and leave it behind for just one night but a paranoia had begun to take her that she might miss something important without it the visions granger he said suddenly sounding less friendly now you wonthave them anymore do you hear me he was talking about what she d seen in divination then that made more sense but it didntmake her feel any better about what he was saying what do you know she asked feeling her stomach tighten he leaned in farther his breath tickling her ear and she shrank a bit something is going on he said certain people are getting antsy i ve been asked more than once about you in little casual ways hermione swallowed hard what what did you say she asked and then so close his lips might have touched her ear it was a joke granger you understand me she didnt understand for a moment it occurred to her that all of this really was his way of making her uncomfortable but no he was too serious for that clarify she gritted out working harder to pull away your prediction he hissed impatiently it was an elaborate joke on the old bat i heard potter and weasley laughing about it in the hall and you had better make sure that someone asking them will hear the same thing hermione froze and malfoy let out a curse as he stumbled over her he grabbed her again less closely and she realized a moment later that he was actually trying to finish out the song blankly she obliged him going through a complex series of steps she probably wouldnthave been able to if she were paying attention the song ended and he gave her one last scathing look before pushing off into the crowd she stepped off of the floor and caught sight of krum looking somewhat lost um viktor she called the name feeling foreign in her mouth over here he saw her and walked over carrying two goblets of what looked like fruit punch someone caught me for a dance she explained quickly i sorry he handed her a goblet with another quick smile it is good you vould attract much attention tonight she sat down at the table setting the punch down and tucking her legs together in front of her chair she cleared her throat nervously so ah what are you planning to do once you get out of school it surprised her vaguely that she hadnt asked this before but then most of their conversation had been on books and philosophy so far krum seemed to mull this over a while sipping at the punch i vill be vith the quidditch for a long time i think it is a good career hermione made an o with her mouth surprised she hadntthought of this i sorry i keep forgetting you play she said with an embarrassed laugh he shook his head no it is a good question after i vould like to travel i haff always been interested in egypt and the artifacts they find there hermione put a hand to her mouth oh she said oh ron brother bill has worked as a curse breaker over there i sure he d love to show you around krum seemed instantly intrigued by this ron is he is the red haired friend she nodded his brother charlie was working with the dragons too do you remember him at all krum made a sound of affirmation instantly he is the one to muzzle the fireball he recalled very quick on his feet i vas thinking he vould have played quidditch in school hermione beamed i fairly sure he did actually here why donti introduce you to ron she took a short swallow of her punch to make certain she wouldntspill it as she walked then rose from her seat krum offered her his arm again but she noticed that he was now looking deep in thought mulling over possibilities as she knew she sometimes did harry and ron as it happened were deep in conversation about that sports move krum had done at the cup started with a w if she recalled parvati and padma were nowhere to be seen they had probably grown just as bored with it as hermione often did they didntnotice her until she was just about upon them hermione harry said in surprise nearly falling off his seat you well hey ron was looking at her with a strange mixture of emotions on his face something like admiration and maybe regret perhaps he was thinking better of the way he d belittled the possibility of her date um she said sheepishly i thought i d introduce everyone but i suppose you ve all met already krum let go of her arm to bow courteously which clearly astonished both of them hermione sometimes had the sneaking suspicion they didnteven know how to shake hands let alone be officially courteous i haff met you two at the table krum recalled it is good to talk again hermione tried not to laugh at ron sudden awe struck look after all she couldntreally talk with her lockhart hero worship viktor said he interested in egyptian artifacts hermione told ron i thought you might know more what with bill and your trip there you haff been to the ruins krum asked with clear interest in his voice ron blinked a moment before nodding hurriedly er yeah family went there summer before last krum pulled up a chair for hermione then sat down himself the mummies they are still living some yeah ron said quickly there re warnings all around not to use magic they get attracted to it and bill told me some wizards turn up dead predictably the conversation continued excitedly from here and while hermione started out quite interested in it as she was in every eccentric bit of knowledge her attention began to wane later on she began to sip extensively at her punch which necessitated that she replenish its contents a few times but even with these short breaks to stretch her legs she eventually found herself blinking back to reality at odd intervals so they tried to lock percy in a tomb but mum found out and let him out you wouldntbelieve it but he was perfectly fine not even scared i reckon he didntactually know there could ve been one in there with him even this seemed inadequate to jolt her back to interest hermione eyes wandered about the room and she blinked as she realized it was slightly blurry i hope this doesntmean i going to need glasses she sighed to herself blinking hard a few times to clear things up hermione a voice asked and while she wasntentirely certain she thought it might have been george hey i didntget a chance to he broke off and she turned to look at him feeling a little hazy you you didn t drink that did you george asked her in a strangely pitched voice hermione looked down at her cup it was empty well she said what do you think george said nothing but his face had drained itself of color ugh harry said across from her i think i had a little too much myself actually i feeling somewhat sick ron and krum took no notice of their exchange deeply engaged in conversation about scarab art i feel fine hermione said to harry well not fine per se but harry interrupted her by leaping to his feet looking quite distressed of a sudden he ran for the doors of the great hall and george groaned told him it was a bad idea he muttered hermione looked at him suspiciously told who what exactly she had the feeling she ought to know what he was talking about but her head was acting fuzzy and her thoughts were moving slowly as though through molasses george looked over at krum once before slipping an arm around her shoulders and hoisting her up it late anyway hermione you ought to get to bed she blinked swaying a little why on earth was she suddenly off balance she d been waltzing not three hours prior i really sorry by the way he sighed dragging her out the doors i dontknow why i didntthink you might drink some hermione felt her knees give way abruptly george seemed somewhat prepared for this as he caught the rest of her weight against himself must be the heels hermione muttered i knew they d trip me up let me let me take them off she pulled away and found herself abruptly sitting on the floor shrugging she worked clumsily at the straps of the shoes frowning as her fingers slipped haphazardly about george knelt down next to her and started to work on them for her undoing the clasps and slipping them off hermione wiggled her toes experimentally and found herself unaccountably fascinated by the action here now george said up we go he pulled her up under the arms her shoes in his other hand she stumbled up beginning to suspect that it was not the heels after all the corridor was now mostly dark and she felt her bare feet trip over themselves without light george arm pulled her closer to him and for some reason she couldntreally fathom it seemed entirely natural that she should lean into him and stop walking hermione he asked sounding surprised and a little worried he wasntcold like malfoy he wasnteven uncomfortably admiring like krum he was warm and familiar and she found she really just wanted to sit down where they were and enjoy the feeling of his arm around her shoulders come on hermione he said we need to get you in bed she sighed tiredly and decided she didnt want to go all that way to get to bed instead she leaned in closer setting her head just below his chin this this was where she d wanted to be all along h hey he said his voice vibrating in her bones what are hermione tired she murmured her eyes fluttering against her will this changed when she realized that there was no protesting voice with a reason as to why she shouldntgo to sleep right here indeed that sounded like an incredibly good idea she congratulated herself as her mind drifted off warm and happy hermione hermione don t hermione she smiled weakly against him his arm close around her it had been such a horrible horrible day and there were so many more to come but for now it was over for now she was warm and safe if nothing else she said in a trembling voice i glad you re still here the arm around her tightened she felt herself surface back to consciousness at some slight change the warmth but george hermione winced trying to sort out her brain everything had somehow mixed together inside and it was suddenly hard to tell where she d been and where she was there was something firm but cushioned beneath her she turned her head with a little sound her eyes opening to slits there were flickering lights in front of her eyes fire a shape was moving in front of it and she felt warm cotton descend on her tucked a little here and there she pulled it closer to herself feeling somewhat cold at the sudden departure of her heat you ll get better hermione i ll take care of you so so dontworry all right a hand brushed away her hair it had come loose from its careful bun it had been up though why the ball she d been at the ball not where where something horrible had happened but she had been at the ball and somehow she knew everyone there was fine how could something horrible have happened and not happened at once why would i worry about myself of all things her heart plummeted confused and frightened and somehow overwhelmed with a staggering grief something escaped her between a laugh and a sob and the hand at her forehead paused hermione she moved her hand to take his pulling it to her chest to fill the empty space there just about where her heart ought to be his other hand moved to her shoulder to pat her reassuringly she swallowed shaking trying to pull the dream from her head it wasntreal it couldntbe because if it was real it meant she d failed and she couldnt fail ah george was muttering you re that kind of drunk she latched onto his voice bringing herself more fully awake there was a sickening feeling inside that if she fell asleep she would dream again and it wouldntbe pleasant in the least george she asked please d dont leave i cant think it all muddled up and i c cant think he stiffened for a moment at her voice but relaxed himself almost immediately after i not leaving he said but you should get to sleep you ll only feel worse if you dontget enough she took a deep breath trying to steady herself i cantgo to sleep like this she said i wont wake up it was a horrible thought and somehow certain in her mind it was even worse for the thought that came after that everything she d done until now would be for nothing if she died there no second time around she thought suddenly her fingers tightening on george hand i cant i cantdo it wrong that the alcohol talking he told her with a sigh believe me you ll wake up no she said shaking her head no it not you don t i really am sorry he said sounding genuinely regretful we spiked the punch hermione i dontknow how much you drank but well enough it looks like i dontwant anyone to die she told him in a choked voice george his hand stopped on her shoulder why would anyone die he asked i dontknow she said feeling the panic in her heart turn to shivers i dontknow i dont know i dont know why did he have to he shouldnthave gone before me it doesnt work like that shh hermione go to sleep you ll feel better i swear he was sounding guilty and somewhat frightened now his fingers brushing reassuringly through her hair i know i know dontdie george she whispered not you too he pulled his hand from her grip but quickly engulfed her in a tight hug i not going anywhere hermione he promised shattered moments by rurouni star hm just thought i d note i was all ready to write on the chapter and i checked reviews for questions to answer then i got this little misspelled jewel that said something about a gun to my head if i didntupdate soon even though the person never reviewed me b4 and obviously had no reason to demand anything at all from me anyway as i dontknow them shortly thereafter i lost all desire to write and put it off until the end of the break actually i thought about quitting altogether for a while but that was me feeling sorry for myself after an utterly terrible year suffice to say donahermurphy and jewel song save the day completely by making up for the one crappy review with pages and pages of lurve thank you very very much even though i really didntfeel like typing anything for a good long while here all you nice patient people merry christmas present with a bit of almost teacher sirius on top the only drawback to this entire scenario is that it put me off so long that the next chapter will have to come after school starts consequently it means that wontbe for a while sorry i sure i could come up with a very witty and cutting remark about inconsiderate twelve year olds on the internet here but we ve all heard it before and it can end nowhere good so i ll settle for questions tombadgerlock it wasntreally a question but i think you may have misinterpreted something i actually meant to be clear er for once malfoy was in his snide sarcastic evil way trying to tell hermione that he was getting her off the hook for her prediction by telling everyone she d played a bad joke by making a doom prediction to trelawny the last part was something along the lines of you better make sure potter and weasley will tell that to anyone who asks too or both of us will get in huge heaping amounts of dead though actually i like this way better person4 your vagueness is appreciated even if you re wrong knowing my luck you d come up with something a hundred times better and have people believing it up until the point i let them down lamely to all others i love george too i d like one of my own one of these days sirius too is a decent sort hermione as i ve said before will probably end up with sirius because i listed it as sbhg and i dontbelieve in letting people down after i ve said one thing plus it was a self challenge to do a real older sirius younger hermione that worked and i really dont want to cheat but george has a really really really really really ad nauseum big part to play in this entire series i promise you ve really just seen the tip of the iceberg well i ve rambled on long enough anyone who actually read it all i touched now go read the real thing warning extreme late night silliness ahead chapter 21 kickback a hangover is the wrath of grapes unknown hermione woke to a headache and a quick fall from a short height ow said the george she d fallen on she groaned and scuttled off him setting his presence to the back of her mind and trying to remember exactly how she d come to be sleeping on the commonroom couch in full yule ball regalia hermione frowned as she realized there was yet another large black spot in her memory now hey she said turning over to stare at george what are you we doing here and why is my head hurting it was usually best to simply ask after all he blinked looking somewhat bleary himself the punch was spiked he said in a tone that seemed to say he had told her so before and she d forgotten well how silly of her oh she said faintly that phrase had entirely too many possibilities behind it i didntdo anything too terribly humiliating did i she asked hesitantly hermione had never had alcohol before excepting the very very small amount in the three broomsticks butterbeer and seeing as she remembered very little murphy law would insist that she had repressed the experience voluntarily out of embarrassment george took a while in responding which only compounded her worries but no he said no not really laughed a little cried a little a lot like fred does actually the vision of george watching her cry over something stupid did not make her feel particularly better oh god she muttered holding her head with one hand i hope no one else saw george chuckled and she found that his hair was in horrible disarray as was his dress shirt and tie what was more disturbing the thought crossed her mind that he looked rather handsome as such the alcohol she determined i still have some in me i think everyone else was too tanked to care much about you he said poor harry he was hanging over the toilet two hours guess it ll put him off going out drinking once he older hey hermione squinted at him suspiciously so how come you re not looking hung over george shrugged but even in her current state she thought he was looking a little too innocent i didnt drink any of the punch he said hate the stuff actually in deed i actually curious to see who shows up for breakfast he said with a twitching grin wouldntit be great if snape had some he ll have brewed a counter agent i d expect hermione sniffed swaying a little as she got to her feet hm her shoes had gone missing you d expect george agreed but that stuff does take a little while to mature and if there happens to be absolutely none on hand hermione continued to stare at him suspiciously just saying he told her you never know she sighed deciding she really didntcare at the moment lord i must look terrible she muttered stumbling over to the bathroom door there was silence behind her it only intensified the queasy feeling in her stomach or actually that might have just been the hangover hermione found to her dismay that her vision was still somewhat blurry still her hair had against all odds stayed mostly in its bun a few stray hairs had escaped and started to curl back into their original shape but parvati had been right sleakeasy was a hell of a hair gel her eyes of course had great big shadows beneath them and her dress robes were alas quite wrinkled sighing she turned to stumble up the stairs only to find george staring at her a little strangely what she snapped it not that bad no he said quickly no it not it just weird you look different with your hair all up and uh he seemed to be searching for a fitting word perhaps the morning was making him come up short not frizzy she supplied her mouth quirking a little dontworry it ll be back to plain hermione jane in no time it was a bad joke even for her then again she really wasntfeeling very witty this morning she turned to go up the stairs leaning a little heavily on the rail as she did so er hey he said quickly your uh shoes hermione paused sighed and trudged back down to the couch to pick up the shoes where they were set neatly by the end so that where they d gone her feet were horribly cold on the floor and her body was already drowsing at the wonderful thought of a warm heavy comforter not to mention the perfect darkness that would result from sticking her head under the covers despite this she paused once more to turn around and look down at george um she said her cheeks coloring somewhat thank you by the way he shifted on his feet and stuck his hands into his pockets no problem you re a relatively calm drunk anyhow hermione had the distinctive feeling that he was lying to make her feel better murphy was insisting it in the back of her head but she accepted it anyway and even managed something of a smile as she slipped into her shared room god came a moan from one of the beds close the bloody door ah lavender had had some punch as well it seemed 000000 upon her second waking at about eight when hermione realized she still had done nothing about her clothes hair or makeup she remembered that one present had yet to be delivered with a scramble out of bed and a hasty change into her robes she went scuttling out the door ignoring the half alive moans from her two roommates she was simultaneously hopping and attempting to pull on a shoe when she discovered she was missing a sock and a sweater ah oh well feeling each step acutely in her pounding head she skidded around a corner into the wall on the other side murmuring the password hurriedly so that she might step through instead of hitting it hermione found to her immediate dismay that the spell on the wall had not worked she squeezed her eyes shut as impact occurred but realized as she did so that the wall she had run into was actually a bit softer than a wall and a lot warmer than most walls came in fact this wall had arms and was trying to hold her up through some slippery bit of material somehow the wall was moving backward and letting out some kind of curse now hermione her brain said you may be slightly hung over but this is one you should be able to figure out yes indeed the wall was a person in an invisibility cloak with a hand on either of her upper arms and presently the invisibility cloak slithered to the floor as well though it was hard to tell in the darkness of the room behind the somewhat real wall you know sirius said with a tired sigh we really ought to stop bumping into each other like this hermione agreed but found her head was really hurting quite a bit too much to say so but his hands were warm and his fingers felt oddly comforting digging into her skin and all she seemed able to think was well obviously not a wall er hermione dontknow why i got out of bed she mumbled sirius laughed and despite the fact that she could very clearly remember being angry at him and for half good reasons that they really ought to have straightened out it made her warm up from the inside out and and want to do something very socially unacceptable yes his laughter stopped as she suddenly threw herself forward wrapping her arms around him and burying her face in his chest i i sorry she said and even though she didntreally mean it she really did sirius though thoroughly bewildered had the sense to hug her back it was a few awkward moments before he cleared his throat er well hermione blinked then felt the unease penetrate slowly she began to disentangle herself to retreat to a more acceptable distance oddly his grip on her only tightened confused she looked up at him forgetting that she couldntsee his face i might be to blame as well he said his voice sounding strange or no i am i sorry too it was not by any means something she had expected to hear from him ever really perhaps she thought i ought to step back at this point maybe her body wasntlistening presently she decided to blame this on the hangover as well in any case he said his grip not slackened in the least i wanted to say it s distantly hermione remembered that she hated when people couldntfinish sentences a fancy struck her to finish for him just to say something but it was luckily suppressed i understand you re doing things and i dontreally know what things but if it comes down to it inarticulate she thought that the word for this but it not the word i would associate with him if it comes down to it you need to think of yourself too he said finally sounding slightly frightened at himself with a tinge of almost desperate because you matter too you know and it just no good living entirely for other people hermione felt the strange little chatterings in her mind disappear dumbledore she thought he talked to him what did he say she didntask she wanted so dearly to ask but she couldn t or it would be tantamount to saying she didnt trust to tell him things herself which was true it was true of everyone but she didnt want to say it i think that all he said suddenly letting her go hermione stumbled her way to the couch in the dark and sat down heavily all right she said faintly all right another uncomfortable silence passed and she felt him lean on the back of the couch with his hand i dontunderstand but i dontunderstand most of what i doing lately perhaps i ought to just play this by ear as well i got you a present she said blinking or not the slight sound of surprise from behind her told her she d caught them both off guard er really i hadntthought of it hermione fingers closed on the silver ring in an awkward way and she nodded remembering again too late that they were completely in the dark oh here i ll she fumbled for her wand trying to remember which pocket she d put it in before she could get it out though there was a murmur from behind her and the room lit up ow hermione said with a blink covering her eyes too bright he asked as he came around the corner of the couch sounding puzzled it just the fire ow she reiterated more for her own benefit than his her head was beginning to pound even more than it had been it was times like this that she wondered why the human hand wasntformed to perfectly shut out light from the eyes inevitably some always got through and it was annoying and currently painful sirius had stopped in front of her and she had the feeling he was examining her curiously she dropped her hand for the sole purpose of frowning at him he dropped his wand what did you you re he broke off bewilderedly as she struggled to sit up against the arm of the couch after a moment of blatant staring unnoticed on her part sirius seemed to regain his sense of self long enough to rub at his temples shortly hermione realized he was being completely silent and she looked up at him with an annoyed face what sirius blinked nothing he said lying quite boldly now look here hermione said crossly narrowing her eyes i not stupid and if there a bug in my hair or something i would really like to know sooner rather than later your hair up he said carefully in what might have been an evasive voice so hermione demanded i wear my hair up sometimes so i not looking perfect she thought with gritted teeth i went to sleep drunk in a dress robe he done the exact same thing knowing him and voluntarily i d bet it looks different he defended brushing some imaginary speck off himself and picking back up his wand you ve got and there s makeup she asked smeared yes that what generally happens when you go to sleep in it she shielded her eyes against the fire again wincing does that stupid thing have to be so bright sirius looked blankly behind him as though just realizing the fire was there oh for god sake he d just lit the thing himself he swished his wand and it dimmed somewhat just enough to lower the pounding in her head from apocalyptic to earthquake sized you look pale he said suddenly have you been eating enough hermione let her hand curl around her head yes she said feeling a slight blush creep up her cheeks i eating perfectly fine thank you she wasn t actually but her paleness probably had more to do with the blatant drumming at her temples er did you get enough sleep then i thought i saw shadows under fine she said i fine all my biological systems are normal hale and healthy his mouth quirked downward except your head hermione swallowed her mouth had been dry all morning she suddenly realized yes she said i ve a headache now now stop talking all right as long as it had been since she d really talked to him and all right heard his voice which she had apparently been missing to some extent every word he spoke seemed to be thudding into her head like a jackhammer sometimes thudded to be fair everything she said was doing the exact same thing except with a bigger jackhammer sirius eyebrows shot upward you got drunk he asked there was a slight emphasis on the you which she didntentirely like now why did he sound so surprised it wasnt as though she werentperfectly capable of going and finding some firewhisky on her own well yes all right it wasnt likely but it was entirely possible someone spiked the punch hermione said groaning he sat down on the floor now still looking slightly shell shocked and rubbing at his temples how badly he asked you remember everything or did you black out hermione made a face blacked out she confirmed although george tells me i didntget into any trouble rather nice of him to stick around and make sure but now i ve got another gaping hole in my memory my brain probably looks like swiss cheese he twitched slightly at this and she caught a guilty expression before it had the chance to disappear i not accusing you or anything she added though of course this brought back memories of every other argument they d had that never got resolved before there could be another awkward pause though she swallowed dryly again and picked up the small bundle she d rushed through the hallways with now before i forget she told him here she thrust the package at him and he blinked at her a bit it not socks is it he asked a wry tilt to his mouth what hermione asked feeling just a little vengeful still do do you not like socks alas her acting seemed lacking because he shot her a dry smile before taking the package from her it had never struck her before that adults opened their presents differently than children did as sirius tore into the paper with a healthy fervor though she remembered that her own parents liked to carefully pull out the taped parts so that the wrapping paper was still pristine at the end folded into a little square a strange vindication arose in her at the sight of sirius doing something so absolutely different than expected she wasntentirely sure why aha he said with a small grin i see red and gold you ve obviously got flawless taste hermione smiled feeling something in her chest swell just a little bit hm he said pulling the scarf from its wrapping and looking just the slightest bit nostalgic hm it not just a scarf she said quietly suddenly feeling a little silly it lengthens into a very normal coat um should you need one should you leave again she wasntsure whether the words were really hanging unsaid in the air or whether he d completely missed them but really it was a completely selfish present because it seemed she d worried a lot over whether he d taken something warmer than the invisibility cloak with him last time and she didnt want to worry again it was entirely selfish and she wanted him warm bah he said now grinning widely leave it to you to pick out something useful too i d have been perfectly happy with the scarf and somehow she knew he would have but he was still smiling like that now so it didntmake a bit of difference sirius being the uncompromising well whatever he was immediately swung the scarf over and around his neck even though the room was a perfectly good temperature indeed he said mockingly solemn red and gold are still my colors yes hermione thought suddenly yes they are and i really wish that everyone else could know it too but that was something even she couldntdo regardless of which holiday it was well he said standing up i think this present deserves a little more than some worn out jewelry hermione immediately grew suspicious so i ll give you your coming of age lesson his grin grew even wider how to survive your first hangover was that a proud expression on his face rule one he said taking the space between them with two quick steps and sweeping her legs off the floor to put her lengthwise on the couch be lazy utterly unapologetically lazy and for future reference skip class if at all possible hermione opened her mouth to protest that one but he continued without pause rule two be lazy with lots of water we can fix that one fairly quick he grabbed a glass from one of the shelves and handed it to her hermione moved for her own wand but found to her annoyance that he had whisked it away first the glass was full a moment later i could have done that she muttered feeling somehow simultaneously pampered useless and relieved actually he said that would violate rule one there a reason for it you know if the muggles wonttrust you in a car drunk imagine what it would be like to use a wand did i just hear you say something responsible hermione asked or actually wanted to ask but she d been brought up better than that and even a hangover was no excuse for being impolite rule three he said have a banana hermione wondered for a moment whether he was beginning to pull rules out of thin air for lack of any useful tips and the need to have more than two rules she ignored the thought which made her head spin a little and instead took a long drink of the water hm well i ll find one somewhere he muttered to himself scratching at his chin then rule four stay under your blanket as long as possible and share the misery with everyone else in the room hermione frowned firstly isntthat two rules and secondly if i stupid enough to get myself drunk i am most certainly not bothering the rest of my poor dorm mates with it sirius shrugged that one might not have been a rule actually it was a personal preference probably hermione wanted to say something acidic but it got lost in her head as a very warm very fluffy blanket hit her in the face oh all right she allowed not really feeling an ounce of willingness to move anyway ugh i going to need a shower very badly look on the bright side sirius told her cheerfully as he gathered up the invisibility cloak again at least you smell like punch and not like firewhisky hermione blinked losing the last bit of it as she unfurled the blanket a bit and settled into it actually she was beginning to very much like rule number one not that she would ever admit anything of the sort hm she muttered drifting a bit then did he just leave to get a banana indeed it seemed he had shattered moments by rurouni star yeah school role playing no more life i highly recommend the latter and officially despise the former but you all knew that already and in my defense role playing has given me lots and lots of writing practice so here we go turning point chapter 22 event horizon there is a point at which everything becomes simple and there is no longer any question of choice because all you have staked will be lost if you look back life point of no return dag hammarskjold she stares out of her glass prison watching and waiting oh so patiently as she is buried again and it turns again with memory i hate you i hate you i hate you why wontyou look at me right outside they re both just outside and her fingers smear on the glass leaving fingerprints that only fade moments later you donthave to be alone i dont want you to be begging half in this place half in that one and another half one that shouldntexist in the past that never was except in memory memory it all to do with memories she almost imagines he looks up at her voice from the tear stained letter but time and memories are funny things and there no way he can possibly hear her in there because because hermione woke up again without ever realizing she d fallen asleep the room had been darkened the fire dimmed to almost nothing but her eyes were well adjusted to the dark by the time she opened them shadows were playing on the walls in the dim silence and there was a banana on the table by the couch she stared at it for a moment thoroughly perplexed in that state between waking and dreaming and began to laugh sirius obviously wasntin the room or he would have asked her if she d gone crazy in her sleep this was entirely possible because she would wake up these days with the sneaking suspicion that something had changed in her in her sleep or she had remembered something or things had been clearer like glass but everything would be gone by the time she woke it was very possible she was going insane she had wondered whether she was before of course but the question was really could you go insane without remembering it hermione shook her head pressing her palms to her forehead she was thirsty this could wait probably it really had to she picked up the banana and peeled it slowly it was surprisingly good she hadnteaten something just to eat it in so long rushing back and forth to classes she supposed all bananas at the table were this good and she just hadntever taken the time to taste them time her fingers were worrying at the ring again time is flexible her reading had told her it can stretch sometimes to accommodate but it of an elastic nature always it snaps back and then there the smack on the hand the recoil on the person who tried to pull the rubber band too far this was a sensible theory wasntit there were some things things she could swear had gone differently if she listened to those voices which could be insane but she had to assume she wasn t because that just how you stay functional she took a drink of water staring at the fire this theory was one of many it was all theoretical of course being a theory but if it was true when will it all snap back and what does that entail and will it just undo everything what if it kills me it wasnta popular theory it had been hard to find in one of those periodical magazine issues but she had to believe the other her had found it had she discredited it somehow or was there a way out a loophole she had to find or worse yet had she not had the time to thoroughly research had she missed it too many possibilities and her head still hurt footsteps sounded behind her quiet padding on the stone she knew it was sirius in that strange way people sometimes do when someone familiar enters the room of course that could have merely been because he was the only other likely person to come in here feeling better he asked careful to keep his voice soft yes the banana helped probably she smiled down at her hands a little weakly the glint of silver on her thumb no she said suddenly the smile dropping i not really feeling better actually i feel confused i dont know what going on anymore from moment to moment a pause he d probably not expected her to tell the truth no one ever expects that anyone will tell the truth when asked how are you or how was your day or are you feeling better and since she d been keeping everything from him it only seemed appropriate he would expect another fine i fine and then his fingers were in her hair threading through it from behind warm and she wanted hermione leaned back into them closing her eyes the pounding inside her head was lessening and growing at the same time anything i can do this was good very good too good there was a little voice in her head what was left of the normal sensible bookworm hermione who was not insane and it was calmly telling her that this was getting dangerous why wasntshe concerned already she liked this too much and it was just his fingers in her hair he probably had no idea what she was thinking of right now what am i thinking of it was another of those very confusing thoughts she d been having lately usually she could pick apart her own mind and her inclinations and say very definitively this is what i want and why possible courses of action would follow with given consequences and risk factors very nice perfect numbers she d pick one very logically the life of hermione granger would follow but her heart was beating a little fast and her breath wanted to speed up and she couldntfind the reasoning behind it this time his fingers disengaged and as they did she threw the entire situation out of her head with a mental cry of distress it could wait for some other time sometime here take this he d come around the side of the couch there was a little vial of golden liquid in his hand hermione looked at it for a moment hesitating he d given her this exact potion before probably she d never found out exactly what it was and she prided herself on good knowledge of everything academic at least a year ahead of the school curriculum maybe more you can drink it later at dinner he shrugged pressing it into her hand it was warm against her skin it ll probably work better with some food she blinked at him trying to straighten out her thoughts his hand had brushed hers for a moment and no you wontthink about that not now thank you he smiled one half of his mouth lifting a little well what would you do without me to force you to take care of yourself oh her face was flushing keel over dead she offered hesitantly he chuckled eyes watching her there was that darkness in them again though and she decided that maybe her choice of words hadntbeen perfect all things considered go ahead and get some more sleep sirius said one hand coming up to rub at his forehead he looked very tired she noted suddenly maybe he hadntbeen sleeping it would be just like her not to notice that in the middle of everything else all right she managed no clear that tremor out of your voice you too i mean at some point rest in peace articulation he smiled at her again one hand in his pocket and the strangest thought floated to the top of her mind he here right here i could touch him hermione fingers moved in her lap but she withheld the impulse for some mysterious reason known only to the little irrational moral voice in her head instead she set the potion very carefully down by the couch and leaned her head back into the pillow turning on her side beneath the blankets it all right hermione i promise you everything will be all right even if it not at some point halfway between sleep and something else there were fingers in her hair again 000000 when she woke up again after what seemed only a very short time he was gone she panicked for a moment her mind finally working almost properly it told her she should have been thinking about things like what time is it and did i miss dinner and did anyone notice hermione slipped out from underneath the warm covers reluctantly calming herself down he would have woken her up before it got to that point hopefully with a belated look at her clothes her school robes sans a sock and a sweater still she picked her wand up from the table and tried to make herself at least presentable by the time she d smoothed out the wrinkles pulled off the makeup and coaxed most of sleakeasy special formula from her hair she was feeling more than a little more like hermione again right library because that was what hermione would do she smiled to herself ignoring the little nagging un hermioneish thoughts about staying just a little bit longer the time she discovered on her way was a lot less late than it seemed she had suspicions about this but finding sirius to ask him about them was unappealing or too appealing as it were there wasnta difference in this case madam pince looked up as she entered then looked down again hermione granger and the library it was well known were having a sordid love affair no surprise there hermione blinked frowning had she really had that thought she d been hanging around boys for far too long no that wouldnthappen again she didnthave her pass to the restricted section with her but pince had seen it at least ten times by now already the thing was going to be worn to illegibility soon her fingers drew along the spines of the books as she went without quite touching them there were books in here that were dangerous enough without being opened after all the fingers stopped on a certain title a ragged titleless green monstrosity she d been working through for a while you werentallowed to take restricted books out naturally and the language in this one was particularly difficult though she d begun to pick it up more quickly a sudden shiver went through her for no particular reason she could decipher another of those unmeasurable things that came from nowhere she stepped back eyes on the book and dinner was sounding good suddenly she turned around especially aware of the faint heat against her heart a clink of glass as the timeturner brushed against the golden potion madam pince did not look up at all as she left 000000 things were progressing today in a very strange manner she wasntsure why time was acting strangely it had to be time her perceptions couldntbe that off could they for example she could swear sleeping had felt like hours compressed into minutes and now eating at the dinner table with harry and ron it felt like minutes drawn over hours something in her was protesting this obvious illogicality time did not speed up or slow down on its own timeturners did that hermione she looked up at the voice harry yes harry playing with her food with the tip of her fork nothing he shook his head going back to his own plate there was a strange distillation in the air she couldntbe the only one feeling it could she this pressure in her head she frowned and got to her feet feeling the heat and pressure of the timeturner and the potion against her chest i think i ll go back early i feeling strange ron nodded but said nothing the roll in his mouth rather hampered his ability to speak hermione stopped outside the doors of the great hall pulling the potion and uncorking it the last time it had cleared her head made things suddenly clearer and less tired maybe it would help with this sudden feeling of uneasiness footsteps then miss granger she blinked the vial slipping a hurried rush for it managed to keep it from crashing to the floor but her heart was suddenly beating a mile a minute and the world was speeding up again mcgonagall in front of her a thoroughly shocked expression on her face that cannot be what i think it is hermione blinked at her feeling her heart thudding sickeningly in her chest what what do you think it is she managed leaning against the wall thud thud thud mcgonagall fingers pried the vial from hers her mouth was set in a deep scowl but hermione could tell she was already trying to rationalize whatever this was because there were some things hermione granger simply did not do and this was apparently one of them this potion she said slowly looking down at it is by all appearances a minor dark arts formula it requires blood miss granger the thudding of her heart stopped her eyes widened he couldnt he wouldntpossibly i have a very good eye for it mcgonagall said grimly i have seen it in use before now i cannot believe you would make something like this yourself miss granger who gave it to you hermione swallowed this was bad he d put her in a terribly tight position here why hadnthe warned her to keep it hidden and she wouldntbelieve it was what it seemed please professor i i canttell you but i know he wouldntdo something immoral on my account would has i cantthink this would be what it seems mcgonagall watched her with hawk like eyes weighing i can only think of one person close enough to you with the knowledge of how to brew something like this it is possible i suppose that it was done while he was in bulgaria where it is not on the edge of legality krum hermione held her mouth shut she wanted to say no he didntdo this but who else was there her insides clenched nervous she couldntlet him get in trouble if it came down to it she would have to claim responsibility for it herself in which case perhaps i shall have to a breath in time frozen hermione felt her heart stop again but this time it was strange real more footsteps and the unmistakable swish of a long robe time started up again and mcgonagall eyes narrowed behind her glasses she thrust the potion at hermione with the clear message of hide that dratted thing take that but you will not i make myself clear you will not accept another no matter how tired you get i will take the timeturner from you myself before that happens hermione stared at her quailing inwardly as she disappeared down the hall snape footsteps ironically turned at another corner and disappeared only two days ago perhaps she would have gone searching for answers demanded the truth today she drank the entire potion and waited to feel better 000000 there fingers on a worn green spine there a better word for it two actually but only if you re a muggleborn a mudblood you would know and he was looking up at her and he was looking at her watching her unmistakable impossible why did you do this to me yelled scattered glass and sand pouring everywhere hermione stumbled from her bed clutching at her head she was hermione she was very hermione she needed to go to the library now no one stopped her as she pushed out of the dorm room but she wasntsure whether this was them asleep or them not there because she really wasntsure what time it was at all anymore the timeturner hot against her chest and energy stolen not hers pumping through her body blood there was no pince behind the desk it was probably night probably or lunch it could be lunch hermione felt herself gasping the burning glass of the timeturner against her fingers her head felt pressurized and expanded all at once what going on she whimpered the other hand leaning her on the shelf had she put it there her breath wasntcoming right the world was spinning but she was somehow certain it wasntjust her it was the world it was spinning her knees hit something as her fingers scrabbled blindly for the book tell me something she begged it tell me what i doing the words revealed themselves so easily so suddenly that she felt her head pound harder this was crazy in every sense of the word god god there were things flashing on the inside of her eyelids every time she blinked black hair eleven sitting alone in his red and gold colors between the lines she read incredulous screams his winces his eyes were young and she wanted to do something runes letters they were the same for some reason letters torn to little tiny pieces and thrown into the fire his breaths ragged and this she read eyes wide this is the final limit the threshold from which things unravel glint silver on his sixteen year old finger most honored house of black the terminal point from which no human can escape as events begin to bend toujours pur two words only she would know this only she could compare it the rubber band snapping back and like a black hole there was that impossible speed beyond light that no one could achieve to escape look up look up look up he does he looks straight at her for just a moment and it not her imagination event horizon we re going to break it hold on tight shattered moments by rurouni star now obviously that last chapter is going to have left a whole lot of questions this is the beginning of the resolution of those questions from here on out you re going to understand a little more every chapter this one is a transition and it worth a warning this story is about to get a whole lot darker this chapter in particular will also show just what the hell was going through sirius head through a few of those things last but not least this update can be considered an extension of the last if you like it may be a while before i get out another chapter but this is short for stylistic reasons and not because i plan to make them all like this donahermurphy of course i would tell you if you were on the wrong track would i lie ah would i abridge the truth actually no dontanswer that for what it worth you re always way too perceptive on most things riptiderobin woe i think i missed that email my spam filter is a little too efficient sometimes jewelsong the last chapter was part resolution of foreshadowing and part an attempt to explain some things very vaguely it ll make more sense as we go on from here everyone else who reviewed i love you really i read every single one i promise chapter 23 zero hour god abhors a naked singularity stephen hawking at the end of the dark there was a moment of perfect clarity it came of frozen time she knew or time so slow as to be negligible the rubber band was reaching its limit and here she was and there she was and there she was and sand all over the place glittering gold like the timeturner and the potion coursing through her veins somewhere out in reality somewhere else she thought drawing a toe through the sand there was an endless sky overhead in yellow gold tinges that reflected infinitely into nothing welcome to the crossroad said her voice she hadntspoken hermione looked up hair long and frazzled and tangled in her eyes and saw a possibility 000000 sirius black was a naturally suspicious person he was almost obliged to be after the countless betrayals secrets cover ups and attempts to incarcerate he d been through but this went beyond paranoia or gut feelings or intuition there was something very very wrong and it all had to do with hermione for god sake he wasnt stupid there were strange things going on even taking magic into account she was she would she d be there one minute then gone the next not physically but there was a definite difference between how the hell could you explain it he almost felt sometimes that there was more than one of her each equally hermione and that one would be there then another then some screwed up mixture of both and the things she murmured in her sleep things about harry about him george weasley all in past tense really noticing that her dot on the map had started to flicker frenetically in and out of existence that had just been extraneous at the point he discovered it but no less troubling not at all so when she was laying there while he was watching feeling that strange overwhelming fear and helplessness sorrysorrysorry very sorry sirius whimpered in her sleep that that had been her twisting strangely beneath the blanket looking like that separate hermione spliced with hermione and maybe neither actually knew what the hell she was saying rutilus vita the potion was called golden life deceptively pleasant sounding almost mythical his family had taught him only one way to make it with blood and life and someone else vitality the order of the phoenix had taken that recipe and twisted it desperately the members in inaction would give of themselves make the potion on their own and supply their energy to the people who needed it more it was by no means a pleasant process or for that matter an entirely safe one he d given more than he should ve this time probably in the revised toned down version the order had used you only used up almost all your stored energy equivalent to a series of very late nights but blacks never did anything half assed this one had probably actually taken some time off his life he decided to attribute this to his typical lack of self preservation instinct instead of the rather more frightening alternative it was a very hard thing to lie to himself about when he was sitting there watching her dream twisted things in her sleep not five minutes after healing the neat puncture in his arm she woke up looking at him confusedly like he shouldnthave been there or perhaps like she shouldnt have been it came together for him all at once the thing he had been dreading the thought behind his madness that had been carefully suppressed and halfway ignored for the sake of dumbledore and secrets and harry hermione granger was being broken apart in front of him systematically inevitably and he had the most terrible urge to do something anything but most of all he just wanted to touch her and make sure she was there i dontknow what going on anymore she d admitted that carefully controlled look of panic in her eyes hermione always did everything in a controlled manner even panicking moment to moment to moment it echoed in his head almost ominously and before he could stop himself he was dragging his fingers through her hair and reassuring them both that she was still there and still her in some way he realized vaguely as he did so that he d always wanted to do this in some dark corner of his mind just to see what it was like it was strange to think that he might have spent some part of his brain wondering whether her hair would be soft or coarse or tangled as it looked at some time probably it was one of those cold nights in a cave beneath an invisibility cloak as it turned out it was just right for his fingers to slip through and she leaned back into it eyes closed and he could almost taste the way she was trying to collect on his tongue picking up bits and pieces of herself and holding them up for examination is this one me i dontknow i canttell anymore that scared him more so he ignored his own little panicking voice in the back of his head what the hell are you doing you re you re really crazy and he stayed and kept sliding his fingers through her hair because he really couldntdo anything else at all she wasntdying per se but she might as well have been she was slowly disappearing and he was watching it it was wrong wrong in that deep gut wrenching disgusting way his family had been the house the elf the heads on the walls and in that same line of disturbing thoughts had come another even for harry this is wrong he justified it to himself later by thinking that harry wouldnthave wanted it this way and as the dot named hermione granger flickered in front of him he looked down at the timeturner and had the most violent thoughts since since peter he still had to catch peter but he half pitied peter even now whereas this thing this incarnation of inevitable time she didnthave he loathed with a palpable hatred it inspired lead weights in his stomach and knots in his throat he wanted to shatter it to pieces again and again but who knew what that would do to her it was an innocent glittering gold wound about her neck as innocent as the potion as innocent as its name but it was even more insidious and he knew somehow that it had a hold on her he could almost see the hand around her heart faceless with no personality or person behind it no conscience or even malicious intent it just was and it did dumbledore was going to stop this he would he couldntsidestep this anymore not with protests for the greater good or she wants to sirius not even for harry he left her to her delirious murmurings the echoes of her apologies in his mind 000000 madam pince did not look up as hermione granger exited the library she didnthave any restricted books with her on her way out and that was really all she needed to know who are you harry was in the commonroom playing chess with himself when the footsteps entered he looked up suddenly feeling that he should it wasntwho he thought it would be i dontknow i sure anymore you keep confusing me you should be working on your egg harry hermione smiled but her eyes were dull shattered moments by rurouni star for those who haventhappened to glance at the theories of quantum physics and such here the low down as i understand it anyone able to correct me you may do so edit aha cookies to aranel abeille for catching that mistake right off the bat i was thinking volume and writing mass i might still be wrong about that the speed of light is the fastest possible speed so far as we know this is because photons have no mass or so little mass as to be the things with the least mass in the universe einstein therefore theorized that nothing could exceed the speed of light humans especially this is relevant when applied to a black hole the reason a black hole is black is because its density is so incredible that its gravity pulls light into it and doesntallow it to escape even the speed of light is insufficient to make it past its gravitational field once it is caught inside this catching point where you cantescape again is the black hole event horizon since the speed of light is the fastest speed it follows that absolutely nothing can escape a black hole once it hit the event horizon scientists believe that the basic laws of physics break down inside a black hole because of this unique state of incredible gravity it believed that time slows to the point of nearly stopping inside this phenomenon is generally called a singularity a point of infinite density and infinite mass the idea cantbe proven however because no emissions escape the black hole there nothing to measure to prove it whereas going inside the event horizon would not only be suicide it would also stop time for you and distort perception stephen hawking is famous for describing this god abhors a naked singularity he said a black hole is unforgiving by nature and unmeasurable it therefore clothes the singularity the theory if it entirely correct can never be proven what does this have to do with time travel you ask it been said that if you exceeded the speed of light you could move back in time if the theory is correct then both are totally impossible to be fair this theory been argued about a lot and the quote because of agitation has since been changed to nature abhors a naked singularity but this is the theory i using for this particular story especially because i have not majored in physics now that i ve completely destroyed your brain with something you d probably rather never have heard of angst for your reading pleasure you ll notice this one is entirely in sirius pov i may continue in this fashion because of the way the rest of this is formatted and when i say i may not update for a while i mean it this time damnit enjoy chapter 24 house of honor the whole problem with the world is that fools and fanatics are always so certain of themselves but wiser people so full of doubts bertrand russell it was a familiar hermione another one one that had been through hell and azkaban and things that she had begun to suspect might be even worse she was older her hair was trimmed down shoulder length her face was tired without being lined she was wearing a plain button down white shirt and black slacks barefoot in the sand who are you she asked it was more than a single question it was complicated there would be a long answer but she had the feeling of eternity here and time for once to listen the other her was silent for a moment watching i dontknow i sure anymore you keep confusing me hermione straightened slowly looking back into eyes that were hers and exactly the same except unmistakably different dark they had that void that way of taking in light and not letting it out again you ve been here the whole time she asked feeling young and worthless or worth less in her shirt and skirt and tie less experienced what could she possibly tell this woman that she didntalready know she was her i think so the other hermione said hands in her pockets toes digging into the sand pale white against its startling glimmering shades a million tiny stars on a beach stretched out into eternity into that impossible horizon since time began anyway and when 000000 how do you argue with a person when they agree with everything you say how can you get any satisfaction out of yelling when they wontyell back he d looked at him old with eyes no longer twinkling for a moment dumbledore had looked dead with a still beating heart do what you feel is right then and that the weight the responsibility his decision now the world harry hermione dumbledore himself countless people all in his hands it was the only way out for dumbledore he hated him for making him understand he didntwant to understand he wanted to live normally and make the choices that seemed right and hate people for making the wrong decisions where everything seemed simple where had the simple things gone they d never been there they d all been in his mind he d been the person making things simple tearing them down to meaningless bits of what they really were and nodding as it all made sense but life wasntsupposed to make sense he found only to stupid gryffindors with moral pretensions dumbledore had to have been a slytherin he leaned his forehead against the cool stone wall and tried and tried and tried to find the answer there d always been one before staring him in the face do this do that everything will turn out if your intentions are good where is it now what do i do what do i do was this how dumbledore felt every day his fingers clenched against the stone wall scrabbling for purchase they caught in the lines of mortar tensing the map on the table was open he looked at it with tight eyes daring it to show him again to strengthen his resolve in the wrong course of action flick flick flick hermione granger leapt in and out of time as she sat in the library she was reading she was dying she was going to die she was going to disappear forever what is she trying to do what is she doing his breath stopped on the sudden thought that welled up inside she disappearing will i forget her no no no he sat down in the couch fingers twisting in his hair forgetting her was impossible he couldnt possibly forget her he d given her bits of himself you couldntforget that red and gold at the corner of his eyes he looked over staring still my colors were they he d changed before azkaban and james and lily god james and lily they were dead he would have grabbed her and ordered her to get rid of it somehow anyhow now he understood all the reasonings and consequences no not all but some he was turning black his fingers twitched the weight of that was gone he d given it away to her on her she was wearing his terrible history on her finger slowly before he could realize he slid to his knees leaning his forehead against the wall james what do i do laughter he d brush his fingers through his own hair and laugh and shake his head because sirius was smart but he was nothing nothing compared to that ineffable natural charisma james always knew everything now padfoot mate you just need to leave things to me dogs are meant to be led they do not lead they follow in the steps of someone else path they need a best friend too i dontknow what to do it echoed in the room everything was exactly the opposite of how it should have been 000000 he found her sitting in the commonroom alone at three am her legs were pulled up into the armchair by the fire chin tucked against her knees i cantsleep she said without needing to look at him there was a peculiar note in the tone she hadntturned her head at all her eyes were still staring into the fire sirius moved around the chair pulling off the invisibility cloak and damn the consequences and and there she was and there she was put back together again in all the wrong ways hermione he didntsay her name much he realized in that moment because it was somewhat awkward on his tongue it didntroll off quite like it should have she looked up at him he was blocking the fire it might have been his shadow no it wasn t but her eyes seemed darker the timeturner glittered against her fingers against a silver ring still on her thumb he stared at it for a moment and decided that this was it he was going to do the entirely wrong thing you need to get rid of it he said hermione smiled weakly it a little late sirius she never used his name either he was stepping forward before he knew what he was doing his hands on either arm of the chair leaning tired looking at the azkaban in her eyes and why why did she have to look like that if there were just one thing he would ever have wished for he would have wanted to keep her from that it was worse than death she was looking at one of his hands now with an odd light in her eyes it wasntlight actually it was more darkness but a different kind her fingers touched his hand just barely she looked almost surprised that her hand didntgo through him entirely a strange sound escaped her throat high and vaguely muffled her breath drew in and in a sudden unexpected turn of events she burst into tears there was an awkward moment of course during which time he found he could only look down at her in her little curled up ball shaking these were not normal tears they were the last gasping cries of a little girl finding she was no longer that someone who lost their entire world all at once irrevocably he d cried these alone sitting alone in a dark damp stone cold room screaming into the dark his knees gave way almost expectedly and his hands moved to take her shoulders his fingers pale against her shirt which was quite white itself she didntmove toward him she didnteven try to hide in her own arms her fingers were twisting in the chain of the timeturner the ring that evil thing on her finger clinking faintly against it he d thought a lot of giving to her at the time he wanted to melt it into nothing now his hands stayed on her shoulders it was a useless helpless gesture against the total devastation on her face he didnteven dare to ask what had happened and finally words were wrenched from her god god god god did not listen to these kinds of wordless prayers he knew the word escaped her over and over god was stacked upon himself a pile of nothing all to no avail he wasntsure how long it went his hands stayed clenched on her shoulders and she continued unabated she wouldntfall asleep to die the little death that sometimes helped he d already taken away that perfect respite cruelly she was shaking with his own energy her eyes stared down at something he couldnt see he would later learn that it was a world apart from this one one inside the timeturner with sand and storms and a short haired woman staring back into her soul with dark eyes she wasntflickering anymore she was perfectly perfectly solid but he had the feeling she wished she d disappeared forever instead when he woke up it was to a hand on his shoulder he d lost consciousness exhausted and drained sometime in between hermione was looking down at him with a face that was perfectly composed but for the raw tracts down her cheeks and the inescapable shade in the place behind her eyes i sorry she said looking down at him now it was a finished apology finally the one from her dreams what did you do he asked her without managing to raise himself from where his chin had fallen to his arms in her chair his limbs refused to move made of lead was truly an appropriate way to say it this time she didntsay anything but her fingers twisted at the silver ring on her finger as though she knew most honored house of black most honored the poison in his soul it had been there forever before james and lily and azkaban slowly ever so slowly it had taken him over insidious in its whispers he wanted to be a black he wanted to be loved he d regretted in the dark of night that he had ever listened to the voice of the lion before the tattered old hat and now after all the consequences of that single stupid action he was there and he wanted back hermione attempted a smile at him shakily and he wondered to himself what time of morning it was if the sun had risen yet it would be the dawn of the first day of this strange reversal in his life because suddenly he was following again he could be called a dog bone weary stranded at her feet you re practically family anyway you know he was too tired to cry much much much too tired dontever let me cut my hair she said inexplicably but somehow he found the energy yet to nod 000000 was that the dark eyes looked back for a moment then they turned up to the endless sky whenever it began i not certain it could have been when i talked to him in azkaban or maybe when you put on the timeturner maybe when the timeturner was created there all kinds of possible starting points maybe all of them are right in some way or another hermione knelt down in the sand to run it through her fingers as she thought it sifted familiar as though through an hourglass so this is the timeturner she asked or 000000 and somewhere before the waking hours he was back in the little room nearly falling from the couch the scarf was pressed against his face somewhere in there twined around his neck these are my colors he was a betrayer but he was the good kind the kind on the side that called it bravery when they knew when they knew about it she knew 000000 is it my mind a shrug some combination of both i didnthave the chance to clear up that particular question before i started this whole mess hermione knees shifted away the sand as they dug into it her toes curled under her one hand leaning to the side harry died she asked there would be a quiver in her voice normally but in this timeless space it was a simple question yes said the shadowed eyes and fred and george sirius a pause it wasntthat they died really it was all in the way sirius died sirius died this struck her strangely preemptively there was the feeling of a hammer just about to hit her funny bone because when she got out of here if if she did she was going to cry you re not going to like me much after this or yourself i suppose actually there a lot of people you re not going to like or we won t or a shake of the head it doesntmatter i ll hit the highlights shall i a quiet nod the sand was warm against her skin 000000 and time passed it went for once as far as he could tell in a perfectly straight line the timeturner did not malfunction once it was a clockwork mechanism made of gold and sand and it took her where she told it to she never flickered ever again but then she didnt happen to visit him again either he heard later about hagrid about the newspaper article and the way harry hadntreally been working on his egg until she said something to him in a low voice the entire time was spent researching researching anything and everything dumbledore could give him that was what he was good for he had been a natural genius in his time and he had knowledge no one else did like the potion that had been his and just before the second task he was given the strangest most blatant set of texts yet they were on time travel as he halfway expected any of them that treated the subject with any kind of seriousness were very very dark there were foreboding warnings about it it could be done they said it had been done but there were prices and it didntalways work the way you wanted it to none of them could say quite how on the morning of the second task he was still awake from the night before staring into the pages of a ragged green tome without a title he didntunderstand it there were allusions this was obvious to him he could tell they were allusions to something but he didnt have the slightest clue what and no amount of searching through piles and piles of vaguely related books could turn up anything speed of light relativity singularity escape velocities and infinite density in a point of no volume event horizon who was the author he tried to discover this to perhaps begin at their background and find things from there there was no such luck the author was imaginary only a cardboard stand for the ideas themselves because ideas last forever once set to pages but a name can die away like that there was no name none at all perhaps that was not by accident he left the book to itself to slip away to watch the task the person for whom they d done it all was going to be at risk for a thousand galleons and a trophy it seemed a terribly ironic thing now shattered moments by rurouni star the reviews last time made me unbearably happy i so glad to know i not losing my audience to dear lord stop with the sci fi shit just so you all know the background of the story had to develop over time i had a vague idea of the theory involved and how it would work but things just recently fell entirely into place with the way time got screwed around with so no i not a genius just spent a lot of time pondering things in classes where i should have been paying attention so a lot of you asked more of those unanswerable questions there was only really one person i could respond to which i ll do now irene you re entirely right on almost all counts after all the brain killing stuff involved with figuring out this plot i decided to be a bad person and use one of those fanfiction assumptions where i convince myself you guys have already gotten close enough to harry in the real series that i can ignore him now later i convinced myself that it was an amazing unconscious theme i had going where everyone kept doing things for harry but never took the time to talk to harry as for cedric i decided to be a really bad person and let you all assume that harry is doing his own things getting sympathetic toward him etc harry telling him about the dragons and cedric reciprocating with the egg for example happened offscreen and last but not least i had already written this entire sequence with fred and george before you reviewed we now have two psychic reviewers congrats so remember how i said george would play a bigbigbig part yeah you ll get some hint of that very soon some of you coughdonahermurphycough might even be psychic enough to figure out the entire plotline from it despite my crypticness chapter 25 situational avoidance the past is what you remember imagine you remember convince yourself you remember or pretend you remember harold pinter the other her paused to recollect herself the metaphysics of this idea would have stymied hermione under any other circumstances so sirius died him first then fred in due time by stupid stupid accident he went out with a good bit of a fight and george was he was devastated of course i had to tell him you know i was there when he woke up and i got to see it all all come down fingers tracing in the sand it not nice watching another person world shatter especially when you re the one holding the hammer is this really me she thought this is me it is i like this i loved him eyes watching blankly past tense i loved him until he went and fucked me up everything he fucked everything up not just me but it me that i most angry about her palms pressed against the sand in front of her there was a soft wind blowing across the glittering dunes it made her shirt billow like the sail of a ship 000000 fred was puzzled no puzzled really wasnt the best word aghast probably yes aghast he d once heard it from his mother it was an amusing word one he d immediately taken to heart she d gotten thoroughly sick of him saying it every chance he got at seven years old and of course george because george and he shared everything except lately he was confused and aghast george had seemed a little different before but he d attributed it to his obvious crush on hermione now he was beginning to wonder whether he hadn t for once been actually keeping something from him his record by the way was still at two months he d hidden one of fred shoes when they were six because it wasntat all usual for hermione to look at george that way with those tight little lines at her mouth fred had asked him later if he d done something stupid to make her mad at him like a prank because the one they d played on her in her third year had had her giving them and their brother the silent treatment for a week george had only looked at him helplessly from across the dark room and rolled over to go to sleep then she was avoiding them both then he caught just yesterday there was a way she looked at him too it took him a few times of watching for it to decipher it before the word was inscrutable now it was aghast no no aghast and sad there maybe she d been mistaking him for george at the time maybe she wanted to apologize for something or other fred decided as he pulled on his gloves that he was thinking much too much about this stupid situation it was clear his brother was being a ninny it was almost as clear that hermione was being uncharacteristically stupid or well socially stupid he supposed which wasntquite so uncharacteristic it was down to him to fix things up again always he heaved a huge melodramatic sigh for the benefit of the empty room then tugged his hat down further before stepping out of the dorm room fred grin right on cue he d known he d be there and that he d say that yes george his twin stepped out toward the bottom of the staircase and the grin faded fred could instantly tell george moods it didntnecessarily have to be a twin thing it was also a i ve spent sixteen years with this person and their mouth twitches at the corner when they re really worried and trying not to show it thing have you seen hermione fred sighed and resisted the urge to roll his eyes theatrically no george i haventseen hermione i haventbeen outside the room yet remember george shifted uneasily on his feet rocking back onto his heels it only harry going to be at the task so she wouldntmiss it for anything i bet and she not with the group and we re about to leave fred cocked an eyebrow asked mckitty yet george nodded quickly in that way of i ve spent sixteen years with this person and anything involving hermione has used this nod that means he done everything he can possibly think of plus some things he didn t she said not to worry about her but you know she wouldntmiss this fred he was quickly getting to an alarming stage of openly worried which was either very serious or just george way of having an overprotective crush as he mused on this however george turned around ostensibly to search the empty common room again on the off chance that hermione was hiding under the chair cushion lay off it i sure she fine fred waved a hand dismissingly maybe she went down to breakfast with harry earlier or something you know joined at the hip not lately actually but that wasntsomething to mention this was a perfectly good explanation and he wasntabout to jeopardize it yeah maybe george mood underwent a sudden about face detailed by the sudden slump of his shoulders and the way his eyes were suddenly interested in something not quite over fred shoulder and here comes the scowl no there wasntone this time damn fred decided he must have been getting rusty at the predict george game that was three times in the past month he d failed to do so accurately let get down then bet she there already george turned to go toward the portrait and passed from fred sight fred for his part wondered just for a moment whether there was something he was missing in all of this just as quickly he dismissed the thought and decided it was time to go shout vaguely encouraging things at harry hopefully there would be no dragons this time 000000 sorry a pause i getting ahead harry died after fred krum died sometime too but i wasnt looking and we all huddled up in hogwarts waiting for the other shoe to drop only a matter of time and time you get that time is everything 000000 the black dog was almost monstrously big but that didntstop the sixth year girls from cooing at it and trying to coax it over to their place in the stands with bits of trail mix it eyed them sleepily for a moment before cautiously slinking over a moment later it paused eyes flicking upward one of them sighed in disappointment as it bounded suddenly away toward some undetermined something possibly some one and somewhere near the back of the pier where harry had dived into the lake a few minutes prior the black dog disappeared without a trace 000000 you can be yourself if you want you know sirius felt her hand brush his head vaguely beneath the invisibility cloak he had to fight the canine urge to lean into it no all right i just thought i d let you know i ve been sitting in this little corner for an entire hour no one noticed me yet though the cloak is appreciated her fingers scratched at his chin idly he felt his tail thump the wood behind him it was a traitorous thing she leaned back against the wood of the stands eyes staring out over the calm water of the lake the shade that had fallen over them was still there muted by daylight her fingers stretched through his fur calmly though and there was a strange serenity to the hermione at the surface that the depths were probably screaming for like the glassy still surface of the black lake he ll do fine she said idly to him her other hand brushing at her shirt just where the timeturner would be he already has the usual flash of uneasy anger that usually accompanied the thought of her using the timeturner didntcome this time his eyes were heavy and her fingers had guided him unconsciously to her lap harry was fine he d come out fine that was invaluable hermione was warm and comforting she smelled like vanilla right now just a tiny hint of it was in her hair and on her skin but his nose was more than sensitive enough to pick it up and revel in it she only realized their position by the time his eyes were tiny slits and his limbs too leaden to move the dog in him was content in the way the human never was right now everything was right with the world when you were lying in a sweet girl lap hermione looked down at him with some surprise then at her hand which hadntstopped scratching him behind the ears despite her eyes on it something odd came into the shadow behind her eyes just before his mind collapsed 000000 and he was human when he awoke there was no warmth against his cheek as there had been before but he had the most inexplicable feeling that there had been nine for moral fiber hermione beside him shook her head and chuckled ruefully he didntmove just yet his body hadntdiscovered it was awake seven karkaroff naturally dontknow why i could expect him to change the second time around she fiddled absently with the timeturner unaware that he d awoken then in a voice so low he almost didntcatch it third third her fingers curled around the timeturner and she was there suddenly herself looking frightened and desperate and only make this stop i ll do anything but the little piece of the one he d known before was gone again submerged beneath the lake the lake could i herm ow ninny he sat up slowly feeling her stiffen a little next to him she didntsay a word though as he pushed himself up against the back of the wall and watched as viktor krum took a wet and bedraggled hermione aside she looked remarkably similar to the one next to him except for the water and there he was walking straight toward them one moment the hermione outside said graciously before detaching her arm from his and going off to one side her fingers plucked at her hair a beetle appeared pinched carefully between her forefinger and thumb it was a large one and had he still been sixteen years old he would have shuddered at it at this point he had experienced such things that the little jump inside was nothing compared his face continued to watch dispassionately the beetle legs were pumping furiously frantically there wasntanything of the normal hermione in the girl holding it the normal one would have been carefully carrying it toward a deserted spot on the wood so she could set it down to go free again she had against all odds a terrible soft spot for little things that couldnthelp themselves he knew this this hermione outside was staring down at it with a perfectly blank face as it moved she brought it up to her lips he blinked confused as she kissed it gently with that blank face before setting it down directly next to her foot it scurried away immediately its legs finally finding the purchase they needed she returned to viktor as though nothing had happened at all did you want me for something she asked looking at him with a tilted head the hermione next to him had curled into a ball her fingers twined together on top of her knees she wasnt watching any of it she was trembling very slightly it is not i do not mean to pry krum face was concerned and uncertain you donthave to then the other hermione said but sirius found he was just now realizing she was the same as the one next to him she d said these things an hour two hours three hours ago however long it was for her krum shook his head he could see him steeling himself for something you are not looking vell herm ow ninny i realize ve haff not talked very much since you haff said ve vill be friends but i haff noticed i fine the girl outside the cloak said but those shadows in her eyes no you haff the look of someone i haff known you are not fine herm ow ninny and ve are friends no his hand went to her shoulder where it squeezed gently i vill listen should you talk and this summer you vill come visit me in bulgaria no it is very pretty there and you vill see castles that sounds lovely viktor she said looking down and smiling tiredly there were her eyes were tearing maybe but it could have been her hair dripping i think you should go to egypt though go visit charlie and see the pyramids he offered ron just hasnttold you yet he blinked at this but didntretract his hand the pyramids are interestink but if you need i ll be staying with my parents though we ll probably go on a trip of our own dontworry about me i fine the words rang in his ears as the hermione next to him trembled in a way that suggested she didntwant him to know but knew he couldnt help but know krum hand left her and he sighed the offer vill be there all the time do not hesitate herm ow ninny i won t he gave her one last concerned glance before stepping away toward the ladder that led up to dry land and this ghost of a hermione watched him go expressionlessly before walking back to sit down in a place just next to his own hermione where her fingers shaking pulled a timeturner out where it flashed in momentary sunlight she was gone so quickly and hermione hermione some version of her was beside him looking perfectly composed once more he didntbelieve it for a moment she looked over at him with those eyes and he somehow knew she was pleading with him somewhere behind them to just forget it all and let her keep pretending he wasntsure what she was pretending but she wanted to keep doing it his hand which had lifted to touch her dropped again hermione smiled shakily but it steadied into a more certain one soon enough 000000 and the inevitable thought is she insane now am i she part of me isntshe 000000 harry and ron were laughing and sighing in relief and tossing stories into the air rehashing them and remaking them i cant believe i was so worried harry was saying i didnteven really sleep last night i was thinking of all the things that could go wrong nah hermione never failed us before she wouldntsend you off to your death with a weed in your mouth right hermione ron nudged her in the ribs with a grin she smiled weakly at him from her spot next to them at the dinner table of course not harry said grinning a little abashedly sorry to doubt you queen genius hermione looked like a doe in the headlights of a car no perhaps he was the only one seeing it she wanted to bolt it was in the way she held herself you can make up for it with more chocolate next christmas besides if it hadntbeen for cedric you never would have known it was mumbled out and it trailed off as she looked down at her plate hermione hadnt always been modest but that hadntsounded convincing at all she d always wanted no needed validation of her intelligence at least once in a while why would it make her uncomfortable now yeah it was good of him i guess harry frowned a little but ron patted him on the shoulder come on harry dontworry about it you ve got moral fiber nah that was just me being stupid harry flushed a little embarrassed and adjusted his glasses hermione looked up at him with eyes that might possibly be slightly damp she d long since dried off it couldnt be the lake and smiled comfortingly at him i dontthink so harry i think it was good of you people have died before in the tournament and if there was any chance of it you chose being a decent person over winning she paused slipping a strand of hair behind one ear besides you never wanted to enter this thing anyway remember harry looked back at her with a surprised expression he nodded after a moment relaxing yeah i guess you re right george watched the entire exchange from his place at the other side of the table he was staring at her unabashedly now she hadntsaid so much as a word to him for weeks and he d watched her get more and more tired and more and more stressed until things were so bad she looked like fifth year again third that had been her third year she d looked awful the little insomniac she was were they making her get enough sleep or did they even notice there werentshadows under her eyes but you could hide those though hermione never did use makeup maybe she was now and the eyes themselves never lied her eyes were very very tired if only he had that map if only he had it he could catch her if he had it corner her until she confessed what the hell was up and get her to go to bed for a few days straight stupid stupid girl he d told her she wasnt stupid after the world cup but she really was she was fred finger poked into his ribs he looked over at him jerking from his thoughts please stop mooning he said with a pained expression george scowled i not mooning and of course fred knew he wasntmooning too he just liked being difficult like that it occasionally made him feel better too yeah so what the problem she got something in her hair george turned to poke at his food with his fork frowning no her hair is fine actually it looks like a bird nest humidity and all shut up fred that was of course the last thing you d say to fred if you really wanted him to shut up and george should have known it too my god is that cheeping i hear listen george listen i am listening fred i canttune you out he stopped even pretending to eat at this leaning back into his chair with a deep frown and glancing over at hermione again she was looking down at her untouched food with that same odd expression he d been seeing lately he still couldnt quite identify it but it always made him just a little queasy and not in a good way hermione arentyou going to eat something ron needled shoving her plate toward her you re not putting yourself on one of those stupid diets are you you re a stick anyway hermione smiled at him and it was only a little strained no ron i am not dieting besides which anyone with a basic understanding of the human body knows that fad diets put your body into starvation mode and therefore do not work ron rolled his eyes but didntstop her talking george for his part was glad he hadn t this was hermione at her most hermione explaining things in detail to people who didntwant to listen it was in fact the most hermione he had seen her being all month he sat back into his chair and took a bite out of his roll moooooooooon fred quietly snickered next to him george found he couldntstop himself from laughing with him this time 000000 i wasntmuch use lost my drive all i wanted to do was hide and wait and george let me do that with him her pauses were maddening they held so many and then and if and you ll know soon but you wontlike it s hermione watched her with mounting apprehension as she pulled the past the future back together shattered moments by rurouni star first and foremost i apologize for the horrendous wait the good news remember how i said get me a full ride scholarship and we ll talk er i sort of got myself one yay for north texas also working separately on both a comic line and an original novel i hope to have the second finished and sent out by the end of summer while the first is going to be an ongoing project with my roommate who draws much better than i could ever hope to looking through a few of the questions here some i can answer as some of you will have already realized the things in italics have actually already taken place the shift of pov occurred in order that you find this all out a little at a time while hermione has already had the conversation also psh of course older hermione was in love with george because he one of the big important people i hope you all will take this in spite of its shortness at the very least i can say it a lot of answers packed into a small space chapter 26 conscience of wisdom you cantblame the innocent they are always guiltless all you can do is control them or eliminate them innocence is a kind of insanity graham green then dumbledore he such a bastard he had to find something to make me care enough again so he did posthumously even he a genius bastard fingers brushed across the sand they left whorls in their wake intricate designs that probably meant nothing 000000 geronimo the owl was very very confused it had never encountered a letter addressed quite like this before in fact despite a rather small confused brain it had the good sense to reread the address just in case to geronimo the owl the owlery tomorrow forward to hedwig the owl the owlery the day after tomorrow before evening forward to any school owl the owlery three days from now before breakfast forward to draco malfoy the slytherin breakfast table three days from now during breakfast there were a few things wrong with this the first was that it had been addressed to three owls the second was that it had been forwarded so very many times the third was that it was ultimately meant to go to a person that had once attempted to turn this particular owl into an actual ping pong ball instead of a metaphor for one geronimo shuffled about a few times staring unblinkingly at the letter after a few more minutes of this it finally took the letter in its beak and maneuvered it into the back of its small sleeping compartment at the hogwarts owlery 000000 crouch was at the second task hermione said idly her fingers toying with the timeturner again she never seemed to put it down these days and that means sirius looked up at her from over his current stack of books wherein somewhere lay the answer to his singular problem ha ha well james would have laughed nothing i thinking aloud she stretched herself out farther in front of the fire and put her head down into her arms with a sigh you re not doing homework he asked her vaguely surprised hermione shook her head without picking it up i done this seemed slightly suspicious he couldnt really remember the last time hermione had been done with her homework and exams were fast approaching sirius pulled the marauder map surreptuously from his pocket and activated it in a whisper surely enough hermione granger was both asleep in her dormitory and walking about the school despite the obvious fact that hermione granger was drowsing near his fire i thought that was cheating he said mildly clearing it again just as his alter persona began to write out a sly remark about sleeping girls hermione did glance up at him this time but only to shrug so is knowing the tasks before they happen that doesntseem to faze any of the champions cheating has sort of lost its meaning to me at this point he d have been vaguely proud of her if the thought of hermione granger not caring about cheating hadntbeen so disturbing in the meantime i trying to put things together could you give me a few moments she asked him politely setting her head back into the crook of her arms sirius looked her over once curiously but said nothing more he looked back down at the book it said nothing in many more words than that a sigh he shut it for the time being and leaned back letting his eyes close whatever he was supposed to be finding out wasntblaring out at him from the page he let his eyes drift instead tired of reading words and more words and this inevitably led to the glimmer of firelight on hermione hair he should ve been a bird animagus considering the way he was attracted to shiny things her chestnut hair looked gold in the firelight spread out like fire over her back her arms the pillow she leaned on it hid her very well so that he couldnttell just what expression her face was contorted into frustrated puzzlement perhaps curiosity the slight downward tug her mouth got when she was thinking very hard i need to get a new hobby obviously i ve been hermione watching too much he wrenched his gaze from the curve of her back toward the book that lay on the table maybe if he went through it again it must be her voice said suddenly and she looked up from the pillow yes there was that slight frown it must be it crouch they re using him carefully they re keeping watch or perhaps they just replaced him sirius jerked his eyes back toward hers blinking in shock how the hell did you come up with that he demanded she smiled uneasily and he saw the darkness flickering in her eyes like fire 000000 he left that pensieve with instructions and memories and memories they re just another measurement of time there were all kinds in there but mostly his i watched them all i couldntstop once i began her face was a mask of careful blankness once again 000000 he d missed her again by seconds there was no describing the frustration involved he was absolutely certain this time that she d gone around the corner into a dead end but of course she wouldntbe there when he trailed after her by a split moment that would be too easy and make too much sense maybe it a secret passage george thought it would have to be a fast one though is she using the invisibility cloak no that was stolen he ran his fingers through his hair with a slight frown turning the problem over in his head she was clearly just not there the logical progression was that she was now somewhere else because you couldntjust be nowhere apparition was impossible on hogwarts grounds therefore she had to be somewhere connected to this dead end it has to be a secret passage somewhere around here his eyes glanced around for differences anything that might mark a certain location he even checked the ceiling on the odds that there was something up there a few frustrated charms later and he had to give up that particular supposition hermione had been but was no longer she hadntmoved from this position but she had clearly gone somewhere else the problem he would later determine was that he was thinking in only three dimensions 000000 when the door opened ejecting a grim looking fifteen year old fifteen was she sixteen by now sirius did his best to look as though he hadntbeen trying to listen in like a child maybe he succeeded to an extent or maybe she was just preoccupied hermione face was very pale when she passed but he could tell the slight difference there she wasntsick or tired though both were possible in any case the way her lips were pressed together and her fingers had curled into trembling fists indicated she was quietly enraged could i talk with you for a moment mr black sirius glanced into the office where dumbledore still sat behind his desk the immediate instinct was to decline and go after her but there had been a quiet undertone to the headmaster voice that made the phrase less a request than an imperative he entered reluctantly closing the door behind him but he didntsit down this might be concluded quickly in which case he could try to fulfill both impulses we re now aware that crouch senior is a threat dumbledore informed him there was no twinkle in his eyes sirius was in fact very much aware of the opposite the usually bright blue color seemed to have dulled from some exhaustion or other crouch junior could hardly be a threat sirius told him seeing as he dead instead of taking this as a macabre joke dumbledore merely sighed very heavily and looked up at him again yes let us talk about that rather disputable fact as it turns out one crouch may be playing the other the first thing to cross sirius mind was not simple incredulity it was instead hermione knew how did hermione know third time dontthink on it too hard dumbledore told him i ve something to ask if the triwizard cup becomes a portkey that leads directly to what remains of voldemort if it will only be that way during the third task if the cup allows no one but a champion to touch it once set how do we use that no he thought suddenly he wontdo that i absolutely will not allow obliviate dumbledore sighed again even more heavily i had hoped for a better idea from you perhaps i suppose none came to mind 000000 and after all of that to leave the possibility of change dumbledore is the cruelest man on the face of the earth and when you understand like i do her voice broke off then after a swallow after that you ll never be able to look at him the same again he the worst sort of human being he got purpose he ll do anything i dontwant to hear this she realized suddenly i dontwant to hear it i really want to keep worshipping dumbledore inside me i want to let him take care of things he knows about leverage dumbledore give me a place to stand and i will move the earth some little girl who could barely find it in her to keep living was nothing to him 000000 there was something important that i forgot hermione glanced at sirius from where she d laid herself out on the couch a hand over her eyes you know why dontyou he blinked at her a little his mind was hazy for some reason or another and it was taking time for her words to process you too then she let out a tired laugh i forewarned you know because i knew what he was i knew he might try something like this her eyes were unfocused but they seemed darker than ever now can you get rid of a memory charm he leaned against the wall struggling to refocus memory charm no he d gone in and sit down and dumbledore had offered him a lemon drop asked about his research if he could give him the notes so far for perusal i bollocks with those he told her with another blink you know that and his would be strong hermione agreed vaguely i cantsee it coming off i ll have to check the diary i dontthink he knows about it but he might what are you talking about he asked her blearily i dontknow not yet she smiled gently up at him then for some reason or another i think i ll stay here just long enough to get my feet back everything kept slipping away so easily he could have sworn he d almost understood everything several times but things were becoming more and more distant with every passing second do you think she mumbled to herself sleepily do you think he ll have anticipated me sirius pressed a hand to the place between his eyes exactly as she d done it had begun to hurt i dontknow what you re talking about he murmured moving to sit in front of the couch leave it to her to take the most comfortable piece of furniture her fingers were light and curling through his hair at any other time he would have been shocked and possibly alarmed at the gesture but right now there was a part of him urging that he lean into it it was touch human touch and it was everything he d so desperately needed for so long it such a twisty way to think she whispered after a while i begin to wonder whether everything was meant to lead up to this if it all part of how it was supposed to go maybe i ll understand this later if i even remember dear god i tired no matter what i change or fix or break it possible fate is still laughing at me this is some kind of strange dream he thought i about to wake up and he did and it was or had to be because she wasntthere 000000 her lip trembled and the mask began to fray hermione with the dark eyes was lost and little a tiny blip in the middle of the vast eternity you know what it like being inside someone life seeing what it like being immersed in them so completely you sympathize you empathize you want more than anything to help them somehow even if everything you re watching has already happened even if you know they re dead no one should be forced to hope again hermione thought suddenly this was the result broken past repair and still functioning somehow pieces found and forced together at odd angles jammed in all wrong and that was her the other hermione brushed her short hair back quietly against the wind her smile sad and trembling after that you you just fuck it all and fall in love shattered moments by rurouni star sorry about the slow updates i really am writing an original novel and i hoping to give it to an editor at a convention that coming up ridiculously soon we re at 35 000 words rejoice break out the mountain dew this chapter is short by the way but really dense think of it as a singularity really bad geeky pun also yes this is the end of separate povs you get to take a look inside hermione truly confused brain next chapter 27 singularity eternity a terrible thought i mean where it all going to end tom stoppard the other hermione leaned back onto her heels closing her eyes with a deep breath we re the same person whatever it is that makes hermione who she is at the core is in both of us the only difference is that i half her soul whereas you ve the whole she broke off trembling by the end of this you ll be one and a half but hey the soul is infinite why should you notice a little more or a little less right she laughed shaking her head there a word for what i did to get here inside the ubiquitous timeturner because of that quality it the only safe place in any time or space during event horizon fingers in the sand perfect fingernails dragging grooves in the infinite stars her eyes lifted slowly to meet their counterpart horcrux the word is horcrux 000000 nudge george looked up at his twin from over his book wizarding business and you to raise an eyebrow did you just say nudge fred grinned i too comfortable to get up and do it anyway hermione just come in you want to take a break from your fascinating study to go declare undying love george frowned at him you were the one who said we had to look into the bureaucracy of it all time a wasting george had already flicked his eyes toward the entrance to the common room though and decided that catching up with hermione was enough to warrant an immediate end to the conversation the book made a depressingly large thud on the chair where it fell as he got to his feet she seemed distracted enough so that he was able to stop her with a hand on her shoulder hermione pause what to say he should ve planned this george my my head hurts i need to lay down he frowned look i know you re avoiding me for some reason but the least you could do is just tell me why instead of making all these excuses i know right i a terrible person she smiled sharply up at him holding her forehead you dont want to talk to me right now george your amazing mind reading powers must be off a bit today he told her because i really do her eyes they were that dark kind of something as they looked at him they were the same color still so it was hard to establish just how they were darker all right all right her smile while pleasant did not promise anything of the sort my room george blinked not only was this not going anything like he would have imagined but er hermione you know i can t her wand flicked at the staircase where he hadnteven noticed it in her hand before of course you can she started up the steps without a backward glance at him he hesitated only a moment before trying to follow the stairs let him up without complaint all the way to the fourth year girls dormitories any other day this would be cause for much patting on the back and blatantly immature snickering today all he felt was an incredible unease do i want to know came the sudden thought i dontknow what on earth i could have done but do i want to know hermione did look back at him at the door she opened it for him waiting patiently as he entered 000000 let me tell you a little secret dumbledore never once used any dark magic not once in his life but he d no qualms about overlooking other people using it as long as it helped him might even encourage it without saying so that was his research all looked into neat and tidy and no one else could possibly understand it but me with my muggle ideas but of course the research said you cantdo this this would be wrong a horcrux is dark magic and it takes sacrifices and you shouldnt do it but an acid twist of her mouth he didntdestroy it did he no and that timeturner and the pensieve those were blatant hints first steps on the road to damnation oh god oh god she couldnthave she wouldn t no matter what she couldnthave possibly a sacrifice but what do you know about the rutilus vita a tiny smile played on her lips that the potion he gave you it supposed to take a sacrifice too but he changed it i watched the moment it dawned on him and all the research after one sacrifice bleed slowly you can fool it he found all it asked for was a sacrifice it didnthave to be unwilling he made a sacrifice of his own blood in the other sense of the word a horcrux now that got to be an unwilling sacrifice you can split it but the end result was still horrific i hid the notes and thought i would never do it and no one could reproach me because no one knew she leaned her head downward chin resting on curled up knees should ve burned them that how you end things right george found them one unwilling one sacrifice he wouldn t for fred of course he would he made me kill him 000000 the door shut with a quiet sound and hermione leaned against it with a kind of idle weariness right girls dorm the hell there had to be a chair somewhere someplace safe to sit what do you want to know she asked him with sudden pleasantness george blinked deciding for the moment to lean against one of the banisters i still entirely in control he thought and tried to project this manner as much as possible i one of those terrible twins mothers warn their ickle firsties to stay away from i just want to know what wrong i guess so much for that it really ironic you should ask that george know why she moved to sit down on her bed he supposed it was her bed at least it had a large stack of books sitting next to it no i don t really i really sorry all right i dontknow what it is but i sorry for it she had to believe him it was pathetic how much he wanted her to believe him because she said her eyes muddled and tired and somehow smoldering with anger in spite of this because this is all directly your fault her fingers were twined up in something a chain around her neck he tried not to gape at her at the sheer absurdity of this statement but it was all right considering the circumstances that he failed there only one way to go back in time and make a difference she told him pulling on the chain there was a tiny golden hourglass on the end of it dangling strangely it was out of sand but it was made such that it could clearly be overturned to fix that little problem only one way i could find between dumbledore research and my own stupid stumbling about and i didntwant to do it in spite of everything i didnt want to do it hermione granger is not that kind of person not now or then or ever there only one way but there variations on the actual process she said looking up at him with her tired smile and her dark eyes so this is the question that ll make it all make sense if it was between saving fred or not fucking me up completely which one would you choose something like tears had begun to collect at the edges of her eyes she wiped at them with shaking fingers this wasnttrue it couldntpossibly be true it was too crazy i wouldn t he whispered dazedly there no way i would not now but you you would under the same circumstances her voice was breaking i sorry george i shouldnthave said anything i cant i cant blame you for this how on earth can i blame you for something you havent done yet now you might never do it he stared at her purely shell shocked i did this impossible i did this to her she d said it direct result i canthate you she said in a small voice there one half of me that really wants to but can t and there the rest of me that really really likes you i shouldnthave done this maybe she crazy the thought came maybe she is that would make it all somewhat better but regardless of her state of mind or the future or the past future or any kind of anything hermione was still sitting on the edge of her bed crying know what later i ll think about it later it seemed an eternity ago he d done this exact same thing pulling her carefully into him while she tried to find the present she was tiny compared soft and shaking i don t understand he told her honestly his fingers dragging through her hair but whatever else i know i wouldn t not me right now her fingers closed around his shirt dragging him down with a surprising amount of strength her mouth closed on his desperate and lost searching for something she instinctively knew she wouldntfind in him someone else a different him he could feel her fingers tracing his face there over his cheekbone down the line of his neck that much would be the same wouldntit before he could begin to make sense of that his own hand slipped to the base of her neck careful this was hermione whatever else in the world was true and she was kissing him like that her lips curved up against him for a moment that made it all worthwhile when she drew back her hand was still resting against his cheek there was some kind of understanding light in her eyes that hadntbeen there before i really could have loved you she told him it sent a strange kind of shiver down his spine as he brushed his thumb over her bottom lip he allowed himself to think for just a moment of that strange future of hers where she did love him the possibility was but we re neither of us are who we were a sigh i shouldnthave done this you remember and from here i ll be no better than dumbledore her wand the wand in her hand confundus 000000 hermione looked at her trying to find the broken insanity inside all she saw was darkness in those dark pits of her eyes worse than azkaban a living singularity unclothed so you brought me here somehow because while i in here time cantget to me seven out of ten miss granger whisper the sand was descending and the sky was rumbling ominously but you re missing the obvious i didntbring you here it tried to destroy you already but you cantdie you ve a horcrux in an untouchable place event horizon brought you here a pause do you know my one regret i shouldnt tell you you dontneed to hear it but you know i more selfish than you at this moment in time i going to tell you anyway sad and tired and dark and she could still smile wistfully i wanted to touch him again just one more time 000000 she really not doing well fred sighed that all you talked about george shrugged uneasily it not easy to talk about other stuff when someone like that i leaving off fred least till summer fred rolled his eyes you re a lost cause mate george sat down heavily picking up the book again yeah i guess so 000000 breakfast this day would rank among the top ten strangest things ever to happen to draco malfoy it would in fact by complete coincidence take the spot that turned into a ferret and bounced around a corridor would have occupied had time not decided to eradicate that particular event as it was the letter that dropped in front of him was unexpectedly ratty and covered in bird droppings he swore beneath his breath at the owl that had just departed at the post at anyone who happened to be nearby in general i not opening this piece of the writing was strangely familiar fuck despite it all the letter disappeared into his bag 000000 her white shark like smile beneath dead eyes is the last memory of the unreal everywhere place the older hermione standing in the eye of a breaking storm white shirt billowing snapping in the wind short hair shadowing the eyes i hate you she informed her because it was what they both expected and they both knew anyway i know soft so dontbecome me shattered moments by rurouni star a few answers a sirius crossed out a more blatant reference to the timeturner which will become a little more apparent later once he starts bugging hermione about it i figure it not too bad to let you know now as it was possible to pick up on it earlier in essence what he was saying went something like this are you crazy get rid of that thing now before it steals your souuuuul er something like that p b as for question number two i seem to have outsmarted myself she closed the door but i forgot to put that and the reason the door was open was an annoying mother playing with pets my own mother used to open my door in the mornings before i woke up and leave it open which drove me absolutely insane so i sort of added a bit and hoped it wasnttoo hidden a message c the different conductor is just there for flavor because i figure poor stan isntworking all the time good idea though d and sirius will get his pov but not for a while you ll figure out why and a comment even though it doesntreally answer any questions the weasley twins get major coverage this time around they re involved in some very important memories as you ll soon see plus i just very partial to them chapter 2 at the burrow lost yesterday somewhere between sunrise and sunset two golden hours each set with sixty diamond minutes no reward is offered for they are gone forever horace mann hermione was glad to see ginny again once she and her mother got back from diagon alley it had been much too long in her opinion since they had talked the idea finally hit her that she would be able to stay up late talking with her since she was staying in her room it appealed to her she d never really had that kind of relationship with any other girl where she could giggle about boys and people they both knew and useful little cosmetic spells of which hermione knew a lot but did not like to use she found herself immediately appalled at the turn her thoughts had taken of course hermione was not repeated not an empty headed little teenage girl but her uncertain mind offered up excuses immediately a little bit of social interaction was nice every once in a while and it couldnthurt surely and and if it was something she wanted there was no reason to deny it to herself her mind made up hermione looked over at ginny across the dinner table the other girl was looking straight back at her as though waiting for a confirmation when hermione gave a hesitant smile ginny grinned back then pulled back her spoon and shot a pea at fred hermione stifled a snort of laughter as he looked about in surprise then blinked as his eyes landed on her with a kind of suspicious amusement she shook her head no and tried to look unobtrusively at ginny but a glint had come into his eye which she didntquite like he turned to whisper something in george ear and a shiver of foreboding went down her spine ron completely immune to the brewing war and underlying tension turned toward her distracting her hey hermione he said harry going to be here in a few days well i mean that is if his aunt and uncle let him at this he scowled slightly but quickly regained himself to continue anyway i sure they will so i was thinking you know we should have a quidditch match i mean with everyone here we might be able to come up with decent teams hermione felt something inside her plummet glumly flying was not easy for her if ron thought she would have fun falling from a great height multiple times he was very wrong indeed but she thought tiredly the thought did count she smiled weakly how about i referee she asked in what she hoped was an enthusiastic voice i sure i have a book on the rules actually i sure you do too at his disgusted face she knew he was going to protest hermione he began surely enough you read enough during the school year dontyou i mean not that quidditch makes for boring reading but you need to have some fun lighten up a little his statement was punctuated by a tiny plop hermione closed her eyes with a groan and smeared the mashed potatoes from her face ah gravy fred george mrs weasley voice was shocked but hermione knew she wasntsure which twin had actually perpetrated the deed it fine hermione said cheerfully but feeling vengeful she looked over at ginny and jerked her head toward the plate of peas sitting ammunition ginny nodded imperceptibly while mrs weasley inspected the two twins faces both identically angelic the two pulled back their spoons and aimed carefully the almost invisible vegetables went flying george blinked as hermione hit him squarely between the eyes ginny s alas went flying straight past fred with no effect hermione realized belatedly that charlie was stifling laughter behind his hand he was judiciously turning it into a cough perhaps we should get out of here before this turns ugly she thought wryly she almost looked for the time on the wall before remembering that the clock didntshow it still she saw with a kind of palpable relief that bill hand had moved to traveling and no longer showed him as being in a deadly situation i sort of tired she yawned would it be all right if i washed up and got to bed mrs weasley looked away from the twins and smiled in a motherly way yes dear that fine you must have had a long day hermione realized as she went upstairs that she really was tired she barely had to brush her teeth and slip on something comfortable before she fell onto her cot and lost consciousness 000000 cold dark damp the wind was blowing through the room making her shiver uncontrollably and there was an awful leeching feeling like more than just her heat was being taken from her it was her happiness her very being i cantremember a voice she didntrecognize was sobbing i cantremember i cantremember anything i wontbe like that a hoarse voice was whispering she did recognize this voice i wontbe like them i innocent i innocent there was a pause and she felt that the owner of the voice had just realized he had begun to repeat himself in a way that was similar to the other i have to stay sane he said choking on the words she imagined he was clutching at his head with his hands though it was too dark to see i cantgive into it it not fair that i should peter why did you peter why you couldnthave known it was like this you wouldntcondemn me to this not you peter it was growing colder by the second there was a clanging sound something was opening a cold clammy hand brushing past her as though it were real and she felt herself descending into screams and pain and darkness stop stop this is too much i canttake this she was saying desperately but there was no reply the voices were blending together now the screams and the gasping and the cold cold room was somehow becoming part of it as it spun away from her her thoughts were beginning to be torn from her every sane thing she could manage and all that was left was an unreasoning terror and despair a howl split the air 000000 hermione hermione are you okay wake up hermione she gasped coming awake all at once and feeling a jerk as her limbs thrashed just remembering that they could move ginny pulled back as she sat up staring at her in the darkness i i sorry hermione managed it it was just a bad dream is all i watched a scary film before i left ginny blinked probably wondering what a film was but let it be in almost the same instant her expression relaxed her interest piqued her hand shot forward to pick something up hermione she said in awe this is beautiful where on earth did you get it eyes widening hermione jerked back pulling the darkly glinting hourglass from the younger girl hand it nothing she said in an awfully stilted voice ginny looked slightly hurt and very disbelieving choices whirled through her exhausted mind she could tell the truth no she couldnt she could lie but what lie was convincing enough and ginny might look it up and figure things out and go telling then it a secret hermione said desperately i can t ginny please i d get into so much trouble ginny sighed and looked longingly at the little golden necklace as though it were everything no one would ever tell her i know a thing or two about secrets she said though her voice was filled with resignation they only get you into trouble in the end hermione hermione found she couldntagree more but she smiled in a relieved way at ginny as they both turned over and went back to sleep 000000 when hermione woke up the next day she found she was having trouble breathing in a moment she realized why crookshanks was laying heavily on her chest off she managed thickly pushing at him the cat opened one eye to look at her briefly then closed it and resettled himself hermione groaned and tried to rise feeling him slide off like a dead weight crookshanks gave her a dirty look before turning away to curl up again ginny bed was empty hermione supposed she must have been downstairs she hoped ginny wasntupset with her it was nice having a friend that wasntmale and trouble magnetic she left a bowl of food out for the cat who would probably get up as soon as she left the room and smoothed the wrinkles from her pajamas before moving out the door she never had a chance why hermione came a pleased voice from her right up already it looks like it doesntit a wry voice said from her other side she blinked as for the second time in two days her arms were grabbed the twins dragged her quickly over to a different room hey hey wait she protested what going on we were going to ask you yesterday of course george said airily but obviously you were busy so you grabbed me as soon as i woke up hermione demanded trying to disentangle herself from their grip as they ushered her into the room while fred closed the door secretively behind them hermione wouldnthave recognized it as their bedroom if she hadntfigured it was where they were taking her the place was like a manicure the beds were neatly tucked in the pillows all in one place the bookshelves bookshelves were well looked through but arranged in alphabetical order the two beds had been shoved to opposite corners of the room in order to make room for well she wasntentirely sure what it was other than a giant mess of knick knacks and odd objects we re taking a chance with you hermione fred said in a semi serious tone that belied his amused eyes we need help help she asked still slightly sleep dazed george moved toward a bed stand where he pulled open a drawer and began to rummage through it hermione took the opportunity to observe the strange mess on the floor on closer inspection she saw that it wasntquite without purpose there was quite a bit of unopened candy in it as well as scattered papers with writing and diagrams and what looked to be quite a few wands hermione looked sharply at them as she realized the candy was not just any candy but muggle candy where did you get this she asked picking up a jawbreaker and inspecting it critically george pulled something out of the drawer with an aha and moved back over to them here he proclaimed thrusting a slightly crumpled paper at her hermione always wary of a joke took it cautiously after no explosions or large scale disasters took place she smoothed it out carefully and looked down at it no she stated flatly looking up at them no fred made a wounded face why not he asked injured george moved to one knee and took her hand dramatically you must hermione he said you re our only hope hermione despite herself began to feel uncertain normally she wouldnthave budged an inch on such a proposition but she d stolen the map it always came back to that stupid map i she began getting ready to convince both the twins and herself that it wasnta good idea we ll cut you in on the profits fred said quickly hermione paused confused what profits she asked george looked up at him sharply if he d known pig latin she might have expected him to say ix nay on the ofit pray but of course he didn t instead of talking in pig latin his face screwed up in concentration as though he were trying to mentally communicate it hermione could have told him it wouldntwork yes fred said firmly ignoring his brother we re starting a business george and i if you help us out maybe more than just this once we ll cut you in on some of the profits you d be a minor shareholder in essence hermione blinked mentally fitting together what she knew of the twins and figuring out what exactly they meant it hit her a moment later that they were much more organized about their pranks than anyone could ever have imagined i ll think about it the words popped out before she could even really consider them fred beamed at her oh good i knew you d see it our way and before hermione could protest that she d said she d think about it he slipped something into her pocket have a ton tongue toffee he winked free of charge george raised his eyebrows but i wouldnt eat it he said with a significant look at fred the other twin looked almost disappointed that he d spoiled the surprise hermione nodded weakly already feeling that her life was more out of control just for having been near the twins and turned to leave the room she folded up the little paper neatly and slipped it into her pocket the door closed behind her as she walked into the hall and she turned about in surprise george was standing in front of it alone he was scrutinizing her closely with an unreadable expression on his face um yes hermione asked him feeling suddenly self conscious in her flannel pajamas he shrugged uneasily you dontlook very well hermione he told her is something wrong she found herself stunned by the question as all the possible answers hit her there was no i afraid for my life no i afraid for a convicted murderer life no just seeing you puts me on a guilt trip and of course yes i perfectly fine please do stay out of my business or something close to that hermione chose a more diplomatic lie i fine george she said thanks for the concern i ve just managed to invert my sleeping schedule a bit is all he seemed to take her comment as truth as he nodded but hermione had the awful feeling that he wasntquite convinced there was an awkward silence as each tried to devise a diplomatic way out of the situation or at least hermione knew she was trying at which point george said why dontwe go down to breakfast hermione took the offered out and she walked down the stairs in front of him his footsteps echoing strangely just behind her own her fingers went unknowingly to the timeturner as she instinctively tried to make certain it was hidden the footsteps began to sound strangely in her ears the echoes stretched then began to slow as though they were part of a record on a very low speed she gasped and stopped abruptly the world had faded away around her into a black eternity filled only with the sound of her own steps it only a matter of time where he concerned her own voice whispered but what could you do hermione ron asked desperately even you cantface off with him well yeah but bulgaria got krum i mean even if they manage a decent score he ll still get the snitch you know he will hermione blinked the world was back and the feeling of vertigo had suddenly disappeared she turned about to ask george what ron had meant and looked almost directly into his surprised eyes hermione pulled back then realized too late that modesty might have taken precedence over falling down a flight of stairs just this once she gasped one hand still on the timeturner about her neck painfully aware that bad things happened to those that broke powerful artifacts thankfully george was quicker thinking than she was his hand shot out to grab hers she grasped at it and pulled herself up a moment before something bad might have happened but as she looked at george she realized that something bad might already have happened what wrong with you lately he asked her impatiently he dead hermione fred is gone she stared at him eyes wide he hadntuttered a word but she d heard him so clearly just now i so sorry george hermione pulled her hand away from his half dazed the time turner still clutched in her hand she squeezed her eyes shut and opened them again and tried to collect herself but instead she was turning around to walk down the stairs shaking her head slowly and pushing the time turner beneath her shirt nothing is making sense anymore she thought desperately george was watching her very closely as she sat down at the table but he seemed reluctant to bring up the strange incident ron meanwhile had begun to talk enthusiastically about harry pending visit he was apparently coming in that very day and hermione found herself frightened by her own lack of enthusiasm but when he began talking about the quidditch cup tomorrow hermione sat bolted upright and glanced sharply at ron tomorrow she asked incredulously when were you going to let me know ron looked half sheepish half irritated well you know you ve barely been here i suppose i just told you right now didnti told her what fred was coming down the stairs looking terribly upbeat for such an early hour but hermione caught herself staring for a moment he dead in a year in a few years and looked away with what she imagined must have been a chalk white face thankfully no one seemed to be looking at her apparently hermione doesntknow when the quidditch world cup is ron said and she could hear him rolling his eyes well that makes sense dear his mother said while refilling ginny cup of orange juice i wouldntimagine that hermione parents talk about it much do they ron went quiet for a second hermione managed a look up at him and saw that he was blushing bright red oh he said yeah i guess charlie and fred got into a long conversation and hermione tuned it out playing idly with her food but not feeling particularly hungry by the end of breakfast she was thinking of the little folded paper in her pocket shattered moments by rurouni star this chapter should be more coherent because hermione clears up some and it not three am and guess what we re getting close to the end i think like the whole thing yay chapter 29 our broken circle it is often stated that of all the theories proposed in this century the silliest is quantum theory in fact some say that the only thing that quantum theory has going for it is that it is unquestionably correct michio kaku hermione seriously you ve got to tell me how you did it i dontthink they ve ever banned a student from homework before she glared at him but there wasntmuch behind it i not answering that ron he was sitting next to the hospital bed his face somewhere between hysterically amused and hysterically concerned she appreciated it really somewhere inside her because ron was the only unchanging thing ever he had always been like this he always would be would have been she cut off the thought and focused on the constancy well when d you figure they ll let you out he snagged one of the chocolate frogs he d brought her stuffing it absently into his mouth i dontknow honestly she d finally gone and broken when she d promised mcgonagall and everyone else that she wouldn t they d believed her too it had been that weird unspoken rule that hermione granger never broke just the thought of the implied betrayal of that rule made her sick to her stomach hermione it it not that bad ron had predictably gone into rationalizations it was for her benefit so she lent him a bit of her remaining attention the rest was on memories and not memories and thoughts and once plans since waking she d been frightened to discover that her perceptions of the present had been grotesquely altered by possible memories of the past which were true and which weren t it was taking time to figure out they ll take it away what if they take it away the thought made her throat seize with fear and you ve always made such amazing grades you ll still be in the running for top graduate or whatever they call it she realized she d already tuned him out and felt the shame grow heavier besides they haventcalled up your parents yet that a good thing right hermione gave a horrible shudder ron looked at her with a puzzled expression and a mouth smeared with chocolate she waved away his quizzical face one of those things someone must have walked over my grave if i ever get one i haventhad one yet no matter how many times the thought was depressing and she had begun to scare herself with her preoccupation on the subject hermione he began hesitant look you you know you can he fumbled for her hand with earnest concerned eyes and slightly chocolate covered fingers you can tell me if something wrong and and harry either of us or both of us you know if you d said something about the work and all we wouldnthave made you go out to hogsmeade that weekend i enjoyed hogsmeade she interrupted him with a weak smile which one did i really have a snowball fight with them did harry really win or is it something else i ll never know for sure um i know but he looked distinctly uncomfortable you re getting off subject what i mean to say is that we re your friends and you you can trust us with anything hermione anything at all we d understand even if you wouldnt really think we would hermione went silent she glanced down at his hand on hers and thought thought on those words on how genuine and utterly applicable they were for a moment not the first not the last she felt the urge within her the rising need to tell him to blurt out everything right in the hospital wing sirius and harry and fred and george and everything she did and didntknow and the plans she had made with malfoy malfoy of all people to get things on that perfect little track but as much as ron wanted to think of understanding he wouldn t or worse he would what would he say to his brothers even she didntknow what to say to them she d been so petrified that she d made them forget hermione he said again listen to me would you she blinked and realized she hadntbeen breathing i want to it not like i dontwant to ron but she remembered him with sad hopeless eyes with death reflected in them with that pathetic little spark of hope still that always made it even worse on solid perseverant ron i overworked she said and i ve learned my lesson ron withdrew his hand she immediately missed it he looked disappointed hermione averted her eyes from his fiddling with the bed sheet in between her fingers where harry she asked softly ron shifted uncomfortably he s he working on stuff for the third task he said you d just tell him off if he came to see you instead hermione weak smile turned genuine at this good that what he should be doing ron ears were red at the tips how peculiar or no perhaps they had once been red perhaps they never would be a anyway he got to his feet uneasily rubbing at his hands you need another blanket in here i ll go bug them for another blanket a big fluffy one hermione smile widened thanks ron he shook his head a little it fine what are friends for huh he paused on his way into the other room i ll make sure it not from some slytherin bed or anything thank you her heart unaccountably felt near to bursting just as his bright red hair disappeared around the corner 000000 you think she knows a pause no she looked too confused to tell good 000000 in the minutes hours days she seemed to spend in the hospital wing hermione found time blurring by in an alarming fashion sirius did not come by to visit again though she found evidence of lupin presence between her dazed waking and sleeping mostly chocolates sometimes just barely a lingering scent of wolfsbane mcgonagall did not come to talk to her nor did dumbledore it was this conspicuous absence of action that truly made her begin to panic why arentthey taking it away from me it had been a simultaneous hope and fear she admitted it to herself in the darkest hours of the night when she found herself awake and thinking and thinking and thinking and thinking but so much damage had already been done that it seemed so ridiculous to give everything up now she had to follow through ideally to an end any end at all perhaps no end sometimes she found herself tracing circles in the bedsheets with her finger unbroken lines that inevitably connected to themselves and overlapped in strange ways at one point she imagined she had drawn herself an entire sphere though that was really mathematically impossible and really what the point she found herself thinking as her hand drew over imaginary sketches erasing them once more it will only happen again it doesntmatter what i do because i ll only screw up somehow and then it begins again there were days she felt much like she had with sirius sitting next to her entirely unable to find the will to move not to care because she cared she couldnthelp but care with some part of herself all the time but the will to hope the thought that any of this mattered at all whenever hope threatened her lackadaisical state all it took was some pseudo memory of ron and his pathetically hopeful eyes the cycle would begin again i not like him i dontwant to be like that hermione granger was a fighter but hermione granger was reasonable she knew when to give up she knew when it was hopeless or crazy or the odds were mathematically stacked against them she was a gryffindor not a hufflepuff and bravery really only got you through so many repeated failures before the real world began to hammer its logistic matrix into you you failed before before that perhaps before that the odds are stacked against you miss granger she d never hated knowing arithmancy before now she never wanted to see her textbook ever again they ve been keeping you away from visitors lupin told her when he caught her awake one day he settled into the chair looking haggard and tired and she could smell the sickly wolfsbane invading her nostrils do you know why hermione shook her head i donteither he paused leaning back in his chair and i dontknow why you haventasked yet you know she told him blinking somewhat bemusedly i not sure i know why either it didntmean it was any less true lupin sighed it might be something to do with the last task it coming up i would ve thought you d want to be there though she circled her arms around her knees pulling them up to her chest i dontknow his brow furrowed his eyes flicked toward her neck he paused again and this time it was pregnant why do you still have that hermione blinked looking at him what lupin leaned forward catching the golden chain of the timeturner with his fingertips he lifted it up to look at it incredulously why do you still have that she felt her dazed frown deepen into something slightly darker i dont know why should i know dumbledore said he was going to take it back the next time he hermione met his eyes he trailed off i see lupin got to his feet very quietly then he didntvisit her again 000000 granger it was a harsh whisper in the middle of the night she was used to strange visits and strange voices on occasion but this particular voice was not one she encountered often if at all she blinked over at a blurry outline in the air it slowly resolved itself into a pale white blond figure with a blood stained lip and a familiar sneer get up now granger this is no time to be playing around you ve had your sulk and it past time we got moving if you think i doing this alone you ve got another thing coming and it probably green tinted and deadly hermione pushed herself out of bed almost mechanically regarding him with a deceptively calm analytical exterior dumbledore is keeping me in reserve she said almost conversationally as a backup but he wontlet me out to see that tournament he doesntwant me getting involved if he can get whatever it is he wants malfoy shrugged so use your timeturner it doesntgo forward malfoy he rolled his eyes it doesnthave to leave now hide out somewhere until the task timeturn back to take your own place after all this blows over her brow furrowed that seemed it had some logic to it but if you re not able to do it once we re done there no point in any of it anyway it was true to an extent hermione set her mind to churning one last time finally after a long moment she looked up at him i need a wand she said they took mine away he threw her one as though having anticipated this it wasnthers nor was it his she wasntsure she wanted to know where he d gotten it let me under that thing he said grabbing the chain it ll have to be to a point before they knew you were nutso hermione raised her eyebrows at him even as she began to flick the timeturner through its turns that she said would take years and time her dear old friend began to recant itself once again 000000 two days i know i ve been keeping track i promise you i ll bet you understand what we re doing here not really it pretty well over my head actually 000000 lupin a long terrible pause severus an even longer one the potions master eyes narrowed the headmaster says you have research for me something i supposed to file or somesuch thing lupin smiled at him tiredly and took a long sip of his tea i seem to have misplaced it he finished off the cup serenely it wasntmy research to begin with anyway i was holding it for a friend snape frowned deeply his displeasure clearly manifest on his features what game are you playing this is important lupin i was told this was our backup plan it was supposed to go in trust if things go wrong you wontbe in any position to send it and you will be lupin closed his eyes sighing i very sorry severus but he told me the project had met with an untimely end something to do with a fireplace and various vibrating strings in the tenth dimension i think he paused again to smile wearily it wasntwithout a bit of mischievousness a bit over my head i afraid snape stared at him the long bony fingers on top of his desk twitched slightly the only betrayers of any emotion whatsoever who he said finally his voice rasping in the dungeon the unspoken words hung in the air twisting like fire this is no game this is no game this is no game lupin stood with some effort picking up his teacup if you cantguess it means dumbledore never told you i cantgo against his wishes snape beetle glimmer eyes watched him incredulously as he left shutting the door behind him this is a game it is the only game that matters the corners of lupin mouth turned up into a dimly amused vaguely triumphant smile as his steps resounded down the dungeon corridor somewhere in conceptualization a sphere split down the middle the chess board never had just two sides after all 000000 that all right i understand it perfectly shattered moments by rurouni star this may be a bit short forgive me i working on it slowly but surely we re in the home stretch chapter 32 a lengthy hour who knows but the world may end tonight robert browning you ll do fine harry no dragons this time fred gave him an attempt at a grin sure he will ron agreed he got it all planned out dontyou harry at this for some reason harry shot him an expression with raised eyebrows something fred might have recognized any other time as a shut up why dontyou face come on now lupin said to fred slipping into the tent it getting toward the start you ll have to run if you want good seats this was his polite way of saying please clear the area so we can get started krum looked up from a guttural discussion with karkaroff nodding at the teacher ve are ready lupin paused for a moment taking a look at karkaroff madame maxime and one father who hadntyet vacated the area cup as good as yours amos diggory said quickly patting his son on the back as he caught the glance in his direction then stopping by harry he gave a friendly nod if the rest of you would leave lupin said glancing at the two international teachers we ll be able to give the instructions maxime looked almost offended for a moment but karkaroff seemed to have been expecting this he rose from his corner with what might have been a superior look at maxime and her pupil no it most likely was may the best champion win he muttered unconvincingly as he too passed harry by harry for his part merely blinked and looked over at krum once his back was turned krum shrugged noncommittally lupin nodded once the adults were gone in which case i ll now give what instructions you need while mr crouch explains to your audience petrificus totalus harry winced as sirius now familiar voice sounded from behind him lupin stiffened in mid sentence shocked but when his body fell it was in an exaggerated way as though lowered by an invisible hand what the devil cedric was already pulling his wand while fleur tried to aim somewhere in the vicinity of the voice with a hurried stupefy the red streak caught the edge of something invisible but instead of disappearing with a hit it deflected off into the ground as a second voice countered with protego cedric had finally gotten his wand out finite stupefy two voices sounded at once neither of them came from under an invisibility cloak cedric eyes glazed over while fleur merely toppled from her seat ve vill need to use the cloak on them krum asked then with a glance at lupin on the ground will they not be suspicious of his being gone he wontbe gone sirius said sounding closer this time you know how to do a decent confundus mine are terrible krum nodded uneasily glancing over at lupin i can do this i vill haff to apologize later you and me both sirius muttered pulling off the cloak and throwing it to harry immobilize them first before they get their senses ron beside him headed over to fleur whom he very carefully began to move beneath a table sorry sorry sorry he hissed under his breath polyjuice sirius said pulling two vials from his robe that means we ve got one hour though i dontthink it should be a problem once we re actually inside the maze you never really know ron said eyeing the lock of silvery hair miserably are you sure this is a good idea when hermione took the cat hair it went really wrong and fleur part bird thing that why yours has the sorry sirius eyed the two vials for a moment then picked one to hand to ron that why yours has the alterations ron gave him a clearly suspicious look you re sure this is the right one sirius patted him on the shoulder as he went to flick a lock of cedric hair off with his wand absolutely not really he d made the alterations up after all a veela was still er humanoid technically and she was only part veela if i start moulting i coming to get you before before we deal with whatever sirius glanced over at krum i confounded you if they ask the bulgarian shrugged perhaps it vill not come to that he raised his wand over lupin with a last vaguely unhappy expression bottoms up sirius said to ron harry knowing what to expect of polyjuice potion turned to look away as the transformations began krum not as well informed took a second longer we ve got one hour said cedric voice 000000 you shouldntbe moving it was an observation of fact and not a suggestion there was no way she should have been moving right now i keep doing a lot of things i shouldn t hermione broke off with a cough a weak glance at her hand and she wiped the blood off somewhere beneath her robes you re bleeding through the bandages already malfoy further noted a sick kind of fascination in his voice hermione glanced at him and opened her mouth to say something but changed her mind soon after her face was ghostly pale from the blood loss she d required help moving for the past half a day she hadntthought she would live half a day your stitches are probably coming undone she said finally pressing a hand very very delicately to the deep puncture in her stomach a wince i doubt you ve ever picked up a needle in your life wouldntyou believe it malfoy said i did once once he was talking in a very subdued voice now and mostly just to fill up empty space between words had he ever seen that much blood before had he ever seen anyone die these were questions she both did and didntwant to know the answers to regardless of the answers it had become clear that he wasntvery levelheaded around blood and had he been able to admit it to himself he probably would have already made her swear to secrecy they came to the bottom of the large hill soon enough it had been visible from a few miles away its old dreary capstone was a large mansion which rose to a sharpened point against the sky hermione sighed and let go of malfoy swaying a little in the process the situation had never had a chance to become humiliating considering the urgency they were in so she didntthink on it much it did surprise her dimly that he didntcomment on the bloodstains she d left on his robes perhaps he already knew how he was going to get them out or perhaps he simply didntwant to think about it there something i need in the house she said but you dontwant to come with me for it i ll be headed to the graveyard directly after he stared at her his face went from skeptical to incredulous in a heartbeat you wontmanage two steps on your own he told her voldemort will be there she said and she caught the flinch in his face as she said the name you cantbe serious he said you told me we d be disrupting the cup you said nothing about actually facing him which is why you wontcome with me she said much more calmly than she felt because you dontwant to take sides which is patently ridiculous considering that you ve helped me pick up one of his five remaining horcruxes already his face went almost as pale as hers as she pulled the locket from one of the inside pockets of her robe you didnttell me he said hoarsely you didnteven mention you just said it was important it is she said she felt her eyes harden as warm blood dripped its way down her side he killed people i love multiple times just because they re not dead now doesntmake it any better i going to kill him this time malfoy was breathing hard now she saw him considering his wand in his sleeve pocket even though he d made no move for it yet she watched him quietly for a moment before she spoke he killed you too more than once he looked ready to faint you re lying he said weakly you re trying to get me to do something and you re lying once because you tried to hide from him she said once because you displeased him there may have been another i cant remember clearly she saw belief in his face and self loathing and fear but she knew he wasntgoing to follow her she d known it from the beginning simply because of who he was i dontbelieve you he said in spite of the obvious and you re not walking yourself straight to him like a present i ll kill you first hermione smiled grimly showing her teeth she imagined she must have looked very frightening all gaunt and white with the red stains on her teeth i already dying malfoy i just want to take as much of him with me as i can she reached for his arm closing unsteady fingers around the place where his wand was hidden but if you think it necessary go ahead she said it only because she knew what a coward he was and because some very horrible vindictive part of her wanted him to know it too malfoy stared into her eyes for a moment and she looked back at him calmly he must have seen something he didntlike because a moment later he was stumbling back hermione felt suddenly very conscious of herself aware of the horrific pleasure she d been taking in his discomfort she turned holding at her stomach as she stared up the imposing slope of the hill i could take you back with the timeturner she said almost apologetically but i wouldntlast the few days of waiting there was a pause filled with the silence of hurried thought i ll go back alone he said and she flinched at the idea no she said almost immediately i i need it but somewhere in her dimly swimming thoughts came the other voice or one of them perhaps her own even repercussions he ll be killed if you don t one way or another her fingers crept toward the chain around her neck trembling and i dying anyway take it she said but she didnthave the will to pull it off herself it seemed like such a very long time since she d last taken it off it had in many ways become a part of her malfoy seemed just as loathe to touch the timeturner more because it involved touching her but self preservation overruled that faint fear and after a moment his fingers hooked the chain it dragged up over her head and she felt a sudden sense of loss as the metal left her skin he averted his eyes unlooping it from his wrist and settling it about his neck delicate gold against strangely pale skin see you later granger she felt the slow ooze of blood beneath her fingertips be good malfoy it was probably the most polite exchange they d ever managed he seemed to think about saying something else but the finality of things stopped him instead he nodded a little and the timeturner flick flicked around a little clumsier than she would have done she stared at the spot he d occupied for a very long time before turning to face the hill once again 000000 there was a crossroads of sorts before the final gasp it happened with a few important meetings things that could have gone wrong could have started things over all over again but didn t they re into the maze lupin said as he sat down next to dumbledore a little tiredly it going very smoothly so far i still waiting for the other shoe to drop mr black is probably wearing more than two of those shoes tonight dumbledore responded with a gently ironic note to his voice lupin brow furrowed for a moment puzzlement evident on his face the moment passed though and he nodded i d expect nothing less in another place deep in the corridors of the changing maze there was another world shaking encounter that would be largely overlooked i think we re nearly there cedric voice said harry hurried to keep up trying to keep his eyes on the roots that kept trying to trip his feet he nearly ran into the disguised convict as he stopped abruptly expelliarmus harry wand flew a very neat arc as cedric figure turned his questioning look turned to one of shock i am your godfather explained the voice sad and patient and my first duty here is to keep you out of whatever trouble is up there petrificus totalus the boy who lived was only halfway aware of the lock of hair that got snipped from his forehead a moment later red sparks went up 000000 the last crucial meeting was the quietest of all i had a feeling malfoy muttered staring at the other person in his dormitory you didntgo back all the way the other malfoy said leaning on his bed you werentplanning to anyway a pause you want to know how it all ends isntthere something cosmically wrong with meeting yourself or something the first one asked a shake of the head from his double not as far as i know i haventmuch to say though just that you d better head out to the pitch to watch things i expected to be there malfoy turned to leave the glimmer of gold at his neck disappearing into his robes the other older by a few days turned over to go back to sleep 000000 at the center of the maze at the end of a very strange hour harry potter form waited patiently for hermione granger to show herself he couldntwait forever he knew any number of things were teetering on the edge of going wrong the fact she hadntshowed yet did bad things to his confidence which had always been a little on the side of foolhardy she could be dead or dying or captured or any number of things a look at the marauder map though showed that she was nowhere in the vicinity the only reason she would have insisted on the center of the maze was if something were going to happen there he expected it would involve harry it always involved harry and the tournament was the perfect time to strike at him but here he was the most tempting target in the world and nothing had happened yet sirius looked down at the timeturner around his neck and frowned he knew it was hers he d no real way to tell but he knew it in a way he couldntquite explain and every time he touched it he found himself with strangely wistful feelings helpless longing wishes for things he couldntexplain he drew one fingertip along the glass expecting more of the same instead he froze as an overwhelming realization hit him the cup it was like a whisper incredibly far off and close to him all at once sirius looked sharply at the prize cup it glimmered faintly triumphant but unmenacing he nearly put it down to nerves as he tucked the little golden hourglass back into his robes but there again came the overwhelming certainty it was the cup the ultimate temptation calling to the champion that shouldnthave been it was that combination of strange fate and overwhelming worry that stretched his hand out to touch it it was all confirmed as an unseen hook jerked into place behind his navel shattered moments by rurouni star sigh i not horrid enough to leave you people at that but i am surprised no one caught the obvious loophole maybe i ve been overemphasizing the time travel aspect of the timeturner too much er you ll know what i mean in a moment there probably going to be only one more chapter possibly an epilogue this fic is going to leave some loose ends obviously but it meant to i suppose if anyone wants to continue from there they re welcome to i ll be both satisfied and a little sad when this ends i pray to god i dontget another ridiculously long term idea like this but i know i will eventually my book is at 60 000 words this series at least double that by now chapter 34 queen declined every moment of our lives is a dying moment the i of that moment dies never to be reborn huston smith the world religions there was a funny flash of green light surreal almost gentle nothing like in his wildest nightmares her lips were paused on his for a moment then she was curving in on herself tiny and bloody and pale he caught her only by reflex her hand was still curled at the front of his robes it was unnatural disappointing voldemort said lowering his wand without further thought or care he turned about wormtail he said give me your arm peter glanced up at him clearly shaken his eyes frightened and vaguely haunted before were now indescribable master he whispered trembling i holding out the bleeding stump hesitantly the other arm peter paused a second later he easily acceded his expression the strangely glassy kind of those in shock sirius stared down at hermione his mind had stopped working everything had stopped working there was in fact a peculiarly empty sensation in him as he looked at her still face she was warm still it felt somehow wrong to let her go peter let out a cry of sudden pain as the mark on his forearm began to burn black the pop of displaced air the confusion of sudden apparition the swirl and swish of musty black long unused left in deepest closets to rot white faces were appearing all around him like ghosts beneath the flickering light of the burning riddle house he failed to see them a confused murmur words a flash of silver go see if nagini still lives voldemort ordered peter the still dazed man looked down at his new arm then at the torch like house on the hill it was doubtful anything could survive such a thing go voldemort hissed at him and he seemed to come back to himself somewhat his scurrying footsteps disappeared into the mutters of the crowd people were looking at him from behind their masks some might even have recognized him others were more focused on the dead girl he still held pale and crimson it was ghastly it was everything all over again it was a sudden wish that he had stayed in azkaban instead or that he might still go back because surely surely there was nothing worse than this exact moment where he was frozen still in horrified incomprehension he would deserve it this time if he hadntbefore ah my loyal servants there was a chill in the words as voldemort swept slowly across the graves his reptilian eyes fixed on various people as though he could see straight through their masks it was entirely possible his mouth quirked ironically and which one of you will volunteer yourselves to take care of this sudden nuisance of mine there was a scramble and a sudden rise in the voices a panic voldemort held up a hand i expected as much the smile curled with derision so eager to redeem yourselves now that the dark lord is here to watch there was a long drawn out pause hearts could be heard pounding frantically as one none of you is loyal i will repair this myself watch well it could be your fate sirius didntlook up at the mention that was made of him footsteps moving again the dregs of a delicate gold chain slid from his neck going silent to the ground it was then that he noticed she was pale very pale her face had no hint of green to it her clenched hand held the timeturner hermione body shuddered against him suddenly she was breathing hard in gasping dying breaths that simply wouldntdie her eyes opened feverishly and he realized with a kind of horror that they d forgotten the original intention of a horcrux she wasntdead neither could she be called alive voldemort paused as he regarded the curious movement wand half raised his tattered robes swished around his feet horcrux he said it was a single word of recognition cold yes it was a small weak whisper and only sirius heard it the hand on the timeturner clenched harder there was something alien behind her eyes now a hermione he recognized only dimly her hand cold by now was suddenly in his pressing something there i cantdo it she said her voice odd it was so quiet that he had to lean in to hear her it has to be you it wasntalways it just it you now he looked down there was a small locket in his hand destroy it it was very nearly unintelligible as she closed her eyes again voldemort footsteps approached she d done everything but put him on the path this was a chance to hurt voldemort significantly to get revenge for every death every disgrace every horrible atrocity sirius black closed his eyes and prepared himself to do the most cowardly thing he had ever done no he apparated 000000 most of the people who were there remember the day very clearly it wasntthe sort of thing you forgot in a hurry the waiting area of st mungo was full to brimming people with boils people unhappily conjoined and or splinched people sneezing out their ears or covered in green polka dots he was covered in blood when he walked in they wouldnthave recognized him otherwise the girl in his arms was even more bloody enough so that it was clear where most of the smears on him had come from the medi witch behind the counter was still in training but she knew with just a glance that the girl was dead her face was much too pale and her arms dangled at odd angles perhaps if it hadntbeen so unexpected one of the people in the aisles of chairs would have stood up to face him but instead there was a kind of stunned silence half fright half sheer puzzlement as he walked toward the desk you have to help her he said his manner was surprisingly calm inestimably sane but his voice trembled the auburn haired witch behind the desk annie said the nametag found herself entirely unable to respond this drew on for a moment while inside she tried to mentally go through the book of procedures they d had her read for the job there were all sorts of things about spell damage and vanished familiars and such but absolutely nothing on azkaban escapees that wasntsurprising there d never been one before after all she found herself going into autopilot mode i afraid sir a pause there is nothing we can do for her the girl shifted very slightly and she nearly bit her tongue for god sake he said pleadingly his voice wavering she only a student annie rose from behind the desk with a swallow descending into a much too calm vertigo right this way sir the nervous breakdown came much later 000000 he was there when she woke up his face was grave and tired and there was dried blood on his cheek his robes under his fingernails he looked for all the world as though he hadntslept in days in fact as she rose very carefully up on her pillow she realized this was likely the case dontdo that he said almost automatically hermione felt the sudden stabbing in her stomach and had no choice but to follow the advice he reached out to steady her with one hand she felt it tremble as he did where am i her voice was hoarse and dry from lack of water her mouth tasted like blood still mungo s sirius told her and there was a peculiar note to his voice as he did he was staring at her haggardly like a man half dreaming certain nightmares oh she said suddenly feeling a horrible pit in her stomach oh she felt her eyes tear up in spite of the fact that she still felt dehydrated oh sirius she threw herself forward into his arms ignoring the pain it gave him pause for only a moment before he lowered his face to her hair one hand stroked her shoulder very gently and she felt his body tremble every once in a while with a silent sob he seemed to be trying very hard not to hurt her while at the same time his first frightened impulse was to tighten his arms until she couldntget away his fingers found her chin after a moment and there was his mouth on hers confused horrified relieved perfect in many ways it might have been some kind of natural reaction after that sort of ordeal she didntmuch care she pressed back desperately ignoring all the problems and possible embarrassments and questions that might result he responded by tangling his fingers in her already knotted hair there wasnta lot of communication in any of these gestures they merely solved everything and nothing all at once merely sharing someone else heat at this point was enormously relieving he d probably have looked at her very strangely if she d told him she loved him when it finally ended there was a long silence of unspoken words an agreement to worry about that rather unimportant complication some other time she didntdare imagine he d let her go though why hasntanyone arrested you hermione asked him with a swallow he closed his eyes with a deep breath and she felt an overwhelming sympathy whatever the answer it would have been an ordeal call it a plea bargain she frowned dimly remembering things all hazy and blurred the what about the locket then in a sudden panic she reached for her neck the timeturner sirius held her still the locket in ministry custody he said with distaste part of the part of their requirements he hesitated for a moment the timeturner hermione saw his eyes move toward the bedside table she followed his gaze tremulously the timeturner was there but it was dull and somehow unenthused compared to the way it had been there was a prominent crack running down the center though none of the sand had escaped hermione felt her breath leave her panic took its place she tried to break free of him to reach out toward it and pick it up but he held her tightly still it saved you sirius said shortly not alone but it did it served its purpose there was a peculiar measure of anger in his tone it she swallowed oh god he couldntpossibly understand she didntexpect him to it had been her a person all on its own she d shared a strange relationship with the other hermione at times she d alternately hated her loathed her pitied her looked down on her there were times though times they d thought with one voice things they agreed on so strongly that there may as well have been nothing to distinguish them apart at all in truth the things she d hated about her had been her own flaws apart from that there had been understanding of a sort and perhaps some kind of love i sorry she buried her face in his chest for a good while longer waiting for the sudden grief and helplessness to subside and in that strange silent way of his he let her shattered moments by rurouni star there always been a couple of things i wasntsure i made clear for anyone who was wondering and didntpick it up snape was the one that sent the original research to hermione after dumbledore died he knew at that point the sort of moral decision it would entail the bulk of the note that came with it was dumbledore s the apology was snape s also i had no perfect place to put in some other wrap ups but they werent absolutely critical harry does not move in with sirius he still needs the protection of his own blood but sirius does pay the dursleys a nice amusing visit wherein azkaban is probably mentioned at least once hermione little time traveling thing is never mentioned to the ministry for obvious reasons though they probably wouldntbelieve it anyway her parents might have been contacted about her hospital visit but dumbledore engineered a bit of confusion in pinpointing them to send anything so they re none wiser and hermione gets to have a horribly uncomfortable conversation when she gets home she probably lies if there are any other questions i might make an attempt to clear them up since this story was so ridiculously long and convoluted gosh i miss it already i want to make it clear if i haventbefore i ve appreciated the reviews incredibly they ve made me blush on occasion and even though we d like to think otherwise we all know authors are insecure and rely on some sort of praise to keep themselves going i certainly havent been lacking in that to anyone who took the time to leave a comprehensive detailed review or even just a small one i read them all you are what made this monster of a fic worthwhile thank you from the bottom of my heart plans for other fiction are sketchy but i ve started on a novelization of neverwinter nights hordes of the underdark that i might put up i hoping to make it comprehensive enough that anyone can read it and understand it be entertained again though i am writing on an actual novel which is coming along steadily and our comic that too so much to write so little time epilogue it is indifferent to me where i make a beginning for there i come back again parmenides there was no time anymore no extras no redos no hurried last minute fixes there was no time except the time she was supposed to have and it went in a line now instead of looping and twisting it was suddenly so simplistic that it made her occasionally afraid but there were things to do and there was no longer any time to think about this in view of everything else that had happened 000000 i see you re awake miss granger and no worse for the wear i hope she looked at the headmaster warily trying to discern his intent he would of course have waited for sirius to leave he had to leave some time much worse i afraid headmaster it was careful but she couldntentirely hide the icy tones behind it his face didntchange though she knew he had some semblance of guilt somewhere deep down it wasnt enough guilt though because she knew he would do everything exactly the same way over again voldemort is reborn dumbledore said it would have been partially a question except that he already knew it happened last time too she said trying to sound indifferent the quaver in her voice failed her but there were differences this time he said and i need to know what they were hermione looked at him carefully trying to gauge him she knew he was a ruthless man when he had to be there had been changes important ones but she knew already that she would have to pick and choose her words tell me about sirius first she said what bargain was he talking about dumbledore sat down in the vacated chair the weariness prominent in his face the ministry received a rather interesting note from one of the school owls around the same time we estimate you apparated away it seemed to insist that they send a large number of aurors to a certain graveyard of those sent three are now dead but among those that returned kingsley shacklebolt seems to swear by the fact that he saw someone the spitting image of peter pettigrew which seems to corroborate an otherwise incredible sort of story his mouth twitched tiredly furthermore in light of the fact that both crounch junior and senior were allied with the dark lord the convictions once made by the latter are now suspect hermione interrupted him here only crouch junior was involved she said i told you tha her eyes narrowed dumbledore sighed it best to let certain matters lie i should think with one of them dead and the other insane there very little reason to save any reputations at the potential expense of mr black if it had been anyone else she may have objected on principle but god and the devil both knew she d already done worse for the sake of sirius black i understand she said but the bargain dumbledore shrugged eloquently mr black has already provided the ministry with one horcrux which it is currently endeavoring to destroy a gesture of good will on his part i sure he has agreed to join one of the auror teams shacklebolt s incidentally he will be helping with the efforts to secure the other horcruxes and in repelling any overt strikes by voldemort that unfair she said bluntly he already done more than enough and they know he not guilty agreed dumbledore said but he would have done those things in any case unless i miss my mark at least this way he ll have people keeping something of a rein on him he settled himself more squarely in the seat as we were speaking of however the differences in this last event may be critical he wasntgoing to let it go we didntget to the locket last time she said reluctantly nor the snake dumbledore frowned in thought you seemed to intimate that mr potter would have been there instead of sirius black hermione had hoped very much that he wouldntcatch that but there was no point in denying it and he would only grow suspicious if she did i believe so she said i couldnttell you exactly how it changed things though i dont have access to the memories anymore she avoided looking at the bedstand though they d already taken the broken timeturner is there anything else you can tell me he pressed anything else hermione raced through the details in her mind looking for something anything to placate him with she had to keep him away from that subject no she said finally reluctantly dumbledore watched her for a moment she kept her eyes low he didntneed to read it from her mind then i ll return some other time he said rising to his feet you ll need to recover your strength if you wish to return to school we ve had your exams delayed in view of events i not going back she said he raised his eyebrows she knew it was strange of her school had always been her main focus it was a defining aspect a kind of quintessential detail of being hermione harry and ron were there furthermore and all of her studies and dreams she was in a good position she was probably already a shoo in for head girl it was ludicrous i going to apply for the accelerated auror training she said i the right age technically i ll have to go through the right legal channels to have it finalized but there are ways to get it cleared up they very rarely accept people who haventgone through the school program first dumbledore told her slowly she could tell he was trying to think of ways to dissuade her already i have perfect marks she said bluntly and i may not have all those memories but most of the things i do remember i d like to forget exactly the sort of things they need i see he sighed you ve already spent time thinking this through i afraid you cantdissuade me hermione told him quietly and you wontmake me forget or confuse me there always the chance that i might know something else you re a very shrewd girl miss granger dumbledore said shaking his head helplessly i hope it helps you it already has she said simply 000000 and there were answers very simple answers surprisingly simple when she looked back on them of course we knew ron sighed as he helped her with her trunk at hogwarts we re not stupid hermione just because we re not geniuses like some i never said i was a genius she retorted hotly but harry picked up where he d left off you kept telling me to mind my own business he told her but really look where that got you i figured one of the teachers had to be in on it since you werentbeing bothered about being snappy at all snappy hermione asked incredulously be fair hermione you were ron frowned as the trunk split spilling books down the stairs bother harry plucked one up but mostly waited for him to clean it up i grilled lupin he admitted i figured he was the most likely to tell me anything and he kept looking like he wanted to say something to you but he never did and he just told you about sirius just like that she demanded picking up hogwarts a history of course not harry snorted sirius walked in right about in the middle he was wearing the cloak but i not dense enough to imagine that doors open on their own all the time some help harry ron asked irritably harry sighed and stepped down to collect a few of the volumes hermione moved to help as well but found herself stopped by a hand on her shoulder this way granger i sure they can handle it she let herself be guided off partially at sheer surprise malfoy shook his head as they went i was somewhat hoping it d be a bit more exciting than books but as it turns out you re very badly predictable why is everyone doing their best to insult me today she said irritably he laughed ironically for them it because you nearly died for me just the usual he closed the classroom door behind them and threw himself somewhat lazily into a desk just thought i ought to clear up some things before you go you sent the letter to the ministry she said malfoy actually gave her a slightly injured look dontyou ever consider just pretending to be surprised he asked her i thought i had the upper hand for a moment there she shrugged sitting down in front of the door old habits die hard but i was surprised when i heard about it he was silent for a moment it gave her time to reflect that his hair was back to its irritatingly perfect state and that his clothing was once again impeccable expensive and blood free she d almost preferred the slightly tattered crimson stained malfoy he hadntbeen any less grating but it had been easier to deal with when he was so obviously off balance himself was i always such a fence sitter he asked suddenly and she found herself surprised again every time i mean hermione stared at him for a moment trying to form a response to the unexpected question you a pause i dontknow she admitted honestly from what i remember you did usually take a long time to decide you were wondering why he explained to her glancing over that why i mean he seemed suddenly vaguely uncomfortable there something very depressing about certainty i had the sudden urge to do something entirely different this time hermione nodded slowly no she said i do understand you wanted to buck fate a little smile curved her lips i always did that in divination there a kind of satisfaction in tearing predictions apart he shrugged suddenly looking at the door i ve chosen sides granger she understood then why he d wanted to talk to her so badly i was wrong hermione said he glanced at her his posture slightly slouched a small defiance compared to everything else what you re not a coward it was actually better than i could have come up with i d never have asked it of you though she saw the slight change in him the straightening the strengthening of purpose because everyone needed vindication for their sacrifices i hardly your drone he said though i dontneed your permission to do things you re right she agreed getting to her feet she could hear harry and ron calling somewhere outside the door going off to become an auror he asked her sounding unimpressed i am he hopped off the desk rubbing at one cheek well he frowned leave my father alone if you can because he really is just a coward hermione tilted her head at him consideringly malfoy senior had done some unforgivable things quite literally if she remembered correctly but malfoy junior had quite possibly saved her life and there was no doubt in her mind that he had singularly gotten sirius his provisional freedom the second it turned out was more important to her than the first i ll try she said he shrugged again as though it had merely been a sidethought she knew better hermione she sighed and turned to push her way back through the door she hoped in a strange sort of way that it wouldntbe the last she saw of malfoy it wasntsomething she let herself admit for some time to come 000000 and there were things that needed to be aired one way or another some time after the twins discovered that the marauder map had mysteriously started working again she had to have a long talk with sirius she was halfway afraid of it for very good reasons you cheated death and you want to try it again for a living he asked her incredulously hermione frowned you re going to be doing it she said yes but i ve got no choice he responded irritably and damnit why are we having this talk while i have to move my furniture you started it hermione reminded him blithely as he struggled with one of the chairs in his flat oh come on sirius you re a wizard she flicked her own wand wingardium leviosa the chair floated up into the air and traveled across the room to deposit itself tastefully in a corner i still haventgotten a decent wand replacement in case you hadntnoticed he said acidly and arentyou too young to do that you might think so she told him kicking her legs up onto the end of the couch but no judicious use of an age line has informed both the ministry and me that i am seventeen she fully appreciated the silence from his end it was a bit of a surprise she d been saving it for a rainy day should i repeat that hermione asked him innocently but he was already muttering something vile underneath his breath i wondered why you suddenly had a taste for moving furniture sirius said look we already or it was fairly well understood that i was not going to except she told him very serious now you will sirius because this war is just beginning and god only knows what might happen she fiddled with her wand a little nervously trying to keep her voice level finally with a bit of an outburst she said i d rather get to know you before i lose you this time there was a good long pause at this one she heard his footsteps though after a moment he reached over to take one of her hands hesitantly she noted as always that he was very warm and that his hands were very smooth she d long since started memorizing things about him on those occasions that she saw him in case in case you re not going to lose me he said i can take care of myself and in any case a pause your parents are dentists he said she felt her face change to one of total confusion what what on earth has that got to do with it i dontknow he admitted i just felt like using an argument you couldntlogic me out of you re terribly good at that hermione grinned actually she said you have very nice teeth you may have to give that point up as well he sighed heavily shaking his head then after a moment of helplessness he leaned over to press a soft kiss to her forehead see now she murmured angling herself a bit awkwardly to catch his lips instead that wasntso hard was it murmured against him i think you re getting a terrible amount of fun out of this he accused her pulling back she shrugged i have to get it somewhere auror training is going to be hell the accelerated program is even worse i hear she gave him her most innocent expression would you like to teach me again beforehand just to catch me up to speed you re a cunning little girl he said you know i wontrefuse i want you alive i know hermione agreed and i going to do my best she hesitated still holding his hand you re going to have to stay alive as well she said for for more reasons than one than me i mean sirius raised his eyebrows she could see that he was tempted to make light of things again but she was being serious and he understood that why is that hermione lowered her eyes and tightened her grip on his hand never mind she smiled at him and subsequently changed the subject i think you ll have to teach me how to dance as well surprisingly he let it go at that she spent the rest of the evening helping him get situated there was little else to do he was still vaguely uncomfortable with her she could tell and it was going to take time to acclimate it was very similar for her the difference was that she had the occasional memory of some unfathomable longing it was sometimes enough to drive her to the edge of tears until she forced it on herself that he was alive and well and trying to rummage something to eat without the aid of a wand or a house elf it was harder now than ever now that she d realized a very uncomfortable truth the one she d kept from dumbledore and then from him in spite of the fact that he really should have known it had been the other hermione that put it together just before her end born to those who have thrice defied him born as the seventh month dies there had been three lives three times they d lost three times she d escaped voldemort running to a place he couldntfollow resetting the table when did i visit you she asked sirius as he tried to make sense of the pantry he stopped to glance over at her a bit confused when did you mean he asked she stared up at the ceiling blankly still lying on the couch her ankles crossed in azkaban it was very very quiet it had the effect she d expected as his face turned troubled but she had a definite need to know i dontknow he said i couldnttell you at all days run together there hermione sighed sorry she said it was a weird thought it was july dumbledore could hardly have put it together in the same way she had not unless she d given him much more information than she had but he too knew that voldemort had taken sirius blood he d called him his enemy there was a scar there still on his forearm a small white line like a spiderweb it was in much the same place that a death eater mark might have been i overanalyzing she murmured aloud turning over onto her side i dontbelieve in divination anyway how the hell do you work this thing sirius demanded aloud hermione heard him kick at the stove she sighed and rolled onto her feet one moment she called dontbreak anything from here it was a long way ahead she had hope that it would end a little better this time shattered moments by rurouni star there was a question in there i very much wanted to answer but the answer is a big thing so it ll have to wait until next sequel sorry chapter 3 going camping some national parks have long waiting lists for camping reservations when you have to wait a year to sleep next to a tree something is wrong george carlin hermione readily volunteered to stay behind when they informed her they were going to go and get harry not only was she unaware exactly how they were going to get there she really had no curiosity as to precisely how bad the dursleys were instead she went up to the room she shared with ginny and began to work on the little paper in her pocket while charlie went out to buy a few groceries it had to be a guilt trip it was during this time when she was glancing at one of her books and chewing on the end of her pencil that she heard the bang downstairs she blinked i hope this isntsomething else fred and george have done hermione grumbled to herself as she pushed open the door her notepad under her arm she heard a happy cry from below though and realized that it was probably nothing of the sort the only thing that usually accompanied one of the twins inventions was a frustrated yell followed by a fred george besides which they were currently picking up harry and probably causing no end of trouble while they were doing it hermione moved slowly down the stairs curious despite herself she heard ginny voice running excitedly and mrs weasley calmer but similarly excited one talking cheerfully she rounded the corner to see three red heads pushed together in a giant group hug and somehow felt immediately out of place hermione went back up to her room 000000 it was later when there was that pop from the fireplace and a chorus of yells and talking that hermione met both bill and harry bill for the first time hermione was relieved at first to feel the normal rise of excitement at the thought of seeing harry again she rushed down the stairs like the normal teen she liked to fancy herself grinning widely and opening her mouth to call out to him but she stopped at the bottom of the stairs for the second time that day frozen by the tired worried expression he was wearing as he pulled ron out to the side to talk hermione felt a little flutter in her stomach something was wrong her paralysis disappeared just in time as harry looked up to see her he too froze just for a moment she was struck by his eyes green green eyes that she d never much paid attention to before and by the shadows beneath that heightened their color harry raised his hand then to beckon her into the fold once more ron moved aside to make room for her as a shrill voice that could only belong to mrs weasley began to berate someone or a few someones what is it she whispered worriedly taking better stock of him now and wondering not for the first or last time if it was something that she had inadvertently caused harry seemed to come up mute struggling either for words or courage she wasntsure but he seemed to find what he was looking for because a second later he said i had a dream something to do with my scar i think it was real he paused seeming pained and embarrassed as though expecting a reprisal but neither ron nor hermione said a word harry looked up through his unruly bangs and hermione felt a strange foreboding as she saw it made his scar stand out more prominently an angry red color i think voldemort back like everything else that day it took a moment to register but eventually the inevitable occurred ron face went a sickly white color he began stuttering though neither of them could make out what he was saying harry became more subdued if it was possible and his eyes dropped to the floor hermione presently became aware that her heart was pounding outrageously and it was hitting the back of her eyes in a way that tinged things in black every other beat she heard dimly the crackle of paper and as she stabilized herself against the wall behind her she saw harry pulling something from his pocket as though through a strobe light i wrote down everything i could remember right afterward he said quietly i thought about about telling someone professor lupin maybe but i wasntsure even he d believe me he would have probably hermione thought dizzily but i suppose that not important i think it would have been a good thing to do she murmured blinking harry shoved the parchment into her hands even as she heard a few indignant yells from the kitchen hermione took a deep steadying breath before shaking her head to clear it ron put a hand to his face looking for one of the first times since she d known him almost like an adult the paper was in harry normally awful scrawl but she d grown more than used to reading it the truly hard thing to make out in actuality was the strange stilted way in which it was written she narrowed her eyes and concentrated willing her heart to stop beating so loudly even as she read chair and fire it said gardener eavesdropping snake hissing parseltongue ministry albania dead wyrm tail quidditch planning something murder hermione swayed slightly her mind whirling with the possibilities and the awful implications but nothing could have prepared her for the last two words avada kedavra harry was taking a deep breath watching her as she shook on the last two words that how it ended he said in a shaken voice it the only part i can clearly remember the green light at the end hermione felt her knees buckle she grabbed at the wall behind her but failed to find anything to hold to the parchment fluttered away as she hit the wood floor hard he picked it up quickly handing it to ron who was still sheet white but was now looking slightly more composed harry knelt down next to her but still refused to look at her you predicted this he said quietly it wasntan accusation but to her it held all the blame in the world we dontknow that she said back gasping i could ve just been sick that day hallucinating or something you did he said and this time it held a ring of finality to it that she found she couldntdispute he was probably about to say more but he was shortly interrupted in the worst way possible hermione she didntlook up but then she really didnthave to mrs weasley i not feeling well she said and it wasnta total lie i think i might need to go lie down for a bit harry got up from beside her slipping an arm behind her back and helping her up along the way hermione prayed only that she wouldntlook over at ron who was probably about to deteriorate into a similar condition harry took her up without a word she closed the door before he could say anything else feeling stunned and sick and any number of other things hermione walked over to her bed and sat down on it something poked into her side she picked it up and stared hard at it hermione picked up her pen and scribbled something down in the journal then she tore out the sheet folded it into quarters and joined it with the other in her pocket ginny woke her from a nap she hadntremembered taking when she came in to go to bed later that night hermione lay awake for half an hour staring at the wall and trying to feel lethargic again before she finally got up and tip toed out the door the folded papers slipped easily beneath the door and she thought only briefly of hedwig sleeping in her cage in harry and ron room before deciding it was too risky sirius would have to find out later 000000 hermione time to get up we re going it was still dark but she could see ginny tired face faintly etched in the blackness of their room she murmured something non committal but got up anyway she felt as though she d barely slept once dressed they met the rest downstairs and picked up a few thoughtfully made packed breakfasts a la mrs weasley fred was beaming at her george was looking uncharacteristically serious and unhappy nothing important happened yesterday ron said from behind her yawning we ve got nothing harry behind him made a quick strangled noise of disagreement no he said i thought of something last night you remember your mum gave me the newspaper to read and catch up ron turned around interested harry beckoned them in closer sirius black was spotted in albania recently he said seriously he has something to do with this i know it hermione felt a chill go down her spine i dontthink so she said hurriedly then cursed herself for being impulsive as they both turned to look at her curiously i just something seems wrong about it she finished lamely harry shrugged it perfectly logical to me but if you put your finger on it let me know hermione wanted to ask him about hedwig then but thought it might seem too conspicuous after their current line of conversation so she stayed silent as it turned out there really wasntmuch time for extra conversation mr weasley hustled them out of the house quickly and started up a brisk walk toward their portkey site normally hermione might have felt her strength taxed by such a strenuous walk especially with her lack of sleep but something about that morning was different her mind descended into a kind of trance and ron had to actually pull her back from walking past the discarded old boot in a haze once she stopped of course her legs began to burn someone was talking as she touched a finger to the boot but then there was a hook behind her navel and everything disappeared to be replaced by a vaguely misty plain and a voice that said seven past five from stoatshead hill ron made as though to pull her along the whole way strangely she let him green shamrocks badly dressed wizards turned muggles and giggling witches in the peripheral of her vision you going to help us with the tents hermione fred asked dad looking a bit too excited about putting them up if you catch my meaning she feeling sick harry interrupted quickly i ll do it no hermione murmured shaking her head a bit and realizing for the first time that this place was real and she was really truly taking all those steps with her own two feet i ll help out she said i feeling much better why was she so affected by this turn of events hermione wondered to herself as she hammered in a tent spike harry really ought to have been more disturbed but then she supposed he had already had two direct brushes with voldemort so the novelty of constant imminent danger to his life might have worn off the question that now plagued her mind of course was this was she more worried for harry or for sirius it was a sobering thought but it fled her mind as she realized with a blank expression that there were no more spikes to hammer in would you like to come with us to get water hermione ron asked she was surprised to hear a strange hopeful tint to his voice she opened her mouth to say yes to affirm their friendship to get more time alone with harry and ron to talk things out and figure out where to go from here but it occurred to her presently that if that happened she would have to finish her prior conversation with harry about her uncanny prediction no i think i ll help around here a little more she said weakly and if ron deflated just a little it was only something she noticed at the edge of her mind oh good hermione you can show us how to use these erm matches are they called mr weasley was once again looking energetic at the thought of learning a new muggle invention hermione realized belatedly that her decision was probably for the better anyway feeling a little more herself she exchanged a knowing glance with harry that said they were sharing the same thought mr weasley with matches maybe you should let me do that instead she said with a slight smile 000000 lunch brought with it the rest of the weasley clan percy quite officiously announced that he had just apparated while fred and george looked at him with envy and a little bit of disgust bill and charlie meanwhile dug in heartily hermione found she had to work fast to manage even a small portion of lunch before they demolished it entirely apparently slow eating didntrun in the weasley family in the meantime ludo bagman and barty crouch made appearances at their tent and mr weasley rose to greet them looking quite proud to be showing off his muggle know how with their tents harry doing mostly and muggle looking fire hermione s neither really seemed to notice but it didntput so much as a ding in his brightness even while he tried to convince bagman that absent minded bertha jorkins might need someone to go find her wherever she d disappeared off to at one point harry came back with three pairs of binoculars he corrected her quickly that they were omni oculars hermione even though i know they look perfectly muggle ron was already using his own pair to great effect in fact hermione was halfway convinced that he was using them to spy on the salem institute female students she herself decided to go and get all three of them programs honestly she sometimes wondered why she was the only one to think of the more useful things come on come on mr weasley was soon saying excitedly herding them all together in front of the tents the game about to start we dontwant to be late ron eyes lit up and even harry looked as though he was barely containing his enthusiasm but hermione reaction was slightly tempered for two reasons one she really wasnta very big quidditch fan though she found interest in the idea of watching the cup with her two best friends two she remembered that the malfoys would be sitting in the top box with them shattered moments by rurouni star to donahermurphy you are an evil evil woman stop giving me tangent ideas truly rurouni star chapter 4 the trouble at the quidditch cup dolendi modus timendi non item to suffering there is a limit to fearing none sir francis bacon on their way to the top box hermione thought of any number of reasons she might split off and go wait the game out in a bathroom somewhere but the truth of the matter was that she was quite stuck where she was because it would be stupid to make people worry just to stay away from malfoy besides there was a binding confidentiality charm on both of them so nothing dangerous would be said in front of other people probably her panic subsided only for a moment as they walked into the top box and she realized that none of the malfoys were there yet it returned as she remembered they would get there eventually to steady herself she opened her program and skimmed it through noting aloud that the mascots would be on soon ron seemed almost displeased that there would be any delay before the game itself but hermione had long since learned that what wizards considered boring and what she considered boring were two drastically different things therefore when lucius malfoy and his family walked in she was watching the field closely for any signs of mascots the voice behind her sly and carefully cultured jolted her from her observation hermione looked back to see draco malfoy father conversing pleasantly with a man she recognized with disgust the minister who had come to passively watch buckbeak die but oh lucius malfoy was sending poisonous glances at arthur weasley and at her she bit the inside of her cheek and pretended to look past him restraining the shudder of fear she felt at the idea that he might be mentally dissecting her checking her for dirty blood her eyes fell inevitably on draco who sneered at her as normal and as expected hermione found she was almost relieved that nothing had changed between them too many changes too quickly he made as though to walk over to her probably to say something snide but noticed belatedly the four weasleys still seated near her and not engaged in conversation with the minister and lucius fred george bill and charlie she had the strangest feeling that at least one of them was directing a warning glare malfoy way because he continued his motion only to stand beside his father prat someone muttered behind her she wasntquite sure who but she was very grateful nonetheless enlivened music from the stadium drew her attention once more and harry and ron sat back down next to her bulgaria mascots at least a score of pretty petite silver haired women marched onto the field tossing their locks imperiously and strutting about in the most ridiculous way they reminded her oddly of muggle cheerleaders hermione rolled her eyes and turned about to comment on this to harry who would probably understand the joke but she found herself thunderstruck as she watched him rise from his seat with glazed eyes to lean precariously over the edge of the box ron similarly was getting up looking as though he were contemplating some act of stupendous stupidity lucius malfoy and family seemed perfectly fine the minister was being calmly held back by one of the bulgarians their minister and ludo bagman was whooping and hollering in a way that made her wonder if he was really being affected or if he was simply like this all of the time bill from behind her snorted you might have to hold those two back hermione he said haventhad much experience with veela i guess feeling more than a little irritated at her best friends irrational behavior hermione leaned forward to catch the back of their shirts one in each hand they barely noticed as she hauled them back into their seats forcefully ron began tearing up his shamrocks harry grinned dumbly hermione decided she really didntlike veela look at that fred crowed our little ronniekins is drooling hermione felt her teeth bite down on the inside of her cheek a little too hard as she whirled about to glare at him i bet you did this at one point too fred he grinned and shrugged i got mercilessly mocked for it too so we re all pretty much even the music stopped then and she turned back around to give ron and harry severe looks but they were paying more attention to the second mascot showing which had just begun if it anything like those veela i officially leaving hermione thought darkly but no it wasntmore veela it was a very showy spectacle of leprachauns and gold showering down and quite a bit more nonsense it was pretty of course but hermione felt bad as she watched ron pay some debt to harry in leprachaun gold honestly even she knew better than that and she was muggle born hermione looked down at her little shamrock badge as the teams made their way out she looked up momentarily to see viktor krum whom ron had been unendingly idolizing since she d gotten to the burrow supposedly she was supporting ireland contemplating this concept she shrugged really it made very little difference to her who won but she supposed she could humor ron and harry this nonchalance vaporized as soon as she got into the game she screamed herself hoarse at the fourth irish goal because really the bulgarians didntstand a chance even if krum was good and they would never beat out ireland chasers at some point in the game the veela began dancing again thankfully though harry and ron seemed to have learned their lesson and were putting their hands over their ears fred still looked incredibly amused the end of the game was swift it seemed to end in a strangely unfinished way as krum snatched up the snitch and completed his team loss hermione found she rather admired him for it they left the top box crowing to each other about victory and lucky throws of the quaffle and how absolutely amazing viktor krum was as a player though hermione really drew the line there and went on to other subjects fred and george looked absolutely jubilant and even the malfoys last parting glare wasntenough to make hermione stop grinning like an idiot they argued far into the night about the game though hermione got lost in many of the intricacies and ended up just talking with ginny about their upcoming return to hogwarts and at some point she found herself woken hazily by ron who told her she d fallen asleep where she was and needed to get in her own bed she mumbled a hurried thank you and passed out in her bed proper not expecting to be woken again for hours slowly hermione slipped into dreams 000000 i wrote to sirius he coming to hogsmeade what but he ll be caught is he an idiot wyrm tail sounds like worm worm tail he just said kill the spare and there was this horrible green light constant vigilance and she was swirling around in circles being tossed about by the dust that had escaped her shattered glass can i really change anything she whispered perhaps his tired voice said and perhaps not but there is truly only one way to find out i give you my blessing miss granger hermione i wonder why her parents named her that not a few people have said that about your name sirius but still hermione hermione hermione hermione she woke with a start only half way dozing now that she thought of it ginny was shaking her in a panicked way come on hermione we have to get out of here something surged through her and she picked herself up out of bed in a smooth motion what happening she asked is someone hurt ginny looked small and frightened i dontknow she said i dontthink so yet but i think there will be soon come on girls let go you can talk after you re safe mr weasley voice coming from the other room hermione took charge as she was used to doing and grabbed at ginny hand she dragged them both out of there and was in turn hustled from the tent by mr weasley who was looking grim with his wand in his hand of course they would pick the world cup he muttered why wouldntthey after all hermione looked around her with wide eyes trying to adjust them to the dark she saw flashes of light there was laughter in the distance and ugly catcalls she moved a little to the side to where the tent wouldntblock her view anymore someone grabbed her by the hand and pulled her away she almost pulled back tried to see who it was but she recognized the hand somehow without looking at it george you see he said as he marched her off no common sense at all you havent any hermione hurried to keep up with him stumbling in the dark what are you talking about she hissed suddenly overly aware of the need for whispering though she still didntknow why he whirled about looking serious deatheaters hermione they re hunting up some muggles for fun and muggle born just as good she blanched at the word deatheater thinking of dark marks over houses and torture and death and everything else she d researched with her precious time after the divination scare you re not serious she told him in a shivery voice the deatheaters are gone they dissolved after voldemort she didntfinish because of course voldemort was not dead not anymore if he had ever been well apparently a few of them kept their stuff for special occasions george muttered he dragged her into the forest and wove them through the trees past a huddled group of gossiping american witches and a clearing where stan shunpike was avidly declaring himself in line for the position of minister of magic in front of a group of skeptical veela eventually and with no clear distinguishing reason he sat down behind a tree and pulled his wand hermione shivered but did the same where are the others she asked in a small voice george muttered something under his breath a shielding spell then said i think i saw fred with ginny perfect percy bill and charlie are all bound to be helping dad i didntcatch sight of ron or harry but they wonthave trouble hermione they re not muggle for some reason though it was the absolute truth hermione felt stung by his casual utterance of the fact that she was muggle though the fact that he d taken the trouble to get her away from it all tended to discourage the theory that he thought any less of her for it thank you she said quietly i guess i really dont have any common sense george sighed that not really true and you know it it hard to use common sense when you dontknow what you re dealing with his comment mollified her currently pitiful self esteem a little but she didntsay anything a horrendous bang from outside the forest made her clench her teeth george looked almost as though he wanted to go and help his father but a badly hidden glance her way stopped him cold he leaned back against his tree instead of getting up so why d you finish the equations he asked her hermione colored at the unexpected question and tried to ignore the panicked footfalls and jeering voices about them you wouldnthave been able to solve them on your own she told him they really went into arithmancy which is a completely different story than basic wizarding equations well yes he interrupted but why did you finish them fred seems to think you liked his business proposition but i not sold on that particular theory she bit her lip and wished not for the first time that she could be more honest about this she settled for a half truth i guess i feel like i owe you two something she said quietly i dontknow why maybe because you kept the slytherins off my back in second year so you decided to teach us how to break more rules george asked with a vague amusement but hermione felt her more somber side take hold when she said rules lost their value when they forced three children to take on voldemort by themselves george stared at her she smiled tightly as she remembered all the awful things she d seen that would soon come to pass there are more important things than a few school rules in this world friendship i think and making the most of what time we have the words sounded so much more dire in her own ears that she suddenly wished she could take them back subsequently george voice floated over to her softly i think that sort of a fatalistic view to take of the world i d rather have you trumpeting right will prevail again and lose the equations hermione drew her legs up to her chest and listened to the booming behind her it seemed to her that it was the literal manifestation of the breaking of her illusions one by one or all at once she wasntsure anymore am i depressing you she asked mildly george shrugged though how she knew this in the middle of the night she wasntsure not incredibly but you do have that sort of mellowing aspect to you tonight he was cracking jokes again the little bit of seriousness was over hermione rested her head on her knees then feeling the adrenaline draining from her system once more she was so very tired in so many different ways you know george started but she never got the chance to find out what it was he thought she knew because in the middle of his sentence there was a deafening crack that opened up the sky and the forest lit up in a sickly green way she felt she d seen before but wasntsure how or when hermione head shot up from where she d been dozing and she lost her breath a ghostly skull with a snake for a tongue it was floating in the air not very far at all from where they were sitting 000000 later she would reflect that there might have possibly been someone in the bushes that someone might have watched her go by with invisible eyes possibly watched george as well and taken note but at the time hermione was only aware that george was up and sprinting ahead and telling her to stay put for god sake she didntlisten naturally but her wand was out and she did cast quite a few protective spells on her way after him as she came upon the scene though hermione saw the last thing she might have ever expected harry and ron looking wide eyed and desperate in the middle of a circle of ministry wizards duck harry yelled as they raised their wands he didntwait for ron to comply but dragged him down with him as he hit the ground stupefy cried multiple people hermione eyes widened as she saw the streaks of red light rushing past the disoriented circle of wizards and racing into the dark get down she yelled possibly to george possibly to the aurors and possibly just to anyone in the area she didntknow if anyone had taken her advice but the ironic part was that something bright and hard hit her fully in the stomach and blew her from her feet hermione felt her brain stutter at the impact and saw dots appear before her eyes she was somewhat aware of a need to stay conscious to find out if harry and ron and george were all all right but she found it was much too hard to breathe the circle of wizards and the people inside it all faded to a smothering black 000000 what you were thinking attacking children of all things well someone fired off that dark mark what did you want us to stop and check before we took out a potentially dangerous threat and it didntregister that there were two of them and they were about a foot shorter than your usual wand height hermione groaned someone helped her up with a hand behind her back no one in their class had ever thrown curses like that not even harry although now that she thought about it the person that had thrown it was probably a professionally trained auror constant vigilance yes that suddenly remembering where she was who she was and what she was carrying hermione moved her hand to her neck and encountered a little golden chain she pulled on it a little ignoring her need to swoon back into unconsciousness and felt a reassuringly weighted whole hourglass hanging at the end you all right the voice splintered through her head like a thousand needles no she hissed stop talking she opened her eyes to see red hair freckles and narrowed brown eyes looking down at her harry and ron have been accosted for questioning george said with not a little disgust in his voice we re trying to straighten things out presently and the person that cast we dontknow he said shortly she struggled to rise to her feet he pulled her up from under the arms everything seems to be under control now he told her all the deatheaters apparated away at the dark mark not sure why but i sure those genius aurors have some kind of explanation on hand okay got it hermione muttered at him they re stupid please dontintroduce any more complicated concepts right now if you can help it well george said with dark amusement tingeing his voice we could go into discussion of verbal irony no thank you hermione ron said rushing over to them you got hit she blinked you didn t harry was following quickly i pulled us down they hit each other though and apparently you as well so what the verdict on the culprit george interjected quickly ron grimaced they think it was a bloody house elf of all things you remember winky up in the top box hermione tried to recall anything from the day before but failed miserably as her head pounded yeah george said confused you dontmean to tell me oh yes ron said that the theory winky took harry wand changed her voice and fired off the dark mark bonkers george said shaking his head hermione rubbed at her temples and tried to make sense of it all somehow though nothing fit together at all usually she would come up with at least some kind of possible explanation here now mr weasley was saying from above them let get back to the tent and join up with the rest you lot should probably get what sleep you can before we leave shattered moments by rurouni star mmm yes forgive me for feminizing hermione just a little i figured she was about at the age of puberty so while i probably wontbe going into any of the nastier details she will have a few emotional things going on you know girly stuff especially with her little age leap also questions answered to the best of my ability 1 hermione obviously recognized the spell it was a stunner but not only are the people throwing them professionally trained in their specific use she was probably hit by more than one and naturally she would know the counter protego but as she was overly focused on everyone else she didntuse it 2 rita skeeter didntfind out about the aurors attack on harry hermione and ron before and she heard nothing about the house elf so i going to have to assume everything she did come up with was based entirely on her own imagination her article is the same 3 i was thinking about letting you all wonder but no hermione does not come up with her spew idea not only has she been forced to grow up more quickly in this fic she is also incredibly busy and she did not personally witness the house elf problems 4 sirius unfortunately does not show up for a very very long while there letters though there letters 5 ron i um i tempted to just deflect this question but the truth is that i ve never been very good with ron as a character i dontunderstand his motivations a lot of the time even in the real books so i find it incredibly hard to write him as a consequence he probably going to get largely ignored in the future as well sorry 6 george ah george yes well i saying nothing chapter 5 interlude once they were back at the tent hermione insisted that she be fully filled in on the events she d missed before harry explained things in a low quiet tone during which time she learned about the house elf in the top box and her sacking she felt her lips grow dangerously thin as she listened that horrible she hissed what kind of a man can do that mr crouch percy interrupted at this point is a very respectable man he did what he felt he had to and personally i agree with him hermione was shocked at this idea from percy of all people and she told him so herself there followed quite a nasty fight about the treatment of house elves and the state of magical creatures in general it lasted far into the night and then to the morning at which point everyone else arose from their beds looking as though they d actually managed no sleep at all i dontbelieve him hermione gritted through her teeth as they packed up how can he be so utterly blind and and pompous we ve been trying to tell you for years said fred knowingly from behind her but you didntlisten and to think you wanted to be like him one day george added with an insufferable smirk hermione shot a deadly glare backward at the two of them but neither so much as blinked mr weasley interrupted their little altercation and told them he d managed to get them on the next portkey back possibly saving the twins from the grim fate hermione was cooking up in her mind she went back to assist ginny with her things the youngest weasley was something of a packrat packer and they made their way to the portkey area a very long worried line had gathered there right there arthur said a tired looking employee a few people in the line looked at them hostilely as they touched their fingers to the old rubber tire but no one said anything or if they did it was after they left they touched down feeling much heavier of spirit than they d left the walk home was utterly silent the arrival there however was quite noisy thank goodness mrs weasley rushed from the house looking incredibly relieved and engulfed the weasleys like a red haired tornado she murmured things along the lines of so worried and could have been killed mostly little fragments of sentences but all with the same breathy gasps of self reassurance we re fine mum bill said with something akin to amusement in his voice charlie with a bandaged cheek was more silent hermione noticed that his arms were tight about his mother and that he was whispering reassurances in her ear mortal peril mrs weasley cried and hermione as she walked dully inside the house looked up to the clock half expecting it to still be pointing straight upward but no it was currently reading home harry walked in behind her he went straight up the stairs to his room hermione shook her head once and thought about doing the same but the full gravity of the situation she d almost been in finally hit her and instead she sat down heavily in a chair in the empty kitchen her eyes drifted downward to the table top where lay open an issue of the daily prophet scenes of terror at the quidditch world cup her brow furrowed she focused on it and began to read several bodies removed from the woods she muttered to herself hermione blinked then felt a momentary shudder wrack her body as she imagined her own glassy eyes staring into nothing her skin blistered and torn by the spells deatheaters had once used dead he not dead he not she only barely remembered to breathe hermione choked on the air then pushed her chair away from the table feeling suddenly nauseous yeah rita skeeter quite the little conspiracy writer isntshe charlie unhappy voice from behind her startled hermione into stumbling back forward into the table she banged her shin on the chair and hissed in startled pain sorry he muttered she heard a slight grin in his voice as she sat back down pushing the paper away from her hermione turned around in the seat to look at him he had been looking over her shoulder she assumed but was now looking down at the floor with his hands in his pockets you mean the person that wrote this article hermione asked he nodded always coming up with things that dontexist charlie paused one of the best pieces of advice i can give you is to completely ignore anything she writes it all lies every last sentence hermione sighed and leaned back feeling slightly better i ve met people like that before dontworry she used a lot of little warning signals that showed it was fake charlie did grin now sharp hermione he said though she thought she heard a tiny note of good natured condescension in his voice even mother hasntfigured rita skeeter out yet hermione shrugged uncomfortably charlie rubbed at his forehead then blinked at her as though he d just realized something you haventslept have you shouldntyou get some sleep at this reminder hermione felt the weight of two very sleepless nights settle on her and she yawned widely yes i suppose i should she muttered well dontexpect to see me until tonight i guess she trudged up the stairs heavily blinking rapidly to keep herself awake along the way just as she was opening the door to her borrowed room she heard someone behind her and turned around fred and george were moving toward their own room up the stairs george stopped to regard her with a strange look as fred kept going er he seemed to grasp for words hermione didntblame him they were all much too tired to articulate above a third grade level you all right he asked finally she yawned again but smiled tiredly a little sleepy but otherwise perfectly fine hermione paused just for a second as she thought over the past night george she said uncomfortably thanks for getting me out of there i appreciate it the vision of what could have happened to her returned and she restrained the urge to say i appreciate it immensely i might have died like harry like fred like everyone else that will die george shrugged his eyes downcast yes well he said who else is going to make sure you lot dontgo and get yourselves killed hermione felt her breath catch in her throat at the thought dontever say that again she whispered unable to stop herself at his startled expression she added please he opened his mouth to speak hermione pretended not to see him and shut the door of her room behind her 000000 the next week passed very strangely for hermione on the one hand she desperately wanted to get back to hogwarts to safety and normalcy and her own dorm but on the other she felt strangely frightened at the thought of seeing malfoy and company every day again at some point she asked harry whether she might use hedwig for a few days he shrugged and said something along the lines of i donthave anyone i really have to owl so yeah if you can get her to that is hedwig was apparently very content with sitting in one place for a good amount of time it took hermione more than a few owl treats to coax her out oh please hedwig she asked with the most desperate expression she could manage quite desperate as it turned out hedwig gave what seemed to be a very resigned owlish sigh and nipped at her finger perhaps a bit harder than necessary hermione let out her breath in a relieved way and ran for her parchment and quill then stopped to chew on the end of it as she realized she hadnteven begun to contemplate what she was going to write she finally settled on a very simple note s dontknow if you re aware the quidditch world cup had a little riot of deatheaters not certain whether they re real or not everyone fine but i a little tired so this may be short she hesitated a moment before writing the next part she had quite a bit of experience with sirius quick reactions and to hell with thinking about it ideas eventually though she guiltily decided that he would want to know harry had some kind of dream about you know who he planning something well it might have been the world cup but i doubt it and he murdered someone or he will murder someone harry not certain hermione felt the sudden urge to confess how terrified she d been both at harry dream and at the world cup how utterly frightened and shivery she d felt and how much she d wanted to simply curl up in a corner and hide herself in a hole and never have to worry about people trying to hurt her or anyone else ever again how she d been knocked from her feet just moments later and come up feeling tired and nauseous but the impulse passed while her quill quivered over the page and instead she wrote the following ron was distraught at the news i think but he looking much better harry looks troubled but otherwise fine i think he trying to remember more but dumbledore might want to know what he has come up with would it be possible for you to let him know or should i tell him i d rather not i think it seems wrong for me to tell anyone else about harry perhaps i will see you at hogwarts i hope so regards h she wasntentirely sure what had made her tack on the last part once she gave the letter to hedwig who eyed her unhappily before flapping away she felt an unaccountable terror that he might take it the wrong way what wrong way he might take it she wasntcertain but the feeling was there nonetheless if she could call back hedwig and scratch it out she had a feeling she might one day while hermione was sitting at the window waiting for an answer and worrying mrs weasley knocked at her door and brought in her things from diagon alley she mentioned something about dress robes and said that hermione were absolutely beautiful and if she were fourteen again she might wear them herself hermione thanked her and thought inwardly in a strangely fierce way almost fifteen but when she looked through the bags and found the dress all such thoughts fled her they were beautiful and oh they were her favorite color blue a shimmery floaty gorgeous blue later that night when ginny came in hermione asked her blushingly whether she might help her try the robes on maybe do something with her hair and see how everything looked ginny obligingly gushed over the idea and helped her dress even twisted her hair into a bun it took an hour of effort and hermione let her know that she was eternally grateful then added just a hint of blush to her cheeks you look amazing hermione ginny managed looking shocked no really come over here and look hermione expected that she was exaggerating things of course but nothing could have prepared her for what she saw in the mirror there was a woman there an adult hermione granger scraggly hair pulled from her eyes her eyes they were so pretty when the hair wasntin front of them and apparently blue really did suit her because the dress was accentuating curves she didntknow she had oh ginny hermione said in a voice thick with something inexplicable i i look amazing ginny finished sounding satisfied i told you oh just wait until harry and ron get a look at you their expressions she trailed off as though suddenly thinking of something hermione turned around to see ginny blushing furiously do you do you think we could do me next ginny asked hopefully i know it probably wontmake much of a difference but hermione hastened to reassure her that she would look very nice in her dress robes she spent the rest of the night doing all of the girlish things she d ever imagined she might stomach and actually enjoying them as they turned ginny into something quite different from her normal self then botched her makeup and turned her into a clown hermione apologized profusely but ginny merely laughed and said that she just needed a little more practice with makeup as hermione took off her dress robes and folded them carefully into her trunk finally getting around to packing it as she was supposed to have done much earlier ginny confided to her that her mother had said something about how ginny may or may not end up actually using her robes that night when hermione slid into bed tiredly she began to wonder how sirius might react he d always made it a game of teasing her about her age but with that dress on when she woke up in the morning to a tapping at her window the question was still stewing in her mind shattered moments by rurouni star well wasntgoing to have this upcoming h g moment in here but bik was having a bad day and she needed cheering stuff so yes here also very very very very good reasons that i have been too busy to post and they are reasons i really not ever going to share so you ll just have to believe me chapter 6 return to hogwarts a man homeland is wherever he prospers aristophanes h the letter read of course i heard about the world cup it hard not to it publicized just about everywhere in the wizarding world at the moment though obviously i canttell you exactly where i am more importantly are you sure you re all right and harry he not hurt at all hermione tried not to be too exasperated with sirius as she read the letter she d already emphasized that everyone was perfectly fine dumbledore is now aware of harry dream i surprised he didntowl someone himself i d really like to hear about these kinds of things earlier from now on could you possibly get him to send something to moony next time again she felt slightly irritated at the fact that she d already told harry something of the sort she wasntsure why she was irritated that sirius had had the same idea but maybe it was more the fact that he hadntgiven her credit for already thinking of it and you re sure you re all right she rolled her eyes just checking for god sake try to stay out of trouble from now on dumbledore been hinting something interesting is going to happen at hogwarts and i not entirely comfortable with his idea of interesting in point of fact keep harry out of it too whatever it is he has a knack for getting into these things and while officially i going to be somewhere south of the equator this year i hope you ll forgive me if i defy expectations and stop by for a while sometime s hermione remembered suddenly that he d been spotted in albania had that been a trick or had he really been there right near where harry dream had mentioned she frowned and absently tore the letter into pieces 000000 in what seemed like no time at all she was being woken up again and pushed out the door with a bit of breakfast and a packed sandwich they took a taxi to the train station this time the poor poor driver and hermione felt surreal as she found herself once again looking at the hogwarts express hurry up dear mrs weasley was gasping to one of her children do write every once in a while charlie grinned at ginny as he gave her a last hug goodbye i might be seeing you all sooner than you think he said with a wink sort of wish i were back at hogwarts this year bill muttered wistfully while ginny pulled a confused face fred turned to look at him with an unhappy expression why wontanyone tell us what that means he asked frustratedly bill chuckled oh dontworry about it it ll be a nice surprise hermione decided not to get involved honestly she rather doubted she could handle many more surprises fred and ron sulked on their way into the train with near identical expressions george looked like he was trying a little too hard not to be amused they took a compartment together this time the summer had been a little overwhelming and she had the feeling they were grouping together for comfort harry slid into the seat beside her while ginny closed the door it isntfair ron complained plopping himself down on the floor in front of her and crossing his legs you can say that again fred muttered they ve been hinting about it all summer oh you ll find out soon i would guess hermione said comfortingly patting ron on the head bill and charlie wouldntget you all excited over something that ll happen half a year from now ron pulled his head back to make a face at her percy would hermione tried very hard not to laugh at his awkward position but a few giggles escaped her control and then the compartment door opened well well look what we have here hermione snapped her head around to stare at the pale pointed face that was surveying their car with disgust i really do pity you weasels malfoy said with a grimace on his face having to share a single compartment and look this must be the trash car you ve also got the potty and the mudblo hermione blinked as a violent flash of light burst through the car as her eyes began to clear she saw that malfoy had disappeared where he d once stood crabbe and goyle were looking through air blinking harry and ron both had their wands out but she hadntheard a word from either hermione looked about in confusion george and ginny were staring at each other in surprise the next instant invariably everyone found themselves staring at the malfoy on the floor huh that looks nasty ron commented very little concern in his voice yeah said ginny who d have thought straw bind and fungus curse naturally crabbe and goyle were moving into the car now hermione found herself stuck in a corner as the already cramped compartment admitted two more bulky people someone threw a punch at goyle she couldntsee who from here and someone else elbow dug into her rib a crack and a yelp alerted her that someone had probably broken their nose oh for heaven sake she muttered as harry stepped backward into her she pulled her wand and swished it through the air a few times feeling awful about breaking the rules as she did so mcgonagall would be so disappointed in her for getting into a fight a hiss of air and a pair of screams resounded through their little room the next instant the train door was closed and she heard hurried footsteps retreating back through the train hermione sat down heavily as she turned back around to face the center she noticed that harry was rubbing at his arm and george was grinning widely through the blood that ran down his face fred was looking at him funnily we could ve just fed him a toffee he said and avoided the whole fight thing george shrugged and replaced his wand in his robe pocket he lifted up his head and pinched his fingers about his nose ginny handed him a handkerchief it was worth it he replied more satisfying then with a grin although we can still feed him a toffee too hermione blinked and pushed her hand into her pocket where she d put the candy fred had given her she d figured it was silly to pack it in a suitcase when it was so small she thought now that maybe it might be a nice thing to keep around just in case of course as she was currently envisioning some horrid demise for malfoy in case would probably end up turning into in case malfoy showed up ron moved to check ginny and hermione feeling somewhat obligated told george that he really ought to hold himself forward instead of looking up so he didntmake himself sick oh come on he said waving his hand i know what i doing as he let go of his nose though a trickle of blood escaped his nose at her sardonically raised eyebrow he dropped his head back to eye level hermione stowed her own wand and pulled out a book to read 000000 after the train arrival on the school grounds the group exited their compartment together ron looking around eagerly for malfoy to see him publicly humiliated by his condition unfortunately he wasntable to catch sight of him because a miserable hazy gray drizzle had begun and was obscuring all other students but on the up side george nose had stopped bleeding alrigh into the carriages with yeh older ones hagrid voice boomed over the crowd firs years over here harry looked over at hagrid with disappointment obviously he d wanted to say hello but because of the rain the students were being rushed through to the castle you ll get to see him during the feast surely hermione offered sympathetically he shrugged but looked much more cheerful as he caught sight of the warm dry horseless carriages headed their way ron grabbed hold of one of hermione and harry arms each and made a run for one hermione opened her mouth to scold him playfully but stopped as something flickered at the edge of her vision i can see every single damn one now do you know what that like she gaped eyes wide as ron dragged her into the carriage triumphantly because for just an instant she could have sworn but no that was impossible the horseless carriages were horseless hermione harry voice cut through her thoughts are you all right she blinked then shook her head i m fine i just thought i saw something strange for a minute ron snorted wiping his face with the hem of his robes what malfoy not being a git or were you talking about something a little less unlikely this led ultimately to discussion of what had happened on the train and from there it degenerated into insults and spells they d each like to throw at malfoy at the point where ron muttered body twisting hex the carriage stopped hermione shivered as they stepped down from the carriage she swung her head to look at the front where a normal carriage might have horses there was nothing her hand clenched at the timeturner beneath her robes and she silently cursed it knowing it had something to do with the strange vision such a horrible place to live i wish i could just go back in time hermione let go of the timeturner as though it were scalding she realized with not a little bit of fright that she was beginning to agree with herself just as this disturbing thought hit her something else did as well specifically a water balloon peeves mcgonagall voice roared hermione saw her shaking her fist at the ghost glasses askew on her face with one hand on the wall to keep her from falling the poltergeist cackled and threw a few more water balloons while hermione shook herself off under the entryway shivering unhappily come on we ll get you some hot chocolate harry offered dodging another water balloon himself i sure the feast hall will have some as they worked their way through the crowd of students and into the great hall hermione remembered she was a witch she dried herself off with her wand irritably then repeated the gesture at her bewildered pair of friends ron particularly guilty expression cued her to the fact that he thought he ought to know the charm but had probably not been listening in class when it was taught truthfully it was on this coming year curriculum hermione had looked over it religiously the week before ah harry she started at the familiar voice and turned to see of all people dear old professor lupin striding toward them immediately she picked up on a few differences he was just a little less tired a little more enthusiastic hermione found herself wondering if he d seen sirius at all over the summer professor harry greeted back looking much happier now so you did make it back lupin smiled as he stopped in front of the three of them yes it would seem so professor trelawny has been casting aspersions on how long i ll last however hermione made a face at the mention of one of her least favorite professors but said nothing on the subject it seemed to draw lupin attention to her however and how have you been hermione he asked graciously i do hope you had a nice summer she thought back on the attacks at the world cup and felt her enthusiasm at being back at hogwarts diminish somewhat it was certainly eventful she said evasively knowing he had probably gotten the whole story anyway lupin turned to ron now and i assume you ve finished your defense against the dark arts homework over the summer mr weasley he asked eyes dancing in amusement ron coughed and looked at the table in front of him of course meaning he would start it that very night lupin looked past him suddenly the doors of the great hall had opened and hermione turned her head to see a line of very wet ragged looking first years file in one was nearly lost in the sea that was hagrid moleskin coat the professor winked that my cue to go sit down he said i ll see you all in class very soon as he walked back to the front of the room hermione realized that the seats at the tables were being very quickly taken she urged harry and ron onward to find a spot near the rest of the weasleys ginny waved her over enthusiastically and she ended up sitting sandwiched between her and harry fred and george across from them were planning something between them their voices just barely audible over the loud chatter in the hall hermione decided she really didntwant to know what they were planning even and especially if it was going to involve her she turned her attention to george now wondering vaguely what he d managed to figure out over the course of the summer he was much more intelligent than she d once given him credit for or perhaps it wasntthat he was more intelligent than fred but more applied fred could probably care less if she was housing a murderer as long as she fixed his formulae just as it hit her that that had been a very unfair thought hermione realized that she knew which one fred was her eyes narrowed and she tried to think back to when exactly she d been able to tell the difference between them hermione ron hissed poking her shoulder from across harry are you paying attention at all she blinked then realized that the sorting hat had not only finished its song but also sorted most of the first years out by now she caught the tail end a whitby kevin in hufflepuff but turned back to stare at the table cloth her chin balanced on her twined fingers dumbledore was saying something behind her but she didnthear the words something was wrong had been wrong and she didntknow what it was well you heard the man tuck in ron was saying cheerfully hermione snapped from her trance and looked up at the appearing food oh leave me at least one bread roll she complained at the two boys to her right moving to grab one for herself 000000 as soon as the large congregation of students finished their meals the food was whisked away and dumbledore stood once more hermione normally paid due attention to him she didntknow why she was having so much trouble doing it tonight thank god the dementors are gone proper now ron muttered beside her but she paid it surprisingly little attention she felt strange as though she were supposed to be doing something but wasntsure what it was what ron hissed in surprise she blinked and turned her attention back to the speech only to see that harry too was gripping the table edge with white knuckles cancel quidditch george said in a shocked voice he wouldn t said fred dumbledore however was smiling it is my very great pleasure to inform you that the triwizard tournament will be taking place at hogwarts this year he said eyes twinkling you re joking fred burst out perhaps a little too loudly dumbledore smile didntwaver i am not joking mr weasley he said but the rest was drowned out by ron hurried whispers to harry which hermione shamelessly eavesdropped on triwizard tournament harry do you think he serious harry looked unabashedly confused er ron he said the red headed boy blinked before an expression of understanding dawned on his face oh right three champions different schools but it big prize money harry can you imagine winning it it was at that moment hermione got a very bad feeling about what was to come shattered moments by rurouni star questions questions 1 again i repeat myself sirius is a ways away but there are letters and when he does get here he is every bit as fun as you might imagine things will get intense in about 7 chapters or so 2 ginny is a teen girl but she been fairly well raised i just cantsee her as a frothing omg harry mine and lolz arnti pretty 11 idiot i just got a vision in my head and i shutting up now 3 remus never got exposed therefore hogwarts p as for your other questions see below 4 barty crouch may or may not make an appearance maybe he already has or maybe i just playing with your mind psych 5 as i said before george is an important part of this story he ll be in it a lot in what ways you ll just have to wait and find out 6 age wise i was really confuzzled at about 3 am when i figured it all out sorry it sixteen then i ll see about changing it at some point when i have the time 7 triwizard tournament read 8 kidnapping bah it been done therefore i may do it anyway and just twist it around a bit p 9 alas i too have a love for almostredeemed malfoy that particular variation of him will probably be making at least one more appearance and then some chapter 7 the unforgivables education is the ability to listen to almost anything without losing your temper or your self confidence robert frost once in her dormitory hermione should have slept well she was back in her normal bed in the school she loved with the people she cared about instead she spent the night worrying about the tournament about sirius and voldemort and harry and every possible thing that could creep into her mind the result unfortunately was that she got very little sleep her dreams such as they were were convoluted and confusing harry running from some unknown spectre and into the arms of a murderer ron standing off to the side unconcerned as he died fred and blood from somewhere she wasntsure and then a loud siren wailing their doom to the world hermione gasped awake and realized it was her alarm clock and that it had been going off for about twenty minutes it was not an auspicious start to her school year to wake up late despite this she managed somehow to get herself dressed and preened and even to grab a slice of toast on the way to getting her new schedule it worried her that she hadnthad much of a chance to look it over but as it turned out her first day was fairly easy hermione hurried over to the fourth year greenhouse relieved she wouldnthave to time turn until arithmancy after lunch 000000 she neednthave worried about her first day it turned out to be fairly interesting and neither of her first two classes gave homework but though her schoolwork was less than usual her stress level was well beyond normal she toyed with the idea of going to the library to research a few important things but decided against it as she remembered the room behind the wall for some reason the idea of visiting it very much appealed to her at the moment she turned about sharply on her heel hugging her books to her chest and looking about quickly for people in the corridor before making a beeline for the moving staircases after skipping a trick step and jumping a small gap between two finicky staircases she found herself staring at the solid stone wall her heart strangely was flip flopping in her stomach perhaps because it seemed so unreal to finally be back at the place she d left so long ago and finally surreally her hand reached out to brush the cold stone and she whispered the word patesco the cold feel of the rock was still there but as she hesitantly pressed her palm forward into it the wall fell away before her hermione stepped inside slowly not certain what exactly to expect she found herself unbearably disappointed it was dark completely so the kind of darkness that hadntbeen disturbed for months and as she lit her wand gently she saw that it was very dusty as the house elves hadntcleaned it a bit not knowing it existed naturally hermione walked over to the couch and sat down heavily feeling suddenly lost though she knew it was better that sirius remain where he was perhaps she d been hoping for his familiar presence it was comforting after all to know there was always someone to ask questions of someone to put things together for her someone that didnttalk down to her not anymore and someone that knew how to take care of dangerous things hermione sighed and buried her face in her hands tiredly since when had she become so reliant on sirius black probably since he d first shown up since there had first been things she d felt she couldnthandle on her own because the previous year had come with the realization that those things did indeed exist for just a short amount of time she allowed herself to sit on the couch and brood but eventually she realized it wasntat all like her and she decided to do something useful hermione rolled up her sleeves and looked around the room stripped of the necessities it had once held if sirius black did come back he would have a welcoming place to stay 000000 hermione discovered to her great unhappiness that snape was in rare form to teach potions that was to say he was worse that usual after he docked harry ten points for a bad potion and sneered at her for being in his words disgustingly arrogant she decided it had something to do with lupin continued presence at the school and his failure once again to secure the dark arts job hermione was therefore feeling quite ready to go to lupin next class as thursday defense against the dark arts class approached she would retract that mental statement before the end of said class as they filed inside she caught sight of harry and ron at their old desks hermione slid into her own beside them wondering where the professor was i ve heard this first class is interesting ron said excitedly i guess he must ve decided to start us out with a bang harry grinned and hermione remembered how well he d done on the last year exam defense against the dark arts at least when lupin taught it was harry favorite class the so named man walked down into the classroom from his office then and hermione felt her own growing excitement drain away slowly it was hard to put her finger on the feeling but she had the idea that he was not looking forward to teaching this coming lesson near as much as the students were looking forward to learning it please put your wands away for today he said ron looked disappointed but harry complied quickly his eyes never leaving the professor hermione felt a drop in her stomach like a lead weight i am not certain what you all have heard about what you are going to learn he said quietly but it is not something i derive any pleasure from teaching and before we start i must impress upon you its importance ron was looking almost crestfallen at this point hermione was certain he was anticipating bookwork what i am about to show you is not a circus show it is not something to be gawked at or laughed at do you understand me hermione was one of the first to tentatively nod her head when the rest of the class saw that he was actually awaiting a response they did so as well what do you think he talking about asked ron sounding slightly frustrated now hermione hushed him a trembling memory coming to the forefront last year this class had to be caught up on magical creatures as a result i afraid your awareness of curses and hexes has suffered i will be showing you how to use and block these but today you will be learning about three in particular that you will never use his eyes settled on hermione and she noticed that they were very very tired for some reason they made her remember avada kedavra imperius and cruciatus the unforgivables and one of them had been used on her she began to shake as she thought of what he d said he was going to show them why was he going to show them if any of you have any qualms whatsoever with witnessing the unforgivables you are hereby allowed to leave for a short study hall he said quietly confirming her suspicions metal scratched against tile and she somehow knew how that neville longbottom had just fled the room lupin closed his eyes wearily and she noticed that his right hand was flexing as though he wished to rub at his temple with it who can tell me the three unforgivables he asked in his soft voice hermione shuddered as she anticipated the answer but silence reigned in the room she realized with foreboding that no one knew cruciatus she said quaveringly in a voice barely audible she didntbother to raise her hand oh dontworry no one will think anything of your screams you see this place is supposed to be haunted lupin looked at her with a pained expression on his face imperius oh dear my shoes are seeming slightly dirty perhaps you should shine them like a good little mudblood what are you doing a panicked familiar voice one that was familiar but how did she know it you can t dumbledore you ll go to azkaban it seemed wrong and she frowned because the imperius had never been used on her but she so clearly remembered there was floating and then pain as she resisted the third miss granger lupin said though she saw that it was costing him much to do so she shoved aside the misplaced memory and looked up with a taut expression avada kedavra she whispered green light fractured glasses and pale green skin so very cold hermione became aware that the whole class was now staring at her it wasntanything new whenever she answered a particularly obscure question it happened but ron and harry in particular were looking concerned lupin ran his hand through his hair and sighed ten points to gryffindor he said hollowly and then he walked over to his desk to pull out a jar with a tiny spider struggling inside it may i be excused hermione asked suddenly feeling sick she knew what those curses could do she didntneed to see them not again lupin waved a hand weakly and she bolted out the door suddenly more than anything else hermione wished that sirius black was there and as she raced through the halls a room firm in mind and a cool darkness awaiting her she noticed the obstacle in her path too late there was a sharp collision a gasp of exhaled breath she hit the ground full on her back her bag skittering away toward the wall and heard someone mutter a curse would you watch where you re hermione leave me alone she said in a small voice knowing before she looked staring at a blossoming bruise upon her knee what wrong george said she knew it was him how she knew was still a mystery and not at all important at the moment leave me alone she repeated getting to her feet she wanted to pick up her bag and go to the dark enclosed room and stay there until sirius reappeared she wanted to ask him why lupin thought it was necessary to not only teach them what the curses were but show them why he would do it if he hated the thought so very much she could feel the pain still unbearable wrenching brutal pain the kind she d never before felt and had thought she never would again but then he d recast the spell and afterward she d felt she might let herself die with the scent of sirius about her and never let it hurt so badly ever again hermione realized she was breathing shallowly holding back tears george hands moved to her shoulders and she felt herself sway slightly i feeling sick she somehow managed professor lupin let me leave sometimes she felt she had lied her whole life oh george said and she thought he sounded slightly disappointed so you didntget to see the lesson hermione choked her arms moving to clasp together and she felt her knees buckle george moved with her catching her so you really are sick he said sounding amazed usually they re faking but i guess you wouldntdo that would you get to see the lesson she asked in a high voice ignoring him why why would i want to see that george looked confused as she brought her eyes to his face we re talking about the same thing right he asked i know lupin said he was going to show all the years but seventh because they d already the unforgivables she said hoarsely ripping herself from his grasp yes he stared at her for a moment as though trying to make sense of the situation he seemed to come up blank too confused to understand her do you want me to take you to the hospital wing he asked her carefully she turned on her heel and picked up her bag head down and before he could say another word she began to stride away where to she wasntsure but it would very certainly be somewhere far away from george weasley 000000 when hermione made her way back to the commonroom later that night the first very welcome sight she came upon was harry and ron making up dire predictions for their divination homework ron looked up as hermione walked carefully over her bag slung over her shoulder hermione he said sounding surprised hey sorry you had to run did you throw up or something you missed the lesson i didntwant to see it she said sharply ron looked immediately chagrined i wasntsuggesting you did he offered uneasily it just you never miss class unless you can help it fred and george were sitting across the room they had stopped talking but she saw them now out of the corner of her eye dontworry about it harry said in a low voice we understand she realized belatedly that he too had had very good reasons to not want to watch the demonstration oh harry she said weakly i so sorry i didntthink to warn you dontworry her friend sighed i think i had to see it there are just some things you have to do to really understand ron looked away toward the floor and hermione had the feeling that he d already had this conversation with harry perhaps not really understanding at first but ron was like that more importantly he was always very contrite and understanding after the fact hey hermione fred called you see george on your way out of class mcgonagall sent him out she was furious it was your dung bomb george said sourly but hermione knew without turning around that he was looking straight at her i going to do my homework in my dormitory she said quietly i ll feel better after i done probably she trudged up the stairs without another word shattered moments by rurouni star answers to the people what ask the questions 1 i probably shouldnteven bother answering this but eh not all fanfiction deals with the main character gasp shock and actually a great deal of it doesnteven mention harry potter i going to take this to mean you just haventread a lot of it 2 you ll find the answer to the malfoy memory question this chapter like that isntgiving anything away 3 hermione would hardly know if any other order members knew she doesnteven really know about the order yet after all and as it from her point of view neither do you 4 hermione independently researched a little wizarding law and dumbledore later said they would do their best that about all the plan entails though nnngh i want to say more here we go strap yourselves in tightly and keep all arms and legs inside the vehicle though you can always stick your head out chapter 8 imperio remember when life path is steep to keep your mind even horace over the next few weeks hermione noticed quite keenly that george was avoiding her she didntblame him but at the same time she felt an awful disappointment in him for some reason perhaps because of his father position she d expected him to understand what the curses really were the kind of people that used them the bright spot in these bleak and furiously busy days though was arithmancy her teacher had brightly informed her the first day that she unlike the other students would have an entire extra year to prepare for her owls she would be allowed to take them her fifth year as usual but would have the special advantage of being a year ahead this inspired a feverish need in hermione to do well in the class even beyond her normal appetite for learning and harry and ron began complaining that she was spending too much time studying she may have said something slightly waspish to ron at that but she assured herself afterward that it was for a good cause and then just as she was settling into a routine of ignoring george ignoring sirius and ignoring everything but her schoolwork she was disrupted because when lupin came into class with the same tired expression she knew today he said quietly his hands clenched white on the railing of the stairs i will be putting you each under the imperius curse hermione clenched her hands in her lap tightly that illegal she said without looking up lupin smiled tightly yes it would be normally but it has been decided that you should know what it feels like and what its signs are therefore i will be asking you all to watch your fellow students as they are commanded to perform everyday things there will be a foot and a half tonight on the signs of the curse a few groans arose about the room but hermione could still feel the palpable excitement at the idea of getting to try something so forbidden couldntthey see what this meant or even what it was doing to their teacher to have to show them lupin was kneeling at her desk now hands on the edge i will understand if you wish not to do this he said gently if i could i myself would leave but hermione felt something inside her stiffen irrationally harry staring blankly green tinted harry unmoving and bleeding and dead no she said hoping she sounded more confident than she felt no i i have to do this lupin sighed and rose to his feet once more calling the class to attention and then the lesson began dean thomas spun around exactly three times counter clockwise and then three more clockwise he sat down looking puzzled and slightly disturbed lavender brown climbed atop a desk and jumped off of it nimbly neville began reciting what was unmistakably a shakespearean sonnet and then harry lupin said quietly sounding uncertain hermione watched him get up slowly out of the corner of her eye he seemed grim and somehow determined she watched with horrified fascination as lupin resignedly pointed his wand at his best friend son and said imperio would you please raise your right hand in the air harry lupin asked softly harry hesitated his right hand twitched i asked you to please raise your right hand lupin repeated hermione could tell he thought that harry couldnthear him which was ridiculous of course because the commands were partially mental harry hand twitched again but he didntmove it the class had begun to stare at him incredulous dean eyes opened wide in amazement he let out a low whistle as lupin repeated himself once again harry arm made a strange jerking motion but only ended up swinging around to grab at a desk lupin let his wand fall away and hermione saw that he was looking even more haggard and gray than usual a very good job harry he said though his eyes were sad ten points to gryffindor hermione watched her friend sit down exertion evident on his face and wondered why she was so certain he d just worked harder to dispel lupin influence than he d done in his life hermione lupin said then and again he hesitated are you quite sure you want to do this in answer she rose from her seat and walked slowly toward the center of the room she focused her eyes on his wand and said nothing imperio the word resounded through her head a clear resonant sound that struck at her very soul but it was infinitely more gentle this time as though the man that had uttered it cared only to see that she was listening this time a content floating feeling one she had felt before would you please walk over to harry desk hermione she felt the urge to do just that take her and why not he d asked politely and she knew him he was a very nice person no there was a reason she was fighting she was sure of it hermione mentally declined politely but firmly walk over to harry desk hermione hermione tried to shake her head but found it was all she could do to stay still her muscles trembled go to his desk to harry was the implied meaning to where he was sitting watching her with clouded eyes but harry is dead no she said no and suddenly there was a sharp pain in her knees and she was gasping on the floor facing harry desk her palms touching the cold stone no one is certain what criteria distinguish those able to resist the imperius curse lupin said sounding incredibly drained but i suppose i have to stress that this class seems unusually resistant to it most victims will not even put up a fight hermione breathed deeply eyes unfocused thinking of the flash of heart wrenching fear and denial she d felt people who have been under the curse before she rasped they also have some resistance lupin looked at her sharply though most of the class was probably disgruntled at the fact that she was still calling out facts yes he said over time and prolonged exposure people do gain resistance one of the most obvious signs that a victim is fighting the curse is muscle spasms as you must have noticed though these usually occur after at least two weeks it had been a good while since her last flight from the class but hermione said may i please be excused professor and again he let her go hermione stumbled away as far away as she could and she remembered it was hard at first to access the memory it was fuzzy and distorted and she couldntsee the details but the seal had broken some other part of her had rebelled the same part that pushed away the imperius the same part that screamed over and over that harry and fred were dead she leaned against the same wall in the same hallway she slid down it slowly and put her face in her hands and cried i have so many memories in me she thought desperately so many different things that might be true and might have happened and might still happen and she understood it all and it was so frightening because dumbledore knew and sirius knew and lupin knew that voldemort was going to come back or was back and that the war would start all over again they were preparing them the only way they knew how but i know something in her said i know already and it doesntmake a difference at all those feelings were for another time they were lost and afraid and desperately aimless but now all she felt was betrayed hermione got back to her feet and walked to the owlery to write a letter 000000 when harry asked her later if she was all right she told him she had used hedwig is that okay she asked serenely he was confused but he nodded slowly hermione he said you dontseem all right lately she sighed i not really but how all right am i supposed to be with everything that been happening harry seemed to take this into consideration as she sat down with him to study for just a little while she let herself believe that nothing was changing at all and that she could do her schoolwork and go to bed like a normal sane person her dreams that night disagreed he was watching the hat at the center of the room she could tell he was nervous his name was so close to the beginning and his house was so predefined he couldntbe anything but nervous she felt the need to clamp a steadying hand on his shoulder before she remembered she couldn t black sirius he realized it was him only a moment too late one of the people behind him pushed him forward pale blond hair no that was preposterous he was seated on the stool the hat slipped over his head and suddenly hermione could hear the voice in his head a little whisper in her own ear it gave her shivers to remember how horribly frightened she d been at her own sorting well well the hat said you re a bit of a black sheep arentyou the boy frowned even through his nervousness that a really bad pun you know he said the hat chuckled it not the last time you ll hear it either especially if you go where i want to place you she walked closer to him knelt before the stool amazed at how utterly small and insignificant this person before her seemed where where is that he whispered back she had the distinct impression the hat was smiling why gryffindor of course sirius black at eleven years of age stiffened on the stool a young mcgonagall nearby watched with a tapping foot and obvious frown she thought she knew where he was going where the rest of his family had gone and where he would end up too hermione wanted to tell her she was wrong and at the same time felt the oddest urge to tell the hat to just put him there instead but of course it couldnthear her you you cantbe serious he managed i usually quite serious when it comes to sorting the hat said back you know you ve got quite a bit of potential for gryffindor godric would have loved you brash defiant courageous the prime example but my family it all depends i suppose the hat continued if you re brave enough to try you re brave enough to be in it otherwise we might still put you in slytherin with the snakes the boy mouth thinned to a line and hermione realized that she was watching a defining moment in his life i yes i think i ought to go in gryffindor if that all right quite right my boy quite right well in that case it ll have to be gryffindor hermione woke with an uneasy knot in her stomach the day proceeded well though and the dream was forgotten in a flurry of other things as the weeks passed she found only one reason she might be feeling so edgy hedwig had returned but she was not carrying any letters
