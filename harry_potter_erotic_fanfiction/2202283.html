mum i answered my father laughed what does it matter now acantha her trunk already onboard and the train leaves in a quarter of an hour there no time to get anything else i could apparate there she began to say noting my father frown i interrupted i ve got it all mum no worries all right then dearie my mother replied wiping away a tear and then to my father what house do you think she ll be in bryan gryffindor of course he said heartily just like her father i grinned i had been brought up on gryffindor with a hint of ravenclaw and i knew which i d be unless of course you dontwork darling my mother cautioned with a smile then you ll be placed in hufflepuff i ll work i promised but i ve got to go i donthave much time left my parents nodded and the three of us hugged tightly they waved to me as i ran onto the train and into the nearest compartment its only occupant was a blonde girl with a pile of brightly covered books she sat next to the window watching the people milling about the station hi i said to her do you mind if i sit here no go ahead i lyra wood it my first year how about you lydia carmichael first year i replied sitting down across from her my parents are just under that lamp talking to those two guys is that your dad the white haired one those are my dads he talking to how old is he almost forty he and my mum are the same age but they dontlook it at all do they when she shook her head i continued why do you have two dads anyway what happened to your mum i donthave a mum she said matter of factly my dads are married oh cool i replied lyra pulled out a thick book and began to read and i stared out the window as the train pulled out of the station the two of us were silent until the trolley rolled by anything to eat girls the plump smiling woman asked us we both nodded and together managed to buy half the cart we ate in contented silence for a while and i opened a chocolate frog oh jadis again this ll be the third one of her i ve gotten i donthave her yet i ve everyone else though lyra said quietly you want mine oh could i yeah go ahead i replied with a shrug handing it over she grinned at me i dontknow what to give you in return i understood her dilemma we were both well brought up witches we had been taught to always repay debts as quickly as possible for they collected interest i dontknow what do you have it doesnthave to be big or anything i ll think about it she said and we lapsed into silence again an hour or so later lyra asked hey do you like quidditch do you fly yes and no i ve never been confident enough to fly do you want to i mean i know you might not want to but do you want to take a ride with me my parents are getting me a skybolt for my twelfth birthday and i thought as a thank you for the card you might want to go with me on it i wontgo too high i a good flyer she said this all very quickly sounding nervous skybolt are they the same ones who did the firebolt and lightningbolt yeah but i swear this one safe after the firebolt the company had come out with the lightningbolt its first professional use was in the first quidditch world cup after the war and it threw harry potter off just after he caught the snitch still no one had come out with a better broom than the firebolt and i was amazed they were trying again sure then that sounds fair when your birthday i asked curiously the first of may what about you yesterday actually i just barely got in by all rights i should be starting next year happy birthday then you know you dontseem like you just turned eleven we chatted amiably for what seemed like ages discovering along the way that we had what lyra called people in common my godfather was her uncle although she admitted she didntsee him very often then inevitably the question of the sorting came up which house do you think you ll be in i asked her gryffindor i guess both my parents were in it and the entire family on one side too for eons how about you gryffindor probably my dad was a gryffindor and my mum was a ravenclaw but i dontthink i bookish enough for ravenclaw brave enough for gryffindor sure noble a bit much though noble always a bit much think the slytherins ll give us much trouble nah they d not get away with it i mean it was voldemort house and most of the death eaters too they wouldntdare it d be asking to get expelled you think yeah it was at that moment that a prefect in slytherin robes knocked on our door we re almost at hogwarts girls you might want to change into your robes now cloaks as well it awful weather out i looked out the window sure enough the wind was blowing and it seemed to be raining as lyra and i changed into our robes we talked about the sorting ceremony although between us we had four parents five grandparents six uncles four aunts one cousin one pseudo uncle and one great aunt who had been to hogwarts neither of us had any idea about the ceremony itself d you think they ll make us do any magic lyra asked me worriedly i haventbeen able to do a lot just simple things no that silly how would that prove anything unless they made us all fight together then i guess they could tell you nervous about it yeah a bit me too well it cantbe too bad i guess i mean it not like you ever hear of anyone dying from it or anything i said it was with this cheerful statement that we arrived at hogwarts firs years over here firs years follow me firs years the speaker was a giant of a man with wild black hair and kind looking eyes i could barely hear him over the wind veritaserum wouldnthave made me admit it but i was terrified and when lyra held out her hand i willingly took it we walked over to him together he led the group of first years down to the lake where a small fleet of wooden boats stood waiting to take us across lyra and i found seats and a boy and another girl came to sit with us when the entire group was seated the boats began to move we huddled into our cloaks trying to keep the rain and spray off our already soaked selves when we were finally inside the castle a tall lanky wizard took us from the gigantic man i am professor rufford your deputy headmaster head of gryffindor house and defense against the dark arts teacher he told us in a few minutes you will move into the great hall to join your housemates but first you will be sorted into your houses there are four gryffindor ravenclaw hufflepuff here he seemed to pause and slytherin your house here will be like your family you will live together eat together and learn together if you would take a few moments to warm yourselves i will see if they are ready for you with those words he left us there was a short pause then a flurry of activity simple drying and warming charms quick hair fixes nervous laughter we werentquite ready when professor rufford called us to come into the great hall but we went anyway in pairs or threes we approached a raised platform in front of a tattered hat on a three legged stool spreading out to face the hat which began to sing describing the four houses and their histories the hall broke into applause at the end of the song now professor rufford said when i call your name please sit down and place the hat on your head and it will sort you i nearly grinned in relief and squeezed lyra hand as he consulted a large scroll adams caroline a solemn looking girl walked up to the stool the hat hesitated only a minute before announcing ravenclaw avery john another minute then slytherin i felt terrible for him bagnold andrew gryffindor carmichael lydia nervously i approached the stool and placed the hat on my head ah lydia carmichael eh ravenclaw mother gryffindor father yes that right i remember them well your father particularly was difficult to sort insisted on gryffindor in the end but you good mind tendency to laziness mm you sound like my mother ah yes well i do try and you ve courage yes but ambition as well a good deal of it and underneath all that a stubborn pride and an almost dangerous loyalty hufflepuff perhaps no i will not be put in that house are you sure your aunt was a hufflepuff no one likes hufflepuffs i wontbe one no then it had better be slytherin a n jadis is the name of the sorceress white witch and lady of the green kirtle from c s lewis chronicles of narnia i figured she deserved a chocolate frog card amelie helena emily and julia have all beta read this fic for me and for that i love them now go hit the little review button and tell me how to make this better chapter ten slytherin games the next saturday i woke up to maddison incessant lydia up groaning i rubbed my eyes and sat up in bed both my roommates were in green silver and black alicia her face painted with green stripes grinned at me lydia it the slytherin gryffindor quidditch game come on we want good seats i had to grin back at her as i sat up fine i up i protested yawning let me get dressed after i d managed to find a clean set of robes and tame my hair alicia handed me a green scarf and hat and maddison shoved a green cloak into my hands let go she said and the three of us ran out to the quidditch pitch aaron and cameron were already there and zach held one end of a huge green banner it read slyther on in large silver letters and the s was a twisting hissing snake waving i left my roommates to sit by him morning lydia he said hi i replied i hope you cheer loudly he told me we re going to have to overpower the other three houses i loud when i want to be i boasted and sat back to watch the stands fill up the rest of the school wore red and gold i fiddled with my scarf and felt a twinge of shame then i looked around to the rest of my house and the feeling was eclipsed with a wave of fierce pride this is your family annie voice said in my head cheers erupted across the stadium as the gryffindor team flew in i grinned at lyra but didntdare cheer slytherin house stood as one as our team flew in carrow rosier graves mchugh jugson shingleton everard screamed the commentator the captains eli rosier and some gryffindor i didntknow shook hands and the game began it was vicious and violent madame hooch called more fouls than i thought possible we were ahead eighty to sixty when a bludger hit our keeper in the face and she fell to the ground fuck zach breathed next to me eleanor and it looks like slytherin keeper carrow is out for the game tough luck slytherin as the bludger came out of nowhere it doesntseem that a penalty will be awarded my entire house jumped to its feet and screamed how dare they knock our keeper out and not give us a penalty foul i yelled that was a foul rosier was on the ground arguing with madame hooch her hands were in the air helpless and then the teams were back in play blatant favoritism zach muttered to me he glared at the pitch as the gryffindor chasers scored once twice and then everyone stopped to watch jess everard race toward a far corner of the field both our beaters were guarding her and her arm was outstretched reaching reaching the gryffindor seeker was close behind i caught sight of the snitch glittering just in front of her and then her hand closed and she let out a cheer madame hooch gestured for both teams to touch down and the scoreboard flipped slytherin 230 gryffindor 90 the entire house screamed in triumph we had won as they shook hands with the defeated gryffindors our team hugged tightly and the sixth and seventh years ran onto the field to congratulate roommates no tutoring tonight zach muttered in my ear neither of us will be in any fit state for it but why you ll see was all he would say i d stopped by the owlery to send lyra an i m sorry but you were still amazing note on my way to the common room and by the time i got there everyone else had already gathered and the seven quidditch players were basking by the fire eleanor carrow was wrapped in a green blanket and sipping from a large mug laughing with jess everard while the five boys grouped around them looking at eleanor with concern and at jess with pride lydia have some punch john yelled to me over the noise handing me a paper cup full of an unidentifiable green liquid i stared at it nervously what in it he shrugged who cares it good i sniffed it experimentally then shrugged and gulped it down it tasted faintly of cinnamon and burned a little do you like it he asked me i nodded where did you get it over by the seventh year couch go grab some i grinned at him and went in search of the punch bowl lydia sarah portsmouth said with a grin stopping me what d you think of your first slytherin game it was intense i told her honestly she laughed a dangerous looking sparkle in her eyes dontdrink too much of the punch lydia she advised before sauntering off i stared after her and as i watched i noticed zach struggling up the stairs with a large set of speakers he placed them on a table in the corner and tapped them with his wand the familiar sounds of the wizard wireless top hits filled the air and the older students started to dance i drifted toward the wall staring around the room after a few moments alicia joined me and we stared silently at the sea of movement she nudged me and nodded toward annie hodgeson and henry mchugh who had stopped dancing and started kissing in the middle of the room ew i mouthed at alicia who nodded as the clock struck eleven professor snape entered the room and the music cut off immediately he surveyed the crowded common room the half empty punch bowl and the swaying students and glared around at us bed all of you i can hear you from my apartments what do you think you re doing miss wilkes mr rosier i expected more sorry professor amanda said with a barely concealed grin we were just congratulating our team on such a thorough victory snape frown broke for a moment yes well congratulations of course noise down all of you i dontwant to have to come back down here again he glared back at amanda and next time dontyou dare spike that punch and with a swish of his robes he was gone and the music resumed this time slower i recognized celestina warbeck crooning and sighed the older students paired off those who werentalready making out in corners and swayed off beat to the music john came toward me one hand extended and i laughed and shook my head as he turned to alicia who took his hand they stepped toward the middle of the crowded floor and she put her arms around his neck i rolled my eyes moving back towards the punch bowl where i could survey the entire room sarah portsmouth and jess everard sat together in one armchair by the fire jess was laughing one arm flung around sarah shoulders i spotted zach moving toward them looking nervous he stopped to address sarah she laughed and waved him away with one hand i left the party just as professor snape came in a second time feeling just a little dizzy and very very happy maddison was in bed and i heard the water running in the bathroom so i tried to be quiet as i sat down on my bed and pulled out a letter from harry which i had received earlier but hadntyet read dear lydia i glad to hear your first few months are going well dontworry about your roommate she probably just as nervous as you are but doesntknow how to deal with it just be friendly and polite she ll come around and if she doesn t it her loss as for how to deal with a know it all she doesnt know the answer to every question hermione was like that in school but and donttell her i told you this that was because hermione was afraid of not being the best some people measure themselves by their grades or their looks or family or whatever they feel that they have to be perfect and in order to prevent others from seeing that they aren t they push them away i think that what your roommate doing and it isnthealthy instead of feeling that she a horrible person you might feel sorry for her she may just need good friends i glad you re enjoying your classes what dontyou like about defense against the dark arts from what i ve heard from teddy he a fair teacher and a nice one have a great christmas i dontthink i ll be able to get back in time to see you i ll fill you in about my work here next time i get a chance good luck with your quidditch game love harry what that i looked up alicia had walked into the room and flung herself onto her bed it a letter i explained no really i mean who it from your parents no from my godfather she sat up harry potter right right how he dealing with you being a slytherin i mean he sent you that bracelet right but you said he apologized for the colors i coughed a little look donttell anyone but harry doesntactually know i a slytherin alicia stared at me come again i never told him and he not in europe right now so i never told him he thinks you re a gryffindor she stated yeah she shook her head slowly you have one insane double life lydia and you are so going to get caught a n i still dontown harry potter major thanks to ambika san and vercisisolde who beta ed this with almost no warning and very little time i promise to upload another cleaner copy once my other betas edit it but i did want to get this out with chapter ten consider the double update my christmas present to you all oh and a shameless plug i have a forum the serpents den for those with slytherin leanings and i would absolutely love it if people posted there happy holidays chapter eleven christmas shopping where my spare cloak maddison yelled in my direction as she hurriedly jammed things into her trunk check the coat tree i told her from my bed alicia had just finished packing and was sitting on her trunk in an attempt to shut it maddison we re going to be late she said anxiously you ve got plenty of time i told her enjoy christmas you two two weeks of home maddison asked incredulously of course we ll enjoy it shut you this to her trunk and stay shut alicia you ready yeah she replied grasping her drunk and dragging it to the door have a good holiday lydia you too i said waving as they left the moment the door shut i felt an odd sense of loneliness the room was quiet and mostly neat it was strange not to hear someone else breathing well i told the air cameron and evan will be with me so it isntlike i ll be alone or anything not completely anyway there plenty to do right like cleaning my part of the room and watering my plants that said i jumped up to make my bed i made the four poster bed watered all my plants and fed the non carnivorous ones and threw all my dirty laundry and some of maddison down the laundry chute once our room was neat i was again bored and a little lonely morning lass said lord byron cheerfully from his frame hello sir i replied i ve never seen you quite so energetic when it comes to tidying up is anything wrong i just lonely i confessed maddison and alicia just left for break and i cantthink of anything to do i feel really restless lord byron smiled at me that perfectly normal you cantbe the only one here for the holidays go find some of your friends they re probably feeling just as odd as you are lydia cameron called bounding into the common room three days before christmas i was sitting by the fire in my pajamas studying zach latest lesson plan and mumbling curses to myself mm evan and i are going into hogsmeade to go christmas shopping want to come sure i replied with a grin let me go get dressed i was dressed in record time and stood in the middle of my room counting my money i still had harry birthday money and the money my father had slipped me before the start of term it added up to just over seven galleons whom did i have to buy presents for my roommates obviously and the boys zach i muttered and lyra lydia cameron yelled from the common room are you ready yet laughing i grabbed a cloak and ran to join them honeydukes first evan directed as we walked down the snowy main street fine by me i said and cameron nodded the three of us wandered into honeydukes pausing in the doorway to stare at the mounds of chocolate on the shelves evan moved past cameron and i to a stack of chocolate frogs and peppermint toads in the middle of the store and i grinned at cameron before walking to the counter and peering at the freshly made fudge behind the glass can i help you a plump white haired woman asked me cheerfully er could i have a piece of the chocolate fudge please just a small one she laughed and cut a generous slice eighteen knuts m dear enjoy it i ate the fudge as i wandered through the rest of the store aaron adrian zach and john would be perfectly content with candy i thought who didntlike sugar after all and honeydukes was having a sale on pepper imps and squeaking sugar mice remembering aaron love of revenge i picked up a few packs of acid pops on my way to the register this all the girl behind the counter asked yeah total one galleon six sickles and eleven knuts wordlessly i handed over the money and took the bag of sweets let go to scrivenshaft s evan said on our way out what for cameron asked they ve got quills and parchment and stuff i thought i d get my cousin one of those quills that takes dictation what does your cousin do i asked robin like a traveling ambassador she lives in britain but she travels all over the world and tries to convince foreign wizards to listen to us sounds fun cameron said with a grin as we entered the quill shop it was divided sharply in half one side housed normal adult looking quills reams of creamy parchment and inks in standard colors the other half nearly screamed there were stacks of parchment in loud colors some were even shiny and quills made from every kind color and size of feather bottles of ink stood on one wall some sparkled some shined and some changed color i walked to a rack of strangely patterned quills in unnatural colors i decided to buy one in lime green with bright blue zigzags and another this one white with orange polka dots both for evan then i looked at the bottles of ink alicia still didnthave any erasable ink her homework papers were full of blotches and i picked out three bottles for her one jade green with sparkles one that looked black but supposedly shone in the dark and one in bubble gum pink where do you need to go next cameron asked as i paid d you think there a bookstore around i need to get lyra something cameron frowned and evan shook his head at me you sure that a good idea she my friend drop it okay they shrugged at each other bookstore just down the street the shopkeeper told us i starving cameron announced around two i haventeaten since breakfast let get lunch then evan said i practically broke i confessed it going to have to be somewhere cheap cameron nodded in agreement but evan shook his head my cousin feels awful about leaving me alone on christmas right so she sent me thirty galleons to allay her guilt let go to the three broomsticks my treat cameron and i exchanged glances and then shrugged in agreement lead on cameron told him we reached the three broomsticks in high spirits the three of us ordered butterbeer and after a whispered consultation three large bowls of stew i love christmas cameron said as he sipped his butterbeer i love the smell of christmas trees and snow snow doesnthave a smell i told him it just water it does so have a smell no it doesn t water doesnthave a smell it does too and snow has a different one that doesnteven make sense i protested evan tell him he crazy evan looked at the two of us and rolled his eyes if water doesnthave a smell then how do animals find it in the middle of nowhere cameron stuck out his tongue at me and i gulped down my butterbeer refusing to concede where does christmas come from anyway i asked finally to change the subject did someone just decide on a day where everyone should get presents cameron looked at evan who shrugged it some weird muggle thing they think that their god was born today or something weird i said as cameron asked wait what a god all seeing all knowing all powerful and benevolent i explained that doesnteven make sense cameron protested do all muggles believe in it i asked evan in god in christmas i dontthink so he said doubtfully i think they all have different gods hey isntshe in our year i asked pointing to a red headed girl in a sky blue cloak she was sitting alone in the corner sipping from a tall foaming mug yeah cameron said something or other wilson marissa evan corrected should we ask her to sit with us sure cameron replied with a shrug i ll go ask evan and i watched as he stood and sauntered over to marissa and leaned down to talk to her after a moment she stood up and they both came back to our table hi she said quietly finishing up your shopping evan and i nodded sit down cameron invited pulling up a chair what ve you been doing just shopping she said i wanted some candy and i went into weasleys wizard wheezes just to look around my parents wouldntlet me near it at home cameron smirked they couldntkeep me away are you three staying over holidays she asked obviously evan told her we wouldntbe here otherwise she laughed i was going to ask if maybe we could get together to practice the tickling charm before term starts there no one in my house to practice with the three of us looked at each other before nodding sure i said that sounds really fun inwardly i was shocked and i was sure the others were too even ravenclaws werentlikely to offer to work with three slytherins almost without thinking i took out a huge piece of chocolate and split it into four pieces want some chocolate a n i dontown harry potter my betas are amazing and i love reviews happy holidays chapter twelve christmas day chapter twelve christmas day after dinner on christmas eve i shut myself in my room to wrap presents i wrapped the candy first wrote out cards and then turned my attention to the rest of my gifts lyra book beating the odds the first woman beater in professional quidditch was easy to wrap you re going to be even better than she was i wrote inside the cover merry christmas cameron hat which read vindictive in large flashing letters was also easy to wrap but evan quills were nearly impossible every time i managed to get the paper halfway around them one quill would pull itself free and poke me in the face i finally just gave up and tied them together with a wide silver ribbon i finished wrapping just as the bells chimed eight o clock and jammed all the parcels into my bookbag with maddison necklace on top holding the bag shut i headed to the owlery to send them sending christmas presents off cameron asked as i got there yeah what about you i just sent the last owl out i hate christmas he grumbled i ve heard the christmas feast is amazing i told him hesitantly and we donthave classes for two weeks everyone else gets to go home i swallowed yeah but it more fun to stay here everyone else just has to go back to to bedtimes and eating vegetables and everything who wants that cameron looked up at me startled and then he laughed you re right we can stay up all night and sleep all morning and open all our presents at once and eat all our candy before breakfast i finished oooooo even with all our cheerful words no one seemed to want to sleep that night there were only two other students staying alexis newbury was tall with frizzy brown hair and a constant smirk and jonathan reinhart was short and stocky he laughed at alexis sarcasm all night as he pulled at his straight sandy hair so why are you here he asked the three of us as we sat in front of the fire evan head buried in a musty book ignored him but cameron answered i couldntbear to leave the dungeons for two entire weeks i had to beg my family to let me miss all the festivities but they agreed it was probably best for my well being to allow me to remain he looked at jonathan with a straight face and waited until he looked away to wink at me and look alexis proclaimed half past ten and professor snape appears right on schedule schedule i echoed every christmas eve he brings us cookies and butterbeer she explained mockingly enough of your sarcasm miss newbury professor snape told her or i ll stop coming you ll never do that she told him you love us too much he rolled his eyes and passed around steaming mugs of butterbeer evan shut his book and accepted one as i passed around the plate of thick sugar cookies what are you reading mr rookwood um rocklin founded to fall he hesitated it about the four founders and how well how they fell apart and how does rocklin treat salazar slytherin in all of this professor snape sneered i dontknow i haventgotten there yet pay attention when you do professor snape advised mr viridian miss carmichael what did you think of your first term at hogwarts i like it cameron said decidedly but i wish we would do something in defense against the dark arts perhaps rufford is simply trying to protect you professor snape remarked with only a little sarcasm perhaps alexis echoed because merlin knows we d be safer without thinking about it and when say we meet a dementor we just tell it we arentauthorized to see it yet of course jonathon finished and because dark creatures agree with the ministry it ll just go away after apologizing profusely no doubt professor snape remarked dryly no doubt i repeated how much of it ministry orders and how much is vector and how much is just rufford professor snape gazed into the fire for a moment before answering the department of wizarding education has suggested that only strictly defensive matter be taught in britian that dumb cameron interjected the headmistress he continued has made her wishes clear she would prefer that her students remain free from the taint of dark magic while at an impressionable age unfortunately she seems to believe that learning anything practical will drive you all into evil that doesntmake sense evan said slowly wouldntthe best way to be to actually teach us something instead of making us go out and learn it on our own from erm questionable sources the higher you get in life mr rookwood professor snape said wryly the less use you will have for logic oooooo i woke up early christmas afternoon to see a pile of presents at the foot of my bed cheering i jumped out of bed and reached for the closest package i could find it was wrapped in bright blue paper and the tag read hope you re enjoying vacation with zach name scrawled below i tore off the paper to reveal a thick paperback book entitled self defensive spellwork the note on the inside cover read lydia you must be bored at school over the holidays i know i bored here with my parents i thought this book might help the first six chapters give you a nice review of what we ve already done and the next three will help you with what we re doing next happy holidays zachary c wenlock i laughed out loud that was zach making me study even during the holidays the next few presents were small chocolates from adrian a large furry hat which constantly recited limericks from john a small box of tea from evan fever fudge and extendable ears from aaron and cameron the largest box was from alicia and maddison after i tore off the glittery purple paper i saw a carved wooden box with two snakes intertwined on the top i opened it to see a jewelry box lined in hunter green velvet inside was a note and under it a silver necklace with a jade pendent and matching earrings i scanned the note it was written in maddison neat cursive but read like alicia s to our favorite slytherin roommate time for you to start showing more pride for your house wear more green more silver more black throw out your red hair ribbons have an awesome holiday dontlet cameron and aaron blow up our room sleep a lot merry christmas alicia and maddison i laughed as i removed the first shelf of the box to see a large assortment of hair ribbons it not my fault i have to wear my hair tied back all the time i protested to the air it gets unmanageable otherwise it too long and too curly to wear loose no one answered but i hadntexpected anyone to and i turned to one of only two other gifts lyra turned out to be a large collection of wildfire whiz bangs they re the best fireworks in the world she d written and harry large envelope contained fifty galleons and a pair of gold earrings which i immediately placed in the jewelry box then i dressed and read alicia old copies of teen witch weekly until the christmas feast oooooo by the time the time i walked into the great hall the rest of the school had already gathered evan waved me over to sit between him and alexis at the sole table how lovely of you to join us miss carmichael vector greeted me i nodded back at her and smothered a laugh as evan poked me under the table i lost track of time i confessed staring around at the hall warm snowflakes fell from the ceiling and enchanted harps played along the walls in one corner stood a christmas tree easily five times my height and it was covered in tinsel and lights what were you doing professor flitwick asked me just some reading i told him carefully omitting that the last article i read had been entitled dazzle your date thirty charms to clear your complexion pass the potatoes alexis asked me and from there conversation progressed to presents and plans for the rest of the holidays the three gryffindors and one ravenclaw i didntknow any of their names planned on quidditch practice a hufflepuff girl wanted to spend her week in the greenhouses alexis needed new dress robes jonathan offered to accompany her and marissa cameron evan and i planned on studying the meal lasted easily several hours finally over dessert the sole hufflepuff asked about personality quirks i for instance she explained can communicate with trees i know if they re happy you can tell if a tree is happy cameron demanded yeah sure my aunt can too well i in the wrong century a fourth year ravenclaw boasted i really supposed to be in the victorian age or regency england or something someplace elegant i would not presume to say that elegance is gone miss logan professor snape drawled but it is i rolled my eyes at evan and he smirked elegance is nowhere near gone look at the old pureblood families i dontthink you could get closer to elegance especially some of the halloween balls no kidding chimed in a gryffindor mum took me to one a few years ago it lasted forever and i had to wear the most uncomfortable robes no doubt you were too young to appreciate it professor snape told him now severus they arentfor everyone vector said gently nothing for everyone cameron told her irritably ready to go guys with that the three of us stood and marissa wilson followed us out of the great hall a n i still dontown the potterverse haleth aldea and ambika san beta ed this for me a good thing too because this chapter was awful please review please dontflame i promise to reply chapter thirteen goblin rebellions so why are you getting extra defense tutoring exactly cameron asked as we sat in the library three days before the new year i shrugged i need it how can you need it evan asked me in confusion we ve only learned two spells and we ve all managed them i paused to think i didntwant to admit that i was getting special attention just because i was friends with lyra in fact zach had told me not to but i also didntwant anyone getting the impression that i wasntsmart enough to manage two spells i took a deep breath weighed both sides and spoke it because of lyra cameron and evan stared at me prefects are afraid i ll get jumped i muttered looking at my open book self defensive spellwork chapter three you probably will evan said after a moment they obviously hate that the two of you are so close i still dontget that cameron complained i mean so what if you re a slytherin and she a gryffindork you re friends that all i smirked the funny thing if no one had said anything we probably would ve drifted apart really fast but i think we re too stubborn to stop just because someone wants us to so you re best mates then evan asked sure we were silent for a long time and then evan looked over his green and blue quill at us that essay for flitwick have you two done it yet not yet cameron said and i shook my head well he wants two feet on locomotion charms have we even done those they re in chapter ten a girl said from behind me i looked up to see marissa wilson a stack of books in her arms can i sit down sure i told her there plenty of room chapter ten evan repeated oh that makes sense i remember them now i have my notes she said after a moment if you want to see them that would be excellent he replied reaching across the table less work for me academic integrity anyone cameron muttered as he snuck a look at evan annotated history text can i ask a favor i asked looking up around them sure go for it you can ask zach gave me a bunch of curses to try fun ones kind of but i need to practice them on someone marissa looked up if you ll teach them to us first and some way of blocking them cameron smirked yes defense tutoree impart your amazing knowledge to us oooooo no i yelped as sparks flew from evan wand it parma and careful with the a sorry marissa touched her slightly singed hair you didnttell me i might burn my hair it ll be fine i told her examining it closely for a moment oh i not worried i dontcare about my hair i thought that was all girls cared about cameron said after a reflective moment marissa and i exchanged frowns excuse me she asked after a moment er tarantallegra we cried together and cameron squeaked as the curse made him waltz across the room evan stood up and brushed his robes off i am sorry about that wilson no worries rookwood finite incantatem cameron managed to yell in the middle of a particularly difficult spin made even worse because he was without a partner enough for today maybe i asked the other three definitely cameron replied sounding relieved can we do it again though marissa asked it easier to study in a group friday evan suggested about noon i ll be there marissa promised oooooo i woke up saturday morning feeling awful this isntfair i told the canopy as i rolled out of bed i an awesome person i deserve parents everyone does came lord byron cheerful voice from above my head what wrong lass my parents didntsend me a christmas present i told him bitterly i hate them you dontmean that he said quietly i do so i hate them i want them to die he was silent i do i their daughter their only child they should love me and spoil me and and invite me home for christmas it will take time lass but i dontwant to wait sir i want them back the world isntfair lass i glared at him he smiled back how long will it take then i asked near desperate i sure if you talked to them i dontwant to talk to them lord byron i dontwant to go back and admit that i was wrong for being a slytherin for existing i not wrong i happy and i love my house and and screw them after a long moment maybe you re right lass but i sure they ll come to their senses you re an amazing girl they should be proud to have you as a daughter i wish someone would tell them that i muttered go find some cocoa he told me it ll cheer you up where do i get cocoa the kitchens the house elves make the best cocoa in europe oh i said thanks i made my way to the kitchens only getting lost twice and spent three minutes trying to tickle the pear in exactly the right place finally the door swung open and i walked to a large oak table in the middle the kitchens were huge almost monstrously so and a small army of house elves stood inside washing and cooking they were all dressed in pressed pillowcases except for two one in a stained skirt and blouse and the other in an old overcoat one of the pillow clad house elves approached me smiling can mixy get miss anything she asked me as i sat down some hot chocolate please i asked nervously in two minutes a towering mug of cocoa topped with whipped cream and chocolate syrup was placed in front of me and a plate of chocolate chip cookies followed it immediately i sipped at my cocoa and slowly ate my way through the cookies when the plate was half empty the kitchen door burst open and cameron and evan ran in followed closely by marissa rookwood viridian i ll hex you both i will she screeched waving her wand in their general direction sure you will cameron replied laughing he pulled out the chair next to me and sat down grabbing a cookie evan sat next to him and marissa collapsed finally laughing into the chair on my other side what was that all about i asked the three of them passing around the plate of cookies those two marissa glared at evan and cameron attempted to re singe my hair so i had to retaliate you tried to curse me cameron yelped you burned my hair it was already burned you burned it more i rolled my eyes at evan and he shrugged back anyway i interrupted after several moments of bickering what else is going on i still have to write the history of magic essay marissa said i dontwant to i think the goblin wars are the most boring thing ever evan stared at her in shock the goblin wars boring they arentboring uh evan are we in the same class cameron asked looking a little horrified i dontknow anything about the goblin wars anyway i told evan binns puts me to sleep every class evan looked around at us are you serious we re doing the most interesting wars in history and you fall asleep evan they re boring he took a deep breath in they are not boring see orik the ugly he was the chief goblin at the time and he wanted to be equal with humans goblins were basically animals back then still are i guess and he started taking wizard children hostage and sometimes muggle children as well and orik threatened to kill all the hostages unless the goblins were given magical protection and their ancient rights so the wizards went to go rescue the kids but some of them would refuse to come back why marissa asked sounding unconvinced who d want to stay with goblins captives never want to be rescued evan explained it some sort of weird survival tactic that doesntmake any sense i retorted sure it does he told me anyway point being the kids didntalways want to come back some of them had been living with the goblins for years when they were finally found and they d gotten used to goblin life so they wouldntreturn and they d have to be kidnapped back binns never told us any of this cameron protested well it happened and it got worse and worse because no one knew what to do with these children who just wanted to be goblins and who wanted the wars over soon there were humans fighting with goblins and humans fighting against other humans and parents fighting against their children and finally orik was killed in a crazy assassination attempt and his son golump the nasty took over and he rounded up all the children and told them to go home to their parents but they refused and so he entered into negotiations with the leader of the wizards council and they agreed to a treaty giving the goblins back most of their rights and that was it i demanded they just obeyed the treaty and lived happily ever after only for about ten years then their rights started to get taken away again and so golump started an all out war this was about 1612 and the goblins headquarters for the war was in the inn at hogsmeade how d they pull that one off cameron asked intrigued the owner used to live with them or something so he was sympathetic he wanted goblins to be equal to humans anyway they started a really really brutal war that lasted for about five years and the goblins managed to win a couple decisive battles so the wizards council finally agreed to re negotiate the peace at that point the goblins seized gringotts took control of the money and refused to leave the council was forced to let them stay in control of all currency i d ve taken back the bank i interrupted you wouldnthave been able to evan continued impatiently the goblins knew what they were doing and plus they had all the gold they were dangerous so they got to keep the bank and now goblins mint all the money too you cantmess with them but what about the kids marissa asked as she reached for the last cookie that how you get half goblins evan explained no one ever gave them anything either that really stupid marissa said quietly who cares if people are part goblin yeah seriously cameron agreed can we get some more cookies a n i dontown the potterverse i also dontown the term gryffindork ambika san and haleth aldea beta ed it for me i love them a lot please please please dontsteal and review there are over 700 hits on this story please guys i begging for reviews here if you review a lot i might give you a cameo does that help chapter fourteen into the forest the first week in april was warm and only slightly breezy i woke up that friday to see maddison carefully folding her cloaks and placing them into her trunk what are you doing i asked sleepily putting my cloaks away it too warm for them and then as she was leaving the room we ve got herbology in ten minutes you slept through breakfast i jumped out of bed and looked at the clock the time was 8 46 as i scrambled around to find my robes it was just like maddison to leave it until the last minute to tell me i d slept late and then not to wait for me to dress luckily though professor sprout was a pushover where any other teacher would assign detention for even a few minutes tardiness she would wave it away as on of what she called those days so i wasntsurprised when she waved me aside with a smile as i explained gasping for breath that i d overslept i found a place next to marissa and tried to look attentive while i caught my breath today professor sprout started i spreading you out spring just beginning and that means there plenty for you to do i ll split you into groups of four that what five groups and two groups can work in this greenhouse the other three will be outside she surveyed us critically well count off oooooo so why were you late cameron asked me curiously as we clipped back thorny night rose bushes i overslept i guess i forgot to set my alarm or something it a good thing we ve got sprout then and not rufford or someone max o sullivan told me and i nodded fervently almost bumping into pernella rosewater as i did under normal circumstances the eight of us would have tried to stick together but something about the ravenclaws or about herbology made mixed groups work out i knew pernella a little bit she was good friends with marissa max on the other hand was something of a loner and none of us talked to him unless we had too the four of us worked side by side near the forbidden forest talking and sneaking looks at the dark woods why it forbidden anyway cameron demanded it dangerous pernella told him as she pushed her hair out of her face if it were that dangerous then it would be fenced off he retorted and pernella shrugged i wish we could go in he added we d get in so much trouble and sprout would go nuts i protested max took off his hat smiling it a learning experience he said thoughtfully breezy out isntit we nodded not understanding the connection and max tapped his hat with his wand and muttered a charm the hat sailed off into the trees well he said looking at us donttell me you re going to let me go in there alone max you can t pernella cried but she ran after him cameron followed her and i stared between them and the roses before finally dashing after them into the trees oooooo the forest frightened me and i kept one hand on my wand and the other on the giant clippers max led the way hat back on his head and he and cameron bickered about which route to take pernella looked about as frightened as i felt and moved closer to me as we walked i held out my hand the one holding the clippers and she grasped it and the clippers i dontthink this is a very good idea i said finally after we d been walking for what seemed like ages every time leaves rustled in the wind or a stick snapped i jumped about a foot in the air and pernella gripped my hand that much harder the boys had started bragging early on about how brave they were now the two of them acted as if the idea of leaving the forest was a complete anathema nothing i could say would change either of their minds please let go back pernella pleaded her voice shook slightly and that might have been what changed cameron mind lately for some reason girls only had to whimper a little and he would drop everything he was doing to make it better for he immediately turned around and looked at her with concern o sullivan if the girls dontwant to stay then we go in cameron said decisively scared viridian not as much as you now let go he and max glared at each other for a few seconds finally max turned and we started back towards the castle we d been walking for about fifteen minutes when we ran into the edge of a marsh this shouldntbe here i said nervously we ve made a wrong turn somewhere i can see the castle cameron replied so we cantbe that far off it straight ahead we cantgo through the water max protested angrily you have no idea what in there we cantgo around it cameron retorted it way too big we ll get lost again besides i dontthink the water too deep there re plants poking up all over let vote on it pernella suggested i say we go through cameron definitely no way max told her lydia she asked me and i shrugged let go through i dontwant to be here all day so the four of us started through the muddy marsh the water was just over ankle deep and freezing cold and max complained angrily all the way after fifteen minutes of sloshing through the water pernella let out a sharp scream what cameron asked turning around what happened my ankles she cried and lifted one foot out of the water her ankle just above her shoe was bleeding from a ring of small puncture marks what the hell max demanded looking more closely did you see it no i dontknow what happened but it hurts she wailed near tears the four of us turned around quickly trying to see something anything lurking beneath the water i could see a few rotting logs floating nearby and farther down the water rippled slightly we cantkeep going i said she cantwalk we need help cameron and max nodded slowly i ll send up red sparks max offered that should get someone attention professor sprout found us half an hour later we were sitting at the edge of the marsh where we d first gone in pernella had both shoes and socks off and was struggling to hold back tears we d bandaged her ankles up with max handkerchief but they still seemed to hurt a lot sprout was angrier than i had ever seen her her face was red and her eyes looked dangerous what exactly she hissed at us were you thinking his idea max muttered with a nod at cameron as cameron said pernella hurt professor sprout glared at the three of us her expression only softening a little as she knelt to examine pernella ankles where were you in the marsh pernella nodded we were t trying to get to the c castle she explained idiot girl sprout muttered you ve no idea what lives in that swamp looks like you ran into a dugbog her face didntinvite questions so we were silent as she healed pernella cuts with a few spells and we stayed quiet on the long walk back to the castle professor snape was waiting with flitwick at the door oooooo all things considered cameron and i escaped relatively unscathed snape lectured us in his most terrifying manner for an hour and we had a month worth of detention plus four feet on dangerous and deadly creatures in the forest you re lucky i in a good mood and you re in my house he d concluded the lecture otherwise i d have you both expelled dontworry about it zach advised me during our next defense tutoring session snape wontstay mad not at you two it only gryffindors he hates for life great i said i friends with a gryffindor and after this i guess pernella and i are friends too zach laughed relax lydia snape got way too much to worry about without throwing you into the mix and besides ravenclaws are fine if not particularly practical hey i heard a rumor that you might get to learn a few curses in class really nope he told me grinning now show me that defense charm we were practicing last week a n hey guys i finally back heh it only been what two and a half months i ve got an excuse though my keyboard died twice keyboards and liquids really dontmix earning me the wrath of my father and the scorn of the tech guys at school plus my school flooded and we

message me or mention it in your review and i ll send along the next chapter and we ll see review please chapter fifteen fireworks the night i finished my last detention lyra met me as i was walking slowly toward the kitchens in search of something to drink i was tired between detention with snape and studying for finals with marissa and evan i hadntbeen sleeping much and my hand was painfully sore from writing lines i will remember that i am a sentient being and therefore capable of thought i will remember that i am a sentient being hey lydia she greeted me cheerfully hi i replied what are you doing looking for you she explained come on follow me i looked longingly in the direction of the kitchens then sighed and followed the blonde girl down the corridor after we d started climbing our second moving staircase i asked where are we going the astronomy tower why i asked curiously it was a popular place for romantic trysts when professor sinistra wasntaround and a girl was rumored to have flung herself out of the tower in a botched attempt at suicide a number of years before she d bounced but i could think of no reason for lyra and me to be up there late at night when we could be asleep it a surprise she told me and wouldntsay another word until after she d ushered me into the tower eyes closed and opened the window there she said finally open your eyes i opened them blinked and stared at what she held in her hands lyra is that a skybolt the newest fastest best broomstick on the market my twelfth birthday present yes yes and yes i gaped at it but what it doing up here i put it here under a concealment charm why because it easier to go out the window and i owe you a broomstick ride remember i nodded slowly lyra grinned okay then come on i mounted the broomstick with mixed feelings a year of madame hooch coaxing had helped with my acrophobia but the idea of a midnight ride on the fastest lightest broom in england still frightened me on the other hand a midnight ride on the best broom in all england but i neednthave worried lyra was an excellent flier and the full moon lit up the quidditch field and surrounding grounds i held onto her tightly as we swooped low over the lake screamed as we climbed up to the stars and gasped in delight when we flew so low over the forest that i could see a unicorn drinking from a tiny stream we didntspeak during the flight since the wind roaring in our ears made hearing anything impossible but i could feel her laughing with joy as we flew towards hogsmeade far from being dark or quiet the little village was bustling with activity the door to the three broomsticks constantly swung open to let someone in or out fireworks in the forms of tiny flowers exploded silently from the roof of the biggest shop all the lights in honeydukes were on and i could see people walking to and fro inside the store lyra landed the broom a few moments later what are you doing i asked her as we dismounted we shouldntbe here it got to be close to midnight she grinned it my birthday they re celebrating celebrating your birthday uh huh okay fine so they re celebrating may day let get something to drink i wait lyra i donthave any money my treat she replied and i willingly followed her into honeydukes where the woman behind the counter sold us steaming mugs of hot chocolate topped with whipped cream and chocolate shavings and then winked at us as she gave us two bags of light chocolate mints and chocoballs for the road lyra and i drank our hot chocolate outside in front of the store window i cantbelieve we re doing this i said to her with a smile i know we d be in tons of trouble if we got caught wouldntwe loads as we sipped our cocoa fireworks exploded in front of us and music played from somewhere just a few buildings down and i was struck suddenly with the strangest oddest desire to kiss her oooooo if i had expected to walk into an empty common room it was after all approaching two o clock in the morning i was mistaken it seemed as if the entire house was upstairs clustered around two girls i recognized annie hodgeson a sixth year prefect with white blonde hair the other girl i couldntsee well enough to identify i slipped by a group of fourth years to sit next to aaron on the floor by the fire what going on i whispered to him annie walked in on henry snogging heather he muttered back i looked up again as annie started to scream at the brown haired girl as she turned to face annie i recognized heather lewis you re joking i whispered back to aaron annie and henry had been dating for almost the entire year they were perfect together and perfect for each other both beautiful smart and wealthy purebloods does it look like it he murmured as heather yelled just because you canthandle rejection he mine annie screamed back he loves me not some mudblood whore there was a sharp intake of breath from the entire room mudblood was the worst most foul name anyone could use and heather had her wand out and pointed at annie before she could finish her sentence what did you call me she hissed i called you a mudblood you filthy whore you think we dontknow what your mother was you think we dont know about you think just cause i not an inbred snotty bigot i not as good as you are she demanded stepping closer you re the mistake of a mudblood and a werewolf you re barely human incendio heather screamed and annie stopped yelling to let out a shriek as her beautiful white blonde hair caught fire and started to burn heather folded her arms and smirked in satisfaction finite incantatem plue eli rosier yelled simultaneously stopping the flames and causing a shower of water to fall on annie burnt hair and scalp everyone back to their rooms now hodgeson lewis get into the prefects common room prefects go with them mchugh stay where you are someone get snape he stared around at all of us no one had moved now we ran downstairs and into our rooms alicia and maddison had managed to reach our room first they were sitting on their beds when i walked in i cantbelieve she said that i said softly i cantbelieve she not even a half blood alicia added i didntthink they let people like that into slytherin people like what maddison demanded sharply you know animals werewolves arentanimals i told her quietly thinking of my half werewolf cousin neither are muggles maddison added irritably well they arentreally you know beings exactly they re different different maddison repeated flatly as i retreated to my bed i hated getting between the two of them when they fought alicia nodded different your death eater daddy tell you that my father wasnta death eater alicia cried jumping off her bed and stepping towards maddison maddison only sneered if he wasnta death eater he wouldnthave run off for nine years unless of course he just couldntstand to be around his family shut up maddison advanced until she was only inches away from alicia my mum muggle born travers you say one more thing about that pureblood dogma and i ll make what heather did to annie look nice got it you wouldn t alicia breathed instead of answering maddison twirled her wand in her fingers and then stalked back to her bed and shut the curtains alicia stared after her for a long moment before running into the bathroom and slamming the door i sat up late that night trying to understand what had happened since i couldntthink of anyone else to talk to i wrote to harry and told him about the entire incident i finished by explaining what bothered me the most harry annie and alicia both think that being pureblood makes you better somehow even though maddison smarter than alicia and heather managed to hex annie i dontreally care much about what annie thinks but alicia supposed to be my friend i not really pureblood though cause mum mum was a muggle so does that mean she doesntthink i really a person alicia said something about thinking muggles werentreally beings what does that mean does she think i only three quarters of a person i really like her harry and anyway we have to live together for another six years but how can i be friends with someone who thinks i not as good as she is love lydia ps you re number one on the witch weekly most desirable wizard list alicia showed me last week you re on there for dashing good looks an exciting past and for being a real life knight in shining armor the perfect man to rescue any damsel in distress dontyou feel special your only downside is the part where you re married with kids pps can i come stay with you for part of the summer maybe my parents want me to are going away kicked me out i stopped and chewed on my quill thoughtfully i didntfeel like i could explain anything i didntfeel somehow that i even wanted to so i scratched out the final post script and finished with i miss you a lot can i come stay with you for a while after school lets out i blew on the ink to dry it then sealed the parchment and turned off the light if i could stay with harry for the summer maybe he could even talk to my parents maybe somehow the whole bloody mess could be fixed a n well again i dontown anything jkr does but if it isnthers it mine and i will hunt you down if you steal from me haleth aldea ambika san vercisisolde and umsc 001 looked this over for me many thanks to them i had some trouble uploading this chapter is this happening to anyone else this chapter was loads and loads of fun to write and i hope y all liked it too so review and tell me this entire fic is going to start moving a lot faster the big stuff happens in year three and i not going to put you through another fifteen chapters to get there review please chapter sixteen end of term harry reply arrived at breakfast the first day of exams dear lydia first i want to tell you again there is nothing wrong with being a half blood or a three quarters blood in your case some of the most powerful witches and wizards haventbeen purebloods i mean albus dumbledore was probably one of the best wizards ever he wasnta pureblood even lord voldemort was a halfblood and he as someone once told me did very great things terrible but great so try not to worry about it lydia because it really isntworth thinking about blood and magical ability have nothing to do with each other as for your friend well it seems to me like maybe maddison right alicia probably did hear a lot of this from her parents and she just parroting it back to you now i dontthink she thought it all the way through either she probably isntused to having faces to put to the labels it doesntseem like your friendship is in much danger just be friendly and courteous you ll help her see that whatever your family is it doesntchange what you can become and even the most pureblooded families can be horrible just ask your dad besides seven years in gryffindor she ll come out knowing the blood doesntmatter i smirked sadly at the page lyra thought i should just tell him i wasntactually a gryffindor but it had been almost a year of lying by omission and i couldntvery well back out now and i really really sorry to have to say this but once again i wontbe home for another couple of months things here just keep getting weirder and weirder i promise that whatever happens i ll make it back for your birthday and i cannot believe i in that magazine did they honestly say that about me really i dontbelieve this i refuse to believe this really love harry i looked up from my letter to see zach eyes on me and i smiled weakly can i talk to you later i asked him what up he replied holding out his hand for the letter which i handed over without further comment your godfather on the most desirable wizard list really that pretty sweet zach oh right lydia does he actually think you re in gryffindor erm yes zach shook his head i think you ought to come clean maybe he can talk some sense into your parents and anyway it not like you can stay with him this summer if he working in greenland was that your plan yeah i admitted softly mum and dad still haventwritten or anything zach wenlock tugged on one of my curls in a gesture that might have been meant to be comforting common room tonight at eight okay we ll talk thanks zach i swallowed my tears no self respecting slytherin would cry in the great hall and besides i didntwant to embarrass myself in front of zach no problem hey you ready for your exams of course evan and marissa and i have been studying for ages oooooo i skipped dinner that night to cram for my history of magic exam evan muttering darkly about academic integrity and people needing to do their own work had distributed copies of his notes for the year throughout our small circle of friends unlike professor binns evan knew how to tell a story and his summary of the never ending goblin wars was at least interesting by eight o clock i was almost positive i had everything memorized i was just contemplating taking a study break when zach sank into the chair next to me how were your exams what d you have herbology and potions they were fine i told him herbology always easy and potions was okay he wanted us to make a forgetfulness potion and i good at those he nodded that lucky and lydia i hope you dontmind i asked eli and amanda to talk to you about this summer i was caught between relief that older more responsible people would be making decisions and anger that they were interfering they arrived before i managed to figure out which emotion was greater hello lydia how are your exams coming amanda greeted me eli just nodded his head fine i mumbled but um about the summer your parents still arenttalking to you and you cantstay with your godfather she finished do you have any other family you can stay with friends i shook my head i dontknow my mum parents and i donthave any aunts or uncles nobody close and i dontwant to to be a charity case amanda nodded i d never quite been able to figure amanda out everyone said she was bitter about not being chosen for head girl but i had never seen any of that instead she knew everyone schedule heard about everyone problems and talked to us as if we were equals i understand my uncle runs the leaky cauldron and he helped out runaways and such before he had problem parents too and as long as you re willing to work yes no that d be great i stammered she smiled at me dontworry lydia everything ll work out oooooo the last night of term meant the leaving feast piles and piles of the best food hogwarts could make the visible relief of everyone who had passed the exams plus the jittery laughter of the few who hadn t and the unbridled excitement of the seventh years who were now finished with school yo lydia pass the pumpkin pie cameron called over dessert what are you doing this summer working i replied amanda helping me out what about you back to the orphanage only for a couple weeks aaron answered for him then he coming to stay with me hey evan you want to come for a few weeks i ll ask my cousin evan replied but i bet she ll say yes she always worried i not going to wind up normal hey lydia sarah portsmouth said cutting across evan answer have some more ice cream it delicious what this about you working in diagon alley this summer amanda got me a job i explained watching sarah add a generous helping of disturbingly pink ice cream to my plate sounds fun i ll come visit you when i get my books we can practice cursing each other or something even though i knew she wasntactually serious i felt an odd thrill go through me after all most fifth years didnteven talk to firsties at that point the conversation turned to quidditch and i tuned out i was almost asleep when cameron poked me yo he said earth to lydia the feast is over oh right thanks i quickly finished my pumpkin juice he shook his head mouthing crazy that one and i followed him back to the dungeons and hurried to finish packing i still had most of my things strewn around our room packing meant i would really be leaving the security of hogwarts and i was terrified at the prospect hey maddison called out holding up a silk scarf who belongs to this it mine i told her stuffing it into my trunk on top of robes and books and it belongs to me not the other way around as i surveyed the room one final time something on my bed caught my eye moving aside the curtains i saw a small wooden box there was a sealed envelope on top bearing a crest i didntrecognize i broke it open and scanned the letter carmichael enclosed are two books on beginning and intermediate potion making and some of the more hard to find ingredients potions does not fall under the ministry law forbidding underage magic you should have time this summer to go through them whatever happens you are going to need snape support and more importantly admiration and the easiest way for you to manage that is through your skills with a cauldron study hard carmichael eli rosier i looked into the wooden box which was filled as promised with vials of carefully labeled ingredients and two soft bound books it came as a surprise that eli should care enough to give me anything it had always been amanda who talked to me i was still frowning over the unexpected gift as i placed it into my trunk added the last of my papers and socks and sat on the lid to close it oooooo the hogwarts express left school at exactly eight thirty the next morning cameron evan and i snagged a compartment in the back and marissa and pernella joined us after the train started to move none of us was really very popular although cameron would probably become popular once we were older since he and aaron were such good pranksters but somehow the car filled up anyway by the time we reached the outskirts of london the compartment had an odd mixture of slytherins ravenclaws and lyra who brought jill holmes a gryffindor girl i didntknow very well evan and jill were playing chess with marissa looking on and the rest of us were engaged in a loud game of exploding snap hey lyra said quietly as the train finally rolled to a stop you never said where you re going to be this summer working i replied my parents well there isntanything else to do you could ve stayed with me she said and i was surprised to hear that she sounded hurt i know but not for the whole summer lyra your parents wouldntlike it and anyway i going to need money i canttake charity it isntcharity if it friends she told me crossly i didntanswer cameron slid the door to the compartment open and amid promises to write and visit we tumbled out of the train and onto platform nine and three quarters it only took twenty minutes or so for the platform to clear lyra came up to me to give me a last hug goodbye and if some crazy death eater tries to eat you or something dontsay i didntwarn you and evan came by with his cousin a tall dark haired woman who looked quite dangerous if a tiny part of me had still been expecting to see my mother and father as the crowd thinned out it was squashed permanently i waited for over an hour then i had to admit that the only thing to do was to head towards the leaky cauldron i had no idea what muggles might think of an eleven year old girl clad in dark school robes walking the streets of london but i couldntthink of any other options standing i grabbed my trunk with one hand thankful that it had a built in lightening charm and took perseus cage with the other well i said to him i a slytherin and a carmichael and before that a black and that means that whatever happens we should come out on top just dontstart squawking i dontthink muggles usually carry owls around with them perseus cooed in response and the two of us started towards the leaky cauldron oooooooooooooooooooooooooo a n right so oddly enough i still dontown any harry potter related things if i did this would be cannon and you would have to pay for it the weird scene changes are due to the horizontal lines not working sighs the next few chapters have already been written from it all going to move much more quickly because all the awesomely interesting stuff happens in year three not year two i ll try and post quickly but to be honest no one appears to be reading this three reviews on chapter fourteen and none at all on fifteen i ll keep writing no matter how many reviews but i have a tendency to get lazy on posting so if you like review if you don t review criticize tell me what worked and what didntand what you think please i respond to everyone too as long as there an email or you re logged in review review review chapter seventeen summer days it took me hours to get across london i was stopped on the way by at least two muggle police officers and no less than three muggle women asked me if i was lost the leaky cauldron was a tiny grubby looking pub sandwiched between a bookstore and a store that sold muggle records these didntlook anything like wizarding records muggles apparently kept their important information on large black discs and something called cds at the door i took a deep breath squared my shoulders and walked in pulling my trunk after me it had grown steadily heavier as i walked i wasntsure if this was due to the diminishing charm or my definite lack of arm muscle the bar was dimly lit and shabby only a few customers occupied the tables no one was at the bar except for the bartender a bald toothless old man you lost missy he asked me looking concerned no i was looking for mr armstrong round back go through that door he pointed to a shadowy doorway to my left and take a right i followed his directions exactly finally coming to what looked like a large supply closet a man in dark blue robes appeared to be counting sets of folded sheets mr armstrong i asked hesitantly he turned around at once and smiled lydia carmichael yes sir he waved one hand in the air call me matthew everyone does step into my office and we ll talk by office he apparently meant the supply closet i noticed after a moment that there was a tiny messy desk in one corner now he said if amanda is telling the truth you re in some kind of family trouble and need a job and a place to stay i nodded wordlessly you re in luck then i just had to let two of my maids go and we re in a bit of a pinch summer always busy i how old are you lydia almost twelve sir i answered matthew he corrected well in that case i canthave you waiting tables or anything but we could use a dishwasher and i sure alley and danielle would love some help with housekeeping normally i give room and board and a little money on saturdays that acceptable to you yes s matthew excellent let say a trial run of two weeks then breakfast at seven in the kitchen and then you can help with the washing up until oh ten o clock guests check out at noon so if you ll help with the housecleaning until two and come back down from six til eight thirty or so for washing up we ll call it a day tea at four thirty and you ll have sundays off of course and twelve sickles a week pocket money that sound fair i nodded and he drew up a rough contract just so everything above the table which we both signed well then i ll take you to your room and then we ll introduce you around at tea of course i wontexpect you to start work tonight no i interrupted i d like to get started right away oooooo tea was a loud boisterous affair besides matthew and me there were five other people sitting around a large oak table in the middle of the kitchen ingrid callahan the cook sonia armstrong matthew cheerful looking wife and alice call me alley she said everybody does a tall girl with impossibly straight hair sitting next to her was another girl very pretty named danielle the two of them waited tables and cleaned up the guest rooms a man named greg sat on danielle other side he had to be six feet tall and he looked like he could lift a small house danielle called him greggie poo i made up my mind not to make him angry so um lydia alley said after sonia loaded my plate with sandwiches and fruit you re not like pregnant right i choked on my tea sonia said alice and danielle smacked her lightly but they all seemed to be waiting for my answer anyway er no i replied slowly i eleven i was just wondering alley added a little defensively ignore her danielle told me we re glad you re here because it all really too much for the two of us and sonia is really too busy to help us and you donthave to tell us why you re here either i smiled hesitantly at her and she grinned back oooooo my tiny room at the leaky cauldron was up in the attic with a sharply sloping roof and a skylight which opened over my bed it didnttake me long to unpack clothes in the cherry bureau books and potions equipment on the shelf carnivorous plants by the windows i d had to leave some of the larger ones with professor sprout for the summer by six o clock i was on my way downstairs the kitchen was crowded with food ingrid was bent over a large pot on the stove alley ducked in long enough to grab two steaming bowls sonia tossed me an apron and pointed at the sink which was already overflowing with dirty dishes after tying the apron around my waist i ran the hot water and started to wash the dishes by eight i had finished most of the washing up only two of the guests remained downstairs it doesntusually get too busy until the end of july danielle explained and then it gets crazy and ingrid had put the leftover food away and was helping me scrub the pots out lydia danielle asked me after a moment do you have any any robes that aren t well your school uniform one or two i answered her why it just that you ll want to save your robes for school they arentpractical for working and they ll be too hot i donthave much money i told her slowly get them secondhand she responded immediately and anyway it ll save wear on your school robes those are the really expensive ones when do you get off tomorrow um two okay i ll take you on thursday that my day off oooooo shopping secondhand in a small store at one end of diagon alley was much different from shopping at madam malkin or twillfit and tatting s there i would wait while someone measured me and discussed styles and colors with my mother all purchases would be sent home later this store was filled with racks of robes shelves of hats and rows of shoes following danielle lead i rifled through the robes pausing every now and again to look more closely at something i liked danielle was much faster than i and had a knack for looking at a set of robes for a split second before saying that ll rip easily or the color isntreally you it took hours before we found three summer robes that we both liked one a light blue purple one in acid green it very now danielle maintained and one in emerald green together they cost two galleons i handed the money over regretfully until i was paid the only money i had was what was left of harry christmas money there danielle said after we d left now you can put your school robes away they should last you another year this way and besides there no need to announce to the world that you re a hogwarts student come on let walk a little faster if we re late for tea greg will eat all the chocolate chip cookies oooooo by the end of that week my days had already settled into the pattern they would follow for the rest of the summer my clock woke me up at six thirty with a cheery rise and shine duckling by seven i was dressed and downstairs where breakfast was waiting ingrid made the best sausage i d ever eaten and danielle treated me like a younger sister giving me background information on all the gossip alley shared with her most of this seemed to revolve around who was sleeping with whom occasionally ingrid would decide something wasntappropriate for me to hear and insist that we start working alley and danielle waited tables which meant they got tips and always had something interesting to talk about on their breaks did you see the way he was feeling her up under the table danielle might whisper as alley nodded in agreement i washed all the dishes and let ingrid feed me small pieces of bacon or biscuit she thought i was too skinny and for the most part just tried to stay out of everyone way after breakfast i had around two hours to spend in my tiny attic room mixing up potions and working on the homework we d been assigned for the summer most of the reading was interesting and the essays were all right but the potions making was downright dangerous i d already managed to stain my acid green robes on one sleeve and i d almost set the leaky cauldron on fire twice brewing some pepperup potion i was always careful to clean up thoroughly and not to mention what i was doing i didntwant anyone seeing the potions brewing on my dresser and forbidding me from working eli had been right the only possible way i was going to manage was through adult allies and that meant keeping matthew happy it also meant somehow convincing snape to like me and that in turn meant succeeding in potions unless of course i blew myself up first i met alley and danielle downstairs just before noon to start housekeeping technically i was only supposed to clean the empty rooms but that wasntalways the case during my first three days i was threatened by a hag and had to dodge a curse from a snooty looking witch after that danielle checked the rooms before i went into them i spent my afternoons exploring diagon alley the alley extended for miles and it was generally crowded i window shopped and tried to remain constantly aware my goal was to return to hogwarts in september able to do what zach could do that is to always know how many people were around me and where exactly they were i spent hours in flourish and blotts and the magical menagerie testing myself a substantial tea was served at four thirty each afternoon that was when greg arrived his job was to act as a bouncer of sorts and make sure that bar fights didntget out of hand alley said he was really rather like a very huggable teddy bear but i preferred not to get too close anyway after tea greg moved into the bar and alley and danielle started waiting tables i went back upstairs to read or write letters until i started washing dishes again around six i worked until just after eight thirty it was a very busy two and a half hours and neither alley nor danielle had a moment to talk to me usually i went straight to bed afterwards reading in bed for only a few minutes before falling asleep it was a busy summer and mostly i was quite lonely oooooooooooooo a n i still dontown the potterverse sorry of course anything jkr doesntown is mine and if you steal it that would just be mean rosiy and anna i assuming that was you bakker thanks muchly for your reviews i loved them and rosiy the next chapter longer i promise because i love reviews which is a hint to the

really sad and i think my dad parents might still be alive but i dontknow them anyway my family all weird and i dontlike them yours sounds nice is that everyone all the woods and then your cousins on the other side that sounds like a lot i dontknow what you re talking about about the history of magic exam i got good marks because i studied all the slytherins did we had group study sessions marissa came pernella rosewater came you could have come too only you were off at quidditch practice you make it sound like we somehow cheated love lydia oooooo 14 july dear lydia i didntmean to say that you d cheated just that you must have done something to remember it all my family is and i not drawing a tree because that too long so there me daddy and papa then papa has one sister four brothers two sisters in law one brother in law three nieces and five nephews plus his parents daddy has his parents his sister her husband and his daddy s not the husband s aunt and i have a sister too helen she 28 and the most amazing sister ever she lives in london but she has a room here and sometimes she stays overnight she did it more when i was younger she d be a good person to talk to if you know you wanted to talk about your nonfamily write back love from lyra oooooo july 20 2012 dear lyra so helen your non adopted sister what about your real parents oh guess what i went into knockturn alley today it was so incredibly amazing i only walked along the street i didntgo into any of the shops but there was one that sold these books with the most interesting titles stuff like thought you were safe did you and constant vigilance all in capitals which sounds kind of crazy doesntit but then after a while this man started following me he looked kind of gross and i was almost late for tea anyway so i went back to the leaky cauldron i realized i never told you about the people there there me of course and then alison alley and danielle who are much older than us and they are waitresses danielle says they re almost out of school but that they dontgo to hogwarts i dontknow why anyone wouldntgo to hogwarts but i didntwant to say that as she been so nice to me then there greg he gigantic over six feet and he really strong he wonttell me what his job is exactly just that he keeps the place safe so i guess he my protection against all the evil wizards you think are hiding out here and there ingrid callahan the cook she very pretty and she has a very slight accent i dontknow where it from but it very pretty and then tom who ancient and has no teeth or hair he runs the bar in the evenings and then mr and mrs armstrong matthew and her name is sonia and they own the inn and run it and everything they re really nice i like them a lot oh i ve got to send this i late for work love lydia oooooo 23 july dear lydia papa and daddy are my real parents i dontknow anything about my mum except that she died and i have another dad somewhere but he never been to see me or helen since i was born and so i dontcare about him my dads are better than he could ever be anyway and helen would have been my adopted sister too except that when i was adopted she said she was too old to be adopted so she just stayed on her own she very clever i think she would have been a ravenclaw but she didntgrow up in britain so she my sister and papa and daddy are her sort of dads because they re my dads does that make sense i dontknow how to say it more clearly than that i think the people at the leaky cauldron sound nice also safe and you shouldntgo into knockturn alley alone next time owl me and i ll come i stronger than you and i ll protect us if some weirdo shows up lots of love lyra ps history of magic passed how please i need to know papa says if i dontdo better next year he ll take me off the team oooooo july 25 2012 dear lyra all right all right i only passed because evan explained it all to us a few times and then wrote it out so we could study he quite good at stories and he loves history so it the perfect combination plus when he there marissa and cameron dontattack each other as much anyway i understand what you mean about your family i think helen your real sister your dads are your real dads and they arentrelated right what does your sister do like as a job love lydia oooooo 31 july dear lydia i was thinking maybe what we ought to do next year is a study group i mean you said rookwood was really good at history and you re doing potions this summer and marissa was in charms with me she excellent and i good at astronomy and jill jill holmes do you remember her she was in our compartment for the train ride likes transfiguration and we can find people who like herbology and dada and everything and then we ll all be good at everything wouldntthat be awesome tell me what you think helen is well i dontknow what she does let me go ask she downstairs talking to papa here she says she does a little of everything but mostly she thinks about things i dontknow what kind of a job that is but i think it sounds awfully boring love lyra oooooo august 4 2012 dear lyra i think that is the best idea you ve ever had between us all we can get good marks in everything and plus studying more fun in a group you know you do one answer i do the other then we swap i asked evan what kind of a job that is and he says he never heard of it but that it what he wants to do but i agree with you it booooring i mean thinking okay and all and i reckon it would even be fun a little but you cantmake things happen that way and that the fun part someday i going to make something happen and it going to be so big and huge that everyone will say wow look at lydia carmichael isntshe the most amazing person you ve ever met and i guess you ll be a big important quidditch star and people will think wow arentthey brilliant and everyone will love us but i serious someday people are going to come to me when they want things to happen and i ll make sure they do love lydia oooooo 8 august dear lydia i guess that good and all but i think that it would get very tiring you d have to do all sorts of nasty things i would think to get stuff to work out right not like that and wouldntit just be better to have everyone love you for winning the quidditch cup for england for the first time in 234 years which is embarrassing not that i mind it much when say ireland wins instead but you know canada won last year canada they flattened us when we played against them 365 10 and then they went and beat ireland for the cup i think they cheated if you re still reading this letter i ll stop talking about quidditch i ll talk about something else how about i miss you i very glad to be home but i miss school and everything it so boring without being able to use magic papa says i cantbreak the law and daddy says he right even though i know daddy used to use it love lyra oooooo august 11 2012 dear lyra quidditch doesntmean doing things not like making them happy it just a game isntit i dontsee what the big deal is i miss you too and school and especially not having to wash dishes mostly i just miss not being the youngest i mean i am the youngest at school but not noticeably not like here where the closest people are almost twenty and that like a decade but only nineteen more days to go that less than three weeks i have to go perseus wants to go out hunting and i tired and i dontfeel very well everything just seems all wrong i want my mother lyra and i so sick of wanting my mother because she obviously doesntwant me but i just want my parents

taken the morning off to walk with me to the station and i nervously introduced her to lyra and her parents mr weasley was tall and thin with red hair and glasses and mr wood was shorter and stockier with light brown hair and a slight scottish accent as the adults stood talking oh i just a family friend mrs armstrong was saying lyra tugged me in the direction of a nearby washroom well she demanded once we were inside what happened what with harry what did he say when you told him i shifted uncomfortably well i didn t tell him i mean lyra stared at me in disbelief why not i dontknow i said i didn t i couldn t why couldntyou she demanded not understanding at all i just couldn t lyra dontyou understand i cantdo this without him i cantlose him too woah calm down she told me anxiously why would he disown you he your godfather he loves you my parents loved me i retorted and bit back a sob lyra immediately pulled me into a hug apologizing profusely i cried onto her shoulder for a few minutes and then embarrassed pulled away and wiped off my face sorry i muttered i just lost it i guess i feel so stupid no it fine lyra reassured me i just think i think you ought to talk to him that all i mean maybe he already knows doesnthe write to your parents maybe they ve already told him dontbe daft lyra if they d told him he would ve said something and anyway they wouldn t i bet they re telling everyone everything okay why would they let people know they d disowned their daughter lyra sighed yeah i reckon you re right but still you could tell him he the boy who lived he the one who saved i rolled my eyes that doesntmean anything lyra he loves my dad i dontwant to make him choose just because he loves your dad doesntmean he ll hate you you ve got to tell him we re going to be late i interrupted so let go lyra followed me still protesting onto the train and into the nearest compartment where cameron and aaron trimble were sitting cameron looked up when we entered and visibly relaxed oh good it you two i looked around nervously who else would it be he afraid marissa will come hex him evan explained from behind me lyra grinned why would she hex you what d you do cameron glared at her why does everyone always think it my fault he demanded everyone always aaron pretended to look thoughtful maybe he suggested it because it always is your fault that not true aaron smirked think about it who put frogs in the bed of the headmistress at your orphanage that might have been me cameron admitted and the bottomless glasses the headless hats the hiccouph sweets who put those out where small children might get at them cameron grinned me and who evan asked as he moved to sit next to me sent marissa chocolates that turned her skin purple well cameron said slowly although i suppose that was probably me i would like to point out that i had no way of knowing that she would take it so seriously dontpanic aaron trimble said softly but she headed this way cameron whimpered slightly hide me please someone hide me distract her tell her i ve transferred i ve gone to live with my cousin mary in america cameron viridian you are so dead marissa screeched as she strode into our compartment if you ever even think about sending me anything that does anything to my skin or my hair or anything else i will hunt you down and then i will cause you lots and lots of pain and it will hurt got it cameron nodded slowly carefully moving his hands away from his face got it he whispered good she snapped and turned to face the rest of us with a broad satisfied grin how was everyone summer anyone do anything interesting i went to a quidditch game lyra burst out the semi final for the cup peru and russia it was amazing aaron looked at her with newfound respect you mean the one that lasted twelve hours where the russian beaters kept getting fouled for actually beating people instead of hitting bludgers at them you were there lyra nodded it was the most incredible thing in the world i almost died it was so good and we were way up top too we had the best seats in the world marissa caught my gaze and rolled her eyes it was going to be a very very long ride oooooo oh look alicia whispered in my ear the firsties look all scared you think we were that small i whispered back my gaze following the forty odd children slowly filing into the great hall you re still that small maddison hissed so shut up and watch the sorting alicia and i rolled our eyes and alicia stuck out her tongue behind maddison back she such a snob i muttered ackerley brendan professor rufford called and a small boy with orange hair stepped up to place the hat on his head hufflepuff knew it cameron whispered next to me as berkley rebecca took his place and her she ll be a ravenclaw ravenclaw would you please shut up maddison hissed at him i trying to listen would you please shut up he mimicked i trying to listen the rest of us silently cheered him on in the scuffle that followed and by the time cameron had declared victory snape was glaring at us and odgen morgana was sitting on the stool hat low over her eyes she ll be a slytherin cameron whispered confidently see the sinister smirk cameron the hat completely covers her face you can sense the smirk slytherin see told you cameron uncanny ability to foretell the sorting continued through alexandra rockwell gryffindor solomon scarpin slytherin and valerie tobin ravenclaw this is creepy i whispered to alicia he got to mess up sometime but there are only two left she replied quietly that doesntlook very promising seriously how do you think he does it no idea alicia muttered williamson loretta snape called and i turned to ask evan whether he thought cameron would be able to guess this one correctly that was when i noticed his face had gone completely white and his eyes were wide tentatively i poked him in the arm evan you all right after a moment he shook himself and glanced up at me it fine cameron muttered you looked freaked did you see something did something happen no evan insisted it fine but as soon as the headmistress finished her announcements he left the great hall at a very brisk walk what the hell was that all about aaron asked watching evan leave i have no idea i replied taking a bite of potato but it weird yeah alicia said and we missed the end of the sorting cameron grinned that williams kid hufflepuff and the other one the last one gryffindor she narrowed her eyes at him how do you do that simple alicia simple all one has to do is to carefully examine the souls of that such crap viridian maddison cut across everyone knows only an extremely powerful legilimens could even begin any idea what she talking about lydia cameron interrupted cause i ve got no clue maybe you re a seer cam aaron suggested as if cameron retorted offended everyone knows divination isntreal magic it just full of frauds it an easy class john pointed out you ought to take it cameron maybe your talent for sorting kids ll turn into something else like what cameron asked interested despite his obvious contempt for the subject well john said slowly you might find out you were an actual seer or alicia said excitedly you could start a business you know seeing the future for a price plenty of people would pay loads to hear you tell them how successful they re going to be i agreed you could be famous and rich aaron added dontforget rich i could do rich cameron said thoughtfully rich and famous i like that okay alicia said everyone wants rich and famous but what if you could only have one you could be tremendously fabulously wealthy or everyone could know your name which do you pick money john said immediately who cares if everyone knows me i can buy happiness i can buy love it gotta be fame aaron countered eternal glory it d be like being immortal only not maddison snapped because you d still wind up dead sheesh cameron muttered what eating her i shrugged i with john wealth is better you can buy influence even if no one knows who you are what about love aaron asked you cantbuy love how many galleons are we talking about alicia responded slowly i mean for the right amount of money thousands cameron asked her millions millions billions it would have to be say the malfoy or the azwal fortune or both there was a general nod of agreement cameron speculation on the exact value of those fortunes was interrupted by henry mchugh a seventh year prefect who leaned over to whisper password sugarplum fairy come up whenever you re ready oooooo where maddison alicia asked me a few weeks later i was curled up with a potions essay in a large squishy armchair alicia had smuggled in and she was finishing the reading for charms no idea library maybe you know she doesntlike to hang out with us yeah because she a mudblood snob she half and half i corrected and it not like it matters anyway alicia crossed her arms i just dontthink people like that should be at hogwarts let alone in slytherin do you know that some experts think they should really be classified as beasts not beings alicia that such crap look at maddison i mean sure she a jerk and stuff but she still smarter than we are whatever alicia muttered anyway let not talk about her i wanted to tell you i saw my dad over break you what your dad on the run right she nodded so you canttell anyone or they might put my mum in azkaban for not turning him in which is stupid because who would turn their husband in especially because he innocent i nodded slowly i didntreally believe he hadntat least been one of voldemort supporters alicia had to get her anti muggle dogma from somewhere right what he like i mean is this the first time you ve seen him no he comes sometimes it the first time bethy that my little sister elizabeth really saw him though because mum was afraid she was too young to keep it a secret before but he came on christmas eve and we opened presents and everything he brought me this really pretty locket see i leaned forward to peer at a small gold locket on a thin chain he been living in brazil for the last year or so he says he moves around a lot he really really amazing though and he and mum are still completely in love even after everything why dontyou all go live with him alicia looked down mum says the ministry wontlet us leave until they find him because they re all muggle lovers and dontreally care about wizards i sighed muggles are people too people think they re really beasts remember because they re not capable look alicia can we not at that point maddison opened the door a piece of parchment in one hand i ve figured it out she proclaimed figured what out alicia asked rolling her eyes why evan flipped out at the sorting she explained coolly and if you two had thought a little you would have figured it out too oh alicia retorted you think you re so special dontyou stop i yelled maddison just tell us and stop being so high and mighty she rolled her eyes muttering i am surrounded by morons maddison i was half afraid she wouldntsay anything but she was apparently too proud of herself to keep it quiet i went to the library it this big collection of books you wouldntknow it alicia and looked through old daily prophet articles there a death notice annabel and peter williamson killed by death eaters on 26 may 2003 and then three days later julian and rachel rookwood arrested for the murders of annabel and peter williamson i sure my face was as blank as alicia s maddison let out an audible sigh are you two both complete imbeciles i ll explain in small words his parents death eaters her parents killed by them so evan got a guilty conscious because his parents offed some little puff parents alicia summarized it conscience you idiot maddison snapped and alicia threw a pillow at her damn i said quietly in an attempt to stop their fight that going to be really awkward awkward maddison repeated his parents made her an orphan and the only reason they even got caught is because they didntkill the baby and so the neighbors heard her crying so she the reason he basically parentless this isntgoing to be awkward it going to be torture do we tell him we know alicia asked me slowly no i said over maddison affirmative response if he wants us to know he ll tell us at that moment there was a knock at the door and sarah portsmouth poked her head inside oi lydia zach wants to see you in the common room pronto he says to bring your defense books she winked at me and i grinned in response although i hadntdone any actual magic over the summer i was fairly confident in my abilities tell him i ll be there in five i replied and stood to find my books oooooooooooooo a n as always dontown dontsteal chapter two down a black marble staircase it was only my pride that kept me from screaming crying or fainting instead i walked to the table at the far left and sat down smiling hesitantly at my new housemates and attempting to look like i was watching the rest of the sorting although my body was reacting automatically i barely heard the names of the students being sorted or even their houses it was only the final name wood lyra that caught my attention please be slytherin please be slytherin please be gryffindor damn at that moment the headmistress stood up welcome to hogwarts new students i hope you ll be happy here i am professor vector for those of you who dontknow me now let the feast begin with these words platters of food appeared on the tables and students began to fill their plates i found i wasntactually hungry and halfheartedly took a slice of bread from a nearby basket nibbling on it i looked around at the table it was much emptier than any of the others are we always this empty i asked no one wants to be a slytherin a black haired boy across from me explained we re evil you know i zach wenlock he added lydia carmichael i said trying to smile ah you didntwant to be a slytherin did you i managed to shake my head you ll learn he told me it better to be one of us pays off in the end have some potatoes with that he heaped a sickeningly large mound onto my empty plate the feast passed slowly enough i drank little and ate less waiting until i could curl up somewhere and cry at last the headmistress rose again now that you have all eaten i have some start of term notices to share with you first years should know that the forbidden forest is off limits to all students mr filch has requested i remind you that magic is not permitted in the corridors between classes other contraband items are posted on his office door for your convenience quidditch tryouts are to be held next week and interested students should check with madam hooch as to the set times madam hooch has also asked me to relay to you that the request by certain hufflepuff students to form a cheerleading squad has been denied further appeals on the matter must be made in writing to the board of governors if house prefects would lead the first years to their common rooms the term will begin we clapped politely and then everyone began to stand first years over here please a harassed looking young woman called to us we shuffled toward her slowly this all of you all right then follow carefully please we dontwant to lose anyone it took me a moment to realize that by we she meant herself and a quiet scrawny looking boy they were both i assumed prefects the girl led us down several sets of staircases until we stopped in front of a blank stone wall this she said clearly is the entrance to the slytherin common room it opens only by our password which is resurgemus at her words a door appeared in the middle of the wall and opened outward in the girl instructed and we quickly obeyed walking into a low ceilinged room with dim greenish lighting and a slowly dying fire right the girl continued this is the slytherin common room girls dormitories are down the black staircase first years want the last room on the right boys you re down the white staircase i amanda wilkes and this is eli rosier we re the seventh year prefects in slytherin and it our job to make sure you lot hold up over this year and especially over these first few weeks many of you are probably excited and ready to begin your year here you ve probably heard wonderful stories of your parents or siblings time here dontbe so optimistic i ll warn you now the other students will hurt you they will hate you they will try to bring you down we wontstop them you re going to have to make it on your own she paused fight your own battles hold your own council there is only one rule in this house and it is this never apologize the world hates us for being in slytherin they want us to recognize our house as a mistake or a punishment and to apologize for it never oblige them tomorrow you ll get your schedules and begin classes if any of you here her expression turned doubtful are planning on playing quidditch this year talk to rosier now off to your rooms your trunks are already there i followed a chestnut haired girl down the black marble staircase near the fireplace when we reached the last door on the right she stopped here it is i guess of course that us a second girl told her snappily cantyou read and sure enough the silver plaque on the door read in engraved script first years carmichael travers and whisp pushing past us she opened the door i maddison whisp she added over her shoulder we followed her in i alicia travers the chestnut haired girl told me you d be carmichael lydia carmichael yeah i said walking to my trunk i had the bed farthest from the door and next to the sole window which confused me werentwe underground where does the window look out alicia asked me i not i began to say but maddison cut me off it doesn t we re underground remember half the common room under the lake we re nearly there as well the window magical it enchanted to show people when you need it to but normally it looks over the north atlantic honestly she said after a pause didnteither of you do any reading on hogwarts before you came here never mind she continued before we could answer i should have guessed i began to unpack not bothering to answer her my trunk was completely filled but there was a cupboard next to my bed for the smaller things i hadntnoticed my roommates following my example but in the next hour our room began to look more like a home maddison had brought portraits and landscapes in silver frames which she fastened on the walls around the room alicia unpacked a silver coat tree upon which she immediately hung two hats and a cloak feel free to use it too she told us i took out several carnivorous plants placing them in unused corners this earned me odd looks from my roommates in case of unwanted visitors i explained besides we ve plenty of space this was an understatement the room was clearly meant to hold upwards of five and there were only three of us anyway i done unpacking any ideas about which direction the bathroom in as if listening to me a mahogany door appeared behind the door was a bathroom half the size of our room complete with two large black marble bathtubs that takes care of that i said with a smile i wrote my first letter home that night in a comfortable leather chair near the fire dear mum and dad i wrote that was the easy bit the hard part was also the most important i ve been sorted into slytherin i wanted to write i like it so far the common room is drafty a bit and a little cold and dark but that too be expected since we re under the lake i find it rather cozy myself i didn t really i was cold and tired and wanted my parents and i was desperately afraid my parents would never forgive me for being sorted into slytherin for being evil dear mum and dad i began again i ve been sorted into slytherin the ceremony was wonderful i didntrealize the food here was so good not like yours mum though i stopped this was moving too quickly dear mum and dad i wrote once more the train ride wasntbad coming up i sat with a girl named lyra and we talked most of the way i gave her the last card she needed for her collection and she promised me a ride on her broomstick when she gets it i think we re going to be great friends even though we re in different houses your house cantmake that much difference right i mean the founders were all great friends i read over what i had written somehow it seemed wrong to me to share lyra with my parents she was too special too important and besides i was straying from the point of the letter dear mum and dad i carefully printed the sorting took longer than i expected i was so nervous when professor rufford called my name and then the hat took so long with me that letter was the hardest one i had ever had to write and i used more parchment that night than i ever did at one sitting before or after it was long after midnight when i copied the final draft neatly onto a monogrammed sheet of parchment dear mum and dad the train ride was fun and not as long as i expected and so was the ride across the lake i was too excited and nervous to take in much though so i not sure what the grounds look like i stood with another girl named lyra during the sorting as professor rufford he the deputy headmaster read the names out i was called third or so and the hat took so long to decide to put me in slytherin my table seemed happy to get me though i was the second this year and the feast was excellent afterwards the prefects lead us to our common room which is partly under the lake it a good dorm i think my bed next to the window farthest away from the door and nearly all my things are unpacked already the letter itself was several pages long and i ended it with a scrawled signature i was very proud of my name lydia medea carmichael and my signature took up a good deal of the last page i sealed the letter with the special red wax my father had bought me and smiled sadly more than ready to go to bed looking up in the middle of a yawn i saw a grim looking ghost covered in some silvery substance er hello sir i said nervously there was no answer but i wasntsure i needed one i lydia carmichael when he still didntrespond i added i new this year still he was silent i ll just be going to bed then i told him backing slowly out of the room when i reached my room i related the experience to maddison and alicia who was he what with the blood i asked maddison stared at me where were you during dinner that the bloody baron the slytherin ghost we were introduced at the feast oh i said i must not have remembered why he so bloody no one knows alicia told me anyway it bedtime the three of us changed into pajamas and got into bed in the middle of our goodnights maddison suddenly exclaimed oh what now i asked the canopy above my four poster as maddison jumped out of bed and muttered an incantation peering through the bed curtains i saw several dozen globes of assorted colors floating near the ceiling maddison it gorgeous i murmured i sent my letter off with perseus my owl before wandering down to breakfast the next morning amanda wilkes was handing out our schedules and tersely answering questions the entire house seemed nervous on edge and so much smaller than any of the others i scanned the other tables lingering over the boisterous and full gryffindor table and caught lyra eye smiling hesitantly she grinned back somewhat heartened i looked down at my schedule it took me a moment to find wednesday classes i had charms first with professor flitwick as i reached for a piece of toast what seemed like hundreds of owls flew into the great hall dropping letters and packages into various laps i looked up to see a small parcel and caught it in midair there was a note attached i opened that first good morning lydia i hope you re making new friends and you re ready for your first day of classes how gryffindor is the tower as comfortable as it was in my day you ll have to find time to write home and tell us about your classes and friends i sure gryffindor as lively as it was when i was there if not more so your mother wrapped up some things for you in the parcel i ve no idea what they are but i sure you needed them love dad i swallowed looking down at the page they didntknow i was a slytherin that meant they wouldntfind out unless i told them unless they got my letter i choked down my toast and ran to the owlery as fast as i could praying perseus had stayed for some reason when i finally reached the very top of the west tower i knew even without whistling for him that perseus had already gone i turned and ran blindly back to my room flinging myself onto my four poster bed i buried my face in the pillow slytherins didntcry we were cunning cutthroat and other nasty adjectives but we didntcry hadntjohn avery said as much when we saw a hufflepuff girl crying last night hufflepuffs are like that not us though we slytherins arentcrybabies i made up my mind that moment that if i couldntbe a gryffindor i wouldnteven try i would be a slytherin instead i rolled over onto my back and lay there for only a little while staring at the ceiling i would be a slytherin it was a terrible awesome thought a slytherin like the dark lord a slytherin like my grandmother the idea was enough to make me tremble as i lay there in the semi dark contemplating black thoughts of my future i had another horrible revelation i was going to be late for my first class i jumped up jamming a standard book of spells grade one into my bag already carefully packed with quills and parchment checked to make sure i had my wand and ran out the door disclaimer i dontown anything jkr does i do own everything else dontsteal it bad for your mental health a n the slytherin password is latin for we will rise again my thanks to my beta readers julia amelie emily and helena now review chapter twenty study group hello lydia zach wenlock greeted me as i approached although i couldntsee his face i could hear his grin hi zach i replied allowing myself a grin of my own it was very good to see him again what did you do this summer lots of stuff lots of girls trying my best to up our stats you know he boasted our what i asked completely confused our stats snogging stats every house calculates based on percentage of students involved in relationships gryffindor on top now this is why you should never shag a gryffindor lydia anyway i was doing my part to up our stats sarah portsmouth snickered from somewhere behind us it only counts if you re consistently with someone zach a random fling doesntgive us anything well it the thought that counts he grumbled and then brightened hey lydia what about your year are you guys ready to help us shoulder the cause defend the slytherin principles keep they re twelve years old sarah interrupted rolling her eyes you re sick zach leave her alone she too young for all that zach sighed heavily and shrugged all right fine see if you can hold your head up though when we have fewer couples than hufflepuff lydia have you been practicing i grinned and nodded all summer i told him proudly excellent then we ll begin hex me i was sure zach was expecting me to hesitate and i certainly was startled but all the same i held my wand at the ready and yelled rictusempra zach narrowly deflected the curse and laughed a little as he faced me you have been practicing told you i spent all summer making potions memorizing hexes and being aware how many people in this room then he asked smirking twenty two i replied matching his smirk with one of my own six on the seventh year couch seven around the big chess set three in the corner near the door three studying at the big table and you and i and sarah nice sarah told me you ever hear of this bloke moody he was an auror one of the ministry best i read about him over the summer he was big into the awareness stuff constant vigilance was what he called it why dontyou read about him lydia zach suggested you re only a second year how much can you have to do i glared at him they re assigning us loads of work zach and i have all your stuff to do and i have to ace potions why sarah started slowly is potions so important because rosier said last year that if i was good at potions then snape might really like me and i need adults to really like me because of the whole thing with my parents i paused anyway i like potions sarah nodded he does have crazy connections that ll help you long run enough talking you two zach interrupted lydia let try that again oooooooooo as the weeks went by i began to realize why most of the older students seemed so stressed out and tired the work was piling up my teachers apparently satisfied that as second years we were finally settled into boarding school life had started adding more and more work suddenly my entire year was sitting up late into the night studying practicing and writing essay after essay professor flitwick especially seemed to enjoy assigning essays if my summer had taught me anything it had made it painfully clear to me that i did not want to spend the rest of my life washing dishes in a second rate hotel i was going to be somebody somebody big and that meant i had to excel in all of my classes and of course my potions grade had to be perfect which meant i agonized over each essay and each experiment until i was sure nothing was incorrect all of this took a ton of time and it was lyra who first mentioned it to me i never see you she told me quietly as we sat in a deserted corner of the library looking over our charms notes before a test and you look crazy tired i dontsleep a lot i confessed there just so much to do and i feel like i dontsee any of my friends ever she looked thoughtfully at the parchment in front of her remember when i said we should have a study group no of course you do i wrote to you over the summer and said we should get a whole group and then we can meet every night and do all our work we ve all got the same teachers and the same syllabi so we can just divide stuff up or do it as a group it ll be more fun and it ll take way less time her face had lit up as it did whenever she had an interesting idea and her hands were slicing through the air come on lydia it d be so much fun what like in the library wontwe be too loud we could meet in an empty classroom or something come on she urged me eagerly it ll be much more fun i nodded warming to the idea evan brilliant at history and cameron could come and he could bring food too see you think it a good idea too she cried grinning at me thursday night at seven that after quidditch practice where i asked her i ll ask flitwick if we can use his room and she hesitated awkwardly donttake this the wrong way okay okay i said slowly looking at her nervously it just dontbring too many slytherins okay i mean rookwood and viridian are okay i guess but well travers and avery and mcnair arentvery very what i demanded angrily lyra just because they re slytherins or whatever it not that she said quickly i mean their parents were death eaters right and they re all anti muggle you know that i glared at her look i not saying they re evil or anything just that they can be really mean then you cantbring bagnold either i snapped or thickey because they re both jerks okay she said calmly i won t i nodded slowly breathing deeply i knew she hadntmeant to sound so awful really and she was telling the truth adrian and alicia both considered muggles to be some kind of highly intelligent animal and although john would never out and say it he thought the same thing okay i replied finally i ll see if evan and cam want to come and marissa too wait what about me marissa voice sounded from behind me and i turned around to see her regarding us with a quizzical expression study group i explained like a party only with homework a study party marissa asked with interest that sounds like it might be fun are we having food i thought cameron might bring some from the kitchens i told her he there all the time anyway no way she retorted you cantlet him give innocent people food he ll hex it and turn them purple i ll bring the food you just think about restraining him petrifying him might be a good way to do it marissa what it would people who turn other people purple dontdeserve a normal life not this again i sighed exchanging a grin with lyra marissa had still not forgiven cameron for the trick chocolates and she was prone to threatening vengeance it looked like a prank war might be somewhere on the horizon oooooooooo i was excited and nervous enough about the study group to wake up early on thursday morning next to me alicia was still sleeping curled deep under her blankets alicia slept later than anyone in our year she never went to breakfast preferring the extra thirty minutes of sleep to the energy food would give her maddison of course never missed breakfast usually she was in the bath when i woke up today though she was still asleep i checked the clock 5 15 sun rising and stretched there was something peaceful about the early morning peace that made me feel quiet even contemplative i was entirely content and that was a feeling that happened rarely enough for me to want it to last as long as possible i happy i said to the still air perfectly happy in fact the year so far had been much better than the beginning of my first year i was no longer a scared firstie and my parents or more accurately lack thereof no longer kept me up at night i thought it had helped that i wasntthe only one without parents out of the eight of us only maddison adrian and aaron actually lived with both parents alicia father was on the run cameron parents were dead evan were serving life sentences in azkaban no one actually knew whether john parents were alive or not he lived with his grandparents maybe we were all a little screwed up abandonment issues maddison said but at least we were all equally screwed up and that made a lot of difference somehow perfectly happy i repeated into the chilly air curling into a ball and i warm and under the covers and cozy and happy with that thought i snuggled deeper into my covers and closed my eyes dozing off for a few more hours oooooooooo the rest of the day continued in the same vein as my morning nothing seemed capable of dampening my mood by the time seven o clock rolled around i was so cheerful i was almost bouncing lyra looked at me with a slightly panicked expression as people started to pull chairs into a rough circle um she started glancing at me for support we thought we d just start the assignments and that we could kind of do them together we ve got someone who knows what they re doing in every class so so does everyone know everyone else i broke in looking around the circle evan and cameron sat together then marissa and pernella then lyra and jill holmes and matthew hornby i didntknow matthew much at all and had only spoken to jill once or twice i saw evan looking uncomfortable and cameron squirmed in his seat but everyone nodded i brought food marissa offered pumpkin juice and sugar cookies and i cantget my astro maps accurate enough for crowley we passed the cookies and juice around and matthew started to draw lines on the blackboard basically it all about just making sure you re really accurate when you plot the positions initially we were there until almost ten that night practicing different spells and going over theory until everyone understood the assignments due the next day it was a little awkward at first as a group we had never actually hung out together and matthew and cameron had been caught in a group of fighting slytherins and gryffindors the week before but pernella was totally oblivious to the tension in the room and marissa was completely comfortable throwing questions out at people so we managed all right if no one chose to comment on the obvious segregation by house well that was all right we did it lyra remarked with some surprise as everyone left we did it and no one get hexed i grinned at her same time tomorrow definitely she replied in fact i think this ought to be a nightly thing with you on that one i said emphatically gathering my books and yawning i followed lyra out of the classroom where we parted she to the gryffindor common room and i to the slytherin dungeons oooooooooo a n as always i dontown the potterverse just lydia and co ambika san and haleth aldea beta ed this for me they are wonderful people and you should send happy thoughts to them i apologize for the mega long delay for this chapter nanowrimo took over my life for 30 days and 50 144 words which was awesome but i didnthave any time for anything else reviews please amabo te chapter twenty one inter house friendships our study group met every school night after that for the next few months working out essay outlines and study guides for each class after the first few weeks i started bringing my cauldron with me so we could redo the potions from class between the eight of us we could master any assignment and our grades were steadily improving although i wasntsure snape either noticed or cared he was pleasant to the slytherins and hostile to the gryffindors as always i caught vector giving us piercing looks and more than once i met fawcett eyes only to see her grin think she wanted this or something i asked lyra as we left her classroom one november morning wanted what you know the study parties the house unity or something lyra snuck a look back over her shoulder i dontknow maybe how would she know though i mean it not like we all hang out outside of studying it just by houses and us marissa and cameron and evan and i are together a lot i pointed out yeah but you were before that maybe she just happy that you re well adjusted and normal or something or maybe she watching out for you for your parents right because my parents would totally tell someone about me now and fawcett would totally just pretend it not happening but watch me sneakily my voice dripped with sarcasm well why not lyra asked i donteven think she knows my parents i protested isntshe legally obligated to tell the headmistress if your parents are mistreating you cameron interrupted slinging an arm around my shoulders otherwise she could be sacked they re not mistreating me i protested they never see me exactly lyra said they re ignoring you and not supporting you you had to work and buy all your stuff for this year and get yourself a place to stay and everything that s she trailed off neglect cameron filled in the government would have to step in i frowned but i wouldntneed them i ve got it worked out and snape almost likes me now i can see it in his eyes all you can see in snape eyes is intense dislike lyra countered thinly masked dislike that only cause you re a gryffindork cameron told her he likes us i am not a dork sure you are he said grinning look it up your picture right there next to the definition and yours is right next to annoying was that your idea of a comeback wood cause that just sucks lyra shot him a death glare and cameron grinned and sauntered off ooh lyra muttered i going to hex him you and marissa should start a club i suggested girls against cameron at least we d get a ton of members i bet we d even have more than the gobstones club the gobstones club was the biggest club at school there ve got to be more girls who hate him than who like gobstones i doubt it i replied i mean most people outside of slytherin or older than us or whatever they wouldntknow who he is maybe when we re seventh years or something but then probably all the girls will be in love with him lyra face contorted into a grimace that disgusting why there are so many guys who d be better to fall for she cried i mean just look around so many prettier people i looked around the guys all seem the same actually really she asked you dontsee like one you would want to go out with or anything i shook my head they all look the same i repeated huh lyra replied as we walked toward the great hall i kept my gaze moving critically over the crowds of boys none stood out at least not in a snoggable kind of way oooooooooooooooooooooo just before christmas break alicia and i were walking out of the slytherin dungeons when she grabbed my arm do you hear that she hissed i listened hard i could hear a loud shrill voice ahead of us as we got closer i started to distinguish the words what do you think you re doing down here this is slytherin territory we dontwant other people down here spying on us trying to figure out then another voice quieter younger i not spying alicia and i exchanged a glance and peeked around a corner facing us was alyssa jennings a fourth year slytherin with one hand on her hip pointing her wand at a smaller girl whose back was toward us what going on alicia mouthed at me should we do something i shrugged craning my neck to see more clearly it was an unwritten rule that one simply did not meddle in the affairs of other slytherins unless one was directly involved then why are you in our dudgeons alyssa demanded pointing her wand at the younger girl throat i cantthink of any decent reasons for you to be here i not doing anything the girl repeated and this time her voice quivered as she spoke oh no alyssa replied stepping forward then what are you doing here nothing she insisted stumbling backwards i not doing anything i could hear footsteps behind me whirling around i saw evan approaching seeing the two of us against the wall he moved to the side of the corridor and walked more quietly what going on he muttered in my ear when he d finally reached us i dontknow i whispered back i was about to elaborate when he stepped forward pulling the younger girl behind him and turning to face alyssa what going on he asked her his voice was pleasant but i could tell that he was worried he was gripping his wand tightly in his hand and his other hand was clenched into a fist this hufflepuff been spying on us alyssa explained i am not spying the girl in question cried her voice was strong again i thought that evan obvious protection was giving her confidence there no other good reason for her to be here alyssa said to evan why else would a hufflepuff come down into our territory evan shrugged she just a first year leave her alone jennings i ll walk her upstairs he offered an arm to the girl who took it gingerly when they turned walking past us down the corridor i recognized her loretta williamson the kid whose parents had been killed by evan mother and father is that alicia whispered staring after them i nodded yeah that her what do you think he trying to do she asked watching their retreating backs curiously i dontknow i told her but i going to ask him about it but evan was almost never in the common room for the next few weeks in fact it was almost impossible to catch him alone he came to our study groups just after the first wave of people and then left before i could talk to him he only passed through the common room at night instead of staying and chatting or arguing even at meals and in classes where it was normally easy to yank him aside he was evasive i finally cornered him the night before christmas break as he dashed through the common room on his way to his room i got between him and the doorway to the boys dorms and held up a hand halt i commanded hi lydia he replied help you with something let take a walk i said cheerfully you re aware it past curfew right he asked looking at me like i was crazy snape actually does take off points for wandering around at night you know only if he has to i said with a shrug and he likes me now cause my potions rock we re walking he shrugged and followed me as i grabbed his arm and pulled him out the door and down the cold stone hallway of the dungeon evan i finally started are you this loretta person you two i trailed off i ve just been helping her out with her work he replied quietly that all doesntshe i hesitated trying to find the right words the last thing i wanted to do was to offend him isntit awkward with you know all the history you mean how my parents killed her parents he asked wryly looking sideways at me yeah i replied that part doesntit make things you know hard evan shrugged it weird i guess but i kind of feel like lydia it our parents who fucked up the world right our parents and their parents so it like it up to me to make sure she okay you know because it my parents who made her not okay who screwed everything up for her i looked over at him you know it not your fault right you were just a baby when it happened you re not at fault for what your parents did but it not her fault either he replied softly it doesntmatter whose fault it is because we ve got to deal with it either way i mean it not your fault your parents wonttalk to you is it but you ve still got to deal with it they donthave to deal with it really it your life they ve fucked up so you ve got to fix it i nodded is she okay with it i think so she was happy that i got her away from alyssa at least and we ve been meeting in the library nights i ve been helping her with her work i looked over at him bring her to study group evan we can all help her and that way she ll have you know more older friends you dontthink people will mind he asked why would they i asked it first year work we can totally help her with that and we re not just slytherins so she shouldntbe scared or anything i ll bring her over he said after break anyway he checked his wristwatch and groaned which reminds me i not done packing we should get back to the dorms anyway before filch comes and puts us in detention right i replied following him back to the common room where traditional the end of term party was in full swing music was playing loudly the raging goblins were singing at top volume over the wizard wireless and a large group of older boys had gathered around the punch bowl which i knew had probably been spiked i grinned at evan and made my way through the thronging dancing crowd of students to the table with the crystal punch bowl i grabbed a goblet and filled it grinning at sarah portsmouth who had appeared by my elbow arentyou too young to be drinking she yelled over the din nope i yelled back gulping the burning liquid down she laughed raising her own goblet in a toast ready for your break she asked as we clinked glasses yes i shouted grinning and i was ready for a vacation it had been a very very long fall term and i needed some time to recharge i felt like i hadnthad a decent night sleep in a very long time between staying up late to finish the work that was actually due for classes staying up to finish my extra potions work or the defense work for zach and staying up just for the late night conversations in the common room i never seemed to get a full eight hours of sleep with that in mind i poured myself another glass of punch and moved back through the dancing crowd making sure to wish my friends a happy break it seemed like everyone else was going home and headed slowly toward the black marble staircase and my room and bed ooooooooooooooooooooooo a n woot i am back and i still dontown the potterverse shocking yes reviews feedback would be especially appreciated on this chapter because my betas are sort of overwhelmed between college and leaving the country and such and so only ambika san was able to edit this for me and so many many thanks to her chapter twenty two christmas holidays i woke up too late the next morning to see anyone off it was near noon when i finally rolled out of bed and made my way down to the deserted common room all traces of the party the night before had been cleaned up the room was back to its normal pristine condition the quiet was strange almost unreal the noise in the slytherin common room was generally kept to dull roar or very occasionally whispers and the total silence was unnatural there were two other slytherins staying at school for vacation but they were both much older than i all of my friends would be at home for the next two weeks although originally i had been excited about spending that much time alone away from the incessant noise and work where i could brew potions and practice hexes without feeling self conscious now i just felt lonely i spent that first day wandering around the castle feeling restless and cagey i desperately wanted to do something but i wasnttired and i didntwant to work or read or write letters and we werentallowed into hogsmeade until the next day the hours seemed to go by unbearably slowly the enormous castle seemed totally empty by the time dinner rolled around i was bored enough that even the prospect of eating with the faculty seemed interesting professors flitwick and snape were already sitting down when i got to the table with vector between them generally all the teachers stayed over breaks but i supposed that since this was over christmas they might switch off for mealtimes who really wanted to spend their christmas vacation with a bunch of children good evening miss carmichael professor snape greeted me how has your day been i shrugged it was okay slow sit down the headmistress told me with a smile we re still waiting on a few students so you wontbe alone with a bunch of old folks i think i the only one here who can really be considered old flitwick protested as i sat down spreading my napkin over my lap and twisting it in my hands for some reason adults tended to make me nervous i was never really sure what they were thinking about me or how to respond to their joking attempts at comradery and i was immensely relieved to see a small group of students walking into the great hall as they sat down i could see their badges two gryffindors one ravenclaw and two hufflepuffs the only one i knew by name was jeffery poole a gryffindor in my year he d started coming to our study group with matthew hornby a few weeks ago but we d barely spoken to each other about anything other than schoolwork so what for dinner the older gryffindor asked anyone know ham i think professor flitwick replied are you all looking forward to your weeks free no one of the hufflepuffs responded immediately you know i only here because you re threatening to flunk me professor i d be home with my family otherwise ha the ravenclaw said smirking nice going greg i impressed i d be even more impressed if this didnthappen to you every year it not my fault i no good at charms greg protested i think they re useless useless the other hufflepuff a girl with long red hair in a braid chimed in they re not useless charms is like the most important subject like the most important snape asked mildly then what is the most important subject miss windsor she grinned i was a little surprised to see a hufflepuff grin when she d just been so obviously chastised by professor snape he was generally known to dislike those outside of slytherin and everyone knew hufflepuffs were well kind of timid and useless you know what i meant professor she protested charms is the most important subject i beg to differ the older gryffindor said jenny everyone knows defense against the dark arts is far more important that such a lie she shot back defense canthold a candle to charms in the lively discussion that ensued it became apparent that greg jenny the older gryffindor and the ravenclaw bryan were all in the same year and good friends besides when the other two slytherins showed up sliding into their places just as the food appeared on the table it was clear that all five of them were somewhere between acquainted and friendly and they dominated the discussion all through dinner poole and i exchanged glances once or twice over our ham and potatoes as if to say well at least we donthave to try and make conversation right over dessert the gryffindor boy appeared to notice that poole and i existed oh he said suddenly jeff we ve been ignoring you all evening and he paused looking at me i sorry you re that lydia carmichael grant graves replied before i could speak he was a tall lanky seventh year the best slytherin chaser we had i jerked my head up looking at him with surprise way to not let her actually answer the gryffindor snapped and turned to me carmichael why does that name sound familiar um i said i dontknow were your parents part of that attack at st mungo s i think that enough professor vector said quickly is anyone planning on going into hogsmeade this week there were nods all around what else would we do i think we ought to be able to go into hogsmeade whenever we want jenny suggested twisting her red hair around her hand not just on vacations and special weekends a few years ago you wouldnthave been able to go in on breaks either vector told her students were expected to stay at the castle how boring greg protested she smiled generations of hogwarts students managed mr morris they did their work something you should be doing on that note he said i ll be off to go practice whatever it is i supposed to know silent summoning charms flitwick squeaked sounding horrified right greg said those and with that the students stood up one by one and left the great hall oooooo three days later i headed out to hogsmeade for christmas shopping the year before i d gone in with evan and cameron but this year i was on my own it was a lot less fun without friends i decided to start shopping at honeydukes even though i was as always worried about spending too much gold i didntreally have a choice i knew my friends would be getting me christmas presents and i hated to be the only one not buying anything besides honeydukes was easily the coolest store in all hogsmeade they had mounds of fresh fudge and shelves full of the best kinds of candy and at christmastime they gave out free samples especially to hogwarts students i think the owners felt bad that some students werentat home for the holidays when i walked in the smell of warm chocolate and sharp peppermint washed over me in an intense wave a woman at the door smiled at me and offered me a sample of fresh peanut butter fudge happy holidays she greeted me shopping for presents at my nod she pointed to one corner we ve got a special on chocolate frogs and cockroach clusters i thanked her with a grin and started toward the table she d pointed out a large pyramid of chocolate frogs sat in the middle surrounded by cockroach clusters peppermint toads and ice mice i grabbed some of each trying to determine just how much candy each person needed for a decent present and on my way over to the counter i saw a wooden chocolate frog card holder perfect for lyra as i dumped everything in my hands out onto the counter i caught a whiff of a very chocolatey slightly peppermint like something the woman at the counter noticing my expression laughed that our newest hot chocolate want some i grinned and nodded and she handed me a small hot chocolate topped with whipped cream and chocolate shavings as she wrapped up the rest of my purchases i sipped my drink as i walked out into the cold air and down the road it wasntsnowing yet but the sky was heavily overcast the streets were mostly deserted and i pulled my cloak more tightly around my body as i walked on stopping at the stationary store for joke quills for aaron invisible edible and blood red inks for cameron and a very nice discounted black inkwell for evan i lingered there for a while looking at the regal looking eagle quills which i couldntafford and running my fingers over the smooth blank sheets of parchment and journals i loved the look and feel of blank parchment there was something about it that was fresh and inviting kind of like a clean start someone coughed at my elbow and i jumped turning to see the clerk help you he asked a little coolly oh yeah i replied i just buying these i told him bringing the inks and quills over to the counter where he could ring them up i got the feeling he didntlike having children in the store he thrust the bag and my change into my hands happy holidays i chirped as i left the store just to hear him mutter happy holidays in return from there i went into weasleys wizard wheezes which overflowed with loud brightly colored pranks things that exploded candies that turned your hair or skin different colors and even a portable swamp which the owners promised was easily assembled and deep enough to need an actual boat to cross of course it also cost fifty galleons which was a lot more than i was able to spend instead of a bell dinging softly when i crossed the threshold a loud siren rang out a stocky man with red hair and a large whole where his ear should be came over to me immediately grinning hogwarts student looking for something to amuse and dazzle your friends involved in a roommate feud here for something to annoy your parents um i replied hesitating i christmas shopping actually excellent weasleys wizard wheezes has something for everyone on your list he told me placing a firm hand on my back and steering me into the store he had a cheerful booming voice the kind that would be easily recognizable and was always ready to burst into laughter i george he added as an afterthought whom are you shopping for who first on your list i have this friend i told him slowly thinking of marissa she sort of a target of all these pranks they re funny like sending her chocolates that turn her purple but she getting really peeved with him ah george said nodding his head wisely young love at its most vexing clearly she needs to fight pranks with pranks now we ve just come out with these quills enchanted to write only the first sentence you write with them or these he suggested spinning me around they re a little older hats that come down over your head and refuse to come off or these he steered me a little further into the store prank books read them for two pages and this one you ll speak in rhyme this one in quotes here limericks dactylic hexameter haiku sonnets riddles bad puns sexual innuendo pickup lines i stopped him thanks i replied flushing a little but i donthave a lot of money to spend i paused adding quietly the books are really cool though george nodded well maybe we can work something out hogwarts student so you ve got a discount so that brings you down to five galleons apiece already and he paused thinking to himself he still had that easy winning smile and i could see how he d built up this business his smile practically said i here i looking out for you how about we do three for two ten galleons and your pick of three of them i hesitated looking at the books ten galleons was a lot but the look on marissa face they re easily charmed to look like textbooks he added this is an incredible bargain okay i told him finally i ll get them the pickup lines and the haiku and the quotes excellent choices he replied cheerfully his hand reaching to pull three books off the shelves remember not to read them yourself he cautioned me steering me away from the shelf anything else we can help you with one of the boys at school been helping me with defense against the dark arts i told him and i d like to get him something do you have anything that s like a malicious person detector pocket sneakoscopes he said immediately and miniature foe glasses i d go with the pocket vibrating sneakoscopes if i were you he confided they re a lot cheaper okay i said one of those then and that all i need excellent he replied steering me to the counter becky here will ring you up thanks i told him as he handed becky the books and sneakoscope here at weasleys wizard wheezes we never rest until you re fully satisfied he told me happy holidays oooooo by four o clock i was sitting in the three broomsticks drinking a butterbeer having finally finished my shopping it had taken me two hours to find something for alicia i d finally found a bracelet and matching earrings in a tiny shop at the very edge of the village i d splurged a little on myself buying a pretty pair of dangling green earrings from the same store they were in the shape of snakes and they hissed very quietly when people came near and a book of short stories from a used bookstore which i was now reading i was deeply engrossed in a story about a dragon tamer but not so deeply that i didntnotice when someone walked by my table and stopped looking up i saw that it was poole hey he said a little too loudly mind if i sit down no i told him go ahead seat free he paused a moment before asking nervously you started up the study group with lyra right yeah i answered it was her idea though oh he responded i think it a really good one idea i mean a really good idea i understanding stuff better me too i said finally looking up at him i didntknow much about jeffery poole he had reddish hair and a square face and mostly he was quiet in classes except for charms so i said in an attempt to ease the awkward silence we re the only second years staying huh yeah he agreed nodding a little too forcefully you re the one whose parents wonttalk to her right i choked on a mouthful of butterbeer and he immediately flushed red sorry i shouldnthave said that i donthave any tact my friends all say i dontknow when to shut up no i said i mean no dontworry about it does everybody know i asked suddenly feeling embarrassed it was one thing for my friends to know about my parents but other students did teachers know probably he said frankly at least in our year and maybe the older kids too they might not know you by name though he added attempting to soften the blow i didntreply after a moment he cleared his throat my mum drinks he offered my dad died in the war and everyone says she was normal before that but she drinks a lot now christmas at home was always really bad you know it better to stay here i looked at him accepting his confession for what it was a kind of a peace offering a tit for tat he was sharing his family to make up for knowing about mine they disowned me when they found out about the sorting i explained they haventwritten me since that tough he said quietly taking a sip of his drink i used to get really mad at my dad he admitted after a pause for dying and making her drink and leaving me alone with her but then i d feel guilty for being mad at him because he was dead and you cantbe mad at people who are dead you know because they re dead yeah i replied pausing a bit before speaking again my voice sticking in my throat i thought they d come pick me up at the station last june i waited an hour and a half for them i kept hoping that like they were caught up in traffic or something came up and they just got delayed and they were really coming to get me i always scared she ll say something when she drunk really embarrass me or something or that she ll pass out and the house will catch on fire or something he told me fiddling with his watch and that they wontput it out in time and she ll die i afraid someone will tell someone like a parent or a teacher some adult and that they ll feel like they have to step in and fix it i confessed the words spilling out almost faster than i was thinking them and then i ll get put into an orphanage or sent to live with some really distant relatives and everyone will just think of me as this pitiful little girl whose parents hate her and then my mum and dad ll be even more mad at me for bringing people into it and it ll be even worse he added nodding and it ll be all your fault cause you told when you shouldnthave i nodded and it struck me suddenly how incredibly surreal it was to be sitting in the three broomsticks with a boy i d barely ever spoken to sharing things i could barely tell even my best friends my mind flashed back to the year before when cameron and evan and i had first talked to marissa and i wondered if maybe it was just something about christmas that erased house lines and let perfect strangers tell each other their deepest secrets oooooooooooooooooo a n as always i dontown anything jkr does everythnig else is mine reviews would make me soooo happy and extra kudos to anyone who got the jane eyre allusions chapter twenty three christmas on christmas eve morning a barn owl flew through the dormitory and into my room landing on my bed and pecking at me until i woke up opening one eye i recognized harry elderly owl sitting up i untied the parchment from her leg and opened the envelope a card fell out of it the front was red with a large green christmas tree and falling gold and silver snowflakes and inside a group of carolers sang good tidings we bring to you and your friends good tidings for christmas and a nice vacation above their heads harry had written in his untidy scrawl merry early christmas lydia enjoy your vacation and get some chocolate at honeydukes on me and as the carolers sang they tossed silver sickles out of the card and into my lap grinning i gathered up the coins and put them into my moneybag which had grown considerably lighter during my hogsmeade visit the card i stood up on my nightstand where it still sang softly the owl flew off after eating several of perseus owl treats as i was finished getting dressed and i followed her out of the dungeon poole and i had planned to meet in the library and spend the day doing homework it was mostly reading but crowley wanted a full foot and a half on jupiter moons and snape had assigned the gryffindors two and a half feet on the properties of monkshood poole was already in the library when i got there seated at one of the tables with a stack of astronomy books spread out in front of him sorry i late i said by way of greeting as i sat down across from him taking out a fresh roll of parchment and a quill how far are you i ve just started he replied i just outlining facts now does she want us to do all of them no i answered just the galilean ones io ganymede europa and um callisto he finished we can get eighteen inches on them i guess you want to do europa and io and i ll outline the other two we can switch after sure i replied opening one of the books to a chart of the relative sizes of jupiter moons we settled into our work silently going through the books and taking notes crowley was a ridiculously tough grader and she wanted each and every fact correct her star charts which were the equivalent of tests were notoriously difficult to pass and she wanted essays complete with a list of sources attached even working together it took poole and me the rest of the afternoon to finish the assignment but by dinner we d each managed to write a nineteen and a half inch essay and could honestly say that we d consulted six books she better give us the best grades in the class poole said darkly this has taken bloody forever i know i replied running my hands through my hair i donteven like astro me neither he said matt really good but i just dontsee that there a point you can do charms or spells and that fun but all astronomy is is looking up at the sky and thinking oh that jupiter and hoping that means something exactly i said and shut the last book with a loud thump hey i said suddenly looking up at the clock it dinner and i haventeaten all day can we do your potions stuff later he grinned we can do it whenever you want carmichael i ve seen you in potions you could probably write my essay for me in about ten minutes half an hour at least i replied grinning there a lot to say about wolfsbane i writing about monkshood he cried looking anxiously at me poole i started slowly they re the same thing wolfsbane monkshood aconite just different names that all oh he answered and then grinned guess it a good thing you re helping me then isntit oooooooo after dinner i helped poole with his essay before returning to the slytherin dungeons it was past eight o clock and the common room was deserted i grabbed intermediate potions from my room and curled up in a leather chair by the roaring fire i was almost finished with the book i d worked through all but two potions one dreamless sleep potion required more pixie dust than i could afford and the other was so illegal that brewing it was enough to send the maker to azkaban and was halfway through the final chapter an overview on creating antidotes it was funny to think that a year ago i d despised potions and been afraid of snape now it was my best subject although snape still frightened me i could never tell what he was thinking i was so far ahead of my year in magical drafts and potions that i d ceased to even have to worry about brewing in class and professor snape always had something complementary to say just after ten the door creaked open and grant graves burst in what time is it he demanded did i miss the cookies um like quarter past i answered what cookies snape keith chaloux answered walking in after him he brings cookies and stuff for us on christmas eve best part of break other than presents in the morning of course they re good cookies grant added flopping into a chair in front of the fire and i in desperate need of sustenance but we had dinner a few hours ago i protested how can you be hungry already we re growing boys lydia grant explained grinning besides keith and i have been flying for hours if the whole team were actually here we could have gotten an actual practice in now there a thought keith declared stopping in his tracks think i could force everyone to stay over easter hols grant grant shrugged hey you re the captain they ll do what you want or leave right and besides everyone wants to win the cup this year very true keith murmured very true indeed and easter at home pfft that not so important and i bet snape will back me up on the mandatory what exactly do you assume i ll enforce for you i turned to see snape coming in through the door cookies and butterbeer in hand as the clock struck half past ten keith grinned evening sir grant and i were talking about compulsory quidditch practice over easter break this year he explained and you think your team wants to spend vacation here with grueling practices every morning professor snape asked raising his eyebrows keith shrugged they want to win i want to win if that what it takes half of em donteven have parents to go back to grant cut in smoothly and hell holidays here arentso bad henry might not like it sure and jess might argue i ll get sarah to talk her into it then keith snickered grant elbowed him hard in the ribs and i looked between them confused why is that funny i demanded looking first to keith and then to grant for an explanation when no answer came i turned finally to professor snape professor i asked why is that funny i dontthink miss everard would appreciate being talked of behind her back was all snape would say as he passed around the cookies and butterbeer i knew him well enough to know that he wasntgoing to say another word but that didntquench my curiosity i turned back to the two boys to ask again but grant just shook his head sorry keith muttered around a mouthful of cookies what are you reading lydia grant asked in an obvious attempt to change the subject i held the book up so he could read the cover feeling somewhat embarrassed it was an advanced book for someone in my year and i didntwant them to think that i was reading it to suck up to snape intermediate potions huh he asked sounds fascinating it is i cried immediately defensive it got all sorts of stuff general theory and specific recipes and chill keith told me holding up a hand everything all right lydia professor snape already bragged to our class about how he got a second year better than all of us combined i did nothing of the sort snape protested demurely as i blushed furiously if keith was telling the truth then my near fanatical studying was paying off snape was bragging about me he was proud of me would that be tugwood intermediate potions miss carmichael yes sir i replied unable to keep a wide grin from spreading across my face and have you brewed all the potions she describes he asked looking at me thoughtfully er no sir there an alternate version of the sleeping draught which uses too much pixie dust and the unctuous unction is illegal to brew i answered adding quickly i ve managed everything else though unctuous unction grant repeated what that do makes the person who drinks it think whoever gave it to him is his best friend i explained the effects can be quite dangerous snape added why keith asked because you ll trust them implicitly or are there other effects i expected professor snape to answer but he didntsay anything both i answered keith i mean thinking someone your best friend can be really bad because they can make you do things but it can also cause like brain rupturing or something the book wasntvery specific but it said that you could die if you drank it sounds creepy grant put in i glad you re not brewing it yes professor snape added dryly avoiding a life sentence in azkaban is always commendable oh come off it professor grant replied you know you re happy to have a student running circles around the gryffs i grinned proudly i knew i was the best in our year even maddison couldntbest me at potions brewing and she was regarded by everyone in our year as the smartest and most condescending and snobbish of all of us professor snape shook his head slowly mr graves if you re implying that i would take some sort of perverse pleasure in watching the students of other houses fail you mean you don t keith snorted as grant protested that he hadntbeen implying that at all professor snape waved both comments off with a laugh and refilled our mugs and the subject changed to other things slytherin chances in the quidditch cup grant sister engagement to a ministry official he deemed completely wrong for her and career plans for both the boys we stayed until early in the morning when professor snape told us he was going to bed and that we should do the same on his way out he turned back to address me miss carmichael stop by my office monday night i ll brew ryder sleeping draught with you i ve got plenty of pixie dust and i d like to see you try something a little more challenging with that and a sweep of his robes he was gone and the door swung heavily shut behind him woah keith said with a low whistle he must think you ve got potential for a prepubescent second year grant halfway to the boys staircase laughed and keith ruffled my hair before following his friend i stayed in my chair for a moment before i headed to my room trying to figure out whether keith had just given me a compliment or an insult oooooooo christmas morning i woke up to a tremendous tropical storm brewing outside the window oh stop it i said irritably it christmas cantyou find a snowy part of the atlantic ocean to show me nothing changed on the other side of the glass so i shrugged and rolled out of bed a small pile of presents sat at the foot of my four poster and i sat down to open them with an excited cheer tearing the paper off the first package i saw which turned out to be from alicia she d gotten me of all things an enormous stuffed bear the attached card said his name was bilbo and he would hug back if you hugged him first i set bilbo up across from me where he could see the rest of the packages and chatted to him as i opened them he was a good listener and so i told him all about my holidays and my roommates and cameron and marissa and evan and lyra and finally about my parents see i told him as i was opening the final package a new gobstones set from harry after i got sorted into slytherin that one of the houses at hogwarts my parents kind of went ballistic and they haventtalked to me since which i dontthink is very fair do you bilbo and anyway everyone so obsessed with the houses the gryffindors cantstand us because we re evil and we dontlike them right back and no one really likes the hufflepuffs and it just seems kind of silly i frowned at the bear he was quite an imposing teddy bear with brown fur and short claws and absently began to pick up the scattered paper i get disowned for being a slytherin and i have to learn extra spell work in case the gryffindors attack me and it just all seems so stupid the four founders were friends werentthey otherwise they d ve never founded it to begin with bilbo seemed to agree with me but it was difficult to be sure his glass eyes didntchange their expression i felt a little stupid talking to a stuffed bear even if he was a large huggable sort of bear i was twelve and a half or nearly people who were almost teenagers were too old to talk to stuffed animals and i would have hated for anyone else to hear me but i was alone and quite lonely although poole and i had a lot in common he was a gryffindor and a boy and therefore inferior company and so i talked to bilbo i even hugged him once i d put all my gifts away and whispered in his ear that it wasntthat i wasntgrateful for all the presents it was just that i d rather hoped my parents might pick christmas to write or something and while bilbo didntsay anything he did wrap his furry arms around me and his paws made jerky circular motions on my back oooooooooooo a n i know i suck at writing things and getting them out on time but this chapter did go out to my betas a month ago i swear anyway i dontown anything jkr does and many thanks to ambika san and vercisisolde for editing this for me please review chapter twenty four potions lessons that monday night i went directly from dinner to professor snape office in the dungeons across from the potions classroom i had never been inside before and i was a little nervous about a one on one study session with him professor snape was a sarcastic and bitter man and he could be cruel when he chose although he usually left the slytherins alone preferring to taunt the gryffindors i wouldnthave the easy scapegoat tonight he d opened the door as soon as i knocked and ushered me into a small room paneled in dark wood there was a large desk and two easy chairs both dark green in front of a fire bookshelves lined the walls with books crammed sideways on top of other books and two shelves double stacked hi professor i managed to say i was holding my intermediate potions in front of me like a shield and trying to hide my anxiety at the same time do you brew potions in here too he sneered but i thought i could hear a quiet chuckle as he spoke no my lab the next room in if you would follow me i nodded and trailed after him through a door i hadntnoticed at once on into a room that looked much like our potions classroom but smaller there were two long tables with cauldrons set up in rows some were bubbling or steaming and some were being stirred by long wooden spoons and one by a silver rod shelves covered one wall and on them stood vials and jars of all sorts of interesting things frogs and newts eyes pickled intestines dried leaves and flowers and jars of various powders and liquids i couldnteven name more jars floated in the air empty cauldrons rested upside down on a drying rack by the sink and measuring cups and spoons stood in a cabinet next to that what do you think professor snape asked me it s um very wow sir i stammered what are you brewing the back row is all antidotes he replied coolly pointing them out the first two are the deflating draught and then one for doxy bites a blood replenishing draught draught of peace and the last one wolfsbane you see the silver stirring rod i nodded but i was still a little confused but i thought silver was deadly to werewolves even when they werenttransformed wouldntsilver taint the potion wolfsbane was supposed to help werewolves not kill them professor snape shook his head only when pierced with silver and it not a guaranteed death even then i ve known werewolves who have survived besides the stirring rod doesnttaint the potion nearly enough to cause that kind of harm it just helps alleviate the symptoms oh i said i was fascinated can i i mean i ve never seen wolfsbane potion being brewed before professor snape cut me off but i could have sworn he was smiling you can look at it if you like there not much to see right now it still in the early stages here i ve got the recipe he waved his hand and a book floated towards us and settled delicately on the table opened to page five hundred and sixty seven the wolfsbane potion it read in large gold letters at the top under that was a lengthy list of ingredients most of which i d never heard of i was amused to see the wolfsbane plant wasntactually one of the ingredients even listed under aconite or monkshood how long does it take to brew i asked turning the page the instructions went on for several pages in very small print and scrawled in the margins were notes diagrams calculations ingredient names abbreviations i couldntmake out ten or twelve hours but it needs to sit for at least four he replied traditionally traditionally i repeated looking up from the frothing potion to meet his gaze are you experimenting with it then professor snape nodded to some extent wolfsbane currently only prevents the transformation of the mind not the body furthermore it needs to be taken on a daily basis as the moon waxes full i have been attempting to extend the potion reach i puzzled over this in my mind i knew that wolfsbane was the only possible way of making sure a werewolf was safe but even i knew that the potion was far from ideal to cover the full moon er month at first he answered watching the brew with a frown ideally of course i d want it extended much further there been some progress with other potions other diseases vampires for instance an adlumos potion can turn a newly bitten vampire human again if administered within eighteen hours could you i mean can the wolfsbane be adapted for that i asked i was immensely interested but the theory went completely over my head transformative potions were among the most complex even for normal humans i had no idea how they worked in non humans i not sure he admitted there an enormous leap from treatment to cure and i haventhad much success yet but there nothing else out there that works so this is as good a starting point as any i looked curiously at the frothing potion again how long have you been working on it about six months give or take he answered shutting the book but you didntcome here to talk about wolfsbane we were going to brew a sleeping draught werentwe yes sir i answered pulling out my intermediate potions i think i can brew it probably it mostly the ingredients that were a problem getting them i mean it a complex potion to brew was his only comment and i saw it for what it was a challenge and an admission of respect if i could manage it ingredients are in the cabinets behind you i nodded and settled down to work an empty cauldron pewter standard size self heating stood on the table in front of me and professor snape cabinets were arranged logically by type storage conditions and finally alphabetically not that it should have surprised me so it was quick work to find the thirteen ingredients needed for ryder sleeping draught i was nervous at first because i somehow knew that impressing snape now would mean earning his respect but messing up could mean losing it permanently and i knew that wasntsomething i could handle i needed snape help and i needed him to like me at this point his feelings toward me seemed to amount to about neutral he praised my work in class and apparently to others but he didntseek me out to ask about how i was doing as he did for his favorite slytherins maybe hopefully this would be the turning point if i could only get the potion right i neednthave worried after a few moments the familiarity of the motions measuring dicing stirring took over and i stopped feeling quite so anxious after all i was the best at potions in our year probably i was better than most of the third years as well and while i might not have brewed this particular potion before i had the recipe and i d brewed ones like it and indeed even with professor snape presence behind me the draught seemed to be coming along nicely ryder sleeping draught had to be brewed in two parts most of the ingredients went in first in the right order and exact quantities and then enough powdered unicorn horn was added to turn the potion a light translucent blue purple color after that the potion had to be stirred clockwise for thirty minutes and counter clockwise for fifteen before the final ingredient four tablespoons of pixie dust could be added i was just adding the powdered unicorn horn very carefully because unicorn horns were tricky a tiny amount could vastly change a potion properties when professor snape spoke that probably about enough miss carmichael i added a last half pinch to the potion and then corked the bottle that the right shade the one in the book darker just because something is written in a book professor snape answered doesntmean it cannot be improved on besides there is a tendency to overuse unicorn horn in modern potions oh i said setting an automatic stirring rod evan christmas present to me to stir clockwise for a half hour so miss carmichael he asked after a moment pause how was your christmas it was fine i answered quiet i got a lot of reading and stuff done though you didntgo home he stated i nodded considering my next words carefully i didntknow how much about my family situation professor snape knew i was sure he couldntbe completely ignorant he was my head of house and it would have been irresponsible for the prefects the year before not to have informed him on the other hand they could have given him a modified version or snape could know exactly what was going on people swore he could read minds and simply want to hear my answer my parents haventcontacted me since i got sorted i said shortly looking him directly in the eye they think slytherin is a an evil house or that only dark wizards come out of it or something you have no other family he asked disinterestedly i shot him a quizzical look he had to know these things were common knowledge but answered readily enough well there my cousin but he fourteen and my grandmother but we arentclose and i just she has a lot to worry about i have a godfather but i can t i dontthink i can go to him professor snape nodded that must be very difficult for you it a wonder you dontdespise this house at this i smiled it my parents who have the problem sir not the house i like slytherin i like my housemates i glad to hear it he answered his voice was still cool and completely unemotional but i thought i could see him smile a little as the conversation turned back to potions oooooo after that i met with professor snape once or twice a month he watched me work through various potions of increasing difficulty offering advice books articles and ingredients by late april he d set me to experimenting on simple recipes to create potions that were more effective or used less ingredients or were faster to brew i had thought i d start in immediately on the n e w t level book but professor snape had handed me a large stack of different level books some simple some advanced and some illegal and told me to brew them experiment on them and try to compare steps and ingredients if you learn the theory he d said then you ll be three steps ahead of everyone else when it comes to developing your own as april turned into may professor snape started to give me back issues of the potions quarterly which were very interesting reads for two reasons first the most brilliant potions experts of the day wrote for them and two professor snape made notes in every issue and professor snape was at least twice as brilliant as any one of them one saturday afternoon towards the end of may alicia and maddison burst into our room as i was reading the january 1979 issue of potions quarterly actually alicia burst in maddison merely sauntered after her looking superior lydia alicia cried when she saw me come to hogsmeade with us no thanks i replied without looking up lydia you ve got to she insisted making a grab for my magazine i tried to move it out of her reach but alicia was too quick for me come on she pleaded i really really would rather stay i protested looking longingly at the article i d been reading a discussion on the healing properties of lavender by someone called lily evans what alicia trying to say maddison put in is that you have to come with us why i asked looking warily between them you um alicia stopped looked at maddison and started again you need to buy a bra lydia a bra i repeated crossing my arms across my chest why i m they re small i told you we should have gotten a prefect to do this maddison muttered to alicia then turned to me lydia well um it was the first time i d seen maddison at a loss for words the boys are noticing them they bounce alicia interrupted up and down oh i said faintly feeling my face flush had people noticed had teachers had zach or oh the horror sarah were people talking about it i crossed my arms tighter over the two lumps on my chest which until then i d barely noticed and hoped the floor would suddenly turn into a portkey and send me to china or egypt or some isolated island where people didnthave to worry about things like this where do people go for bras then oooooo ribbons and lace was a large store on one of hogsmeade side streets the windows outside had mannequins wearing only their underwear and inside was full of lace and silk and things i was fairly sure my mother wouldnthave wanted me to see alicia navigated coolly through the store and maddison wore her customary holier than thou look but i fell embarrassedly behind them trying not to look around me at the racks maddison noticing me rolled her eyes god lydia it just lingerie you re such a prude i felt my face flush and looked pointedly at nothing i am not i ve just never seen stuff like this before alicia giggled anyone would think you were nine years old lydia i glared at her shut up i started to say but i was interrupted by a smooth voice asking can i help you with something girls lydia here needs a bra maddison told the girl pointing at me my face went bright red but thankfully the girl didntlaugh of course was all she said have you been measured um i answered no okay lydia she said smiling easily i callie why dontwe go in back and i ll measure you for a bra and then we can pick a few out i swallowed and nodded following her to the back of the store and into a small room empty but for a tiny armchair her casual manner had no doubt been meant to reassure me but instead i felt stupid and embarrassed i stood awkwardly in the middle of the room my arms crossed tight across my chest callie took a measuring tape from out of her pocket and looked at me with a small smile you re going to have to take off your robes lydia she said gently right i muttered peeling them over my head and depositing them on the chair under them i wore only my underpants and i was sure i was blushing again callie took no notice though i was sure she was laughing at me secretly i just going to measure once around your ribcage and then again around your breasts okay that will tell me your bra size at my nod she deftly wrapped the tape measure under my breasts noted the mark and did the same across them it was strange to be touched of all my friends only cameron and lyra were prone to spontaneous hugs her fingers were cool and didntfeel bad but it didntexactly feel good either and i squirmed away from her touch all set she said finally you can put your robes back on now you re a seventy two a but you could probably go a size above right i replied as if that meant something to me my voice was slightly muffled by my robes which i was pulling over my head seventy two a i can help you find something comfortable callie told me as she led me out of the room to where alicia and maddison were waiting do you have anything specific in mind strapless sports bra i shot alicia a helpless look and she took pity on me and stepped in just a couple normal ones three about right maddison dontyou think maybe one in black but she doesntneed anything fancy and it not like you fly or anything lydia callie nodded whisking the three of us over to a far wall then i d recommend this one she reached up for a white bra and maybe this this as she spoke she handed me bras in various styles and colors most of which looked the same to me i finally handed the lot over to alicia you pick i told her i dontknow anything alicia grinned see you know enough to hand it over to an expert you re not an expert maddison objected rolling her eyes you re thirteen maddison alicia replied severely it possible to be an expert at something even at a young age besides you know isabel this was true alicia older sister isabel was in zach year and she was the kind of girl who would know about bras and lace and makeup and all the rest and she wouldntresent teaching some of what she knew to alicia either if i might callie started with a smile i d recommend buying at least one of these she picked a light pink bra out of the pile in alicia arms because it ll grow with you up to two sizes sounds good alicia said she ll take it and one of each of these she added handing two to callie but nothing pink i protested and callie laughed reaching to one of the racks to replace the pink grow with you bra with a blue one are these fine she asked me and i nodded i trusted alicia and anyway it wasntas if i knew anything about it excellent callie replied leading us to the front to pay that eight galleons nine sickles two knuts i nodded and dug into my money bag for harry christmas money and the very last of my summer savings i didntwant to spend it all but it felt nice to be finally spending money on new clothes and i wouldntneed any money i hoped before i got my first paycheck in june callie handed me a small paper bag and two knuts in change you re all set have a good day thanks i replied relieved to finally be done and followed alicia and maddison back outside well alicia asked when we got outside what did you think i shrugged it was weird i dontlike having my robes off in front of people maddison snickered you re such a prude i am not a prude i snapped i just wasntcomfortable with it alicia giggled come on lydia it not as if she was a lesbian or something how would you know maddison asked it not like you can just tell i can tell with portsmouth and everard she replied testily that because they snog in the common room maddison argued i blinked and looked up they snog in the common room are they like dating i d seen them cuddling on the couch but i hadntrealized that they were actually together it hadnteven occurred to me that girls could be together like that you re so clueless maddison sneered at me they ve been shagging for ages alicia explained since last year it such a total scandal all the sixth and seventh years are talking about it it not that big a deal is it i asked frowning i mean just because they re together it not like the rest of the school needs to care the rest of the school doesntmatter maddison pointed out we take care of our house yeah and the house isntthat happy about it either alicia said i mean it weird it not really natural for two girls to be like that you re just an all around bigot arentyou alicia maddison asked caustically lesbians muggle borns half bloods non humans anyone else your death eater parents teach you to hate my parents arentdeath eaters alicia snapped but anyone would think you were a lesbo yourself maddison shrugged the biggest bigots are what they hate you know who was a half blood he was not dontsay that so you re more likely to be gay than i am i am not alicia cried maddison said something back but i tuned them out i d heard enough of them fighting in two years to last me a lifetime and anyway i thought their argument was silly it didntseem wrong to me for two girls to be in love but i did wonder if any of those girls also didntfind boys particularly snoggable ooooooooooooo a n nope i still dontown harry potter many many apologies for the late chapter if it any help i had this one out to my betas in april but thanks and cookies to them for editing haleth aldea ambika san and t mad hatter i ve written through chapter 31 and i want to get a lot of this done before deathly hallows because i sure jkr is going to torpedo my plot reviews for this chapter will be loved and cherished and plus i always write back chapter twenty five study parties yo lydia hold up i stopped in the middle of the corridor on my way to our study group and turned to see marissa dashing toward me followed closely by lyra what is it i asked when they caught up marissa slightly out of breath something wrong no not at all lyra answered grinning but they ve posted electives for next year we have to pick them tonight really i said excellent what are you guys going to take stunt flying lyra responded immediately new this year hooch is teaching it and she used to be with the holyhead harpies she was fantastic stunt flying i repeated skeptically and marissa laughed you should do it tpo she urged a decided gleam in her eye we all know how much you love flying lydia right i answered laughing as that the only class i practically failed last year lyra grinned widely and wrapped an arm around my shoulders i could give you private tutoring she offered and teach you to fly a sharp jolt shot through me like she d shocked me somehow and i shrugged her arm off nah ancient runes for me and maybe arithmancy professor snape says that best for people studying potions anyway i said smirking flying is just pfft useless useless lyra repeated flying i wounded wounded hey wait why are you listening to snape he so mean he mean to gryffindors marissa corrected her he likes ravenclaws and he loves slytherins besides you re in her class she brews like woah lyra shook her head still he mean then she brightened looking back at marissa what are you going to take cameron wants me to take divination with him she said and i thought care of magical creatures would be fun too ooh that the other one i was going to take lyra replied but i wanted to be in a class with lydia too lydia why dontyou do care of magical creatures with me i rolled my eyes i want to take arithmancy and ancient runes take one of those with me lyra wrinkled her nose but that involves writing and reading and being inside i laughed and pushed open the door to flitwick classroom where most of our study group had already gathered i like reading and writing and being inside me too evan commented as we walked in he was sitting cross legged on the floor next to loretta williamson who had her standard book of spells grade one open in front of them how hard should we be studying for finals you think hard as we can poole replied i bet they re going to be brutal we ve got plenty of time cameron said grinning as he and aaron transfigured a tortoise shell comb into a seashell like three weeks that almost a month it practically forever two and a half weeks loretta corrected it not a lot of time she grinned innocently at cameron who merely stuck his tongue out at her loretta might be a cheeky cocky first year but evan would hex anyone who so much as looked at her wrong and beneath his quiet studious demeanor evan was capable of a few nasty hexes i d never said it to anyone nor would i ever but it wasntall that difficult to think of him as the child of two of the last war most dangerous death eaters sometimes i wondered if loretta could see it too we ll be fine marissa said easily you forget we ve already done loads more review than any of us did last year just from this group anyway tonight there something way more important than exams aaron asked in mock horror falling off his chair and gasping i don t i can t a ravenclaw admit there more to life than studying shut up trimble marissa retorted thwapping him with her charms book someone turning thirteen tonight with that i dimmed the lights and aaron unearthed a large cake from his bag and lit the candles with a wave of his wand get over here cameron so we can sing laughing and clapping we gathered around cameron and the cake and lyra started the singing we were horribly off key does anyone ever sing happy birthday on pitch but the cake was excellent and some people had even brought presents open mine first marissa cried shoving a rectangular package at cameron what inside let me guess the ravenclaw bought me a book he said tearing off the paper to reveal a paperback copy of blood on my robes speed dueling at its best and another the modern wizard guide to treasure hunting aw sweet thanks marissa you re welcome she said perkily and i handed my own gift up to him i d made him a hair growth potion without comment because i was looking curiously at the two books as far as i knew there were no weasleys in publishing yet the small print on the spine proclaimed them the publishers i looked up at marissa comprehension dawning and she grinned and winked this is awesome lydia thanks cameron told me with a grin as he applied some of the potion to his chin after several moments he began to sprout an enormous green beard pernella rooted around in her bag for a mirror and cameron inspected his beard from all angles i look pretty good dontyou think you look like a leprechaun marissa told him through giggles where your gold oh stop flirting with him aaron scolded her did you bring the butterbeer oh yeah i totally forgot she cried and cameron opened the rest of his presents to a round of the three broomsticks best butterbeer oooooooo two days later cameron came down to breakfast with a scowl on his face hey cam i said brightly what wrong he glared at all of us folded his arms and sat down aaron sat down next to him laughing hysterically cameron fixed him with a death glare and aaron held up his hands it wasntme he said between bursts of laughter i swear cameron narrowed his eyes it wasn t i swear what what happened i asked although i had a pretty good idea what didntyou do aaron choked on his own laughter again when cameron woke up he snort of laughter wanted to know if he needed a library card cause he was checking me out he collapsed onto his plate in giggles and the rest of us started to laugh with him didntknow you swung that way evan said with a smile but we support you i didn t cameron tried to say but what came out was was your father a thief cause he must have stolen the stars from the skies to put them in your eyes when he realized what he d said he clapped his hands over his mouth and evan smirked trying unsuccessfully to hide his amusement i get my eyes from my mum side of the family sorry i flattered though cameron glared around at us all and silently began to serve himself some bacon and eggs i tried for his sake to control my laughter but it didntwork i burst into giggles again by then everyone else had turned to stare at us but our year was laughing too hard to really care finally cameron stood took his plate and stalked out of the room remember aaron called after him transfigurations is first you dontwant to be late then turning back to the rest of us he asked with a smirk can you imagine what fawcett is going to say oooooooo transfiguration that day was all review for the coming exam or at least that what it was supposed to be professor fawcett started off the class by reminding us that our exam was less than three weeks away and explaining again what we would be expected to do since she d said all this twice before no one was actually surprised although john avery did pantomime total petrification when she reminded us that we d have to transfigure a cactus into a cauliflower then she started us on changing turnips into tops and back again and she walked up and down the rows to watch our progress i was attempting to turn my top back into a turnip which was difficult i was stuck with a wooden looking radish and i couldntmove it back either way when i heard a crash from the other side of the room aaron turnip had exploded and was sending singed turnip shards through the air the blackened part of the turnip that had stayed on his desk was halfheartedly sparking fawcett wiped pieces of turnip from her face impressive mr trimble thanks aaron replied with a saucy grin i always impressive in all ways the rest of the class snickered but fawcett merely shook her head i figured she was used to it by now aaron and cameron almost always managed to insinuate something during class i thought it might be because she was so good looking you re very quiet today mr viridian she said turning to cameron is everything all right cameron nodded trying unsuccessfully to look both perfectly fine and quietly wise at the same time then would you mind telling the class where mr trimble went wrong cameron shook his head vigorously and pointed to his throat miming that he had lost his voice box or at least i thought that was what he was trying to sign cameron wasntvery good at nonverbal communication mr viridian i dontbelieve you ve lost your voice now answer the question cameron shot a desperate look at the rest of the class but no one came to his rescue we were all too interested in what he would say to fawcett mr viridian finally desperately cameron opened his mouth to speak i could see that he was trying to control his words but what came out was if your left leg was halloween and your right leg was christmas could i meet you between the holidays the entire class burst into shocked laughter and cameron flushed beet red and started to sink under his desk fawcett stared at him in disbelief for a long awkward moment and then she too burst into laughter no mr viridian she said finally once she d stopped laughing you could not but i think perhaps you had better get your ah affliction looked at i sure professor snape wouldntmind you intruding on his class cameron couldntvery well argue with her for fear of what would come out of his mouth so he silently packed up his books and stalked out of the classroom glaring daggers at the rest of us as he went his eyes clearly said someone is responsible for this and if i come on to snape i shall never forgive whoever it is and i shall hex that person and it will hurt feel better aaron called as cameron shut the door and that opened the floodgates for more laughter we were half an hour to the end of class but i wasntat all surprised that fawcett told us to take our books and get out of her classroom i think she knew we werentgoing to settle down besides it was a beautiful spring day and i knew for a fact that fawcett had a free period after our class oooooooo hey you re a girl i looked frowning from one thousand magical herbs and fungi to see evan face blocking out the setting sun coming in over the lake yeah i a girl i agreed did you just figure that out or something he rolled his eyes and sat down next to me on the rock no i meant you re a girl so you would know about girl stuff i looked curiously at him what do you mean girl stuff alicia better at makeup and hair and all that but about girl politics you know about those yeah i said slowly if you mean catfights and rumor spreading and all that i room with maddison and alicia after all why what up evan frowned picking at the grass that grew at the base of the rock it like this letta roommates arentbeing very nice to her and they keep taking her stuff and telling the rest of their house all these mean things about her that arenteven true and i dontreally know what to do i told her maybe she should talk to another girl but she said she didntwant to so i thought about asking you letta i repeated wondering about the nickname even as i turned his dilemma over in my mind it quicker he said with a shrug and anyway she not really a loretta but that not what important lydia she having problems and i need to fix them i didnteven bother reminding him that a first year hufflepuff problems werentof his making even if his parents had screwed up her life evan had made up his mind that she was his responsibility and nothing i could say would change that besides it might even be that he had a point it wasnthis fault that her parents had been killed but it wasnthers either cantyou talk to her prefects or something go up to a hufflepuff prefect and say their firsties are bullies they d never believe me he answered well what do you want me to do about it i donteven know the girls but you could tell me how to make them stop i sighed and shut my book evan girls are mean that just how it is you cant make them be nicer to her maybe you could make them be civil but you cantactually make them be her friends i know evan said slowly it not that she needs them to be friends she just needs them to stop bullying her evan it practically the end of the year i argued why are you dealing with this now she just told me about it he admitted i think she embarrassed he paused come on lydia please help i cantlet her down i leaned forward over the lake and thought about it well you can try threatening them blackmail works or just go up to them tell them that if you hear anything you ll assume it them and throw some hexes around you are i hesitated i d been about to say a rookwood but thought better of it a slytherin and all i mean what the problem why dontthey like her he shrugged this and that i nodded accepting that it wasntreally my place to know right well you could do that and teach her charms to protect her stuff although that will just stop the bullying does she have friends i paused realizing how that had sounded i mean who does she hang out with some of the girls in the year above and a couple ravenclaws i think and me obviously and she wouldntwant to be friends with them anyway okay so threaten the girls with bodily harm if they spread any more rumors or anything and rig up some sort of alarm system for her stuff i stretched standing up slytherin ll watch out for her our year at least if you ask nicely and the rest of the study group likes her i just dontlike that it hard for her evan said finally taking my book and following me back towards the castle it hard for everyone evan i answered but that doesntmake it right he told me quietly that doesntmean we shouldntfight to make it better oh evan i groaned rolling my eyes you re so idealistic you re almost a gryffindork ooooooooo a n anything belonging to jkr doesntbelong to me anything belonging to me doesntbelong to you savvy lots and lots of thanks to ambika san t mad hatter and vercisisolde who edited this for me and caught a bunch of weird errors please review i promise i ll reply back and if something bothers you you really like something i wontknow about it unless you tell me so review chapter twenty six year end our study group met one last time after exams were over to celebrate the end of the year talk about what we were planning to do over the summer and consume vast amounts of butterbeer and honeydukes best peanut butter fudge although a few people were worried about exam results jeffery poole had accidentally ignited the cactus he was supposed to be transfiguring most of us were fairly confident about our answers i cantbelieve that the leaving feast is tomorrow night marissa complained she was lounging on the floor leaning nonchalantly against cameron shoulder so casually that i knew she had to be totally aware of her position me either lyra agreed tossing me a new bottle of butterbeer it not fair i dontwant to go home you guys arentthere i ll be all alone and bored and only have old people for company you could come visit me jill holmes suggested my parents wouldntmind a better idea cameron put in would be to have a party somewhere who volunteers their house and their parents ooh me pernella offered we have a huge yard it would be perfect for a big party and my parents wonthover around bugging us either perfect marissa declared hey aaron asked as he stealthily halved cameron piece of fudge anyone going anywhere exciting does the beach count marissa asked we re spending part of august at this stupid little cottage in the middle of nowhere it not even connected to the floo leaky cauldron i said with a grin i d owled matthew armstrong the month before to ask if i still had a job and he d replied immediately to say that i was hired and maybe even with a raise lyra thinks psychopaths hide out there so that got to be exciting lyra glared and pelted me with rolled up bits of parchment but i could only laugh it not like you can deny it lyra she might be right matthew hornby told me seriously i heard that this one time there was this cook and she was making chili right so she was chopping up vegetables only she missed and slit her wrists wait what cameron interrupted how can someone miss a carrot and hit both wrists instead that doesntmake any sense shut up viridian and let me tell the story hornby retorted so she slit her wrists but if it was an accident marissa mused then she would have called for help or healed it or something and if she meant to kill herself she wouldnthave done it over vegetables how do you know hornby asked glaring at her i mean maybe she was chopping them up and then her boyfriend broke up with her or something the point is she slit her wrists and in the commotion afterwards no one had any time to finish making the chili so the next morning they were all freaking out over what to serve that silly i protested laughing a little they always have enough food and anyway you dontserve chili for breakfast anyway he continued loudly the next morning when they went downstairs there was a pot of chili all made on the stove only no one had actually made it and when they tasted it it was the best chili anyone had ever had but still no one would admit to making it and finally when they went back to the dead body the fingers were gone we all stared at him blankly dontyou get it he asked the fingers were in the chili gross pernella said making a face that was a horrendously awful story cameron told him besides it not true i heard the same one when i was six about the hog head anyway i said what does it mean it not like the cook was a violent psychopath she was just suicidal i not in any danger i paused a beat besides they make really good chili and why do you think that is hornby demanded i blinked at him um not because it has fingers in it are you sure yes but can you be absolutely positively completely one hundred percent sure that there werentany fingers in the chili that last time you had some he asked i d opened my mouth to respond when pernella replied for me okay this conversation is over ew no more talking about cannibalism someone change the subject let tell more creepy urban legends jill holmes suggested i know this one about an escaped convict with a hook for a hand oooooo i went back to my room after the party it was late nearly midnight and both maddison and alicia were already asleep although i was tired i decided to pack instead of sleeping after those stories i imagined every creak or rustle to be a murderer creeping into the dormitory by one o clock i d gotten all my things spread out over my bed alicia chair and the floor it was a little disconcerting that everything i owned could be packed into one trunk it gave me an oddly unbalanced feeling as i squeezed my robes and cloaks over my schoolbooks i realized with a sudden sinking feeling that the expanding charm on my trunk was either fading or reaching the end of its limits i was running out of space the trunk had been my mother when she was at school and for some reason i d thought that bringing her trunk to hogwarts would be cool of course i hadntrealized then that my parents wouldntbe there to buy a new trunk when i needed one i didnthave the money to buy one myself and unless matthew gave me an enormous raise i wouldnthave it by the end of the summer either this would just have to do the final things to go into my trunk were the little knickknacks that littered my bedside table and the inside of my wardrobe a glass snow globe headache and stomachache relieving potions a small crystal bowl that had once been filled with mints a box of extra nametags for my clothes a large rainbow paperweight a miniature stuffed hippogriff i d called buckbeak i lingered longest over the one picture i had of myself and my parents in it my mother hand was intertwined with my father s and i stood between them with one of their hands on each of my shoulders i was holding our cat dido in my arms dido was an aloof independent cat and i hadntparticularly liked her in my defense she hadntparticularly liked anyone either and she absolutely despised my father i hadntmissed her much in the last two years but looking at the picture i realized suddenly that she might have run away or even died and i would never know for all i knew my house had been repainted or added on to or sold or burned down how would i know months ago this would have reduced me to tears but now i almost found it funny i had no idea what was happening to my family and they had no idea what was happening to me for the first time i realized that i could do whatever i wanted who was going to stop me if i wanted to i could drop out of school and travel around europe or i could work year round or run off to join a flying circus i was completely independent i was fully in charge of my own destiny i could do anything it was a daunting thought but it was exhilarating too i grinned a little to myself as i squeezed a last book into my trunk and sat on the lid to shut it oooooo professor snape had asked me to check in with him before i left so the next evening i stopped by his office before the end of term feast he was in his study and the door was open i walked right in and took my customary chair hi professor miss carmichael how are you tired i admitted with a sheepish smile i was up all last night packing maddison thinks i a moron but she always thinks that professor snape sneered but good naturedly and your plans for the summer i working at the leaky cauldron all summer i said but i think you knew that and next year your electives are ancient runes and arithmancy correct i nodded yes sir good he said and lapsed into silence for a moment this summer you will of course have free time during your holiday i nodded i only work six hours or so a day spread out then you should have plenty of time to work on your potions he said and reached behind him to pull two well worn books off the shelf i thought these might be of some interest scarpin is almost all theory but belby has some recipes you should be able to brew he paused while i examined the covers olivia scarpin theories of modern potion making and samuel belby 300 practical potions and you should feel free to owl me with any questions or if you cantget specific ingredients there are the apothecary on diagon alley may refuse to sell you some things why sir i asked interested the ministry likes to keep certain more illicit substances under watch they especially do not want children or those more inclined towards evil to be able to use them but if i owl the owner there should be no problem thank you i said unable to keep a smile off my face i was proud that he trusted me so much i was also excited at the prospect of using ingredients that were actually restricted by the ministry from the corner of the room a grandfather clock rang the half hour and professor snape glanced at it before turning back to me and pushing a stack of potions quarterly across the desk i ve marked articles in these which more or less follow from the scarpin and i want you to owl me biweekly at least and tell me what you re reading and what you ve been brewing i took the magazines and nodded making a mental note to figure out whether biweekly meant twice every week or once every two i promise and more often if i having trouble good he said looking briefly back at the clock i took the hint and stood up i should probably go professor and drop these in my trunk before the feast i said but um thank you for all the help this year and all of this and everything professor snape smiled and waved me out of the room i am your head of house miss carmichael now go before you re late i grinned and dashed out the door and down the hall towards the great hall dropping the books and magazines professor snape had given me in my room on the way as i got there i realized i hadntreally needed to run most of the students were still trickling in i grabbed a seat next to sarah and she turned to grin at me hey lydia how d your exams go they were good i told her unable to keep from grinning back other than astronomy but i always bad at that she laughed i the same way with herbology i cantget anything to grow but i bet you donthave that problem no i answered i keep plants in my room even sarah smirked a little so i ve heard didntone try to eat your roommate oh right i said uncomfortably one of my fanged geraniums had almost strangled alicia way back in the fall but why did sarah know about it she must have noticed the confusion on my face because she rolled her eyes zach mentioned it he seemed rather proud i thought i laughed zach would be proud and was about to reply when sarah head snapped to the right i followed her gaze and saw jess everard seventh year slytherin seeker and according to alicia and maddison sarah girlfriend since that afternoon in may when maddison had explained it i d been watching the two of them closely i d never actually known any lesbians before i wanted to see what they were like but aside from seeing the two of them holding hands or nestling together on the couch i couldntfind any evidence of them actually dating and anyway normal girls touched that way too lyra and jill holmes for instance sometimes walked arm in arm down the hall and lyra and i would sometimes share a chair in the library jess came up behind us and wrapped her arms around sarah neck hi love she said softly and then glanced over at me lydia hi i squeaked normal girls didntcall each other love did they you ve still got one of my jumpers sarah said tilting her head up to meet jess s i going to need that jess laughed and moved her cheek to rest against sarah s i can think of a lot of reasons why you wouldn t sarah elbowed her lightly in the ribs it my blue one and i happen to like it jess rolled her eyes fine i ll give it back if you come over and get it sarah snickered and murmured something i didntcatch and then jess leaned down and kissed her full on the lips there were a few whistles and catcalls from the rest of the table and i stared at them slightly shocked until someone poked me hard in the back it not polite to stare zach voice spoke in my ear much as i d like to i flushed and turned around i wasntstaring i told him zach laughed i cantsee why you wouldntwant to it hot although i guess girls arentinto that into what he shifted before answering looking uncomfortable lesbian sex he said finally i cantbelieve i talking about this to a twelve year old neither can i sarah said but she sounded annoyed jess was sitting on her other side with one arm casually slung around her shoulders they were holding hands and anyway she continued our sex life is not for your entertainment zachary so bugger off zach ducked his head sorry he said although i wasntsure he really meant it but maybe you shouldntdo it in the great hall then you snog your girlfriend in the great hall sarah pointed out it not like we re doing something no one ever seen before lydia hasn t zach told her and i froze then shot him a frustrated look i didntwant to be dragged into this sarah looked at me thoughtfully were you traumatized lydia she asked her voice was serious but she was smirking a little underneath it no i answered i mean it wasn t i didntmind i mean i trailed off not quite sure what i did mean but the kiss hadntbothered me she laughed and jess grinned a little next to her then it all good sarah said pass the meatloaf jess would you oooooo the next morning the train left early for king cross station alicia and i were almost late because at the last minute she d realized she didnthave her favorite bracelet and it took us a long time to finally find it it was under her bed all the compartments were taken by the time we managed to climb gasping for breath onto the train but that was all right alicia grinned and said she d sit with john avery and i continued on to a loud compartment on the right where most of our study group sat around an eight person gobstones game lydia you made it marissa greeted me with a grin as she handed cameron a handkerchief he wiped his face grimacing at the taste of the yellow goop i sat down next to lyra and looked at the game expecting to see aaron royal blue stones dominating the board inner circle instead it was littered mostly with light purple stones who playing purple i asked me pernella replied not looking up i didntknow you were that good i told her impressed anyone who could trounce aaron was clearly excellent yeah cameron said looking dejectedly at the four stones he still had in play neither did we lyra nodded i ve already lost she told me pernella got me out ages ago although i guess aaron helped i laughed i could tell you ve still got the gobgoop in your hair a bit i do ugh where she asked turning towards the window to try and see it no hold still i told her and then took a tissue from the box on the floor and carefully wiped the light blue goop away yuck i know i dontknow why they invented this game she complained getting foul smelling stuff in people faces that the whole point gryffindork aaron said although if you re good you dontget squirted your go rosewater pernella grinned carefully flicking one of her larger stones it hit one of aaron s then ricocheted off of it to hit another both blue stones rolled off the board my points pernella said mildly damnit aaron hissed holding a hand up to shield his eyes as both stones shot blue gobgoop into his face that gross pernella smiled a little deviously i know the game continued for the rest of the train ride although for the last forty five minutes or so only aaron and pernella were still playing the rest of us alternated cheering them on talking about the coming summer and eating as much candy as we could by the time we finally pulled into king cross station we d gone through three bags of bertie bott every flavor beans thirty chocolate frogs and a box of pumpkin pasties and aaron and pernella were still playing i cantbelieve we re here already marissa said looking out the window we re really done with second year i know i replied quietly as evan yanked open the compartment door everyone going to write everyone else though right and parties lyra added someone have a big party i ll have a big party sleepover jill holmes suggested yeah cameron agreed following us out the door and off the train co ed slumber party like my parents are ever going to agree to that lyra scoffed they re nowhere near that cool hi lyra said a bemused sounding voice what wouldntwe agree to papa lyra cried dropping her trunk and running to a tall lanky red haired man and vaulting into his arms i missed you where daddy what are we having for dinner i felt awkward and a little jealous watching them so i backed up to stand next to cameron and evan instead evan glanced sideways at me the parents thing weirding you out yeah i admitted i dontusually think about it but now it like parents are swarming the place tell me about it cameron groaned i not used to seeing so many old people evan and i laughed a little and then i grabbed my trunk and perseus cage i should probably go i said i want to get to the leaky cauldron before it gets too late you want someone to walk with you evan asked no i ll be fine i said thanks though we hugged all around and then cameron yelled that i was leaving and everyone else came to say goodbye in an enormous group hug owl me lyra ordered before i left and watch out for psychopaths i grinned and winked at her then waved at everyone and moved through the brick wall back out to muggle london ooooooooooooooooo a n still dontown the potterverse sadly enough this chapter brought to you straight from beta readers ambika san ill ame and t mad hatter i know i know i a horribly slow poster i ll get better i promise my lovely and amazing betas all have chapter 27 with them and i ve almost finished 33 hopefully we ll get somewhere before deathly hallows i hoping it doesntcompletely screw up my plot what do y all feel about reading a slight au not that this isntsort of one already review review review chapter twenty seven the leaky cauldron halfway to the leaky cauldron i was stopped by a muggle man wearing a black leather jacket you by yourself he asked and i stepped back he was uncomfortably close yes i answered i would have lied even i knew that muggles would expect a twelve year old to be with her parents not dragging an enormous trunk down the sidewalk and carrying an owl but it would be too difficult to explain where my parents were if he asked where are you going he asked stepping forward a little i wanted to reach for my wand but i didnthave a hand free and didntwant him to know i was frightened home i told him not that it any of your business you re carrying an owl he pointed out i dontthink that legal cruelty to animals and all i glared at him perseus is not treated cruelly i snapped and he much prefers living with me and you re blocking my way he shook his head i cantlet a kid with a stolen owl stay on her own why are you carrying a trunk anyway are you running away as he talked he reached out with one hand to take my trunk and he put his other hand on my shoulder i think maybe you should come with me i shook his arm off and he let it fall to the handle of perseus cage um actually there my dad coming now i said looking in front of me and picking out a man at random see in the green shirt he ll be mad if i dontgo meet him i dontthink he started but i d already wrenched my trunk free from his grasp flicked perseus cage open and took off across the street leaving the empty cage in his hand i dodged a couple of the muggle carriages what were those things flinching when the drivers yelled at me but when i looked behind me the man was still on the other side of the road perseus fluttered above my head and finally came to rest on my shoulder and i sighed sorry perce i guess you ll have to make do without a cage for a while because i not going back there for it i hope he doesntcome over this way i added biting my lip i made sure to have my wand firmly in hand hidden in my pocket before i started walking again as fast as i could without attracting more notice ministry regulations or not i wasntgoing to be kidnapped by some crazy muggle the rest of my walk was uneventful although it was long it was almost unseasonably hot for june and my robes were black wool the only muggle clothing i owned was what i d worn to platform 9 my first year and i d outgrown it i probably should have changed into one of the lighter robes i d bought with danielle last summer but i hadntthought of it by the time i finally got to the leaky cauldron it was late evening and i was tired hungry sweaty and didntthink i could walk another step the bar was empty except for tom who was polishing glasses hi tom i called as i stepped in hello he replied you dontlook like you could drag that trunk any further i flushed and looked down at it it heavy i admitted i think the lightening charm about gone but i ve gotten it this far i ll get greg to bring it upstairs for you tom told me and maybe you should think about getting another one or at least fixing the charm though a girl your age shouldntbe staying alone here to begin with i d barely opened my mouth to reply when he ducked out into the hallway to yell greg bar i jumped at the noise and jumped again when greg appeared almost immediately in the doorway no need to yell he said mildly i was right there think you might get her trunk upstairs tom asked nodding at me you ve got the attic room right i did last summer i answered but shouldnti make sure well we ll go ask and then we ll see greg decided and let me get that it lydia right he asked taking my trunk and starting down the dingy hallway toward the main part of the inn yeah i answered as i trotted after him perseus still perched on my shoulder and you re greg right i didntactually have to ask since i remembered him from last summer tall strong and usually quiet he d seemed content to let the women chatter around him only speaking if someone addressed him first or there was a lull in conversation that d be me he answered and then fell silent i wasntsure if he was going to speak again but in the end it didntmatter sonia armstrong came out of the dining room as we approached who oh lydia it you she said smiling at me how are you how was your year you look exhausted greg why dontyou put that upstairs she in the left attic the same one as last year lydia how is hogwarts good i answered smiling a little back at her how are you and matthew and everyone oh everyone fine she replied putting an arm around my shoulders and whisking me into the kitchen where ingrid the cook was washing up you should have something to eat you look famished doesntshe look famished ingrid ingrid spared me a quick glance and even thinner than last time and i ll bet you didnthave anything on that train but sweets did you they only serve sweets i protested but i couldnthelp grinning as i was herded into a chair and handed a huge bowl of chicken soup and a tall glass of milk there sonia said decisively you re going to eat that and then you re going upstairs to sleep you can talk to matthew about hours tomorrow before breakfast and i ll let your owl outside poor thing he doesntlook like he likes the kitchen much perseus was looking a little miffed so i lifted him off my shoulder thanks i said to sonia and added to perseus and you go with her okay get yourself something to eat and stretch your wings out sonia smiled and patted me on the shoulder before dashing back out the door into the dining room perseus flying after her i sat in the relative quiet of the kitchen the wizarding wireless was playing softly in the background and ingrid was humming along to the singer and ate my soup slowly savoring each bite it was warm and the kitchen smelled like bread and chocolate with a hint of vanilla is it good ingrid asked me as she moved about the kitchen wiping down the counters and sink it excellent i replied but ingrid just sniffed no i mean it this is amazing i glad she told me finally with the ghost of a smile ingrid was an incredible cook but she never thought anything she made was good enough i couldntunderstand why that was everything she made tasted fantastic drink your milk she told me breaking into my thoughts it ll give you strong bones as she spoke a timer dinged by the oven and she turned away from me to pull out a cookie sheet the smell of chocolate grew stronger are those chocolate chip cookies i asked craning my neck to see the sheet i could hear the smile in her voice as she answered they are would you like a couple to go with your milk yes please i replied and after a moment she handed me a small plate with two cookies on it the chocolate chips had melted and the cookies were hot biting into them tasted like heaven you like them she asked a little nervous i grinned at her with my mouth full and gave her a thumbs up sign as i gulped down my milk they re fantastic i said finally totally amazing good ingrid replied whisking my empty plate and glass out of my hands now go to bed before sonia realizes you re still down here scoot grinning i ducked under her arm and hurried upstairs my room was in the attic four flights of stairs up from the kitchen by the end my legs hurt so much from all the walking that i promised myself that next year i was taking the knight bus and damn the cost my trunk was already there in the middle of the floor the room itself hadntchanged much it was still the same small space with the same sloping roof and the same mismatched furniture i opened my trunk and rooted around for a nightgown and headed for the bathroom to take a quick shower before bed it was down the hall and tiny but i was the only one who used it it was nice not to trip over alicia makeup and lotions and whatever else it was she kept in our bathroom at school after my shower i considered unpacking for all of about five seconds i was tired and sore and my bed was waiting for me unpacking could wait i dug around for my clock and placed it on the nightstand then promptly shut the trunk wake me up before breakfast i muttered to the clock as i tumbled into bed oooooo the next morning my alarm clock woke me up in time to see the very end of the sunrise i stretched luxuriously for a castoff bed it was actually really comfortable and lay for a moment watching the pink sky turn blue through my skylight the sunlight streamed in and danced in front of my eyes and i couldnthelp smiling to myself after a while i got up out of bed and started to move things out of my trunk and into the bureau and onto the shelves i tried to angle my plants to get the most sunlight except for my hangman moss which needed shade and arranged my potions ingredients for the best possible effect i felt smarter for having them on my shelves more responsible more grown up as i was reaching to take the books out of my trunk i heard a pecking at one of the windows curiously i reached to open it and a huge fluffy thing flew in and landed on the bed glaring at me agh i half shrieked before i realized what the enormous ruffled ball of feathers in my face was oh perce hi he blinked angrily at me and clacked his beak it took me a moment but then i realized what he was upset about all right i said i sorry i didntleave the window open for you but you never like to come in in the mornings and i was so tired last night he sat in stony silence on the bed aw perce i whined and then searched my shelves for an owl treat which i held out to him halfway forgive me if i promise not to do it again he held my gaze for a moment then stepped delicately forward to take the treat from my hand before flying to the back of the chair to perch i grinned and laughed a little you re such a brat sometimes perseus do you know that the clock chimed and i jumped realizing i was almost late for breakfast and dashed down the stairs they seemed a lot shorter this morning than they had the night before when i d been so tired the kitchen was bright and cheerful and smelled like bacon and biscuits and sausage ingrid had one eye on the pots and pans on the stove and the other on the bread dough she was kneading and danielle and alley were setting the oak table for five danielle turned as i walked in and called lydia good to see you again good to see you guys too i replied and added good morning to ingrid as i snatched a piece of bacon from the plate cooling by the stove she swatted at my hand go tell matthew and sonia we re about ready so if they want to eat before we open they d better get in here fast i saluted and dashed out the door matthew and sonia were in the dining room sending plates and place settings flying to the tables lydia sonia greeted me half turning good morning how did you sleep is the bed comfortable good morning matthew echoed her smiling at me matthew had dark hair and dark eyes and he usually looked like he hadntslept in a week does ingrid want us for breakfast i nodded she says you d better come now if you want to eat matthew laughed better not keep her waiting then eh sonia he asked offering her his arm she took it and i trailed them back into the sunny kitchen where the table was set with steaming plates of everything breakfast like my mouth watered just to look at it i hope everyone hungry ingrid said as she joined us at the table it ll be a long day i starved alley declared as she helped herself to some eggs and bacon how many people are we expecting today quite a few matthew told her sonia has the exact numbers dontyou dear at least fifty tonight she agreed there that order of merlin conference this week a bunch of them are staying over instead of flooing in the morning of dontask me why they re making a trip out of it ingrid said nodding as if she agreed with the idea cantsay i blame them are we getting anyone famous danielle asked her eyes sparkling i leaned forward to hear the answer but not for the same reason harry had an order of merlin and if he was staying at the leaky cauldron then i was in trouble i dontthink there anyone staying you would recognize sonia told us with a smile but you re welcome to look at the register if you like excellent alley breathed and maybe we ll get someone for dinner too maybe matthew agreed but in that case i expect you to act like adults better than adults in fact no hero worship no requests for autographs that clear i nodded danielle sighed heavily before nodding in agreement and alley sulked but muttered fine to her plate sonia laughed it not the end of the world girls they re just people you know they have a right to their lives just like you do matthew she continued turning her head do you think greg will be all right by himself tonight he told me he can deal with reporters by himself matthew answered with a shrug we ve never had a problem he couldnthandle before it not the reporters i worried about sonia told him it the girls i d hate to have someone mobbed here you worry too much matthew said but i ll talk to him and tom not slow about using his wand either you watch it ll be fine do you have the list of rooms we ll need cleaned by tonight danielle asked and from there the subject turned to the week work sonia summoned the register and let alley and danielle divide up the rooms leave a few for lydia she reminded them and then turned to talk to ingrid about menus for that week as it turned out the tomatoes we d been delivered were all sub par and ingrid refused to use them they had to revamp all the meals for the next few days in the middle of this matthew turned to me to talk about hours and a possible pay raise he still didntwant me waiting tables or really anywhere near the customers because of my age and i was perfectly content to work behind the scenes the last thing i wanted was for harry or my parents to see me or for some official person to enquire as to why a twelve year old was working instead of staying with her family i thought i d give you sundays off and every other thursday this summer matthew was saying i dontlike my girls to work too hard thanks i replied but you donthave to i want to he told me sternly besides it two more days a month that nothing we cantcover for i nodded okay i mean thanks excellent since that settled more bacon another biscuit these are fantastic ingrid by the way maybe your cooking the reason we have so many people staying ingrid sniffed but i could tell she was pleased as long as you have a word with ronald about the tomatoes matthew i cantcook if i donthave fresh vegetables of course matthew replied as the clock chimed the kitchen clock was set a few minutes fast as a warning and everyone jumped to finish breakfast just clear the plates and put them in the sink ingrid called lydia can wash them up alley danielle dontkeep the customers waiting we re going they chorused within minutes the table was deserted and only ingrid and i remained in the kitchen i cleared the serving dishes off the table and started to wash them as ingrid went back to the stove you dontmind some music do you she asked after a moment and i shook my head good she replied and the sounds of berlin premier orchestra filled the kitchen ooooooo a n so many many thanks to t m hatter and ambika san for beta reading this chapter for me as always i dontactually most of it the rest of this author note contains spoilers for deathly hallows if you haventread it yet please scroll down to the review button and click i ve been going through this fic and i could almost make it canon compliant obviously sirius will have to go as will snape remus and tonks i had my hopes about sirius and i still have them about sev but i might as well do it properly or not at all and the harry and professor granger storylines will have to be tweaked a bit what do you guys think are you more interested in canon compliant stuff or does it not matter if you do think i should revamp and it shouldnttake too long i ve gone through and marked what needs to be switched then do you have any suggestions who would make a good replacement family or a good head of slytherin or a good dada teacher end spoilers thanks for reading go review chapter twenty nine lunch with lyra lyra didntwrite back which didntsurprise me at first i did the best i could to put the whole thing out of my mind i worked at the leaky cauldron finished brewing the potions i d been working on and owled professor snape with the results finished all of my summer homework and then cleaned my room twice still no word from lyra july turned into august and i got my book list for the coming year including half a dozen books with titles like modern magical history and ethics morals and wizardkind and blood brothers my life amongst the vampires i didnteven want to know what class those were for in fact by the end of the first week in august i d nearly given up on lyra completely it was a thursday mid afternoon and i was curled up on my bed with one of professor snape potions quarterlies it had been at the bottom of a stack from the 1960s but the issue i was reading was from the spring of 1973 this was extremely odd i d never known professor snape to be anything less than perfectly organized furthermore the article i was reading the uses of hellebore in invisibility potions was completely clean every other article i d ever read had had professor snape notes all over it he d scribbled in the margins re worked equations and questioned charts and graphs it wasntuntil i reached the end of the article that i thought i d found the reason though the article author had been given in the beginning as one horace slughorn the very end had a note to the effect that slughorn potions master at hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry had merely edited and submitted the article it had been written by two of his fifth year potions students l evans and s snape i didntknow anyone named evans but s snape had to be professor snape i knew he was brilliant but i hadntknown he was that brilliant published in his fifth year and who was this mysterious l evans another slytherin what did the l stand for laurence ludo larry a loud knocking interrupted my thoughts come in i called it was odd for anyone to bother me in my room usually sonia and matthew respected my privacy and even danielle didntlike climbing four flights of stairs unless it was absolutely necessary i put the magazine aside as the door creaked open and peered through the crack trying to see who was behind the door yes i asked a little nervous now hi it was lyra voice and after a moment her face appeared in the doorway it me can i come in i stared at her and then nodded slowly and lyra stepped into my room hi i said finally finding my voice i was having a hard time believing that lyra could actually be in my room how did she even know where i lived how well you said you had a room here she answered my question before i could even ask it i just came and asked where you were and the woman sonia i asked frowning i dunno she had really long dark hair i nodded that was sonia all right that sonia armstrong she basically runs the place well with matthew right lyra said anyway so i just asked her where you were and she said upstairs and then i said i was a friend from school and could i visit you and she said definitely and that i should just go right up and keep going up the stairs so i did i like your room by the way thanks i replied and then hesitated um lyra about um your letter and my letter and that why i here she answered i wanted to talk to you about it in person do you want to walk somewhere we can get ice cream or lunch or dinner or something she paused half a beat my treat you donthave to pay for me i answered automatically but lyra just rolled her eyes and grabbed my hand come on she ordered we re going i was almost laughing as i allowed myself to be dragged down the stairs and out into the street where lyra stopped and looked in either direction okay so do you want lunch food or supper food or dessert food anything i answered i was nervous a little and so not at all hungry whatever you want that the worst answer i ever heard lyra declared but i going to let it slide let get sandwiches or something i followed her down diagon alley lyra stopped at the second caf we came to it was called kaladi brothers and had small wooden tables outside lyra promptly sat down at one and handed me a menu look she said after a moment i not going to tell anyone about about your parents or anything even though i think someone should be told i glared at her no one needs to be told anything i ve managed for a year and a half haventi yeah she agreed grudgingly but not well how are you going to get books and new robes and things i have a job i reminded her i didntwant to admit that i was wondering the exact same thing and that i hadntfigured out a workable solution yet so far i d decided to go without new robes for this year and get as many books as i could secondhand when the money ran out well there was always the hogwarts library they had to have textbooks but your job gives you meals and a room how much can they be paying you she looked at me and then shrugged whatever you donthave to answer but you know i right lydia even if you could just tell your godfather i not telling harry anything i cried and heard someone cough discretely above us i looked up to see the waiter and felt my face flush can i get you ladies anything to drink he asked looking for all the world as if he hadntjust heard me yelling pumpkin juice please lyra chirped and i asked for a lemonade lyra watched him go and then turned back to me you could she said earnestly he the boy who lived he the one who saved the entire wizarding world he played quidditch with my dad at hogwarts and all the villains of his stories at school are slytherins i finished i mean his archenemy was a slytherin was the freaking heir of slytherin i m i realized people were staring and i lowered my voice lyra i just canttell him that i one of them if disowns me too i wonthave anyone you ll have me lyra protested fiercely i wouldntlet you get hurt i shook my head lyra you re just as young as i am besides then you d have to tell your parents and they d tell vector or someone at the ministry you know they would it the law government people or teachers they have to what about snape she broke in you said you thought he knew but he obviously hasnttold anyone i thought about it for a moment well he doesntknow officially at least i haventtold him i donthave anywhere to go especially since i do have a place to go and as i remembered what evan had told me about professor snape involvement in the wars i dontthink he really plays by the rules anyway lyra sighed and shook her head but she was spared from answering by the appearance of our waiter bearing drinks ready to order er yeah i answered slowly can i have a sandwich please a blt french bread with chips of course he answered and turned to take lyra order fish and chips and a cup of soup and half an egg salad sandwich lyra could eat a ton coming right up girls lyra folded her arms on the table look lydia i just i worried do you get that i worried that you re going to to i dontknow but that something going to go wrong it not a big deal at school but here there are crazy people who stay at the leaky cauldron dontlook at me like that she protested it true and you could get hurt and and i just dontwant that to happen she finished i don t i swallowed and reached to take her hand you worry too much i said finally it safe really i safe i promise and if things get too bad i will get help it just that i can handle them now dontyou see what about the money she demanded but i could only shrug i ll use the money i make to buy what i can and i ll do without the rest will you at least come home with me for christmas this year she pleaded and i knew i d won course i answered it d be fun good she sighed and then her face brightened nice food as the waiter moved to place our dishes on the table i realized with a jolt that my hand was still holding lyra s i yanked it away before the waiter could notice oooooo after we d finished lunch lyra and i bought ice cream cones and ate them strolling along the street i felt grown up and rich and life felt perfect two best mates a perfect afternoon and ice cream lyra i said after a long silence mm i glad you came i told her i missed you and i sorry we fought really i am she smiled i sorry too and oh i almost forgot to tell you because i was so upset guess what what my sister helen you remember me telling you about her anyway she going to be teaching at hogwarts this year i dunno if we ll have her but she teaching a course in ethics or something i really excited lyra was in fact more than really excited she was practically jumping up and down really i asked woah will you have to call her professor trent and everything probably lyra told me she already said she wontplay favorites and i d better be three times as good as everyone else i laughed so that what all the right and wrong books are for yeah she said did you buy them yet no i admitted as we entered the leaky cauldron i haventgotten a chance yet lydia it was ingrid and she looked flustered lydia sonia looking for you she in the kitchen i followed her into the kitchen lyra close at my heels had something happened had i done something i shot lyra a panicked look and she took my hand again and squeezed it sonia was standing in the kitchen she smiled when she saw me dontworry she said immediately seeing my expression there a letter for you and the owl wontleave until you take it she explained nodding to a great eagle owl sitting on the back of a kitchen chair i moved forward to take the letter from its talon and turned it over in my hands the seal was an enormous elaborate swirling g lydia lyra gasped that a gringotts seal i stared at it and tore the letter open why would i be getting a letter from gringotts of all places unless my parents had died or harry but no that would have been all over the papers i would have heard about it i looked at the letter again aware of lyra and sonia reading it over my shoulder lydia m carmichael leaky cauldron diagon alley london 8 august 2013 dear miss carmichael it has recently come to our attention that the account at gringotts formerly belonging to one edward l carmichael has been passed on to you please come in at your earliest convenience to finalize this transfer our hours are between nine a m and five p m monday through saturday regards hedrod chief financial officer gringotts bank london i gasped but who i donteven know an edward carmichael sonia was shooing the owl out of the kitchen i sure they ll explain everything to you in person she reassured me we ll go in tomorrow after breakfast surely matthew can handle things for a few hours dontyou think ingrid she turned to lyra should you be checking in with your parents yes lyra grumbled i promised to meet them in quality quidditch supplies at six but i bet we ll be back they ll probably want to have dinner maybe lydia could eat with us she suggested her eyes brightening sonia shrugged it her day off lydia she begged please pretty please my parents would love to meet you i nodded i d love to i admitted thanks lyra grinned and i stuffed the letter into my pocket as i followed her back out the door to meet her parents neither of us said what we were both probably thinking how much money was in that account ooooooooo a n as usual i own only what jkr does not t m hatter beta ed this chapter and the last one for me because she amazing and wonderful d anyway reviews would be awesome i ve got through thirty six written so chapters should hopefully be coming fairly regularly assuming they get edited i start school in about a month so we ll see how quickly i can get chapters out once that happens chapter three warnings over invisible ink my charms class was only slytherins and there were just eight of us john avery who had pointed out the crying hufflepuff aaron trimble adrian macnair evan rookwood who hadntsaid more than two words yet cameron viridian alicia travers who had the bed on my right and maddison whisp who had the one on my left together we formed a small but tight group professor flitwick eyed us carefully and then said rather gently how are you settling in we nodded and smiled and agreed we were doing all right he examined us again as if to determine whether or not we were telling the truth and then told us to take out our wands and begin the lesson it was a practical fast lesson and it flew by before i knew it charms had ended and we were walking to our next class flying with gryffindor i hated flying with a passion it didntmatter if i was on a broom or a carpet or even a motorcycle heights terrified me the idea of being hundreds of meters above the earth only prevented from death by a flimsy piece of wood was not one i cared to think about so it was with great hesitation that i stood next to an ancient delicate looking school broomstick lyra wood bounced on the balls of her feet across from me grinning and talking animatedly with the boy next to her i felt jealous for a moment but that was soon eclipsed by my nervousness as i looked at my broom madam hooch blew her whistle catching our attention good morning everyone by a broom good now put your right hand over it and say up firmly people be firm about it she surveyed us carefully lyra broom had jumped into her hand almost before she was done speaking and several other gryffindors had also managed it out of the eight slytherins only maddison whisp held hers but as i watched john leapt into his hand and to my immense surprise so did alicia s my own broomstick hadnteven moved and i felt an odd sense of relief up i commanded there was no response bloody broom i muttered kicking it is there a problem miss madam hooch asked me frowning carmichael lydia carmichael there no problem oh well perhaps less brute force then i nodded glaring at the piece of wood get up now i ordered otherwise i shall hex you into oblivion shockingly it obeyed you ve all got your brooms good now mount your brooms and on my whistle kick off the ground rise just a few inches and touch back down three two and the whistle blew by the end of the lesson i could fly brief distances without touching back down in fear this was nothing compared to either lyra wood or maddison whisp both zoomed back and forth apparently engaging in a series of informal races but i was proud of myself when i finally dismounted john avery grinned in my direction i thinking of trying for the team he told me what now no i mean in a few years i d be good at it i think modest arentwe of course anyway you going to lunch no i ve some things to take care of catch up with you there sure he said and ran off to catch up with the others i pretended to examine my broom watching lyra finish talking to madam hooch walking past them to put the boom away i caught bits of their conversation quidditch tryouts beater and puddlemere united as i came back out lyra ran up to me you coming to lunch sure i said you were really good today where d you learn to fly so well my dad taught me i ve been flying since i could walk practically he flew for puddlemere united up until a few years ago he coaches now mainly you trying out for your house team then of course madam hooch said one of their beaters just graduated and the other a sixth year so at least they ll know i around if i dontmake it i thought beaters were usually the boys no that just because they re usually stronger but i can do it too i used to practice with my uncle on papa side he was a beater here too did he play professionally no he left school in his seventh year i guess it was and founded a joke shop the pieces slowly came together in my mind you mean weasleys wizard wheezes that awesome do you get free samples has he told you his secrets yes and no she said laughing i get free stuff sometimes i ve got a bunch of extendible ears but he doesnttell me anything only hints like all the passageways here you know there are a bunch into hogsmeade i d heard my godfather used to sneak out of here all the time i wish i could she said mournfully you straight arrow gryffindor girl watch it you i didntget a chance to reply we had reached the great hall and wordlessly we separated there was an unwritten rule here at school that slytherins and gryffindors did not socialize we were enemies dark verses light voldemort verses potter even though the war was over even though we were the same inside i ate fast to insure that i would have time to run back to the common room to grab my books for defense against the dark arts and history of magic i met alicia in our room searching her trunk for an extra bottle of erasable ink i knew i should have unpacked all this last night she grumbled want to borrow some of mine i ve plenty of the stuff you sure yeah go ahead i told her rummaging through the cabinet next to my bed and tossing her a small bottle blue ink okay yeah it fine anything so long as it isntpink i blinked at her i have a little sister it all she ll wear our room in pink she made mum dye her hair pink it disgusting really i dontknow what she thinking maybe she ll improve as she gets older i stated hopefully you looked good in the air thanks i was kind of hoping to be on the team sometime what position i dontknow chaser maybe i d like to score she paused you were watching that gryffindor what her name the blonde one wood yeah i replied trying not to sound defensive i like her oh just you know thought i d warn you to be careful some of them dont dontlike us talking with them you could get both of you in trouble you think yes i dontknow if they d do anything bad us being first years but they might want to inform you i guess who re they the older boys in gryffindor they can get away with anything i was talking to some of the second years at breakfast and my sister told me too she a fourth year it not smart to get on their bad side just be careful that all i saying she looked in earnest nervously pulling at her hair thanks no problem just think about it right right we walked to defense against the dark arts together we were the last two to arrive and nearly all the seats were taken one was left next to evan another by lyra i heard alicia sigh as i started down the aisle to lyra desk seat taken no she told me i was saving it for you grinning i slid into the seat and took out my book as professor rufford turned around to face us i hadntseen him clearly since the sorting but he looked friendly enough i going to do the roll call if you re here just say present cheerfully if not then no one has to say anything avery john present bagnold andrew present sir carmichael lydia here this droned on more boys than girls more gryffindors than slytherins until he finished with wood lyra present she chirped professor rufford looked up at us looking over the students one by one all at once his face went somewhat gray and he looked like he was about to throw up please excuse me a moment he said abruptly dashing out of the door stories sped through the classroom he was a seer and had received a vision he had just seen a death eater and was going to kill him he had seen a dementor he had seen his true love waiting outside the door if my great grandmother were still minister of magic teachers wouldntbe allowed to le a snobby looking gryffindor boy announced ministers arentallowed to meddle with hogwarts moron john avery said cutting him off the last one who tried committed political suicide when he did i wasntsure but it seemed like he d been watching evan when he d had his panic attack what could evan possibly have done i stole a look back at him he looked a little pale but i couldntsee anything wrong what was that all about lyra muttered to me i have no idea maybe he remembered something important he had to do i paused well he was looking at evan rookwood i mean when he left weird she said looking over her shoulder i wonder why i swallowed er donttell anyone i asked i dontthink that is if it about evan then i dontthink everyone should know course i ll even swear lyra said holding out her wand we touched the tips of our wands together i would realize later that this was the first test of our friendship could she keep a secret from her house especially when said secret was known by a slytherin i was to discover that she could a n if jkr owns it i don t if she doesn t i claim it for my own dontsteal please my thanks go to my beta readers emily amelie helena julia for editing for me chapter thirty an inheritance the next morning after breakfast sonia and i headed to gringotts bank i had my letter in one pocket and kept reaching down to make sure it was still there lyra had asked to come with us but i d had enough trouble evading her parents questions at dinner without having to run through the gauntlet again lyra parents i d decided were too responsible since they couldntimagine any parents letting a twelve year old wander diagon alley at night they d assumed mine must be somewhere nearby lyra and i had had to lie horrendously just to get them to let me walk back to the leaky cauldron alone it was sweet of them i reflected as i walked with sonia but it had made me feel like a child i wasntsure i liked that anymore it felt stifling who do you think would leave me gold i asked her i dontknow she replied did you know him or perhaps he just left his money to the youngest in his family if your father side is small oh i replied following her through the double set of doors and into the bank sonia walked purposely up to the long counter where a goblin with a dark pointed beard looked up mrs armstrong gabblehook she answered good morning how may i be of service he asked her his voice was cool but unfailingly polite and i wondered how he knew sonia i here with one of my employees lydia carmichael she received a letter last night show him the letter lydia informing her she d just inherited an account here his gaze swung to me and i dug out the letter and placed it on the counter he scanned it briefly if you would wait a moment he said and stepped down from his seat disappearing into the darker recesses behind the counter i waited nervously with sonia still wondering how any of this was possible it was five minutes before another goblin approached us this one was shorter and bald and he introduced himself as hedrod the one who d written my letter good morning he greeted us miss carmichael and sonia armstrong sonia finished i just accompanying lydia ah he answered excellent if you would just step into my office then i ll explain everything he added ushering us into a small room paneled in dark cherry wood there were two blue armchairs in front of a desk and a silver tea service on it i noticed that the kettle was steaming a little sit down he urged please sit down sonia took one chair and i sat down nervously in the other i was glad she was there to help i hadntknow whom to trust but when i d owled professor snape the night before to explain what had happened he d sent me a reply immediately sonia armstrong is a reliable woman he d written and she knows more about money than most people you d do well to ask her advice now hedrod started to finalize the transfer all we have to excuse me i said hesitantly but um could you tell me why i ve inherited it i i paused searching for the words it just that i didnteven know i had a i donteven know how we re related of course hedrod answered mr carmichael would have been your great uncle he made you the sole beneficiary of his will some time ago i gathered it was a family tradition of sorts oh i responded faintly sole beneficiary how much money is it hedrod handed me several sheets of parchment the first is your balance the second and third are for you to sign to confirm the transfer one for our records and one for yours and your key he added after a moment holding it out to me the key was small and gold and i reached out to take it without thinking i was still staring at the number written on the parchment is this right i asked faintly and hedrod nodded it mine i repeated just to clarify and hedrod nodded again with this much money i could buy books clothing anything and everything i needed i wouldnthave to worry about money again for years it all yours or it will be once you sign right i answered weakly accepting the proffered quill as sonia reached for the parchment with my account balance i felt a little dizzy as i scrawled my signature still unconvinced this wasntsome huge practical joke if you like hedrod said breaking into my thoughts i ll take you to your vault now that would be wonderful thank you sonia answered as she stood and grasped my hand to pull me to my feet i smiled gratefully at her as we followed hedrod i was still too shocked to move oooooo sonia i asked later as we sat and ate ice cream cones outside the ice cream parlor i d insisted on paying since i actually finally had money and sonia had laughed and accepted why do you think he d leave me that much money i barely even remember him even now that i ve been thinking about it she shrugged in a lot of families it traditional to skip generations that way money is inherited when people are young when they really need it and well what your family like on your father side nonexistent practically i replied dad got a cousin i think who his age and his parents are around somewhere but that all it really just us see so you re probably the logical beneficiary especially if you were a particularly likeable five year old i snorted but our conversation had reminded me of another question i d wanted to ask i hastily swallowed the ice cream in my mouth sonia i asked how do you know professor snape sonia looked at me thoughtfully how do you know about that i owled him last night i explained to tell him about the money and everything he wrote back and said that i should listen to you about the money that you were good with banks and money and everything she nodded but i thought she looked flattered nonetheless professor snape was my head of house back at school she told me after a moment you were in slytherin i asked my voice slightly high and screechy i tried to picture sonia as a teenager lounging in the slytherin common room or studying in the library it was difficult yes sonia replied with a little smile i was in slytherin all seven years in fact the more i thought about it the more sense the idea of sonia as a slytherin made did you like it was matthew a slytherin too uh no matt was a ravenclaw actually saved my life when you know who attacked hogwarts you were there i was shocked the most exciting part of hogwarts history and sonia was there it surprised me she d never seemed like the fighting type i couldntreally leave she said softly and then shook her head briskly we should head back soon but do you want to talk about your money first you wontwant to spend it all at once of course but it might help to put you on a budget what do you think i should do i asked her mindful of professor snape advice well she started i think you might as well spend what you ve got now and take another twenty galleons or so to school with you the rest you should leave we can talk about what you ll need next summer when we get there she paused of course you wontreally be needing to work any longer but i want to i protested i like working i think it good for me sonia smiled a little proudly i thought well in that case i certainly wontstop you i d still recommend only taking twenty galleons with you in september you can deposit any extra okay i agreed as i stood to follow her back to the leaky cauldron hey sonia i asked a few minutes later yes thanks oooooo the rest of the summer passed by in quick succession since i was no longer worried about money nearly all my anxiety had disappeared i was able to simply enjoy the hot days of august i was trying to be responsible with my newly inherited fortune but it was difficult there were so many things i wanted to buy besides the things i needed robes that fit schoolbooks a cage for perseus and a trunk for myself it seemed like every shop had something i wanted a scale model of the solar system a self stirring self heating expandable cauldron a marble and jade set of chess pieces it took all of my self control and finally some sharp words from sonia to keep me from spending every last knut of my inheritance lyra and i owled back and forth regularly and evan was still owling me with any interesting bits of history he d picked up he and i were also trying to make sense of ancient runes made easy which was a lot more complicated than i thought was possible marissa and i were even owling although less regularly the last owl she sent me before school started was after several weeks silence 29 8 13 dear lydia oh my god i am about to go completely utterly insane cameron kissed me i stared at the parchment in complete disbelief cameron kissed marissa he came over to my house because he wanted to talk he d just figured out that the books i gave him for his birthday were jinxed he came over still jinxed he was talking entirely in haiku which was hysterically funny he d realized what caused it had come to yell at me so we had a big yelling argument or at least i yelled he said things like your pranking of me causes me anger also sadness so please stop which is a horrible poem i told him so i just pointed out that he d started the whole thing my turning me purple last summer so it was really all his fault then after we d yelled and screamed for a while my mum came out told us we had to go outside because we were bothering the house elf which was a blatant lie because what are house elves for if they canthandle some healthy yelling but anyway we went outside because we really had to we were just walking along by the river there a river that runs through our yard you can follow it a bit he said something stupid i said well you donthave to be a stupid git all the time he said i would not prank you if you were not provoked so do not blame me then at that point i was going to slap him but then he just leaned in kissed me it was very strange awkward only in kind of a good way so then when he stopped i kissed him then mum called to say that he could stay for dinner if he wanted but we needed to come inside it was really awkward we didnttalk at all on the way back he didntstay now i dontknow if this means we re together am i his girlfriend now is he supposed to ask me to go somewhere what do i say to him on the train please please please help also happy early birthday i cantwait to see you marissa i stared at the letter in total utter shock marissa and cameron snogging it was a weird thought i could understand maybe why cameron would want to kiss her marissa was really pretty after all any boy would want to date her but cameron was well cameron i couldntsee how anyone could see him as anything more than a friend or friendly archnemesis as with marissa it was weird i dontknow what to tell you about dealing with him i wrote back to her i guess you should just wait and see what he does but if you are together now then i guess that ll change things or maybe you could try owling him you know worst comes to worst though you ll see him on the train on monday you can talk to him then or avoid him i guess but i think that a bad idea sincerely lydia oooooo sunday night ingrid baked me a huge birthday cake and everyone gathered around the table to sing happy birthday sonia and matthew and ingrid had even gotten me an elaborate stationary set and danielle and alley with greg pitching in had bought me a beautiful pair of green silk pajamas i was so happy that someone had thrown me a party that i almost started crying when i cut the cake the cake was chocolate and vanilla with mocha icing and small yellow sugar roses it tasted like heaven and sonia with a little protesting from ingrid who didntthink it was suitable let me have a tiny glass of firewhiskey it burned a little going down but it tasted surprisingly good a little bit like the punch we had at end of term parties that enough ingrid announced as i put my glass down she too young to be drunk welcome to being a teenager danielle said to me here to breaking rules and taboos greg put in and hearts alley finished let not corrupt her too badly matthew chided them gently danielle laughed next year then lydia we ll take you clubbing you will not ingrid burst out looking absolutely horrified in fact you two shouldnteven be clubbing more cake sonia cut in smoothly and the conversation turned back to less controversial things like matthew jokes which tended toward the knock knock variety they werentvery funny but they were so bad you had to laugh finally i had to pry myself from the table i sorry i said but i have to finish packing before i can go to sleep the cake was amazing though and thank you all so much for everything we were glad to do it ingrid answered for all of them just be careful next year make good choices i could hear alley danielle and greg snickering at her as i walked up the stairs i was mostly done packing except for the things i absolutely needed and the birthday presents and cards i d gotten that morning i d told harry i was staying with my roommate until school started which he d seemed to believe he hadntasked any awkward questions at least i was still wondering what my parents were telling him my new trunk held everything i owned with room to spare and it even had little shelves to keep things separated and neat by eleven o clock i was completely packed and ready for bed i was tired and a little sad to be heading back to school and homework but i was excited to see everyone again and to meet lyra sister helen besides my arithmancy books looked interesting and ancient runes made easy looked like it even had things like love poems in it i was just getting into bed when a knock came at my door lydia it was ingrid voice yeah i asked answering the door what going on can i come in she asked she looked a little nervous nervous and awkward of course i said stepping back is everything okay ingrid sat down slowly on my bed and motioned me to sit next to her no everything fine it just that she paused lydia what do you know about er menstruation not a lot i answered truthfully i d heard some of the older girls talking about it once or twice but it had all been very hush hush and giggly i picked at my quilt hoping that perhaps my bed would suddenly disappear sending me into a time vortex where i wouldnthave to have this conversation first maddison and alicia and bras and now this what was with people telling me awkward things about my body oh she said well usually it happens to girls when they re about your age or a little older you ll start to well bleed every month it perfectly natural you donthave to worry about there being something wrong with you although you might get some cramps across your lower back or in your abdomen there are potions you can take ingrid explained all about what it meant to be a woman and why that meant you had to be extra careful around boys she talked about what to do once you got your period only she called it the curse instead which i thought was silly and about how you should mark the date on a calendar so you would know when to expect it later it ll come every month or so she explained although some girls get it every four weeks and some get it more and some less and you shouldntbe surprised if yours isntregular at first that perfectly natural i wanted to ask why marking the dates was such a big deal then but i didntwant to prolong the conversation as it was this was one of the most embarrassing lectures i d ever gotten finally she looked at me seriously do you have any questions she asked me anything at all there nothing to be ashamed of um no i squeaked out i fine all right then if you re sure her voice made it clear i shouldntbe then i ll just put a box of ah female supplies in your trunk shall i would you mind that is would you not put them on top i asked quietly what if the trunk opened on the train and someone some boy especially saw them i would die of humiliation of course ingrid replied and her voice was surprisingly gentle goodnight lydia goodnight i replied watching her slip a small box into my trunk before slipping out the door ooooooooooooo a n still dontown harry potter t mad hatter beta ed this for me so about a zillion thanks to her especially since she beta ed for me instead of packing for college so next chapter we re heading back to hogwarts and you ll get to meet lyra older sister there also a brief cameo from hermione and cameron begins to worry about what it means to have a girlfriend and if you look down a little to the right there a little blue button chapter thirty one salazar library the train ride back to school was long it rained and thundered the whole way up with bright flashes of lightning illuminating the walls and scaring pernella half to death eventually lyra and aaron started a game of exploding snap and the entire compartment joined in i won the first round and evan the second then we switched to playing seep speed and elimination exploding snap which was far more exciting because it was louder and involved more cards exploding at the worst possible moments marissa was the first to lose which wasntsurprising at all but cameron lost next and he d always been one of the best in our year i was surprised until he left the compartment and then i realized that he was following marissa to someplace quieter strange evan remarked i ve never seen him lose that badly bad hand chasing after marissa more like aaron told him snickering a little they re dating he her boyfriend oooh marissa and cameron sittin in a tree lyra sang k i s s i n g i didntknow they were actually officially together i complained marissa wrote that she didntknow she doesn t pernella announced aaron just being annoying but her voice changed to a higher breathier pitch i hope they do start dating they d be so cute together i really jill holmes started but whatever she was going to say was cut off by an enormous boom of thunder which was immediately followed by the loud crack of eight or nine cards exploding at once oh bollocks lyra said i out oooooo the floor of the great hall was soaking wet by the time we straggled in clutching our cloaks tightly around us and holding our hats on our heads mine had been guaranteed waterproof for a hundred years but it couldntprevent the rain pouring off the brim from dousing my cloak and soaking through to my robes i saw alicia ahead of me wringing her hair to get the water out and cameron and i squeezed through the crowd of students to get to her hey i called poking her how was your summer lydia she cried pulling me and cameron once she noticed him into a very wet hug i missed you so much isabel was talking to her boyfriend all summer and kept ignoring me and bethy was just being annoying do girls do that cameron asked looking a little panicked at the idea do what talk to their boyfriends all the time well isabel does alicia answered why cameron mumbled something indistinct and collapsed into a chair next to me you dontthink marissa he started as the sorting hat began to sing i shook my head at his question but had to wait until the end of the song before i could assure him that marissa wouldnttry to talk to him constantly why would she want to aaron asked from across the table smirking at cameron just kidding mate hmph cameron retorted brilliantly as he scanned the row of first years standing before the hat bets on how many i can sort correctly this time see if i can match my perfect record from last year i think that weird alicia told him but i hope you re taking divination this year of course he said but we ll see how good a class it is enough stalling evan decreed what this one carla ferguson what she going to be cameron looked at her thoughtfully with a name like ferguson she could only be a ravenclaw you re sorting by name now alicia asked with just a hint of disdain cameron answer was cut off by a yell from the sorting hat ravenclaw ha i dontbelieve it evan said shaking his head he actually making the sorting decisions before the hat let rent him out i suggested we could get anxious pre firsties to pay to see what house they ll be do you think they d actually fork over gold cameron asked me perking up considerably as he added and him he ll be the first slytherin sure enough peter halloway became the first slytherin and we burst into noisy cheers when the noise died down alicia and i started playing tic tac toe letting cameron sort the first years as they came up to the stool to be honest i was a little jealous i couldntpredict the future or read personalities at a glance or whatever it was that cameron was doing on the other hand i wasntthe one getting strange slightly uncomfortable looks from the people around us cameron must have noticed because he pitched his voice so only we could hear for the last first year eliza yu to hufflepuff i dontget how he does it alicia was complaining to me when vector finally stood up good evening everyone she greeted us cheerfully i d like to start this year by introducing two new faculty members professor trent who will be teaching a new class ethics and morality helen would you like to introduce yourself i followed vector nod to examine lyra sister helen who shook her head at the headmistress question but did stand briefly she was tall nearly six feet with long reddish brown hair that curled a little at the ends she didntlook anything like lyra and as professor rufford has decided to take this year off for some extended research time in zimbabwe it is my great pleasure to introduce professor granger who will be taking his place professor granger stood up and nodded shortly before sitting down again she was short much shorter than professor trent and had bushy brown hair her name was vaguely familiar although i couldntplace it probably she was just related to some author i d read over the summer professor vector continued with the usual announcements the forbidden forest was forbidden magic in the corridors was forbidden anything made by weasleys wizard wheezes was forbidden happiness and fun were forbidden before finally finishing so we could eat what do you think they ll be like evan was asking the two new teachers i mean the first one the tall one she hot cameron observed craning his neck to see her better you cantsay things like that anymore alicia told him in exasperation you re taken if you have a girlfriend you canttalk about other girls then what the point cameron grumbled if we have to tell you that aaron retorted then you shouldntbe dating anyone oh shut it cameron snapped at him aaron just laughed and we debated about what the two new teachers would be like and why we needed of all things an ethics course until sarah touched me on the shoulder lydia she said quietly all the third years need to leave the feast early the seventh years want to talk to you guys in the common room ten minutes okay what about i asked evan and cameron who were close enough to have overheard looked at her expectantly you ll see was all she would say before leaving to sit at the other end of the table with the rest of the seventh years what the hell john avery asked but the rest of us could only shrug as far as i knew we hadntdone anything particularly bad we hadnteven been on the grounds an hour yet ten sickles says it all cameron fault evan joked to me hey meant nicely of course he added and cameron rolled his eyes we d better head down then alicia said finally we dontwant to be late right i said and we stood as a group most of the boys grabbing rolls for the road and started down to the dungeons all of the seventh years were sitting on the couch when we walked in eleanor carrow the slytherin keeper was snuggled up next to jonathon barbary greg harkiss and peter marchbanks were on his other side and melissa radford and sarah portsmouth were sitting on the far left of the couch it was always amusing to me that the seventh years with six slytherins were considered a fairly large year the class before had had seven slytherins and was considered monstrous it was a small point of pride that my year had eight slytherins so john avery said finally as the rest of us shuffled in place behind him you wanted us here early i looked at sarah finally catching her graze and bit my lip she merely winked at me but that was a little comfort surely she wouldntbe winking if we were all about to be expelled she broke my gaze to look at greg harkiss as if to say well you tell them greg cleared his throat right well why dontyou guys sit down there are plenty of chairs and the rug comfortable enough he paused a beat as we scurried to find places to sit and you can all stop looking at us like scared hufflepuffs no one getting expelled cameron caught my eye as we both started laughing evan plopped down next to me on the floor that a relief he muttered in my ear i wasntfancying explaining it to my cousin no kidding i whispered back and then turned to face the seventh years greg was speaking again you all know the founding of hogwarts greg was asking that four best friends gathered together to form a school and teach young wizards and witches such as yourselves and that everything was beautiful and cheery until it all went to shit we blinked at him this was not quite the way professor binns had taught it anyway as the great salazar slytherin was leaving his weeping students behind he promised them that he had left various protections in place and that he would always be there if they or hogwarts needed him you mean like the basilisk that killed the ghost in the girls bathroom aaron asked grinning a little yes greg answered like that and he also told his students that he d left his personal library which held an enormous number of scrolls for them over the years it became traditional for every graduating slytherin to leave at least one book for the house library and most leave more than one or journals if they re significantly egotistical he paused looking around at us and melissa radford took up the thread now this library is only for third years and up you re on your honor not to tell the younger students and if you do i ll hear about it and you ll regret it there is a smaller section for those books which are too disturbing for your young eyes it for sixth and seventh years and prefects only and if you want a book in there you ll have to get one of us to go in for you which isntbloody likely what if the firsties or second years see us going in cameron asked wontthey wonder they wontsee you melissa told us calmly how can you be sure adrian asked her folding his arms adrian like maddison seemed to think he was better than everyone sometimes it worked on the students our age but melissa was the top student in her year and a prefect as well not to mention the fact that the radfords were one of the oldest wizarding families in britain do you have any idea where the library is macnair did you ever see an older student entering it or hear about it she snapped and then at his slow head shake i thought not if the rest of you donthave any other her voice didntsay stupid but implied it comments we ll show you the library we shook our heads and melissa led the way through a door hidden behind a dark hunter green tapestry i d never noticed the tapestry before which was odd it was in the middle of the wall and it was nicely embroidered with a dragon hunting scene i was in the middle of formulating a theory on why this was possible when i stepped completely into the slytherin library the room took my breath away it was completely paneled in dark cherry wood with small lit globes hovering above us towards the ceiling the ceiling itself like the great hall was enchanted it looked like the winter sky with the stars glittering brightly above us the walls were covered in shelves and shelves formed rows across the room every shelf was lined with books and one wall had a cabinet with what looked like scrolls piled on top of each other the shelves were all tall much taller than i was and ladders stood on rollers to reach the upper shelves there a card catalogue by the door sarah told us and our own personal librarian in the form of a large book tell her what you re looking for and she ll find it for you you ll want to introduce yourselves to her in the next few days we followed her finger which was pointing to the large podium where a leather bound book lay open next to it was an enormous filing cabinet there are study carols towards the back too they lock excellent place for getting work done sarah continued and of course there a plethora of chairs and desks scattered about i looked around me in amazement i couldntbelieve this had been hidden away for so long no wonder professor snape had told me not to worry overmuch about buying all the potions books he recommended they were probably all here waiting can you believe this i muttered to evan who only shook his head dontyou get it he asked me eyes shining remember what greg said about journals this place has got to be full of primary sources i almost smacked him as it was i had a hard time not bursting into laughter primary sources what kind of thirteen year old wanted primary sources oooooo my first class of the year was beginning ethics and morality it was an odd mix of students as it turned out not everyone was taking professor trent ethics class everyone was required to take three years so only fifth years and up were actually guaranteed a spot for everyone else placement was random there were twenty students in my class and evan lyra and i were the only third years i was a little disappointed i d been looking forward to hearing alicia justify her anyone not like me is inferior dogma on the other hand the mix of kids looked interesting and as one of the younger ones i probably wouldnthave to talk as much professor trent started the class by walking in once everyone had been seated and writing her name on the blackboard good morning she said my name is helen trent professor trent to you and this is beginning ethics anyone here who shouldntbe now is the time to leave she paused a moment looking around at us this everyone good we ll just do attendance and then we re going to move the desks into a circle unless you would prefer sitting on the floor this class is discussion based so i want you to be able to see each other jeremy bassett right here the voice came from a tall blonde boy sitting between peter marchbanks and a hufflepuff boy whose name i couldntremember lydia carmichael here i said raising my hand halfway so she could see me she nodded and i relaxed against the back of my chair as she called more names there was only one first year a frightened looking hufflepuff and two second year girls every other year had three or four it seemed like we were evenly divided between girls and boys and the four houses i caught lyra eye as professor trent called for joanna umfraville who said very quietly that it was umfraville with a long a and grinned lyra crossed her eyes at me lyra wood er here charis yaxley present she had that carefully bland bored tone of voice that almost screamed wealthy pureblood eliza yu here she whispered i felt a little sorry for her who had thought that putting a first year puff in with a bunch of older students was a good idea excellent that everyone then desks in a circle please oh couldntwe sit on the floor a fourth year gryffindor named paige lombardi asked suddenly it d be more casual connolly finished for her informal like he was tall and bulky i figured he d probably be on the gryffindor quidditch team i didntrecognize his name there wasnta wizarding family called connolly that i was aware of maybe he was a muggle born i ve been around alicia and adrian and john for too long i scrawled on a spare piece of evan parchment i starting to wonder if people are pureblood or not and i donteven care i know he wrote back maybe that why so many slytherins wound up psycho pureblood supremacist death eaters they were just indoctrinated day and night with no rest or possibility of reason no access to actual muggles or muggle borns until they had no choice but to i took the parchment away from him you re creeping me out also i not going to become a psycho pureblood supremacist death eater and miss carmichael mr rookwood would you care to join the rest of us professor trent asked coolly taking the parchment off my desk and scanning it on the floor please a little shamefaced we grabbed our bags and went to sit on the floor i claimed a spot next to lyra and evan sat next to me professor trent stood in the middle of the circle for a moment looking at us before she too went to sit down now you know that this is just the first class in a progression of three she began those of you in your fifth and sixth years will have to put up with me until you graduate the rest of you will have your second and third years sometime in the future seventh years obviously only have this year this class is supposed to teach the difference between right and wrong true and false good and bad i have my own doubts about the ability of a class to teach a bunch of teenagers about things they ve probably already made up their minds about please professor why are you teaching this class then why is it even being offered it was lombardi again i wondered if she was going to be one of those kids who never stopped talking i hoped not this class is part of a long list of ministry directives to help ensure the safety of the wizarding world it was brought up in the ministry focus group that the hogwarts curriculum is very science based the thought for this class was that perhaps a generation of students trained in logic and creative thinking a better grasp of cause and effect and basic ethics if you will would be less likely to unthinkingly support a tyrant like say lord voldemort she paused as a few students gasped at the mention of his name i am teaching this class because the headmistress asked me to anything else before i talk about class structure there were no other questions so professor trent reached behind her for a stack of books which she spread out in front of her in the circle these are the textbooks for this year i think we ll use them all and i dontthink you ll have to add too many more over the next two years but remember that this is the first time i ve taught this class things may change i ll just read the titles out you ll need ethics morals and wizardkind a hundred and one wizarding dilemmas a proper consideration of muggles house elves and other dependants the third edition of modern magical history great wizarding events of the twentieth century the rise and fall of the dark arts make sure that the 2010 edition please and hogwarts a history anyone who doesnthave what they need can talk to me afterwards and the library always has extras if you lose yours or loan it to your roommate or whatever i ll keep copies of nature nobility a wizarding genealogy and notable magical names of our time in case you ever wish to consult them if you have extra money and want to order more books we ll be reading selections from hairy snout human heart and blood brothers my life amongst the vampires but otherwise i ll hand out printouts questions are we going to read them all the whole way through this question was from a second year gryffindor girl named rockwell who looked a little overwhelmed i not sure yet professor trent responded i ll be assigning reading on an hour a night policy if i assign something on wednesday for friday then i expect you to work for two solid hours on it if you have a problem finishing it then talk to me and we ll work something out she paused looking around at us i expect that the older students will be more than able to handle the workload i dontwant anyone to come in without the reading done on a regular basis you ll be writing for me as well i ll try to make sure it fair since some of you have been writing essays for a long time and some of you have never written one before but i expect everyone to use proper spelling and grammar get someone to look over your essay if you need to i also expect that you will all back up your statements with solid logical arguments evaluate your sources explain why you disagree if you disagree i wontmark off if i dontlike what you re telling me but i will mark off if you cantsupport it she glanced up at the clock there were maybe thirty minutes left to the class any questions no then read the introduction and first chapter of ethics morals and wizardkind and the introduction from a hundred and one wizarding dilemmas and please bring them both with you to the next class you re dismissed we grinned at her thirty minutes free was a gift and evan and i stopped to apologize for passing notes before we left just dontdo it again she told us but she didntreally sound angry i glad you re asking yourselves that sort of question though you ll have noticed that muggle born enrollment is down of course evan said i only nodded i hadntactually noticed a huge difference but i just thought it was just a typical rise and fall thing it a symptom of a growing problem voldemort defeat did not remove the anti muggle lobbyists from the ministry and there a growing movement of isolation coming up again that combined with muggle parents concerns about the safety of their children has led to a decided dip in muggle born wizards and witches being trained she paused thoughtfully this sort of thing never leads to anything good maybe we should talk about it in class especially if you re already thinking about it do you think it such a problem with the rest of the students evan and i exchanged hesitant glances our house is the only one without muggle borns i explained finally and we have the most pyscho pureblood supremacists professor trent asked finally smiling i see well maybe we ll talk about it anyway dontforget to do the reading she added and evan only grinned i never forget to do the reading he insisted come on lydia let go i think john grandmother sent him cookies this morning let see if he wants to share ooooooooooooooo a n erm i still dontown anything jkr does i just playing t m hatter ambika san and ill ame all beta ed this for me meaning they deserve love and thanks and such also loads of thanks to shadowcub who pointed out that i d uploaded chapter 30 again next chapter is an actual class with professor trent review tell me what i doing wrong chapter thirty three midnight conversations it turned out i neednthave worried about the ball we found out two days later that it was only for fourth years and up there would be an early feast for the whole school and then the great hall would be transformed into a spectacular ballroom for the older students while the rest of us went to bed reactions to this were mixed alicia locked herself in our bathroom for four hours maddison and i had to use the first year s but the news put cameron in a cheerful mood until marissa realized that he was happy about not going to a ball with her at which point the fireworks started i was more relieved than anything else shopping for robes sounded like more trouble than it was worth and i wasntlooking forward to dressing up and dancing with some boy i probably wouldntlike like that after which there might be kissing which marissa said was enjoyable but i was iffy on like alicia lyra seemed disappointed when they announced it which surprised me i didntget to ask her why until the end of defense against the dark arts when professor granger set us to practicing simple jinxes did you want to go to the ball or something i asked her as i ducked her leg locker curse you looked upset when vector said we couldn t she shook her head well i mean not about the ball exactly i was really excited about it because matt asked me to go with him and then when vector said we couldntgo i was so mad but then matt said maybe we could just go out to hogsmeade instead and that just as good better even because i donthave to go buy some stupid frilly dress robes oh i replied as i sent back a tickling charm it must have been particularly strong because it hit lyra square in the chest and knocked her giggling madly onto the floor i didntknow you liked him for some reason lyra exhilaration bothered me why was she so happy about going somewhere with hornby well i ve always sort of liked him she confessed only i never said anything to anyone because you know it would sound stupid only then it turned out he likes me too she said this all through huge bursts of laughter and it was only after professor granger aimed a counter curse in her direction that lyra was able to stand back up lydia you arentmad are you i mean you dontlike him do you i stared at her shaking my head hornby she thought i liked hornby he was irritating and pompous and his hair looked idiotic always messy and in his eyes and the idea of kissing him or snogging in the library stacks ugh no why would you think that she shrugged i dontknow you sounded kind of mad or something i just wanted to make sure you werentjealous or anything jealous i repeated incredulously why would i be jealous he looks like a goat dontcall my boyfriend a goat lyra snapped i was just asking okay sheesh oh he your boyfriend now i thought you hadnteven gone anywhere the bell cut me off and lyra scooted out of the room before i could finish my sentence i almost didntmind if she wanted to go out with some gryffindork goat boy and then have the nerve to call me jealous then she could bloody well leave i stomped out of the room narrowly avoiding professor granger and headed down the hall to dinner halfway there i realized i wasntreally hungry instead i wanted to go back to my room and hit something so i did oooooo by one thirty in the morning i was still in a foul mood i d finished all my work for the week except for a runes translation it was a fragment of a love poem not something i was keen on doing and had started throwing quills at the ceiling like darts trying to make them stick after my fifth failed try with my best eagle quill maddison finally lost her temper lydia she snapped either stop throwing those quills or get the hell out of the room before i hex you bloody i ve got a transfiguration essay to finish and you re distracting me so so get out she yelled and threw a bottle of ink at me i ducked it then grabbed my rune dictionary and headed to the common room making sure to slam the door shut i assumed the common room would be empty so i didntbother to open the door quietly or walk in slowly usually the common room was deserted by one o clock students went to bed or snuck out to shag in the astronomy tower or behind the lake or retreated to the slytherin library in a desperate search for relevant books it wasntuntil i d yanked the stone door shut behind me and flung myself down on an armchair that i realized i wasntalone i could hear someone crying somewhere behind me i turned slowly to see sarah portsmouth at one end of the seventh year couch sobbing at first i didntknow what to do sarah had always seemed to be perfectly happy and in control seeing her crying was disconcerting for a moment i stayed in my chair unable to move but finally i stood up and slowly walked over to her sarah i whispered i didntwant to sit down next to her maybe she was one of those people who wanted to be alone while they cried and anyway the seventh year couch was strictly for seventh years so i stood a little awkwardly to the side she gulped back a sob oh hi lydia she answered shakily you re up late i ignored that are you all right what wrong she shook her head wiping at her eyes it been a really really crappy day her voice still wavered but she managed a smile oh i replied after a moment i sat down on the floor at her feet do you want to talk about it jess broke up with me sarah said she was starting to cry again i swallowed i hated it when people cried and i didntknow what to do when a couple broke up marissa usually rolled her eyes called cameron a prat and moved on cameron only came to me for advice when they were together did you badmouth the other person ask what had happened remind her that there were other fish in the sea she met someone sarah continued bitterly some mediwitch how d she meet a mediwitch i asked curiously before realizing that maybe i wasntsupposed to ask that sort of question she messed up in training sarah explained took a curse to the leg slipped broke something she wants to be a hit witch she added she so daft at least here she bit back a sob and i tentatively put a hand on her arm she could have waited until after halloween i have these ridiculously expensive robes because she wanted to take me and now i wonteven be able to wear them i sorry i said quietly you ll find someone better maybe sarah agreed gloomily as she conjured a handkerchief and wiped her eyes you ll have noticed there a definite dearth of witches seeking witches around here bloody heteronormative conformists heterowhat uh no i didntnotice why would i have noticed she smiled a little bit at that well i sure you will she was silent for a moment and then lowered herself to sit down next to me on the floor you re pretty tense lydia bad day for you too i had a fight with lyra i confessed i d nearly forgotten it listening to sarah but now it all came rushing back over what she has a boyfriend now you had a fight because she got a boyfriend sarah asked sounding curious when sarah put it that way it sounded stupid but i d been angry i still was angry where did lyra get off thinking it was okay to act the way she had well she called me jealous are you ew no i said making a face he looks like a goat you couldntpay me to go out with him sarah laughed i wasnttalking about being jealous of her silly then what i trailed off uncertainly if i wasntjealous of lyra then did sarah mean i was jealous of hornby why would i be jealous of someone with bad hair and an unfortunate resemblance to a mountain goat sarah stood up stretching a little while i was still mulling it over thanks for cheering me up lydia she told me i going to get to bed you should too it really late you re welcome i said even though i didntthink i d actually done much good night night sarah replied cheerfully at the door she half turned back to me oh and lydia i meant that you could be jealous of what s his name the boyfriend for having lyra what i asked but the door had already swung shut behind her jealous of matthew hornby for dating lyra that would mean i d have to want to date lyra myself didntit well that silly i said to the closed door oooooo by the time i d finally finished my rune translation it was nearing two o clock in the morning and i was almost asleep i knocked softly on our door not that i was expecting anyone to still be awake and then let myself in maddison stood by her bed toweling herself off i squeaked oh hi lydia she said looking over her shoulder i saw her reach for an inkwell hi maddison i answered stepping uncomfortably towards the bathroom i just going to go brush my teeth and let you put clothes on you do that she said watching me go with a bemused smirk i shut the door tightly behind me turned on the tap so maddison wouldntthink anything was wrong and jumped up to sit on the counter sarah wasntright i wasnt into girls but seeing maddison like that made me feel different funny sort of tingly kind of like what alicia described feeling when she was around john except that alicia wanted to go out with john and i definitely didntwant to go out with maddison i waited a long time until i was sure maddison had gone to sleep before i came out of the bathroom and crept into bed oooooo that night i dreamt that when i walked into our room sarah was standing where maddison had stood when i squeaked out her name she dropped her towel to the floor hi lydia she said quietly what are you doing here i i was just that is i live here i stammered donti as i spoke i realized that the room was changing it wasntmy room anymore it was smaller and round with lots of low hanging silks above a large bath i shifted awkwardly why dontyou take a bath sarah asked stepping slowly into the tub i swallowed heavily as i watched the steam swirling up around her body arentyou going to sarah laughed and reached out a hand to me you can come too she told me and i took her hand and stepped into the bathtub as my clothes slowly melted away she ran a hand up my arm you re so tense lydia she half whispered pulling me closer you should relax she leaned in to kiss me and i closed my eyes her lips brushed against mine and i woke up breathing heavily it took me a few moments to smooth out the sheets and fix the quilt and then i lay still in the darkness i could hear my heart pounding and feel my blood pulsing through my veins i d just dreamt that sarah and i had taken a bath together naked without clothing i d just had a a lesbian dream it made me blush just to think about it but did that mean i was actually not straight sarah had implied it how the hell did she know and maybe even lyra had guessed but i couldntbe gay i couldntactually like girls like that could i just because i didntlike boys didntmean that i had to like girls except that i had to admit that maybe lyra was right i was jealous of hornby and in my dream well i hadntseemed to mind i d wanted to be with sarah but what did that mean i slipped out of my bed and pulled on my dressing gown green satin i d splurged at twillfitt and tattings then padded silently back down to the common room and into the library it was deserted of course it was nearly four in the morning and not nearly close enough to exams for people to still be awake and the lights had been dimmed i made my way to the large oak podium where the slytherin librarian resided and opened the leather bound book hello i wrote carefully the words lingered for a moment on the page before melting away good morning lydia appeared almost immediately how can i help you her words swirled away and i picked up the quill again what does it mean to be a lesbian a lesbian is a woman who is sexually attracted to other women from the lesbian sappho a bisexual greek lyric poet living on lesbos in the sixth century bc oh i wrote it sounded so clinical detached it about falling in love she wrote after a moment lesbians are women who fall in love with other women instead of men would you like a list of books i thought about it for a moment i was tempted but what if someone saw them alicia would flip if she thought one of her roommates was a lesbian no thanks if you re sure her tone even through the paper was decidedly cooler lura was a librarian through and through and felt that books ought to be the only sources a person consulted i sure thanks for your help though lura you re welcome she answered i waited politely until her words disappeared to shut the book then turned and headed back to my room i was tired and i didntwant to deal with the implication of her words if a lesbian was a girl who liked other girls and i was a girl who liked other girls then did that make me a lesbian i d hoped too that lura would be able to give me more than just a definition some of the older students said she was the best person to talk to about any kind of problem it was fine to know what a lesbian was but she hadnttold me how i could know for sure or what to do if it was true where did you find other lesbians how did you know when two girls went out somewhere who paid what would other people think what would they say i was still turning it all over in my head when i got to my room and stumbled back into bed which was when i noticed the large barn owl sitting on my headboard half asleep i stared at her lo owl why are you here in answer she reached down to nip the piece of twine that tied a letter to her talon and dropped the letter on my pillow i reached for it saw my name on the front and put it by my bedside table until i was more awake she started to take off and i sat up struck by a sudden idea hold on a sec hon she touched back down watching me curiously as i scrambled for parchment and a quill how do you know if you really are lc i scrawled and folded the parchment carefully here i said handing it to her give this it for a girl named sarah sarah portsmouth she a seventh year in slytherin with me can you wait for a response please only dontwake her up if she asleep she blinked at me as if she understood and flew off while i snuggled back into my bed sarah would clear things up for me she would know what she was talking about ooooooooo a n as always hogwarts and the rest of the potterverse belong to jkr i just playing t m hatter ambika san and ill ame all edited this for me so lots of thanks and hugs and cookies for them and also many thanks to stopthesignal who realized i d mistakenly written lydia initials as lb ah deathly hallows when will you stop screwing with my plot and i sorry this one took so long college apparently actually involves work who knew also i was having some serious issues with lydia dream because writing erotic dreams about a thirteen year old is just awkward anyway this one was fun and the next chapter will hopefully be out soon and please do review i promise i ll write back and send cookies and happy thoughts seriously though if i doing something you dontlike or something you do or you re just confused if no one tells me i ll never know and my writing will deteriorate so review chapter thirty four realizations at breakfast the next morning i waited anxiously for the mail i d brought last night letter with me to read the handwriting looked like harry s and i opened it over my toast and bacon i was a little worried about what he might say he d had seemed just a little skeptical when i d seen him on my birthday where are your parents he d asked are they all right mum wasntfeeling well i d lied and then changed the subject by the end of dessert he d seemed perfectly calm and cheerful i d just assumed he d forgotten that my family never seemed to be around now though my worries came flooding back what if harry had actually asked my parents what if he d gotten suspicious enough to talk to them or poke around on diagon alley i wasntna ve harry potter was the boy who lived the savior of the wizarding world people would tell him anything if for instance he managed to run into danielle or alley and mention that he was worried about his goddaughter she d stayed at the leaky cauldron over the summer with her parents perhaps they remembered her a black haired girl dark eyes about thirteen name of lydia then either girl would immediately give me up without a second thought oh lydia danielle might answer she works here in the summer i didnt know she was related to you i tore open harry letter logically i knew that he couldnt have found out about me but what if he had dear lydia how is your third year going so far excited for halloween and the feast that was always one of my favorite parts of the year how are your new classes going arithmancy and ancient runes right i never took either but hermione took them both she took everything bit mad if you ask me speaking of classes what do you think of hermione as a teacher is she any good what about your ethics class i just heard about it and i not sure it ll quite work out the way they want but maybe i wrong what your take i scanned the rest of the letter no mention of my family or my house harry suspicions must have faded and professor granger must not have said anything to rekindle them hey cameron said poking me i half jumped in my seat and he snickered way to be out of it lydia you didnteven notice the owl pecking at your chair isntshe your godfather s i looked behind me and grinned apologetically at the owl she must have gotten sarah response yup that her i reached up to take the parchment from her and tore it open cameron looking over my shoulder said with a frown that from your godfather his handwriting looks like a girl s er no i replied absently someone borrowed his owl that all sarah had written only one line you ll just know i realized as i reread the note that i d hoped for something more decisive if she d said there a secret handshake or you ll test positive or you ll turn blue sometimes then i could be sure i wasnt i didntturn blue and i didntknow a handshake or anything i guess i just wanted some way to prove to myself that i wasnt gay because because it seemed like i was i didntlike boys but i seemed to like girls you ll just know sarah had written i looked up and caught her eye and she winked i looked back down at the note and then up at sarah and frowned i d just know i ll be right back i said suddenly to cameron dontbe late for class he called after me as i dashed out of the great hall tucking the letters into my pocket i stopped gasping as soon as i reached a secluded alcove off the hall behind me i could hear the heavy oak doors swing shut sarah had said i d know and i was pretty sure i did know maybe i d known ever since alicia had told me that jess and sarah were shagging oh merlin i muttered slumping against the wall you okay sarah asked and i jerked my head up oh um i stopped sarah i i a i dropped my voice to a whisper a lesbian she put a hand on my shoulder it sucks when you first figure it out she said earnestly but it gets better i promise i nodded slowly er sarah yeah how d you know about me she hesitated then sat down on the floor and gestured for me to join her i sat gingerly lydia i just knew it happens like that sometimes but how i asked i was halfway between intrigued and completely petrified if sarah could guess could other people she laughed lydia you were always staring at jess and me and besides you never seem interested in any of the boys even though cameron and john both seemed interested in you how did you know i wasntinterested had sarah been watching me you were too busy watching that gryffindor chick wood i thought it was kind of cute myself i flushed i did not stare at lyra or if i did it was only because we were friends but sarah just chuckled and ruffled my hair buck up lydia life ll get better are there more of us i asked slowly sure she answered couple girls out among the huffelumps and a gryffindork or two and some ravenclaws there only one other slyth girl out though other than me rachel fletwock she a year ahead of you yeah i replied i know rachel i hadntknown she was gay though rachel was feminine really feminine but she so girly sarah frowned you know lydia you can be lesbian and feminine if that how you are i know that i grumbled even though i hadn t really i d thought you had to be kind of i didntknow jock like or something sure you did she told me standing up and offering me a hand just remember it okay you can be whatever you want dontlet other people label you okay i promised letting her pull me to my feet i won t oooooo i didnttell anyone else about being a lesbian alicia would freak out and i didnt want to tell any of the boys and lyra i was always two seconds away from telling her but i never knew how to start the conversation i wasntentirely sure how she d react her parents were both gay i knew but she was also christian and sarah said that christians were anti gay but keeping it secret was making me feel like i was going to explode finally two weeks into november a solution presented itself it has recently come to my attention professor trent announced impressively that the lot of you seem to be suffering from the idea that ignorance is a good excuse for ridicule which i happen to think is an idea deserving of ridicule so i ve pulled some strings and talked to some people she snapped her fingers and pieces of parchment flew through the air as one landed on my desk i realized that they were envelopes mine said lydia carmichael in messy black ink these professor trent continued are letters from students at a school called spencer academy in the united states of america each of you will begin a penfriend correspondence with the student who wrote your letter i expect that you will write long letters and that you will be faithful correspondents your grades will reflect your effort believe me i will know you may leave class early today if you finish your response she paused for effect then smiled well go ahead and open them i carefully opened my envelope and took out the letter it looked long dear lydia hey it your pen pal arentyou glad i not sure what to write about actually but my teacher just put a list up and first i supposed to tell you a little about yourself your family your friends so here goes i fourteen with red hair and glasses and freckles my eyes are blue green i very loud i have opinions on absolutely everything my favorite food is dark chocolate also pepperoni pizza with onions and peppers i cantstand lettuce or broccoli my family really small just me my parents and my little sister she really annoying want to adopt her i d tell you about my friends but there are a lot of them plus all my enemies so i ll tell you about them later right next we re supposed to tell you a little about life in an american wizarding school i not kidding about the exclamation point either i dontknow what you want to know normally we go to a muggle school or we re homeschooled until like 12 13 that seventh grade or else 14 15 which is ninth grade that when wizarding school starts there are a bunch over here i dont know what it like in europe but in america there are ten or something let see if i can name them 1 salem girls 2 pembrose boys 3 jefferson 4 hecate 5 spencer 6 and i forget the rest they arentas good as mine anyway i go to spencer which is way up north in new hampshire where it all deserted the muggles think we re a correctional facility for dangerous young criminals or something so they stay away that gives us the space we need for our incredibly awesome quodpot team we go to nationals almost every year i going to be on the team next year maybe hopefully now i supposed to tell you about america in general but you re probably bored with all this so i ll screw the list i woke up very very late this morning like at ten thirty and had to hurry ridiculously to get to my class where mr cohen was all why are you late meghan which only teachers ever call me i usually just meg and i was like i didntmean to sleep late and he glared at me and told me to give him a perfect cheering charm which wasntfair because we ve only just learned them but i did it anyway and he got all happy and i didntget a late if you get four lates it the same as one missed class and four missed classes means you have to be in your dorm early for a whole week and there a trip to the franklin commons in massachusetts just outside of boston although i realize you dont have any idea where that is which i really really really want to go on it a big deal we fly in over a huge faux cloud cover and everything and if he d marked me late that would have been three missed classes and four lates and i would have had to stay here and it would have been horrible so what are you like what do you do for fun what your school like i have to go now class is just about over and i have to meet my cousin because we re going to look up flower meanings so she can find something for her girlfriend for their anniversary which is tomorrow write back soon meg o hare i read over the letter a few more times meg sounded nice if a little bit scatterbrained and boisterous and maybe she was someone i could talk to i d never have to meet her so it wouldntmatter if she had problems with me or i told her things i couldnttell anyone else and when she had talked about her girlfriend did that mean her cousin was gay too i fumbled around in my bag for a clean sheet of parchment and a quill then sat motionless for a while as i tried to think of what to write dear meg i finally started i dontknow what to write about either i thirteen with black hair that sometimes curls and dark eyes my hair is long and it usually gets in my face when i try to write essays the only foods i dontlike are tomatoes and coffee flavoured ice cream you ve a bigger family than mine it just my parents and me except that my parents disowned me when i was sorted into slytherin and havent talked to me since so i guess really it just me slytherin is one of the four houses at hogwarts the others are hufflepuff gryffindor and ravenclaw the huffelumps are uselessly diligent brown nosers the gryffindorks arrogant gits and the ravenclowns impractical slytherin the best although we ve more than our share of death eater children we re not evil though we just have screwy families mostly i have my friends my best friends are a girl named lyra and two boys evan and cameron and i really close to cameron girlfriend actually she might be his ex girlfriend currently i not sure marissa and i have a godfather his name is harry hogwarts starts for us the september we re eleven so one of the girls in my year is almost a full year older than me her birthday is september 2 2000 and i august 31 2001 and there are seven years of classes hogwarts is the only wizarding school in britain i think but there are more on the continent we play quidditch and by we i mean other crazy students because i dontreally like flying although it just inter house matches what quodpot flower meanings that romantic i paused chewing on the end of my quill wondering whether i really wanted to confess what i was about to write is your school nice about girls dating each other i just figured out i gay and sarah this girl in my house she a seventh year doesnt really seem to think i should tell anyone and there arentany girls together anymore sarah was dating this other girl jess but they broke up and anyway only our house knew so i dontknow but my roommates wontlike it so i just going to keep it quiet for now you wonttell anyone lydia carmichael oooooo true to what i d written to meg o hare i stayed resolutely in the closet but as the weeks passed and october turned into november and november moved towards december staying silent started to get much more difficult i wasntused to keeping secrets from my closest friends and anyway being a lesbian meant there was a lot i wanted to talk about sarah was always around and never refused to answer questions and meg always read my letters and wrote back but it wasntthe same as talking to lyra or evan or cameron besides which coming out to myself had brought on a lot of what sarah called gay angst it was just one more thing that made me different and unnatural to the rest of the world and it bothered me i didntwant to be different being different was hard and for the first time i was different alone the only gay people i knew were sarah jess and rachel fletwock but i wasntclose to rachel at all and jess had graduated sarah said there was one lesbian per every ten women but apparently that didnthold true for hogwarts especially for my year i was lonely and i felt lost and isolated and i couldnt help withdrawing from my friends people noticed of course professor snape asked me during a few of our study sessions if there was anything i needed his help with cameron and marissa sandwiched me in the corridor and refused to leave me alone for an hour while they tried to cheer me up evan dragged me off on a long cold walk around the lake where he promised that he wasntgoing to pry but reminded me that talking helped so did chocolate and that life was horrible sometimes but usually got better lyra who d been worried then angry that i was keeping secrets finally decided that i was angry with her for dating hornby the closest i could get to explaining the truth was it not about that there just stuff going on she didntbelieve me i wasnt sure i believed me i d taken to fantasizing about hexing hornby when i practiced curses with zach and our friendship was starting to feel decidedly cooler one friday at the end of class we d argued about whether registering and controlling werewolves counted as good because it protected normal people or bad because it infringed on the werewolves rights to freedom and happiness professor trent stopped me as i was walking out the door miss carmichael she said quietly what are you doing on sunday er nothing i replied why did i do something i was hoping you d join me for tea she told me around four uh sure i stammered i d never been invited to tea with a teacher before even professor snape kept my visits strictly work related that sounds fun good she said i ll see you then any kind of biscuits or cake you especially like i told her that i liked lemon squares and she laughed and told me to get to my next class and that if i d come on sunday she d have as many lemon squares as i could eat oooooooooo a n so as always i dontown jkr does t m hatter ambika san and ill ame all went over this for me so they deserve my everlasting thanks because this chapter was rough oh who else was excited that jkr actually gave us a canon gay character i so happy with her that i not even irritated about finding out that hannah abbott longbottom is going to wind up taking over the leaky cauldron sometime in the remote future and then i thought wow the chapter sitting on my hard drive is strangely appropriate maybe i should post it so here you are anyway as always if you review i will love you forever and give you cookies seriously constructive crit would make my life better and so if there anything you think i screwed up or didn t please tell me it makes me a better writer chapter thirty five draught of the living death at four o clock precisely i stood before the door to professor trent office it swung open when i raised my fist to knock and i stepped cautiously inside zach and sarah both insisted you could find out everything you needed to know about a person just by their rooms and i believed it professor snape after all was exactly like his rooms cool unemotional organized with kind of an oddly clinical smell and alicia fit perfectly with her belongings she was sparkly and soft and feminine with just the slightest unfriendly edge professor trent study was well lit and cozy with shelves lining the walls they were filled with all manner of books and some even had flowers growing in small pots there was a desk against one wall a rolltop cherry desk it looked expensive and a smoky gray cat was dozing on the chair it looked like a cheerful classy sort of room a door led from her study into the rest of her apartment and i walked through hesitantly the next room looked like a sort of sitting room with a two seater couch and three armchairs the table between them was set for tea and professor trent entered the room from a far door as i crossed the threshold ah miss carmichael good afternoon she said with a smile do sit down lyra supposed to be joining us but she usually late how has your weekend been er fine i answered still looking around me there were portraits on the walls many of lyra or lyra and two men i took those to be her fathers others were of people who looked a lot like lyra except about the mouth and in a sunny corner there stood a large fanged geranium i examined it with some interest it was a very strong orange color something i d never seen before it beautiful isntit professor trent asked quietly i ve never seen one like it i told her truthfully the color quite rare they re incredibly difficult to breed you d have to ask professor sprout for details and so they re very valuable you ve heard of the muggle wars of the roses hasnteveryone she laughed a little not everyone has mr rookwood for a friend anyway the war was started by two wizarding neighbors fighting over one of these it funny isntit to think of an entire bloody civil war being fought over a potted plant funny i couldnt think of anything funny about it it just seemed sort of pathetic she means ironic funny not silly funny lyra explained i jumped i hadnt heard her come in is the tea hot are those lemon squares hey lydia hi sis she added belatedly bouncing into an armchair as professor trent sat opposite us on the couch it was odd to hear her referred to as sis she was so clearly a teacher to me that it just didntfit it would be like hearing someone refer to professor snape as gramps or uncle sevvie someone like isabel travers could be called sis she helped alicia with makeup and hair and robes and she d sit with us in the common room sometimes gossiping and teasing but i had a hard time imagining professor trent doing any of those things hello lyra professor trent replied as she handed around steaming cups of tea were you outside your hair is dripping oh yeah we had quidditch practice and it snowing out there bloody long too because art apparently doesntunderstand that he supposed to catch the quaffle not watch it go by with a dazed expression i cantwait until bethany gets out of the hospital wing personally i hoped it took bethany until new year to recover maybe a little longer slytherin was set to play gryffindor just before christmas holidays and a defunct keeper would up our chances considerably what wrong with her i asked dragon pox lyra said sounding miserable they re saying it could take weeks for her to recover i thought only little kids got that i said puzzled isntshe a sixth year seventh lyra corrected dismally whatever why she got dragon pox usually only children catch it professor trent explained smoothly but in some cases they don t and then they re susceptible to it later in life when it much more serious she not going to die or anything right lyra asked sounding worried for the first time i mean pomfrey will be able to heal her i sure she ll be fine professor trent reassured her it ll just take time after a moment silence she changed the subject how are you liking my class do you think there anything else we should be covering i like it i told her it was the truth i thought professor trent class was one of my most interesting are we going to spend more time on werewolves lyra asked i thought that was really cool uh no i thought we d move straight on to vampires professor trent answered it rather more interesting as the vampires actually have their own government and laws to the ministry chagrin but no one actually knows any vampires lyra protested people know werewolves or at least they know people who know people who which professor trent cut in smoothly is an excellent reason not to delve too far into it we dontwant to make anyone aunt into a case study but doesntthat make it more relevant i asked slowly i mean there are all sorts of laws about werewolves and working with children and just getting jobs in particular and it actually kind of affects us a little if we know one doesntit shouldntwe at least be more aware dontyou think they d prefer not to be the center of a debate in someone else classroom they arentgoing to know lyra protested and anyway everyone who d be offended is bound to have heard it all before haventthey and besides i added just because it never been debated like formally that doesntmean no one talked about it i mean one of the girls in slytherin last year was half werewolf and it not like people were nice about it if the the underlying prejudice the phrase was evan s and i hoped i was using it correctly is there then it doesntreally matter if it doesntget talked about inside a classroom or out of it half werewolf lyra repeated really i nodded remembering heather but thinking more about my cousin some of the purebloods didntlike her they wouldnthave much liked teddy either i thought how d they know she pressed did she tell everyone i shrugged i dont know actually she graduated last year so i dontreally know if she told everyone right away or someone found out can you tell lyra asked turning to her sister if someone half werewolf can you tell i not sure professor trent replied frowning possibly they recognized her last name or there might have been signs there a registry at the ministry and someone could have double checked for her father female werewolves canthave children can people do that i asked aghast and more than a little worried for teddy just go in and look at records like that not technically she said but anyone with the right friends or enough money can get to them especially with werewolves it generally recognized to be a matter of safety that a community be able to check for werewolves if someone had a parent check the records it entirely possible that not fair lyra protested if they arentdangerous that only if they take the wolfsbane i pointed out without it a werewolf would be deadly and he has to take it every day during the full moon if he even forgot once then the consequences could be catastrophic that particular phrase was professor snape s he d talked or perhaps lectured a bit about why the wolfsbane could only be a temporary solution during one of my tutoring sessions and i had to admit i agreed but that didntmean i liked the idea of people being able to find out about half werewolves just from ministry records lyra frowned and reached for a lemon square but why does everyone have to know even if he is dangerous how does that change if we know about it i just dontunderstand why it should be public knowledge what if a werewolf moved in next door to you professor trent asked quietly and remember that not all werewolves take the wolfsbane regularly why not she interrupted and i noticed that lyra was frowning a little well i wouldntwant a werewolf to live next door either it expensive for one professor trent explained slowly and some werewolves actually like transforming every month besides the wolfsbane has some side effects which are slightly less than desirable but people shouldnt have stuff about them available to the public i protested what about their kids and making a list of them isntfair anyway lyra cried what if someone who was i dontknow really anti werewolf got a hold of it and tried to hunt them all down or if they couldntget jobs since we agree professor trent cut in with a smile maybe we should change the subject i reached for a lemon square grinning although i didntthink we actually agreed exactly lyra didntwant werewolves registered at all i was just worried about teddy lyra crossed her eyes at professor trent can we talk about boys then all boys or one in particular matt lyra clarified i reached for another lemon square and then took a brownie as well if lyra was going to talk about her boyfriend i needed chocolate he made my stomach knot up weirdly what about him professor trent asked he being stupid lyra said irritably are all boys like that generally yes professor trent replied laughing he ll grow up what he done this time i dontknow lyra said he hasnt done anything exactly but he being irritating and keeps flirting with other girls and i dont know it bothers me you should dump him i suggested maybe a little too cheerfully because lyra shot me a disgruntled look lydia what i asked trying to look innocent as i handed her a lemon square i dont think he s well good enough for you people say that about you she snapped and i recoiled the brownie in my mouth suddenly tasted like ash lyra anger vanished almost as soon as it came oh lydia i sorry i didntmean it like that she said looking anxious and apologetic it just that i a slytherin i finished for her yeah whatever i late for chess club i said abruptly standing up thanks for the tea professor lydia wait lyra said jumping to her feet do you want to take something back with you professor trent asked me lemon square brownie no thank you i said absurdly grateful to her for acting like there was nothing wrong i walked as quickly as i could out of her apartments lyra dashed after me to the door lydia she cried as i left you re not even in the chess club she was right i wasn t but i couldnthandle staying in that room another minute oooooo two weeks before christmas break professor rufford posted a sheet in the great hall for those of us staying behind and i was one of the first to sign up cameron grinning signed his name with a flourish below mine and then reached an arm out and grabbed evan as he walked by evan evan old fellow old chap old friend what do you want cameron he asked but he was smiling a little make it fast though i supposed to meet letta in the greenhouse ooh really he asked sidetracked are you and miss williamson snogging is she your girlfriend shut it cameron evan said blushing a little his smile had turned goofy we re not dating yet i said but you two are together every night you two come to study group together and leave together you re the only slytherin i know who ever gotten near the puff common room it just a matter of time yeah maybe evan said if you know she ever forgets that my parents killed her parents and even if she forgets do you honestly think aunt sally and uncle will are going to let her i exchanged looks with cameron if evan knew the names of the people loretta lived with then things were worse than they looked what d you want cam anyway evan asked oh er christmas break stay please um evan said i think robin going off to the states so you can stay well i was thinking about asking if she d take me actually evan answered awkwardly oh i said i was disappointed cameron and i got along better with evan around especially when marissa joined us otherwise i tended to feel like a third wheel and they were starting to ask if maybe i didntwant a boyfriend too i could never figure out how to answer that there wasnta good way of saying i not into boys without outing myself look evan said i ll owl her and ask okay and then if i cantgo with her i ll stay and make sure you all get your work done thanks cameron said rolling his eyes i touched at how much you care by evan corrected immediately what you re touched by how much i care not at how much i care that what i said cameron protested no it not you said at i ll see you two later i said backing away enjoy your grammar argument neither noticed as i headed towards the door which i thought was a little pathetic wasnti more interesting than prepositions lydia someone said as i walked out of the great hall grabbing my elbow i reached immediately for my wand no lydia it just me oh teddy hi oh hi that all you can think of we haventtalked in ages you ve been avoiding me haventyou er no of course not i said quickly but i didntthink he believed me his hair was slowly going bright red like it used to when someone had broken a promise look teddy i haventbeen avoiding you we re in different years different houses we just dontsee each other that all you manage to see lyra wood all the time he snapped and your friend rookwood manages to see that hufflepuff girl every night you should bloody well be able to see your cousin teddy and what were you doing signing up to stay here over holidays i gulped had teddy been watching me as i signed up i wanted to stay with my friends that all i didntwant cameron to be lonely did you stay with your friends over the summer too he asked arms folded over his chest uh because you werent at your house anytime i showed up for dinner or lunch or tea or to borrow a book i was visiting friends i protested it not a crime you know no but it a little convenient isntit christmas break and you re conveniently seeing friends summer break you re conveniently visiting friends every time i stop by why it almost like you arentstaying at home isntit teddy was going to make an excellent lawyer someday i thought well it all just coincidence where would i be if not at home or hogwarts i dontknow he admitted but it isntlike ditching kids is new in our extended family is it i mean look at grandmother still coincidence i said firmly and i ve got to go teddy i have a runes translation to finish lydia he started but i shook my head seriously teddy dont worry about it okay i staying for christmas because i want to what about staying with harry he suggested i was going to spend new year with them anyway i thought about it it seemed like the perfect solution a real christmas a real family until i had to explain to harry why i wasntat home like a normal person then everything would come out my house my parents and anyway i d just explained to teddy that i wanted to spend time with my friends i shook my head no thanks teddy i cantleave cameron alone he frowned well if you re sure i sure teddy i keeping an eye on you though he warned so if anything happens i want you to tell me about it before i figure it out okay okay teddy i ll tell you if anything goes wrong you promise i promise i said and we touched wands i watched him head down the hall with a sinking feeling in my gut teddy was suspicious lyra was anxious if they compared notes or talked to harry i could be in a lot of trouble very soon oooooo two days before term officially ended i met professor snape for extra potions work he d promised to let me try brewing the draught of living death which normally only sixth years got to do and i was positively brimming with excitement it would be the most difficult potion i d ever brewed before and i d taken the time to read everything i could find on how to brew it not that i thought that would make much of a difference i was coming to find that generally professor snape knew a lot more than anyone else and i wondered why he hadntbothered to write a book i wished i dared to ask him but professor snape just wasntthe kind of man you asked questions of ah miss carmichael come in he said opening the door just seconds after i knocked are you staying over break of course i told him it much more interesting than anywhere else isntit and the house elves dontcare how late i sleep he nearly laughed at that or at least i thought he did his face looked about as near to laughing as it ever did excellent reasons miss carmichael have you looked over the ingredients and instructions for the draught of living death yes sir i answered taking out my copy of advanced potion making i read what i could find in the issues of potions quarterly you leant me too and some of the other books very thorough of you he remarked why dontyou start i ll look on and make suggestions i finished silently for him that was how things normally went i laid the ingredients out on the table valerian roots sopophorous beans asphodel infusion of wormwood lacewing flies unicorn hair three strands dried newt eyes wild lettuce it was an incredibly complex potion with nearly thirty separate ingredients to be added in specific quantities at the exact right times i started preparations quietly sometimes i hummed to myself but that seemed out of place in snape apartments chopping the valerian root into exact pieces grinding up the newt eyes and squeezing the juice from the sopophrous beans i d started by simply cutting them up but a slight movement from professor snape told me there had to be a better way i thought about it for a moment sopophorous beans were probably in the same family as the sopophorous vines which were a nuisance everywhere they d climb up over walls and porches but for some reason they had an averse reaction to most metals and would leak juice all over a screen door if you werentcareful i pulled a silver knife from a drawer and hesitantly crushed one of the beans juice gushed out of the bean much more juice in fact than i d been getting by cutting them excellent deduction miss carmichael professor snape said over my shoulder as i collected six tablespoons worth of sopophorous bean juice and added it to the simmering cauldron with the valerian roots and dried newt eyes the potion was starting to turn from black into a deep purple as i added the unicorn hairs and sprinkled in the lacewing flies the final ingredients the book said to stir counter clockwise but i d been experimenting on stirring with other potions and i decided to add a clockwise stir in i started with one every five that being a safe bet usually but it didnt feel quite right so i upped it to one every six and then one every seven that felt right i shifted to avoid the blue steam rising up from the cauldron it was a little acidic and burned a little when i inhaled it i impressed professor snape said after the potion had finally gotten so clear i could see the bottom of my cauldron excellent first try thanks i said feeling satisfied the potion was still steaming but the steam wasntblue anymore and it had stopped burning my throat i yawned step back miss carmichael professor snape said suddenly i think your results are a little more potent than we d expected i d prefer not to have you collapse on my floor er right professor i said jumping backwards should we do we test it on someone are you volunteering miss carmichael i looked at my steaming cauldron thoughtfully if you ve got the antidote then sure i paused er professor snape the book said the antidote a potion but if you re asleep it meant to be heated first professor snape explained the steam will revive someone who been given the draught of living death if administered within the first three days i nodded okay then i ll try the potion professor snape waved his wand and conjured a goblet and a green armchair oddly reminiscent of the ones in the slytherin common room i would sit down miss carmichael he added as i ladled some of the clear potion into the goblet you dontwant to fall asleep on the floor yes sir i said sitting gingerly on the chair and sniffing at the liquid there was no odor but i was starting to feel sleepy just breathing it in well here goes i said gulping down the potion almost immediately i started to feel warm comfortably warm instinctively i curled a little into the chair yawning my eyelids felt like lead i couldntkeep them open any longer wake up miss carmichael professor snape was saying i jolted awake he was holding a steaming goblet in front of me drink this and then you should get to the kitchens and ask for something to eat if anyone stops you tell them you have my permission thanks professor i said taking the goblet with both hands and downing the antidote i placed the empty glass on the table and stood slowly carefully making my way to the door i still felt groggy but no worse than i normally did after waking up suddenly in the middle of the night and lydia i turned at the door yes sir that was quite impressive he said we ll have to talk about class work next term i dontthink it particularly worthwhile for you to continue with the third year curriculum i couldntkeep the grin off my face as i walked down to the kitchens especially once i realized that professor snape had actually called me lydia instead of miss carmichael oooooooo a n as always it jkr sandbox i just playing t m hatter went over this for me and thus deserves millions of thanks and lots of love and uh i apologize profusely for the time this one took there was writer block and then the rest of my betas had school and exams i try not to post anything without two people looking it over and then i had exams so this went on the back burner but this chapter is nearly 4 000 words so merry early christmas and i very sorry i also going to add at this point that i do want to keep everything canon i love canon other than the snape death thing it not actually canon that he died i swear that said i dontget to hear all the interviews so if you catch anything i ve screwed up and want to let me know that d make my life the same goes for anything else i screw up please please tell me what i did wrong otherwise it ll never get better chapter thirty seven felix felicis since cameron and marissa were the only friends we had staying over holidays pernella and i had ample time to meet secretly the corridors were usually deserted and no one was using any of the classrooms so we had plenty of places for furtive rendezvous including one in the astronomy tower where we were interrupted by two seventh years and had to hide behind a large statue of an enormously fat man with a large mustache cameron and marissa were so preoccupied with their own romance that they didntnotice the amount of time pernella and i were spending alone pernella said we were lucky if one of us had been a boy everyone would have assumed we were dating immediately but since we were both girls she said people would just think we d gotten tired of playing third and fourth wheel to cameron and marissa i guessed that we were lucky because it made pretending easier but it made me mad as well who said that two girls had to be just friends while a boy and a girl had to be dating where was that written i wanted to talk to sarah about all of this the secrecy the lies that werentreally lies so much as they were keeping things quiet i thought that of all people she might know what i was supposed to do but even i knew that asking sarah for advice would mean breaking the promise i d made to pernella not to talk about us and for that matter i wasntexactly sure what us entailed i was starting to think of pernella as my girlfriend but we hadntactually talked about being girlfriends or even about going on an actual date we were just snogging in dark corners and making up excuses for where we d been and since i d only told meg it didntseem real somehow meg had written back promptly but her only advice had been talk to her about it and pernella didntseem inclined to talk about it or us snape was still gone he d be gone for the rest of the holidays but i had access to his lab and when i needed time to think i went there i was trying to make the felix felicis potion but it felt like an uphill struggle felix felicis was incredibly difficult to brew and could be downright catastrophic to mess up and i was too preoccupied with pernella to give the potion the attention it deserved madam pomfrey luckily had several quick remedies for third degree burns and i was able to repair most of the shattered glass in the lab thankfully none of the full jars had broken i thought about giving up but the lure of a full cauldron of felix felicis was hard to ignore properly brewed the potion practically guaranteed unlimited success if you drank it of course it was banned in most organized competitions but they didntalways test for it and it was a good thing to have around just in case the felix felicis would be my christmas present to myself if i could get it right oooooooo by christmas eve morning i was fairly certain that i d successfully finished phase one of the felix felicis the powdered unicorn horn had turned it into a light lavender i had added a little less than the recipe called for remembering professor snape thoughts on overusing unicorn horn and i d set it by an open window to sit under the waning moon from moonrise to moonset the clock had just stopped ringing the hour eleven o clock when i shut the window and stirred the potion carefully sniffing at it delicately it gave off a decidedly minty smell okay i told it i guess we re good to go what next the dried clover i double checked the book just to make sure i was right and then added in two generous pinches of clover the green swirled together with the lavender slowly turning a light amber color the smell was delicious let sit stirring slowly in a clockwise direction add three tablespoons crushed ladybug wings little by little pausing between additions the book read i followed the instructions carefully although i did add a counter clockwise stir every seven turns the potion was lightening turning slowly from amber to gold and tiny droplets were beginning to jump out of the cauldron to glitter in the air before falling gracefully back in they looked like dolphins or merpeople i thought the felix felicis was supposed to sit for twenty minutes for full potency so when the color change was complete i stopped stirring floated the cauldron off the fire and sat down to wait i couldnthelp thinking of all the ways i could use the potion maybe if i took it pernella would actually answer me about whether we were dating or not or maybe if i drank some next time i talked to teddy he d stop wondering why i wasntat home more often maybe lyra would even break up with hornby when the potion was finished i bottled a little of it up into a crystal vial the rest i decided to let sit no one but professor snape would see it and he would know what it was besides i wanted him to see what i d done most newt level students couldntmake the felix felicis and i was only thirteen i brought the vial back to my dorm and placed it on my nightstand even bottled up it looked beautiful the crystal caught the light and the gold shimmered and glittered and looked well lucky oooooooo none of the ravenclowns were at dinner that night the head girl who was a claw had managed to get permission to take anyone staying to diagon alley for the day so i actually had cameron full attention where ve you been anyway he asked around a mouthful of stuffing not that i dontappreciate it but what ve you and pernella been up to about the same things you and marissa have been doing i thought but of course i couldntsay that keeping away from you two i told him you think we want a visual lesson on what happens when a boy and a girl lust after each other very much he grinned sheepishly sorry i just didntrealize you two were that good of friends that all well she good to talk to i said finally even though we didntreally talk and i ve been working at brewing stuff too i just finished the felix felicis today seriously cameron nearly spit out his pumpkin juice you managed it uh huh i replied evenly as if it were no big deal that brilliant he cried i mean do you have any idea what that stuff does can i buy some could you give it to me for christmas what are you going to use it for his questions were coming at me too fast to actually answer them so i waited until he d calmed down enough to take another forkful of turkey you canthave any cameron i said flatly i saving it for when i really need it cameron harrumphed arentwe friends lydia dontyou consider me among your trusted circle of you arentgetting any cameron i repeated good girl said the hufflepuff next to me sixth year prefect dontlet him pressure you into doing anything you dontwant to do your body is yours to control cameron collapsed into giggles and i let my head fall to the table too embarrassed to even correct her besides what could i say he isntmy type i dating his girlfriend best friend let go i whispered to cameron i could feel my face slowly returning to a normal non red color he nodded vigorously and stood to offer me a hand remember the puff said brightly as we left wait until you re ready i groaned under my breath do they sort for that cameron for what he asked ridiculous attitudes towards what normal healthy men and women do together or the inability to tell when two people arentdating the second one i guess i replied quietly i was still thinking about the first part of what he d said what normal healthy men and women do together i didntever want to do that with a boy whatever it entailed i wasntexactly clear on the details did that mean cameron would think i wasntnormal or healthy you okay he asked after a while yeah why you sounded off or something he told me slowly did what she said bother you that much oh no i said flashing him a quick grin nothing like that maybe the sorting hat had been right two years ago when it had bypassed gryffindor because i couldntquite get up the courage to explain to cameron why i was upset why his comment had upset me okay he replied but he sounded a little doubtful do you think evan having fun in the states probably i said i mean his cousin seems pretty lenient about things doesntshe and if meg telling the truth then there no way for them to tell if he does magic as long as he smart about it i dontthink that fair cameron complained we cantdo magic outside of school gryffindor was a thief i said to the common room door i agree with you cam i said as the door swung open i wish we could do magic too see you at ten he asked i ve got to go wrap presents i ve been putting it off for ages i hate wrapping things you know there are spells for that cameron nodded sheepishly i cantget the paper to stay smooth maybe you just need to practice i suggested my grandmother really good at it but she had loads of time to get it right or maybe it a girl thing he suggested cameron i lobbed a leg locker curse at his retreating back dontbe a moron sorry he called up the stairs i considered going after him but girls going down the wrong staircase was strictly forbidden and i didntwant to wind up blasted back into the common room instead i made my way through the tapestry covered door and into the slytherin library lura book was open when i got there but the room seemed empty hi i wrote lydia good evening appeared almost immediately where my words had been what can i find for you i m i hesitated for a moment then scratched it out when you said you could find me books on lesbians and stuff would you like a list her words swirled away while i looked around again to make sure no one was watching please i wrote finally just the stories though i paused half a moment then added not ones where they die in the end just a moment she wrote her words lingered on the page then disappeared after a few seconds titles and authors began to appear there were hundreds of them it seemed like far more than i d ever thought were possible who d written them all there couldntbe that many gay girls could they did other people write them but why would a straight person write about lesbians the words stopped coming for a moment as i looked over the three pages of titles which would you like me to get for you lura asked or would you prefer to browse i stared at the list of titles how could i be expected to know what was best could you pick some for me how many would you like five five would be enough to read before everyone else came back to school of course books began flying off the shelves and i had to duck to avoid being hit by a large leather bound tome when five books had stacked themselves neatly on the podium lura wrote again you ve got them for two weeks miss carmichael thank you i wrote back and i waited until my words disappeared to shut the book i examined the covers of the books lura had selected as i walked back to my room the one on top am i blue had a pink and blue cover and looked to be a dusty collection of short stories but it was the book on the bottom that really caught my eye a large leather bound book with creamy pages covered in tiny cursive the front page said it was the personal journal of a girl named olivia stuart who was born in 1923 and had started hogwarts in 1934 and the journal four years later it also had a little gold sticker to indicate it was unedited usually journals were edited to reshape events in the writer favor or to protect the guilty i kept stealing glances at it as i changed into my pajamas and wrapped myself in my dressing gown i desperately wanted to start reading it was olivia gay too had her roommates minded but i d promised cameron i d meet him in the common room at ten for cookies the journal would have to wait by the time i got down to the common room everyone had already grabbed a mug of hot chocolate and a couple cookies i sank into the armchair next to cameron and grinned at eleanor carrow and alexis newbury who were the only other two slytherins staying over alexis was a sixth year prefect and eleanor was our keeper and quidditch captain where ve you been cameron asked you re late by six minutes i protested taking a chocolate chip cookie from the plate who brought the food anyway i did eleanor said that part of my job as the oldest get cookies when snape not around yeah where is he alexis asked he always here for christmas eleanor shrugged he been gone all break he had an unavoidable commitment he said i explained he wontbe back until the start of term alexis shot me an odd look teacher pet much i shrugged awkwardly but eleanor tossed a napkin at her leave her alone alexis it not lydia fault you barely managed an a in your potions o w l that not the point alexis grumbled but she fell silent eleanor wasnta girl you wanted to cross she ruled our winning quidditch team and our team ruled the house besides she continued snape doesntpick favorites not like slughorn did you remember the slug club alexis alexis grinned sheepishly i guess you re right merlin that was fucked up you re just jealous because you werentinvited eleanor laughed cameron and i watched this exchange with puzzled expressions who was slughorn and why had there been a club named for him oh right alexis said noticing cameron and i blinking at them sorry i forgot you two just missed him slugs was how can i explain it eleanor he was kind of a snob eleanor began swirling her cocoa thoughtfully but he was also nice you dontget that with snape so much slugs would talk to you he wanted to know how things were i mean not that snape doesnt because he does but it different slughorn talked to you alexis agreed he wasntso cold and he knew everyone not just like you but your family and what you were good at so what was the slug club i asked did he head a potions club or something alexis burst out laughing and even eleanor couldntstop giggling no it was more like a popularity contest if you had the right grades or parents or talent he d invite you to these parties in his apartments i guess the idea was that then you d remember him when you were rich and famous i mean slugs knew everyone important seriously alexis put in everyone he knew all of the order of the phoenix and the owner of weasleys wizard wheezes rose zeller seriously everyone rose zeller cameron repeated the rose zeller the lead singer of twisted coven that rose zeller how many rose zellers do you know alexis snapped of course the rose zeller she even got him tickets to that concert in edinburgh the one where that guy almost got trampled to death we were all silent for a moment after this basking in the glory of twisted coven and rose zeller in particular until eleanor finally summoned her stereo we finished the last of the cookies and hot chocolate singing along to all of their death on a broomstick album and i went to my room that night still humming the chorus of more than just my house which house she was singing about was the subject of much discussion we claimed her for our own because slytherins were so marginalized but the puffs thought rose zeller was theirs this was obviously nonsense though because twisted coven was cool and hufflepuffs were not i was exhausted but olivia stuart journal was too tempting to leave for tomorrow and i wanted to know all about her how did she realize she was gay had she had a girlfriend i took the journal to my bed and snuggled into the covers to read olivia first entry had been on september the first right after the sorting and feast there was a list of the things she d forgotten at home socks toothpaste third best quill and back copies of witch weekly and her schedule which included muggle studies apparently a new elective only a term long and care of magical creatures olivia handwriting was cramped and hard to read and her spelling was atrocious furthermore most of her first entries dealt with the tiny details of her life books to check out homework assignments to do lists i was beginning to wonder why lura had recommended the book to me when i finally flipped the page to a longer entry from january i haventbeen very good at keeping a diary have i it began my new year resalution is to try harder and write every day or at least every weak the problem is that nothing interesting happens though molly is supposed to go to hogsmeed with ed but none of the boys have noticed me this year eether at least she might not be able to go because sluggy caught her teasing one of the second years about being a muggle born and he put her in detention all this weakend for it molly says the boy kept saying he was really a slytherin like that he was related to salazar and she was just trying to teech him proper respect for being related to the founders since she related to one to but sluggy didntbelieve her oh yesterday will a asked jean to go on a walk around the lake with him after the quittich game and she said no i dontunderstand her he and his brothers are the most handsum boys in our whole school or at least the two older ones are pete is still only twelve and i would give all the gold in the world for will to ask me for a walk he even smells good sort of outdoorsy and kind of expensive and i think he the most amazing boy in all of hogwarts it isntfair that he likes jean who doesnteven seem to notice him at all when i right hear i practicully completely in love with him all ready maybe i should wate for him after brekfast and ask if he got the transfiguration notes i didntreally understand what dumbeldor was talking about yesterday anyway or would he think i was stupid then well i ll tell you what happens tomorrow and i forgot to say that the muggles are having a war i was worried that they might get us jean says they have queer wands made of metal that blow people up and also things they drop out of metal flying carriges but will said wizards are protected from that sort of thing that why i in love with him he always knows everything i only remembered to tell you now because there starting a ratuning thing where we can only get a little sugar and butter and meat and stuff and even wizards have to go by it jean says that means fewer cakes because i guess the increased sugar tastes differently than the original anyway i promise to write to you tomorrow and tell you if it true olivia handwriting was so difficult to decipher that i d gotten a headache just from the little i d read so i put the book aside and snuggled deeper into my quilt it didntseem like olivia had many friends she d mentioned molly and jean who i gathered were two of her roommates and ed and will but nothing in her journal so far had talked about late night conversations or midnight raids on the kitchens plus olivia sounded almost stupid or at least trivial and she was certainly not a lesbian she d just spent a whole three quarters of a page going on about a boy what was this journal possibly going to teach me about anything ooooooo a n as usual i dontown anything jkr does t m hatter beta d this for me so she should be showered with praise and chocolate especially because it almost her birthday the next chapter is in the hands of my betas so it will hopefully be out soon and of course reviews make me happy happy spring everyone chapter thirty eight sitting the next morning i slept late it was almost noon by the time i finally dragged myself out of bed to go take a bath i brought olivia journal with me on the off chance that it might have more lesbians now that i was wider awake unfortunately for me olivia had slid immediately back into her habit of not writing anything substantial january and february both had lists of books to check out and homework to do and february had several paragraphs detailing the exact color of will a hair but there was nothing else during march she d apparently misplaced her diary only to find it after easter holidays i skimmed through april but i finally found what i was looking for on may fifteenth yesterday molly stopped me after charms and said she wanted to talk molly allways worries me when she says she wants to talk because she says it in a very sireus way like there is something very important that she needs to say like that hogwarts is going to shut down or will is getting marryed or something but i just said what is it molly like i wasnteven worried or anything and then she said you should shut your sodding mouth about will when you talk to jean and i said why all i saying is that she shoud go for a walk with him or something since he asks her all the time and then molly glared at me and said she doesntwant to go for a bloody walk with him you bloody mooron i dontthink that was very kind of her to say and i told her so all i said to jean was that she should maybe go on a date with will because he obviusly likes her and he is what my mum calls quite a catch but molly said she doesntcare if will is the best catch or the richest boy in school or if the averys are the purest family or anything jean doesntwant to date any stupid boys and i should just shut it and stop bothering everyone i told her she was being unreesonible but i didntknow what else to say other than that i not a mooron and it not fair for her to call me that either just because she and jean get all good marks and all the profesors think there so smart and dumbeldor allways calls on them in class doesntmeen i stupid and molly doesnthave any right to lord it over me eether just because she thinks she better than me my family better than her stupid family anyway what kind of name is lestrange it what she is strange and will a is gorgus anyway and she and jean can be stupid if they want to and not have him but they shouldntcall me a mooron just because there being stupid and childish i couldnthelp grinning at that even if the references to families i knew of the averys the lestranges was kind of chilling i wondered if it was jean who was the lesbian or if molly was too but olivia had mentioned something way back in january about her going to hogsmeade with ed and had she joined the death eaters i couldntremember ever hearing about any good lestranges but then again i only knew about bellatrix and the two whose names began with r s i hoped molly hadntbecome a death eater she seemed from olivia description like a nice person even if she had a mean streak and olivia did complain a lot and she was a moron if she kept insisting that girls should date boys but then she d sounded hurt by molly words i didntthink she had friends and the rest of the page was so smudged that i couldntread it it looked like she had been crying maybe she was just lashing out like lyra did sometimes and whatever she d said she obviously wasn tvery smart but maybe that wasnther fault i hadntknown what lesbians were really until someone had told me and the 1940s were ages ago maybe it wasnther fault for being a stupid boy crazy conformist and assuming everyone else was too i kept thinking about the three girls as i dried off and pulled on my robes on a hunch i went to the shelves by maddison bed and looked around for her wizipedia i d been meaning to get the charm to install it in one of my journals for ages but i kept forgetting she had the newest edition where people didnteven have to register their wands before editing entries maybe it would have something about what had happened to the girls i flopped onto my bed opened it and wrote out molly lestrange with my wand once i tapped the blank page the parchment flashed an hourglass as it searched after a moment the hourglass disappeared and the page began to fill with writing molly peasegood born molly lestrange in october of 1922 met her husband ethan peasegood in june of 41 while on her grand tour wedding following soon after the article skirted around her involvement with the dark lord mentioning only that her younger brother ralph lestrange was one of the first to take the mark and that of her children two were confirmed death eaters apparently molly allegiance was still unknown towards the bottom of the article after a lengthy section on her career working with welsh greens and another on her children there was a small note about her ongoing friendship with school friend jean grimstone i tapped my wand on her name and waited for the hourglass to disappear jean entry was much shorter than molly s mentioning her work on homosexual equality and spending what i thought was an inordinate amount of space on the fact that she was apparently single but in between all that it did mention her work she d gotten a whole list of laws passed they were simply numbered and nothing happened when i tapped them so i wasntsure what they were about whatever homosexual inequality had been the status quo in 1940 i guessed before emigrating first to france and then to canada during the early seventies there was a whole list of books too at the end for more information i wrote them down on a spare bit of parchment and put it on my bedside table it was i thought a good thing that someone had fixed things for gay witches and wizards but why didntpernella realize everything was fixed or had jean just not fixed things for hogwarts students after i put maddison wizipedia back i thought about wading through more of olivia diary but then i decided against it her handwriting was too cramped for me to read too much of it without getting a headache besides i knew cameron had planned on meeting marissa for lunch and i had a sneaking suspicion they were now snogging in the library maybe i would go see if i could hunt up pernella and then we could snog too ooooooo after about an hour of searching i was forced to admit that i had no idea where anyone was the castle was eerily empty and even the library hadntyielded any of my friends although it did have two of the books i remembered being mentioned in the wizipedia entry i was heading back to the dungeons thinking about maybe going back to bed or playing with alicia tarot cards when i saw professor granger she was walking hurriedly down the corridor trailed by two small children the taller of the two was a red headed girl who could either have been ten or six i was never sure about children ages and the smaller one was a boy with darker hair and his thumb in his mouth you said there would be big kids the little girl accused i want to meet the big kids i could almost see professor granger count to ten in her head rosie she said carefully most of the students have gone home you know like your cousin victoire rosie appeared to consider this for a moment as the boy took his thumb out of his mouth and pointed it at me she a big kid he remarked professor granger looked up as i tried to flatten myself against the wall miss carmichael she said regarding me with a piercing gaze barely slowing her pace what on earth are you doing here i thought for sure you and your cousin would both be home teddy coming for new year s uh i said i tried to remember everything harry had ever said about hermione granger which in retrospect wasntmuch sure stories about how she d managed to solve deadly logic puzzles and had gone to a ball with a bulgarian quidditch star were interesting but they didnthelp me now what was going to convince her of my normal home life my friends were staying i offered cameron uh doesntwant to go back to the orphanage and i had a lot of studying i wanted to get done exams are coming up in a few months i added in a flash of inspiration professor granger face cleared and she even smiled of course she said very responsible of you miss carmichael how has your holiday been then fantastic i told her surprisingly it was actually true there d been the felix felicis and now there was pernella and snogging was fun hey said rosie now looking at me with a look that scarily resembled professor granger s are you a real student she was sort of a cute kid kind of in a small child sort of way and there didntseem to be much point in lying so i nodded it was the wrong decision really rosie asked do you live here can you show me your room can you fit all your stuff in your trunk do you have lots and lots of books do you have a real wand can you do lots of spells can you make a swamp what about bluebell fire my mum can make that do you play quidditch my dad played quidditch he was a keeper my uncle did too he was a seeker and my aunt she a chaser my cousin is a gryffindor beater right now do you know my cousin she could speak about five times faster than i d ever heard anyone speak in my life by the time it registered that she wanted to see my room rosie was already off talking about lyra i know lyra i offered to rosie this somehow made me a cousin too because she came over and took my hand do you play quidditch she asked no i said risking a look at professor granger i expected her to say something along the lines of now rosie dontyou think miss carmichael has somewhere she needs to be instead she had slowed down considerably and was watching me with a sort of calculating glint in her eye that i didntlike at all miss carmichael she said slowly are you doing anything this afternoon uh no not really i stammered then would you mind sitting for them a bit rosie likes you already and hugo quite friendly their father was supposed to take them this afternoon but he had an emergency at work and the minister just firecalled and i really need to be there right now but i cantleave them she said this all very quickly i was tempted to refuse but then i didnthave anywhere to be and rosie at least was friendly i might have wondered why professor granger couldntjust bring them but i was fairly sure rosie wouldntbe a good addition to the ministry i ll pay you of course professor granger added it should only be for a few hours and rosie knows how to contact me in case of an emergency it would have been entirely reasonable for me to refuse and i almost did but rosie was looking up at me hopefully and hugo had even come to take rosie other hand besides i wanted to stay on professor granger good side and entirely separately from that i wanted her to like me she was possibly the most amazing woman ever after all she could destroy horcruxes battle death eaters and apparently make bluebell flames whatever those were er sure i said finally we can um tour the castle and see your room rosie asked her eyes shining sure i told her if that what you and your brother want to do thank you miss carmichael this is a godsend professor granger said it shouldntbe more than a few hours she added and then she took off actually running down the hall what going on i asked the kids does your mum usually run off like that uh uh said hugo gravely taking his thumb out of his mouth dad was s posed to watch us this morning he was going to make pancakes yeah rose said only then he got a silver deer and said he had to go right away and mum said she d take us to hogwarts only then after we flooed the minister came into the fireplace and said we need you straightaway hermione i getting the whole order in and then mum said that she had to go right away too so we were going to go to professor professor somebody s only then we saw you oh i said um i lydia by the way and you re rosie and hugo right uh huh said hugo can we see your room now rosie asked i couldntthink of anything better to do so we headed back to the dungeons on the way i learned about professor granger and her husband about how mr weasley made very good pancakes but only on very special occasions about how they had a cat named crookshanks who was very orange and one called socks which rosie had named about how rosie wanted to go to hogwarts and have a dormitory and her very own trunk and a wand and maybe even a broom so she could be on her house team hugo didntsay a word although he moved after a bit to take my other hand he seemed to be a boy of very few words although with a sister like rosie that might be more self preservation than anything else i couldntimagine that he d be able to get more than about five words in edgewise with her prattle once we got to the door rosie tugged on my hand does it open with a password she asked eyes wide the gryffindor door has a password it used to be fortuna major that means better fortune fortune means luck and fate and the ravenclaw door has a talking knocker and it asks you questions and if you answer right you can go in can i say the password i sighed what had i gotten myself into sure rosie i said and whispered it in her ear rosie stood up as tall as she could for someone who had yet to hit the four foot mark and said very gravely if i not mistaken the waters finally swallowed up fisher and boat and with her singing the lorelei did this when the door swung open she squealed hugo grip on my hand tightened a little while rosie dashed ahead careful i told her as she ran toward the boy staircase dontgo down the white staircase girls arentallowed rosie slowed to a stop that not fair she said can anyone stay in the common room though uh huh i told her i thought for a moment about explaining the library or the prefects room or the seventh year room that i was almost sure existed but then thought better of it do you like it yeah she said i took a seat by the fire the armchair was big enough for hugo to sit next to me and we watched rosie rush around the room she tried out each of the seats greeted the portraits on either side of the fire and played half a studied game of chess against herself my dad plays chess she announced when she grew bored he once beat you know who on a giant chess set no hugo said folding his arms the pieces were tran trans transfigured by the professor who could turn into a cat uncle harry beat you know who with a mirror i was about ninety percent sure that wasnthow it happened but i thought it was better just to end the conversation entirely do you want see my room now rosie hugo yeah rosie cried jumping up where is it down the black stairs i told her hugo let me carry you okay he didntsay anything he d put a thumb back into his mouth but he held out one arm as i awkwardly pulled him into my arms i was almost sure that the stairs wouldntcare about a boy that young but i didntwant to take any chances he just a kid i told the common room we re not going to do anything gross i just watching him for the afternoon promise are you coming rosie called from the bottom of the stairs lydia i wanna see your room i hurried down the steps it the last one on your right rosie i said and she skipped on ahead holding out her hands in front of her for a moment before dashing into my room i put hugo down once i got to the bottom of the stairs and we followed her inside rosie was already at the window staring out there was a calm sea outside with a little wooden rowboat drifting with the current where the forest she asked me that not the lake i explained we re underground the picture shows the ocean that why you cantsee the shore anywhere wicked exclaimed rosie and then she turned her attention elsewhere inspecting the beds and my trunk and pausing to examine my flutterby bush i sat down after a moment in alicia armchair and pulled hugo into my lap he had a book in his hands professor granger kid after all will you read me a story he asked handing me the book it was something called hans christian anderson the complete tales i d never heard of the author before so i let hugo choose the story this one he said finally pointing to one called the little mermaid i cleared my throat and began far out in the ocean where the water is as blue as the prettiest cornflower and as clear as crystal it is very very deep i read the story started out as an adventure turned love story with an odd old witch who couldntdo human transfiguration worth anything and then ended with the main character dying after that hugo had me read a story called the little match girl which was about a little girl who froze to death selling matches and then we read the steadfast tin soldier which was about a tin soldier who burned to death i was sensing a pattern by the end of the third story and i asked hugo where he d gotten the book mummy had it when she was a little girl he told me hey lydia rosie called why is everything here green anyway are you a slytherin mm hm i said looking away from hugo for a moment seriously what kind of stories did muggles tell their children it was a wonder they werentall completely disturbed by the time they started school that funny rosie said and then after a moment does your dad mind of course not i told her distractedly hugo was pulling on my sleeve again can we read the one about the girl who gets her feet cut off now lydia let read something else all right what about beedle the bard we can read about the fountain of fair fortune how about that hugo sulkily allowed me to persuade him to read stories in which people were neither killed nor maimed and both rosie and i completely forgot about her question it wasntuntil much later after professor granger had collected the two kids that i even thought to wonder why an eight year old would automatically assume my father didntwant me to be in slytherin ooooooooo a n jkr of course owns all things potterverse including rosie and hugo and all the tales of beedle the bard the slytherin password in this chapter comes from the end of heinrich heine poem the lorelei translated here by clint andrews which of course is where lura name originally comes from the quote from hans christian anderson the little mermaid is in fact the beginning of the fairy tale which is online at they have the little match girl and the red shoes as well but unfortunately not the steadfast tin soldier which is a pity that was one of my favorite stories as a kid this chapter was mostly a quiet interlude to fit the atmosphere i remember best about vacations at school erm i meant to post it to er coincide with a vacation at school but then i got behind and one of my betas got bogged down well i will try to do better next time this chapter was beta d by t mad hatter and all criticism is welcome chapter thirty nine the rookwoods dear meg classes start today and i kind of embarrassed to admit i happy about that i know you go home for your holidays what do you call it over there vaca how do you pronounce that but i was at school the whole time it will be much nicer to have more people here and professor snape said he d deal with my lesson plans when term starts again did i tell you about that he doesntthink it worthwhile for me to keep going with the third year lessons and he called me by my first name when i finished my last potion with him which he never done with me before and i dontthink he ever done it with anyone else either i did spend part of the holiday the part where i wasntsnogging my girlfriend in the greenhouses is that normal the hiding in the greenhouse bit brewing because he let me into his lab and stores which are amazing but it was cold and creepy down there and i didntlike to linger much my friend evan says he was in washington dc and his cousin is a sort of ambassador person but not to any specific country he says she deals with the importing exporting of illegalish things but he doesntknow any more than that evan says he had a lot of fun and that he is extremely jealous that you americans can use magic when you re underage i am also extremely jealous although it only affects effects evan says it affects because things affect things that are already there and effect changes or something my summers because i spend easter and christmas at school how far is washington from your home sometime i think you should come to england you could visit hogwarts and my friend lyra could teach you how to play quidditch well evan finally found his book i was writing this while he was digging around through the stacks for some random biographies that he couldntpossibly live without so i going to close this so i can send it off before breakfast i read over the letter once more then signed my name at the bottom evan was already waiting for me at the door to the library so i hurriedly sealed it and shoved everything back into my bag come on then i told him let go to the owlery he grinned and shifted his books under his other arm dontyou even want to know what i checked out i let out an exaggerated sigh what d you get i found the life and lies of albus dumbledore which everyone knows is all lies but it sort of interesting anyway and then i got decoding dumbledore deceptions which is supposed to be the premier biography on him but i think the title a bit much and i got influencing albus aberforth ariana and gellert and then i got dumbledore and the order and lura has another one for me i stared at him dumbledore the old headmaster here yeah he got killed by professor snape on the astronomy tower i know that i said irritably as we caught a passing staircase but why are you reading so many books about him evan shifted on the stairs so he was facing me it like this he said finally dumbledore basically he was the order you know all the anti voldemort stuff all the fighters all the intrigue and spying and prophecy stuff he set it all up so to understand the wars i think you have to understand him first and i dontthink that easy to do with just one book i considered this for a while dontyou think he was a good man i asked after a moment i mean harry thinks so and i sure he must have been to win the war and let himself be killed and everything i dontthink it enough just to say he was a good man and be done with it evan told me there are lots of things that he did that i dontthink are good except that he did them for a greater good i wish professor trent would let us talk about this stuff in class i dontthink that would be a good idea i said as i opened the door to the owlery the windows had no glass and the room was lit with pale early morning light and much colder than the hallway i shivered as i looked around at the owls who all regarded me curiously i mean professor snape might mind dontyou think and i feel like it could all get really personal really fast with all the family baggage everyone brings in take this one to the states would you i asked the largest owl there who hooted as if to say that she could certainly handle a trans atlantic flight thank you evan sighed yeah i know but if we donttalk about it all the people who know what happened will be dead before we re able to figure out what happened hurry up would you i freezing i nearly done i said clipping the letter around her leg go on then you evan and i waited just long enough to make sure she made it out of the tower before we headed back down the corridor what if everyone just forgot about it then slytherin could be a normal house and we wouldnthave to worry about everything so much everyone forgot before evan pointed out that how he came to power and anyway slytherin been fucked up since the seventies you know that like ninety percent of the death eaters were slytherins and people need to realize why that happened or it ll happen again werentthey just sort of mad i asked that made sense you d have to be crazy and evil to like torturing people maybe there were others who joined because they werentclever enough to realize what was going on or because they were too scared to say no and then the next generation of slytherins had a lot of death eater parents so they had other reasons to join but luckily voldemort was completely dead this time so alicia death eater parents wouldntmean anything evan shook his head they were disenfranchised lydia i think that the right word anyway because after the seventies no one trusted the slytherins anymore everyone thought they were evil so when voldemort showed up again they all felt like they had no choice but to join him so if it happens again they ll join again you see evan it canthappen again voldemort dead remember evan shook his head again there could be another dark lord lydia i crossed my arms no there couldn t you d have to be completely mad and horribly cruel and persuasive there no one like that here you know that voldemort was head boy right that the thing you wouldnt know you know someone would just show up one day and convince everyone who felt rejected to follow him can we talk about something else i asked finally maybe evan was right that people needed to talk about what had really happened but he was ignoring the fact that it was much more comforting not to and anyway voldemort was dead and there were all sorts of reforms now so that it couldnthappen again of course he agreed gallantly what do you want to talk about i fished around for another topic what about the study group i know we sort of let it lapse last term with marissa and cameron being you know gross but maybe we should start it up again i think that a good idea evan said my grades were much better when we were all working together do you want to talk to marissa and lyra and i ll talk to letta and get us a room sounds good i said as we neared the entrance to the great hall ooh breakfast smells good doesntit you ve no idea the states dontunderstand the whole breakfast concept very well evan said with a groan the hotel kept serving me something called a continental breakfast not even worth getting up for serves you right for being able to use magic i told him as he opened the door the sound of hundreds of students talking over breakfast swelled around us and then suddenly stopped everyone was staring at us and people had stopped eating what did you do i hissed at evan but really i was worried someone had found out about pernella and me i risked a look around the hall everyone was staring at us and some were whispering hesitantly i reached for evan hand and together we walked towards the slytherin table cameron moved aside so we could slide in between him and aaron across from maddison and alicia what going on i whispered everyone staring wordlessly maddison folded over her newspaper and pushed it across the table to evan i read it over his shoulder convicted death eaters escape azkaban read the headline and underneath there was a picture of several aurors in a prison cell shaking their heads and turning away from the camera to examine the walls there were two more pictures further down one of a man and one of a woman it took me a moment to realize they had to be evan parents oh sweet merlin i whispered evan he didntrespond after a moment he folded up the paper and handed it back to maddison so the aurors dontknow how they did it he said finally i met maddison eyes and she swallowed only sirius black was ever able to escape she said after a bit other than the mass break outs that is he did it by transforming into a dog i put in but ah i trailed off i didntknow if it would be more comforting to say that surely they d be heading out of the country without him or that the aurors would catch them and send them back or it ll be okay man cameron finished awkwardly for me the great hall which had started to return to its normal level of conversation suddenly fell silent again what are you doing here alicia asked someone over my shoulder and i turned around to see loretta williamson she didntanswer alicia but she looked at me pointedly after a moment i realized what she wanted and moved over on the bench so she could sit next to evan he put an arm around her shoulders neither of them spoke i couldnthelp staring everyone was staring even the other slytherins who usually tried to be good about that sort of thing but no one sat at the slytherin table except for slytherins especially not hufflepuffs and especially not second years mr rookwood the three of us jumped at the unfamiliar voice would you come with me please i turned around to see who it was evan hadntmoved the man who had spoken was tall with long dark hair pulled back in a ponytail who are you i asked gawain robards he said with the auror office i need to speak to your classmate i believe i asked you to wait for me snape hissed i was so glad to see him i almost hugged him i trusted snape completely and strange aurors not at all mr rookwood this is mr robards who is the head of the auror office he d like to speak with you in the headmistress office when you ve finished breakfast actually i really need to speak with him immediately when you ve finished your meal professor snape told evan firmly evan looked at his empty plate and pushed it away i done anyway he said standing up loretta stood up with him i sorry i really need to speak with evan alone miss williamson she finished for him and i going with him robards opened his mouth and then closed it again and loretta tilted her chin just a little come on evan she said and the two of them walked together out of the great hall was that the williamsons peter girl the head of the aurors sputtered he was stillshaking his head as he followed snape out do you think they mis sorted her aaron asked after a long silence i d say it a definite possibility i agreed hey maddison can i see your paper she nodded and passed it over and then after a moment cameron asked for the kippers and i helped myself to some sausage and conversation slowly returned to its usual deafening level ooooooo evan was missing through all our morning classes and i didntsee him at lunch or loretta williamson either cameron and i talked briefly about going to find him but we finally decided that he and loretta were probably talking it over and we would only be in the way cameron and i hadnthad parents like either of theirs potions was first after lunch and professor snape set everyone working on simple aging solutions miss carmichael he said quietly can i see you in my office as for the rest of you i expect a finished memory enhancing draught and remember please that they are illegal on examinations he didntreally have to worry i thought the class was all slytherins so we were all too worried about evan to think about making trouble i followed him into his office which was just off the classroom with the door open he still had a clear line of sight to the student cauldrons he had a desk inside and on it was my felix felicis tell me about this was all he said i swallowed well uh i made it just before christmas sir i just followed the recipe in twenty difficult potions but i added a counter clockwise stir in and i only used half as much unicorn horn about you didntbottle it up he remarked i bottled a little of it i told him but i thought maybe it wanted to breathe a little professor snape looked at me thoughtfully for a moment perhaps it did miss carmichael he said finally you are aware he continued that the seventh years sit for their n e w t s at the end of this year er yes professor i would like you to sit for the potions n e w t as well he told me my mouth dropped open but sir i only a third year you have quite clearly demonstrated that your skills are far above the average third year s we discussed this last term i would like you to use the remainder of the year to complete the seventh year curriculum and to prepare for the n e w t this will give you a chance to cement the theory you will need for more advanced work and the practical lessons will give you more experience in applying that theory and in forming your own recipes how do you mean sir i asked i mean that i would expect you to be able to make any potion on the n e w t curriculum without notes instructions or an ingredients list and if it were a general potion to pick the most practical type oh i said it sounded like a lot but then if i could pass my n e w t s this early no one had ever done it before i was sure what on the test sir instead of answering professor snape handed me a small booklet titled nastily exhausting wizarding test potions an outline he explained to guide your studies i would like to meet with you twice weekly to check your progress are your tuesday and thursday evenings free i nodded it wasntreally a question good we ll meet at seven then you should take normal class time to revise as well he said i am not asking something easy from you miss carmichael and you will not want to embarrass yourself no sir i said if i was going to do this i was damn well going to do it right i was going to get an outstanding on my n e w t and then maybe i could spend next year doing even more interesting potions potions quarterly had just run a series of articles about anti polyjuice potions they were still in the testing phase but these were potions that would prevent your hair and nails from being used for polyjuicing and professor snape was still working on the wolfsbane and he d been quoted as saying a breakthrough might come in the next few years evan and cameron had bought me a subscription to the practical potioneer for christmas and professor snape had been featured in a lengthy article or maybe i could do research on how moonlight affected potions i ll get an o sir i told him firmly see that you do professor snape said as he stood up i suggest you take the rest of the period to look over the material you ll be tested on and i ll expect to see a timetable on thursday yes sir i said and i followed him back into the classroom cameron caught my eye and frowned and i flashed him a quick grin he relaxed and i headed to the back of the room to see what i would be tested on in june there was a lot of material there was a page of general expectations it began the student shall have a clear understanding of the use for each ingredient the proper techniques for storage preparation and brewing the theory behind all potions covered and a general knowledge of the greater moments in the history of potions making and then a twelve page outline of the basic theory i would have to know after that was a list of potions we were expected to be able to brew without instructions and then a list of further reading i noted with some satisfaction that i d already read most of the books on the list i took out parchment and a quill and began to rewrite the syllabus outline marking down whether i was confident in the topic or not whether i had brewed the potion before or not the n e w t was supposed to more or less follow the lessons laid out in advanced potion making and deeply dangerous brewing a student guide but there were probably other things on it i knew i should be worried about evan and i was but i couldnthelp being excited as i looked over the material and started to draw up timetables and even though i tried very firmly to keep my mind on looking over the syllabus i couldnthelp wondering about what might happen if i managed to finish the whole n e w t level this year and take the test and get an o oooooo a n as always i dontown anything jkr awesome this chapter was beta d by t mad hatter and ill ame who are both wonderful and fantastic and brilliant all mistakes are of course mine and not theirs i trying really hard to get back on a faster update schedule because a month between updates is ridiculous and you shouldnthave to wait that long as usual comments and criticism welcome chapter four bigotry begins each morning i eagerly awaited a letter from home i was the only one in my year it seemed who had not received a package or even a congratulatory letter adrian macnair family had sent him cookies and a case of butterbeer finally at the end of my second week at school i saw my mother owl swoop into the great hall i quickly tore open the letter it dropped into my lap dear lydia it read we received your letter my initial thought i must admit was that the sorting hat had made some grave mistake but professor vector assured me it had not my question to you then is this how have we raised you if you can embrace the slytherin ideals do you not know of the horrors committed by your kind if you are a true slytherin lydia then we have failed as your parents to instill in you morality and love for truth and justice i would advise you to make plans for the christmas holidays when i was at school students were allowed to remain in residence if that is no longer the case then i recommend you make arrangements to stay with a friend your father is livid i would not write to him if i were you did you have any idea lydia what this would do to us did you even give us a thought your mother acantha t carmichael i stared at the sheet of parchment willing it to change the only noticeable difference was a slightly smoky odor as i watched the letter began to char slightly around the edges suddenly a hand shook me roughly what do you think you re doing carmichael eli rosier asked me angrily not worth it you re too old to show your emotions like that someday it ll get you killed now put the letter away and finish your breakfast or you ll be late for class i nodded agreeing silently he was right of course slytherin did not allow such weakness if it did there would be hell to pay as the rest of the world the light side potter vast army the faithful followers of the boy who simply would not die attempted to destroy us to punish us in retaliation for the harm they had suffered at voldemort hands for i had learned those first weeks just how much danger my house put me in the green and silver stripes on my badge made me more of a target than i had ever thought possible often the teachers could not take action against our tormentors more often they simply would not and hadntthey too lost loved ones to the dark lord i think i ve been disowned i told lyra that afternoon as we walked toward the lake together lyra defying all odds had remained a true friend to me our houses never seemed to make any difference in fact we tried not to mention them our one tacit acknowledgment of our differences was that we never walked together in crowded places where trouble might start up disowned she asked why is that even legal i guess so i got this letter from my mum today here i said extracting it from my cloak pocket and handing it to her you can read it it pretty self explanatory she read it quickly she told you it was your fault for being selfish and that she doesntwant you home for the holidays and it reflects badly on them how do they think you feel lyra was seething ooh i so mad i could just just kick something what was she thinking probably that i was finally showing my true colors as part of the extended black family and becoming a loyal follower of voldemort i replied dryly she didnthear me and continued her tirade and that it was your fault they both went to hogwarts they know the hat does what it wants and it not like slytherins are all evil anyway plenty of ravenclaws and hufflepuffs went over to the dark side too ugh how can you stand it lydia i was surprised at her question it hadntoccurred to me that there was anything else to do what else do i do i their only child so until they decide to take me back it not like someone going to steal my inheritance i paused well i suppose harry might get it but he got enough i think he d give me some and anyway i ve got money of my own from my grandparents and i ve a place to stay but they re your parents so my dad ll rant and my mum ll rage and then they ll remember i their only heir and they re both getting older and they ll remember how easily people die and then they ll welcome me back in it just a question really of how long it ll take and it could be worse how well i dontknow but i like the kids in my house and i mean it not like i ve embraced muggle religion or anything my parents would go insane why lyra asked sounding a little put out i a christian why they must ve known you d be a witch right i mean you re not muggleborn are you would you mind if i was she asked me course not it just that you ve got wizarding parents i not like that like most slytherins you know about was what i d wanted to say well actually i dontknow my sister a witch and she always just told me the church thing was what my mum would ve wanted and we dontreally talk about it anyway but i guessing somewhere in there there muggle blood there muggle blood in nearly everyone though we d have died out without the half bloods we had reached the lake and we sat down together by the shore what will you do about holidays lyra asked me stay here i guess i dontknow about the summer you dontthink they ll still hate you then seeing my face at the word hate lyra took my hand i sorry lydia i didntmean to say that i sure they donthate you i shook my head to clear my vision i was not going to cry not here not now it fine i just being sure to take care of everything it never hurts to have a plan b you know maybe you could come home with me your parents would let me i a slytherin remember i couldntkeep all the bitterness out of my voice yeah but you re still my friend thanks i told her i might have to take you up on that unless do you think the leaky caldron would rent rooms to eleven year olds lydia carmichael you are not spending your summer in a in a pub she looked completely scandalized by the idea well why not harry potter stayed there before his third year and he was fine first off you are not thirteen years old and you haventdefeated the dark lord three times and you arentbeing protected from an azkaban escapee he was innocent i interjected and you arentthe boy who lived besides there might be untrustworthy people there i was silent for a moment trying to come up with an argument i settled on asking who going to try anything there are still death eaters out there you know and other people who wouldntthink twice at hurting a defenseless i not defenseless little girl on her own she finished glaring at me and you are so defenseless or at least you would be against a fully trained dark wizard i sighed all right i promise not to spend my summer defending myself from dark wizards hiding in the leaky caldron satisfied yes she said rather smugly anyway i continued figuring a change of subjects was in order what are you so happy about i made the gryffindor team she said managing to sound modest i a beater lyra that great i cried throwing my arms around her in a congratulatory hug i so glad that awesome you ll love it how often do you practice do you like the rest of the team do they like you we practice three nights a week the team so nice to me even though i the youngest by years it so great it like having six older siblings just like that and the other beater really awesome too ooh do i sense a little bit of a crush perhaps lydia of course not he just a really nice person mm hm he is i not arguing but you re insinuating she accused me never and anyway we re going to be late for dinner now you re just trying to change the subject and you re wrong dinner over we missed it i wanted food i whined then let go to kitchens and get some the house elves dontmind they like giving it out you re sure the rest of the team does it all the time we set off for the kitchens silently lyra seemed to know her way confidently turning down smaller corridors and down various staircases we walked side by side shoulders nearly touching until i heard someone approaching she turned to me in surprise as i jumped to the side and i shrugged if it a group of older guys i didntsay gryffindors but we both knew that what i meant then it better if we re just walking alone together instead of together alone i not sure i can see the difference well alone together is like we re here alone we just happen to be together and together alone means we re here together without anyone else and that sketchy as i finished speaking the group turned the corner i waited long enough to see the red and gold on their ties before winking at lyra and turning down a side corridor disclaimer as always i own nothing that belongs to jkr everything else is mine though so please dontsteal it a n thanks to my betas vercisisolde ambika san haleth aldea and amelie the reason for such a late chapter lies entirely with vercisisolde who took several eons to help me revise this and the next chapter hopefully with summer vacation almost here four days i ll get chapters out more quickly i d like to get this pretty far along before book six comes out please review chapter forty death eaters in hogsmeade you seen evan cameron asked as the door to the common room opened greg harkiss shook his head and pulled the door shut behind him sorry he told us he may not even show tonight cameron sighed and i ran my fingers through my hair to try to get rid of the headache that had been building all night cameron and i had both finished our homework and lingered as long as we possibly could over a game of gobstones but we werentfooling anyone our whole year had been up and down the stairs too in case there was any news where the hell was evan surely the ministry couldntthink he was actually involved in his parents escape evan was thirteen he couldntbreak into azkaban and he wouldnt i wondered what loretta thought she was doing standing by him like this when she was a second year and a hufflepuff and her parents had been aurors i wondered if it was helping hey alicia said softly from the doorway any news we shook our heads no one seen him i said with a sigh here she said john sent this up he thought you might want something to drink she handed us each a bottle of butterbeer and touched my shoulder gently he ll show up lydia where do you think they re headed cameron asked i mean do they have a plan you think there was no need to ask who he meant they ve got to be totally barking by now alicia said they ve been in azkaban a decade nearly right they say it drives you insane crazy people can have plans i said maybe even worse ones because they arentreasonable about it they ve got to be reasonable enough cameron put in they ve escaped haventthey i latched firmly onto that idea right then they ll be heading for the continent right for denmark or germany they wontbe stupid enough to come to britain right with everyone watching merlin i hope not alicia said with a shudder i still dontsee how they did it people have broken out before i pointed out sirius black right and there were mass breakouts during the war but the mass breakouts those people had help cameron said after a moment and black was an animagus wasnthe but i dontsee how they could have done it the both of them unless they had help couldntthey be animaguses animagi too i asked s not like we d know maddison says they arenton the register alicia told us though i guess they could be unregistered maybe cameron said as the clock struck midnight it d be awfully convenient though they were death eaters i said you d think they d have planned for this wouldntyou i would if i were a i stopped as the door creaked open and evan walked in behind him was melissa radford looking grave evan the three of us cried at once hullo he answered dully sit melissa ordered him firmly and finish your hot chocolate and then get to bed you should be excused from classes tomorrow i dontknow what snape going on about i all right melissa evan said quietly but he sat down and let her hand him a tall mug it better for me to go to class anyway she shook her head it oughtntto be allowed she repeated and then she headed towards the girls staircase i going to get my charms reading evan you ve got half an hour to finish that drink and then you re going to bed you can worry about your homework tomorrow after you ve copied the notes from today lessons yes melissa evan said and he took a big gulp of his drink she looked at him doubtfully but headed down the stairs we waited until her footsteps faded away to ask questions well alicia prompted what happened cameron asked are you all right i asked anxiously he nodded slowly his face still looked sort of blank i wanted to put an arm around him but i didntquite dare it was just the aurors wanted to talk to me about what happened that all evan i protested you were a toddler when your parents were put in prison you couldnteven talk what does he think you were involved somehow i think he just covering all his bases evan hedged yeah that one way to put it cameron muttered do they know anything alicia asked she was biting at her nails no i dontthink so evan said nothing they told me anyway robards said they were talking to my aunt and robin and that letta and i should be vigilant and he gave me his card if i remembered anything he shrugged like it wasnta big deal to have aurors questioning him about his missing parents they dontthink they re coming here i asked shocked they d have to be mad azkaban cameron said ten years seriously now lydia i dontthink they think so evan said quietly but they might i here and so so is letta and they well there no telling what my what they re thinking you think they might come after will loretta i asked doubtfully i ll kill them if they do he said simply his face was set and his eyes were hard alicia and i exchanged a worried glance evan was quiet and calm most of the time so it was easy to forget whose child he was or how dangerous he could be they can t cameron said firmly ten to one they never made it out of the water and how would they get to hogwarts with everyone watching that a good point i conceded and evan nodded in agreement but alicia and i double warded our door and window that night anyway oooooo for the next week or so walking anywhere with evan was sort of like walking somewhere with the plague everyone whispered and stared and most people avoided us he insisted on walking loretta to each of her classes too but after the first few days i wasntsure who was walking whom exactly evan carried her books for her but she was the one who told people off for staring no one liked seeing them together the slytherin prefects had approached evan more than once to tell him so but he was ignoring all their efforts there was something about loretta cameron and i agreed that was decidedly un puffish and while we still didntlike her we couldnthelp but feel a sort of grudging respect for her for the way she was standing by evan rumor even had it that she had threatened to hex a fifth year hufflepuff for daring to suggest their friendship was a betrayal to her parents aurors were still visiting the castle occasionally ostensibly to see if evan had thought of anything to help in the capture of his parents personally i wasntsure if they thought evan was going to confess to secretly breaking his parents out or if they were just so amazed at his relationship with loretta she insisted on staying with him when the aurors questioned him and she would wait by the door if they refused to let her in they talked to her as well of course but evan said it was just to remind her to be careful there was no telling what the rookwoods were going to do it was possible they were going to try to finish what they d started over a decade ago or that they would come for their son or cameron and i told evan over and over again they were headed for denmark or already dead the north sea was freezing this time of year after all and it wasntlike they were healthy after that much time in prison we didntthink evan actually believed us though granted he helped arrange for a room for our study group we met most school nights which was an incredible help when arithmancy problem sets were due and he seemed to go about his normal routine as always but he insisted on walking letta back to the hufflepuff common room and waiting until she was through the door before leaving and i d quickly grown used to seeing him standing in the corridor outside the slytherin dorms wand ready evan i said finally what are you going to do if you actually see them they re trained death eaters and you re thirteen i dontknow he admitted lowering his wand a little and turning to me sheepishly professor granger loaned me some books i might be able to hold them off i blinked professor granger expects you to fight them surely professor granger wasntactually telling a third year student to be ready to attack two full grown ex death eaters no of course not he answered rolling his eyes that would be fairly irresponsible of her and i think unethical too actually she told me to run away and go for help if they managed to get here but she said that she d known third year boys who tried to go after azkaban escapees before and it was better i do it with the cards stacked in my favor speaking of which are you and zach wenlock still doing extra defense work technically i said we haventstopped it but we haventdone any in ages i ve had potions and everything else and he has whatever the sixth years have why could i borrow your books sure i said and then hesitated for a moment but evan yeah lydia you ll be careful wontyou i mean i know they shouldn t attack you if they know who you are but they might and i dontwant you to die i finished lamely none of us do evan smiled at me and gave me a sort of awkward hug i know he said i mean thanks i mean i won t he corrected will rather i dontwant to do any actual fighting either lydia but if they try to come after letta dontyou see that i d have to yes i said finally hating to concede the point but i still say you should run away let the aurors handle it the bloody castle crawling with them i hope to he said actually i hope i donteven have to come on let get to bed before the prefects are all over us i laughed melissa radford had become ridiculously strict about bedtimes where evan was concerned and we walked back into the common room but evan sent a stunning spell at the wall before he opened the common room door and i sort of felt as i drifted off into sleep that nothing had really been resolved oooooo i nearly impressed professor snape told me as he double checked my antidote this would indeed render someone immune to veritaserum although i do not know how long it would remain effective and this is an unusual brewing process thank you sir i said i was flattered antidotes were not my strong suit since most of them were impractical next to a bezoar it was nice to know that i could still actually brew one do you think it ll be on the exam i think anything is fair professor snape said how is the rest of your review going pretty well i answered i ve been revising the easier stuff first though so it might get harder and it been hard to concentrate lately i confessed i surprised myself by admitting to it professor snape wasntsomeone i thought of as comforting exactly and i didntlike admitting that i was rattled because of the rookwoods yes more than that though evan scared which is bad but what worse is that he so determined professor he says he ll kill them if they if he has to and i almost think he would i dontlike thinking that my best friend could be a killer professor snape sighed miss carmichael everyone can be a killer nearly everyone he corrected and most of the people who cantare prevented by their lack of expertise not because they are too good or too pure to kill i frowned and pulled out a lab stool so i could sit down this wasntexactly comforting i couldn t i said finally do you really think so he asked what if you were being threatened what if one of your friends was being threatened the thought flashed through my mind for a moment the rookwoods an army of death eaters at their backs approaching on evan on lyra on pernella that would be self defense i told him isntthat different in the end you still have a corpse on the floor professor snape said on the other hand if mr rookwood did manage somehow to kill either or both of his parents i do not think anyone would fault him i very much doubt anyone would feel the same way if their situations were reversed but i stopped i didnt want to talk about this it wasnteven something we had touched on in professor trent class when was it all right to kill someone when was avada kedavra forgivable i shook my head to clear the thoughts away and the clock struck the hour thanks for the lesson professor snape i said i ll study the next section for tuesday see that you do was all he said and i gathered my notes and headed out into the corridor for the stairs i was late for study group which meant i was late for seeing pernella the worst part of not being open about seeing her was that we werentusually alone people gave marissa and cameron space but they thought pernella and i wouldntmind company study group was an excuse to talk to her and sometimes to touch her if we sat close enough together lydia cameron cried when i got there it about time i got here as soon as i could i answered defensively i had a meeting thing with professor snape come help with arithmancy pernella called i cantget the third problem sure i answered grabbing a seat next to her and fishing some parchment and a quill out of my bag where are you so far it the stupid equations she said they wontbalance i looked over at her open book and wrote the equation out on my parchment pernella could solve things in her head but i needed to write them out did you double check everything against the number chart which one are you using anyway the one from chapter twelve she said but it isntworking huh i answered i started to rewrite the equation using the number chart pernella had used as i was writing i bumped her arm with mine i thought she would pull away but she just looked down and pretended she hadntnoticed hey pernella i asked in a near whisper mm there a hogsmeade weekend lydia she hissed looking around to make sure no one was listening lydia no way this isntthe holidays there are people all around pernella i whispered in irritation we never do anything because we dontwant people to know no because you dontwant people to know have you two figured out that problem yet jeff poole asked cause i think i ve got it pernella and i jumped and pernella moved her arm away and then scooted her chair away from me so he could come sit between us see i think it originally an aramaic name so we have to use that chart it in the appendix instead of the one from the chapter ooh pernella said actually i think that might work i flipped his book open to the relevant page and recopied everything using the right chart this this is why i hate aramaic names oh i know poole said they make the equations so bloody complicated luckily we re almost done with this right you are maybe i said i ve still got five problems after this this week has been awful i bet poole said is um rookwood doing okay sort of i said i didntwant to talk about how he was practicing cursing his parents or how i would come up to the common room at two in the morning to find him staring blankly into the fire he worried about loretta the three of us turned instinctively to look at her she was sitting next to evan practicing warming charms she looks better than he does pernella said i sighed he been taking it bad let talk about something else um i ve redone the problem and i think it working awesome poole said with a grin i thought it might hey pernella i was meaning to ask you there a hogsmeade weekend coming up next week and i wondered if you wanted to go with me um said pernella i wanted to elbow her but poole was still between us we should get going actually i said instead melissa doing rounds tonight and she hates it if people are out late right pernella said faintly sure poole said hey everyone we should pack up and head out it after ten no one argued and in a few minutes we d put the desks and chairs back where they were supposed to go cameron had to clean up an ink spill so i waited with him while everyone else dispersed we asked evan to stay but he was going to walk loretta back to her dorm poole offered to go with pernella and marissa come on he was saying as they left it not like you re seeing anyone else right i glared daggers at both their retreating backs hey i done you ready cameron asked after a couple minutes stain as gone as it going to be i shouldnthave used that permanent ink thing lydia are you okay er yeah i said shaking my head and turning back to him pernella had probably just been surprised that was all she was probably walking with him right now explaining that she couldntgo with him to hogsmeade i hoped i really really hoped oooooo where is he melissa hadntraised her voice but she made up for it with incredible intensity who i asked cameron shut the common room door behind us and looked around at the room it was completely packed with slytherin students evan rookwood he the only other slytherin missing lydia where is he walking loretta williamson back to the puff dorms i told her why hey arentyou supposed to be making rounds cameron cut in what going on melissa sighed heavily and ran a hand through her hair it the rookwoods the parents i mean they ve been spotted in hogsmeade apparently they jumped into the lake the aurors think they re headed here here i repeated like to hogwarts or worse melissa said you know they say there a passage under the lake into the dungeons oh sweet merlin i whispered cantwe block it cameron asked we dontknow where it is sarah said coming over and putting an arm around my shoulders but the aurors have been here looking for evan people were really worried are still really worried you say he on his way to the huffelump dorms with williamson we nodded okay so melissa is going to go get them this was peter marchbanks the other seventh year prefect and i going to go firecall the headmistress and tell her sarah can you keep the common room calm and they may want to relocate everyone to someplace more er defensible can you handle that sure sarah said i wondered a little why he hadntasked one of the other prefects to keep control but then again the seventh years were close they relied on each other more than the prefect support system and besides melissa didntreally like alexis her next in line sweet peter said melissa nodded at them both whispered something to sarah and then disappeared through the common room door peter walked into the prefects room and shut the door okay people sarah called listen up the rookwoods have been spotted they may in fact be coming here that means that you all need to stay here i know you have assignments to finish and important things you need from your rooms too bad the fourth years and up can help you summon them think of it as practice but no one is to leave this room until you re told she paused a minute i going to do a roll call if everyone would be quiet until i finished that would be helpful peter halloway here he whispered the roll call continued until everyone had been accounted for and then sarah let the older students start summoning things i scooted over on the floor to make room for her and she put an arm around me i knew i had a girlfriend and i sort of felt bad about it but i leaned against her anyway her body was warm and smelled good they ll find them right i asked sure sarah said they ve got the best aurors on this lydia ooooooo a n so um i suck at this faster updating thing but the olympics are surprisingly conducive to faster writing thousands of athletes can come together to be freaking amazing i can write a couple thousand words and the opening ceremony oh my goodness how amazing i cantwait for the actual games seriously anyway this was edited by t mad hatter and ill ame who are fantastic and amazing and very good at nagging me and er catching really embarrassing mistakes thanks guys i still dontown the potterverse because it jkr s i just play in her sandbox the reviews i ve gotten are amazing and they really do keep me writing faster and constructive criticism is absolutely wonderful a n so uh i know i ve been really bad about updating but midterms are over for me and my betas and i ve ironed out some really thorny plot problems i e harry so hopefully this will be smooth er sailing from now on the reason there are notes at the top this time is because tdolphing nicely suggested that i put a previously on slytherin in red and gold sort of segment at the top so i am going to try that with my apologies for taking this long and thus requiring it last chapter evan parents having escaped azkaban and shocked the country continued to elude aurors while loretta and evan continued to amaze the school by staying friends lydia practiced antidotes with professor snape and was horrified when he reminded her that almost anyone herself and classmates included could become a killer if pressed later jeff poole flirted outrageously with pernella who angered lydia by not refusing to flirt back finally the rookwoods were spotted in hogsmeade jumping into the lake and hogwarts went into lockdown mode chapter forty one a midnight vigil two hours later the door creaked open and professor snape strode in with a man i had never seen before is this everyone miss portsmouth yes professor she answered good all of you up you are being moved to the great hall not because i think you re in any danger here but because it is better to be safe than sorry this is mr finnegan he added for some reason he seems to think that i am incapable of protecting you on my own in dungeons i have lived in for most of my life age has not granted you wisdom mr finnegan mr finnegan looked distinctly uncomfortable now professor snape said wands out and ready we followed professor snape and mr finnegan out the door sarah waited until everyone was out before leaving and i waited to walk with her luckily she was left handed so we could hold hands comfortably as we walked usually the walk to the great hall was fairly quick i never thought about it much but this was through the dark hushed corridors our footsteps and breathing were the only sounds and the only light was from our wands and the faint beams of moonlight coming in through the few high windows even the portraits were eerily silent but they were all awake and looked like they were keeping a vigil i tightened my grip on sarah hand and looked over my shoulder i knew the rookwoods couldntbe here you couldntget into hogwarts unless you were a student or a teacher or an auror or or someone who had a reason to be there and hogwarts was magic and it was crawling with aurors and we had professor snape on our side but i was still jumpy and sarah had to keep squeezing my hand mr finnegan opened the doors to the great hall and professor snape ushered us in every slytherin but mr rookwood and miss radford headmistress he said any news none she said miss radford and mr rookwood should be down in a moment they re with gawain the other houses they re all here she said miss williamson is the only one missing from hufflepuff she with gawain as well we ve firecalled her aunt and uncle professor vector looked a little frazzled but her voice remained calm do you think you could start patrolling the dungeons we dontwant to be surprised indeed not headmistress thank you severus she said i sure seamus would be happy to accompany you neither man looked particularly happy to hear that in fact mr finnegan looked slightly ill but they left together anyway sarah tugged at my hand and i followed her to where the rest of our house was sitting in one corner the tables had all disappeared and in their place there were about a thousand squashy beanbag chairs they were pretty comfortable so do you think they re actually trying to get in i asked sarah i dontknow lydia maybe i dontthink anyone really knows what they re thinking or where they might be going coming here is probably the daftest thing they could do but then self preservation and a decade in azkaban dontreally go together maybe it wasntactually them i suggested desperately maybe it was someone else who looked like them maybe sarah said i sure it happened before why do you think loretta is sticking by him i d been looking for a motive in her actions for a year now and i still hadntcome up with anything williamson sarah asked i not sure lydia i suppose she might actually like him you know but his parents killed her parents but he not his parents sarah pointed out reasonably does she seem like she has an ulterior motive i mean maybe she can just move past it and evan been looking out for her since she started school did you ever think that maybe they re in the same boat how evan parents were murderers loretta parents were murder victims his parents had been death eaters and hers had been aurors his were alive hers weren t that didntsound like the same boat to me well they re both effectively orphaned sarah said thoughtfully and they both live with their relatives dontthey that got to be difficult and he looked out for her since she started here maybe she lonely it still seems kind of fishy to me i told her i still think that maybe she up to something like revenge you mean at my nod sarah shook her head i dontthink so lydia she seems pretty straightforward to me hmph i answered and sarah laughed after that one of the hufflepuff prefects pulled out a guitar and started strumming a few chords i didntreally want to sing along but he was playing old celestina warbeck songs and you couldntlisten to a cauldron full of strong hot love without singing along the headmistress came back before evan and loretta returned by that point we were all curled around the hufflepuffs someone had passed around platters of toast and mugs of tea and we were all munching contentedly chatter had mostly hushed and even the guitar had slowed to a soft sort of absent minded strumming lights out in ten minutes she told us all softly and then waved her wand and conjured a couple hundred mummy bags i grabbed the nearest one and crawled inside i wasntsurprised to see cameron and marissa crawling over to us dragging sleeping bags but i was very surprised when pernella followed them and laid out her bag next to mine hi she said quietly hi i answered unable to keep from grinning who up for sneaking up to see evan cameron hissed cameron marissa he protested it our duty as his friends to to sneak out and get ourselves in detention she finished for him no you moron go to sleep i ll sit up for evan and loretta us too pernella said you have no spirit of adventure cameron accused us but he curled up in his mummy bag just the same i lay down as vector turned off the lights the only people still standing were a few prefects and one or two professors everyone else was in bed night i whispered night cameron and marissa muttered back to me pernella didntsay anything but after a moment she turned over on her side put her glasses between us and took my hand for a minute i was too surprised to do anything but then i squeezed it good night pernella i said very softly sweet dreams she whispered back ooooooo i woke up once or twice during the night to stare up at the stars in the great hall pernella had pulled free of my hand during the night she was i discovered a restless sleeper and the room was very quiet and dark i sat up once and looked around for evan but it was too shadowy to see anything and after a moment a prefect shone her wand in my face and hissed for me to get back to sleep when i woke up again it was morning small tables had been set up around the room in a big open square and i could smell breakfast i jumped up my sleeping bag disappeared as soon as i did and went to find a seat the tables were only half full plenty of students the older ones especially were still sleeping i saw alicia sitting down and next to her evan evan i cried and dashed over to him hullo lydia he said smiling a little letta still sleeping have some toast i had no idea why he thought i cared about loretta but i sat down anyway and helped myself to some bread and jam when did they let you go a couple hours before sunrise evan said rolling his eyes protective escort and all but are you all right and all i asked did they find them no evan answered they think it was a false alarm a false alarm i repeated who would do that maybe someone just made a mistake alicia suggested anyway they ve cancelled classes for the morning really i asked taking another slice of toast and grabbing some eggs why probably the teachers are too tired she said dontlook a gift horse in the mouth right right i said thank merlin hey can we leave and get dressed or anything no evan said and you cantgo to the loo without a prefect the professors are all doing something debriefing maybe yeah or sleeping alicia said with a laugh or that he agreed let talk about something else though how your potions n e w t going lydia it fantastic and amazing i told him and brilliant and fun i playing with antidotes now only you would say playing and talk about antidotes alicia said how about we talk about something that doesntinvolve classes or azkaban we spent the rest of the morning talking about alicia sister friend cat who was having kittens it was pointlessly inane but i didntthink any of us really cared we were still waiting to see whether or not evan parents had been caught it was past one thirty by the time the professors returned there were no aurors with them and they all looked extremely tired students please professor vector called and everyone immediately hushed i know it been an exciting night for everyone and a lazy morning but please calm down for a moment as i sure you ve all guessed the rookwoods were not to the best of our knowledge here last night they were but that was when i stopped listening owls had been flying into the great hall for several minutes the delayed mail of course but there were about a hundred official daily prophet owls one of them dropped a rolled up newspaper onto the table next to me for sarah i peered over her shoulder as she opened it escaped death eaters caught at denmark border aurors still mystified read the front page headline the article began aurors are set to return julian and rachel rookwood to azkaban fortress where they will receive the dementor kiss the kiss is standard punishment for attempted escape i reached over to take evan hand it seemed like a lot for him to have to take in from an article in the paper his parents had never had any intention of coming for him and now they were going to have their souls sucked out i thought personally that they should have told evan before this he shouldnthave had to find out through a bloody newspaper evan pulled his hand away from mine as soon as i d found it but i wasntsure he even realized he was doing it he was totally engrossed in the paper he probably hadnteven noticed that everyone had stopped eating to look at him i guessed that the headmistress had already told everyone that the rookwoods had been caught i glared at her she should have told evan first in private where he would have time to digest everything and get his emotions under control i tried to catch professor snape eye but he seemed to be intent on watching evan it didntreally matter i knew he agreed with me oooooo i didntpay any attention during any of my afternoon classes there didntseem to be much of a point to them i spent all my time watching evan he of course watched each professor intently and took meticulous notes sometimes i just didntunderstand him i managed finally to corner evan after dinner in a deserted corridor well deserted except for the portraits i ignored them with as much dignity as i could and hoped evan would do the same evan i started hesitantly can we talk sure he said easily what wrong i thought you might be i told him honestly er not wrong exactly but you know feeling bad evan turned to me looking a little surprised why would i feel bad they got caught well they got caught in denmark i pointed out so they werentactually you know ever coming here and i thought you know that that might be hard evan blinked a couple of times before he answered me why he asked finally i dontfeel like they ve abandoned me like like other people might and can you imagine anything worse than having them actually coming here well no i admitted but i still didntsee how he could feel good about the fact that his parents had broken out of prison and run away from him even if they were evil murderous death eaters they were still his parents and they were still about to get their souls sucked out but evan didnteven seem to care but dontyou i mean i know that you re glad they ve been caught and everything and you should be but arentyou more confused than that evan shook his head it not like with you and your parents he said and then he had the grace to look at the floor and scuff his shoes along the stones for a moment i mean they deserve it you know for what they did to letta parents and for joining with voldemort in the first place i dontcare that they re getting the kiss i glad they re getting the kiss they deserve it all death eaters do i shivered wasntprofessor snape a death eater evan stopped for a moment and considered this he was on our side he said finally but even if he wasn t i said slowly i mean if he had been you know evil then do you think the kiss would be a good idea well yeah evan said and his tone implied that it should be obvious because i started slowly i dontthink it is because it sucks out your soul that the point evan said it the absolute worst punishment for the absolute worst crimes but your memory is part of your soul i argued that means that you d be punished for the rest of your life and you would never understand why because you wouldnthave any memory of what you d done or what had happened to you and what if they re wrong and they get someone who wasnta death eater he frowned for a moment i thought maybe i had convinced him but then he just shook his head they re death eaters they deserve it he said right i said i didntthink evan was right but i didntknow how to argue my side any better than i had maybe professor trent could bring this up in class anyway have people been giving you crap about it no more than they had been evan said it definitely helped that we all got the news at the same time yeah i agreed that was awful i thought they should have taken you aside and told you first no i was being serious i mean he said it was better that they told me in front of everyone so that everyone could see you know that i hate them but wouldntit have been better to have gotten the news in private i asked that what i would have wanted and i found out about my parents in the great hall lydia no one knew about your parents he said people still dontknow about your parents it different with me everyone knows so everyone has to see that i dontsupport them i thought about this for a minute in some ways his opinions made sense of course he wouldntwant people to think he was pro death eater but i couldntimagine having to keep such a public profile about family things which were supposed to be private everyone was going to look at evan and see the child of two soulless death eaters and they were either going to think he was just like them which would be awful or that he didntcare that his parents were having their souls destroyed which might be even worse and everyone was going to know that his parents were the kind of parents who would break out of azkaban and not even try to find their son oh i said finally not entirely truthfully i guess that makes sense evan shrugged it not the same for me or for letta as it is for you lydia he repeated you re the only victim of your parents actions and they were just in family i guess it not like that for letta and me i guess i get that i answered i still thought they shouldnthave let him find out from a newspaper though oooooooo a n so if you like the summary at the top please tell me and i ll continue to write them otherwise tell me and i ll uh not write them this chapter was edited by the amazing and fantastic brood saint who did it even though sick and under lots of school related stress so you should all love her to pieces kind of a creepy expression actually for those of you waiting on harry and especially lyra fear not they are coming lyra especially is coming with a vengeance in the next few chapters i would promise not to take so long but as that never seems to work i just swear i will work harder as always constructive criticism is love and thank you all so much for sticking with me so far previously on a slytherin in red and gold as lydia worried that lyra was trying to ferret out her sexuality she lydia was distracted by the sight of pernella with a boy in the midst of trying to repair their relationship both girls were attacked and lydia landed in the hospital wing she woke up to a crowd of friends and the news that the whole school now knew she was a lesbian in all the commotion pernella managed to slip lydia a break up letter chapter forty four on a muddy spring day i spent the rest of the week dodging rumors it seemed like the entire school was staring at me like i had three heads or six arms or something even worse they were whispering zach offered to start hexing people but he couldnthex the whole school charles mcallister on the other hand had been in and out of the hospital wing all week meg wrote back explaining that she didntthink lyra had been trying to out me at all her letter also mentioned that between sneaking out at night to go for midnight broomstick rides and studying for exams she hadntgotten any sleep obviously the stress was causing her brain to melt a little bit and anyway i liked meg i liked her frank letters and her crazy stories and the weird way american wizards thought so i didnthold her mistake against her but the biggest surprise came on thursday at breakfast when harry owl landed on the back of my chair ate half my toast and gave me a letter that read dear lydia i heard you got into a duel and landed in the hospital wing i think we need to talk how does saturday morning around eleven sound i ll take you out for lunch dontworry i ve already cleared it with the headmistress just meet me at the main entrance love harry ps if saturday morning doesntwork i ll come up tonight for dinner i didntknow what to say but i knew that more time was always better i scribbled a quick note that saturday was fine and sent it off with the owl who took the rest of my toast for the road and then i sat and thought for a while i had no idea how he d found out about the fight who he d heard it from or how much he knew if all he d heard was that i had been in a duel i could just tell him that someone had said something mean about muggle borns or professor granger or something harry had been in so many fights when he was in school that i didntthink he would scold me if i had a good reason on the other hand what if someone had told him i was a lesbian i couldntpretend that wasnttrue it was all over school anyone could confirm it but why would anyone tell him about that unless it was lyra maybe since she had failed to out me in the library she d told harry but then why would she even bother i was already outed to the entire school there was no reason for her to tell harry too but in that case who else would have told him teddy teddy wasnta snitch and he would have made a point to talk to me beforehand anyway well i d have to ask lyra that was all then i could find out how much harry knew and work from there and while i was at it i could borrow her gryffindor robes then harry and i could have a short conversation about how my house principles had caused me to fight against injustice or something what up cameron asked poking at me you look like a cat who just gotten into the cream i jumped oh no nothing harry coming for lunch saturday that all really cameron asked seriously can i meet him cameron no i mean it do you have any idea how much an autographed photo of him would go for there probably a first year puff who d pay galleons for it look i said quietly he still doesntknow i a slytherin and i not planning on telling him so we re going to have a nice lunch in hogsmeade and i not going to bring him to hogwarts because people would probably figure something was up if i was wearing the wrong robes cameron laughed i hate to break it to you he said but i sure he already figured out you re lying about something maybe i said but i d like to make sure he figures out as little as possible anyway cameron i ve got to go pomfrey wants to see me before class and i have to finish my charms essay right cameron answered you go ahead i ll just finish breakfast see you in class uh huh i said as i grabbed my bag and my letter and hurried out of the dining hall madam pomfrey had said this was a routine follow up whatever that meant i didntthink it was actually necessary though i felt fine i explained all that to her as soon as i got to the hospital wing but pomfrey insisted on a quick set of diagnostic spells anyway are you sure you re feeling quite all right she asked when she was finally finished and miss carmichael if there is anything anything you need to ask someone about you should feel free to ask me thanks madam pomfrey i told her but i fine really and i really have to go finish an essay of course she said and let me go oooooo classes that morning were mostly focused on our upcoming exams three months is not a lot of time professor granger kept reminding us and i did my best to take notes i had spent so much time thinking about potions that i was starting to fall behind in the rest of my classes and the past weekend hadnthelped any professor snape never asked about the rest of my classes but i knew he wanted me to do well i wanted me to do well and i would need good marks in everything not just potions i couldntspend the rest of my life working as a maid at an inn after all in the afternoon i went for a walk along the outskirts of the forest i wasntdaft enough to go into it i was still thinking about what maddison had said the week before about being out as a slytherin i still didntagree with her that i had any obligation to anyone to be open about anything but at the same time i wondered i was lying about being a slytherin not outright but by omission and i was only telling the truth about being gay to people at hogwarts and only because someone else had told them first but then it wasntanyone else business and what if harry was angry about my house or my sexuality what if sonia and matthew realized i was gay and didntwant me around anymore it wasntas easy as just coming out about things maddison didntknow what she was talking about for a moment i wondered what would have happened to me if sarah and jess hadntcome out if i hadnthad known there were actual lesbians out there would i have ever figured out about myself and if i had would i have known it was okay but they were older they were already comfortable with themselves and they didnthave as much to lose and i owed them for coming out i didntowe future generations or harry any more than they had owed me with that in mind i started to think about how much i could tell harry at all costs i had to keep my family situation quiet i wanted to keep quiet about slytherin and the whole gay thing too but if it came to that it would be better to throw him off the scent of my family stupidity by admitting the rest of it and if he couldnthandle it it would just be easier to keep my summer plans secret hey lydia i turned around lyra was dashing towards me her cloak flapping behind her lydia hold up a minute i stopped and waved it was nice to see her even if i was still angry that she d gone and written to harry about me lyra waved back at me and forced herself into a sprint she was still dressed for quidditch practice and her robes were covered in mud her cloak was the only clean thing about her and it was getting progressively more mud splattered as she ran hi she said again when she got closer did you come to spy on us no i said kind of defensively i hadntknown the gryffindors were playing if i had i might have gone to watch not to spy though you know i wouldntknow what to report if i did i d say something like the gryffindors were practicing things where they flew around after that ball which one is it the reddish one lyra giggled you re hopeless she said come visit me for easter hols i ll teach you quidditch no thank you i said although if i was going to be honest i wouldntmind flying with her again if she was going to hold me and if we didntgo too far above the ground but that was stupid because she was straight and because i had just broken up with pernella and that was not an experience i ever wanted repeat lydia lyra was saying you ve got that faraway look on your face again focus i am i said i dontwant to fly though you can get killed doing that seriously lydia who do you know that ever died flying she asked rolling her eyes she was sort of exaggerating all her movements and talking a little too loudly it was like she was acting or something i looked around to make sure there werenthidden cameras well there have probably been plenty and not just in quidditch matches either just ordinary people who died struck by lightning probably i dontthink you can die like that she told me doubtfully dontyou have to be grounded uh maybe i said i didntknow much about death by lightning oh hey i got a letter from harry you didn t write to him or anything did you yeah i write to him sometimes she answered but i didntwrite to him about you if that what you mean i figured you know your sexuality your coming out your choice why i nodded at her answer she wouldntlie outright he sent me a note he wants to meet here i said digging it out of my pocket i heard you got into a duel i think we need to talk she read that sounds kind of ominous it sounds like someone wrote to him i agreed well it wasntme she said firmly i mean i think you should talk to him and i glad someone finally written to him but it wasntme i promised i wouldn t i know i said sitting down on a piece of dryish grass and motioning for her to sit next to me it just someone did and i dontreally i d like to know where i stand before i talk to him you know lyra sighed crossing her legs in front of her and leaning back on her hands well maybe it was a professor she said because i didntand teddy wouldntthink to so maybe it was a professor like aunt hermione or something maybe i agreed what do you think she d have told him lyra shrugged hell if i know that you got into a fight he got into fights with dark wizards every year he was at school i protested he wouldntbother coming down just for a fight no he knows something else well maybe he wants to make sure you re all right i nodded hey can i borrow your robes why what wrong with yours nothing except that they say slytherin on the front i said that not a conversation i want to get into lyra frowned at me and picked at the grass well she said here the thing i promised you i wouldnttell anyone and i haventtold anyone but i still think you should tell harry because he your godfather and he not he not mean or anything lydia you know that and i think you shouldnthave to work in a pub all the time or spend all your christmases in the dungeons lyra i interrupted i like the dungeons and i like the leaky cauldron but that not the point she insisted christmas is a time for family and summer is a time to relax and you dontget to do either because your parents are so stupid and i i can keep your secret for you but i canthelp you lie lydia i think you need to tell him especially now that you re outed you need a grownup on your side i have lots of grownups on my side not family she protested i sorry lydia but i canthelp you on this one and and if you try to borrow robes from someone else i ll tell him myself lyra i gasped out you wouldn t i will so she said i ve been patient and supportive but i really dontlike what you re doing i really think you need to go to an adult you can get angry if you want but it more important that you re okay she folded her arms it none of your business what i tell harry i told her huffily i thought you were my friend i am you dolt that why i forcing you to do the right thing what happens if you get sick or something and there no one to call or if you need a parent slash guardian to sign something nothing come up so far i said that doesntmean nothing will lyra said something horrible might happen or or what happens if you get hurt getting back to the leaky cauldron this summer they might not realize they should report you missing and mungo wontknow who you are even assuming someone gets you there and no one else will know you re lying in a ditch somewhere there arentany ditches i protested but i couldntthink of anything better to say lyra come on no she said no i won t what if something bad happened to you here and your parents didntcome or if they did come you d want a grownup who actually cared wouldntyou and dontsay snape cares because he a professor and doesntcount i wasntgoing to i said even though i had been thinking it snape did care anyway i ll take my chances no way lyra said the whole point of having friends around is to stop you from taking stupid chances look you tell harry and if he stupid about it i ll yell at him and you can come live with me okay she put an arm around my shoulder come on say yes i was about to argue but at that moment teddy appeared on the horizon and ran over to us waving madly hi he said how my favorite cousin and the most awesome beater ever hi teddy we chorused he grinned and collapsed onto the ground between us moving lyra arm off my shoulder and onto his glad i ran into you he said i ve been wanting to have a talk with you for days lydia great i thought what about lyra asked for me she was frowning anyway lydia and i were talking first teddy rolled his eyes yeah but you re girls he said you d talk forever if you could we both opened our mouths to protest this but teddy grinned kidding he said seriously though can i talk to you sure i said i mean i guess er alone he asked looking pointedly at lyra she rolled her eyes at me but stood up yeah sure whatever she said catch you later lydia sure i said i have to meet with professor snape tonight after dinner but if you re there early we could talk awesome she said bye ted teddy waved at her before collapsing onto his back on the ground and sighing heavily isntit a beautiful day not really i told him dubiously it muddy and wet and it still kind of cold nonsense teddy said it spring there are flowers er in the greenhouses one of them tried to eat me in class sprout said she despaired of me and i was going to drive her into an early retirement that d be kind of depressing i said i mean i like professor sprout she nice and she knows what she talking about professor snape says she one of the best herbologists in europe he says we re lucky to have her you know it kind of creepy the way you repeat whatever snape says teddy said with a frown you dontcatch me repeating things teachers say that because you keep forcing them into early retirement i pointed out i felt too lazy to argue and it was pointless to argue with a gryffindor about professor snape anyway was that what you wanted to talk about no teddy said i wanted to tell you that i am fully supportive of your being gay thanks ted and i wanted to say that you should feel free to tell me before you start dating anyone so that i can make sure they re a good person and not someone who going to turn out to be weird or break your heart or anything and also then i can keep an eye on you so if you get attacked in the library again i can hex them first i looked at teddy with some surprise he d never really seemed to be the type to try to play the protective older brother especially not with me even so it was nice to have his support of course there was no way on earth i was going to let him interrogate my dates no one would ever want to go out with me if he did that i ll let you know if it anyone important i compromised but you ll have to be nice to her i always nice teddy said but it my job to look out for you like i looking out for victoire too and i ll look out for harry kids when they re old enough to need looking out for otherwise you all might wind up dating the wrong people i raised my eyebrows at him whatever teddy i dontknow why you think you ll be more intimidating than harry anyway he saved the wizarding world from evil and you canteven pick a hair color then there no reason not to let me talk to your girlfriends is there maybe i answered come on let go inside i told lyra i d meet her for dinner teddy frowned as he sat up brushing the mud from his robes but followed me inside without protest ooooo a n as usual nothing is mine there is no profit please dontsue this was beta d by the lovely ill ame she deserves thanks and praise and cookies i fail at life for taking so long to update but it the summer now and i ll be writing all summer so hopefully updates will be much faster you ll see harry next chapter whee which i know a bunch of you have been looking forward to and there plenty of lydia lyra interaction after that i know i haventbeen individually responding to reviews but please believe i appreciate them all and dance around like a maniac whenever i get them and i will reply to each of them um as soon as i get the chance summer means time right thank you all for reading this far guys previously on asirag you may or may not remember that lydia was recently outed in a terrific fight in the library and then she was dumped by pernella via a letter and got an owl from harry saying they should talk lydia attempt to confide in lyra ended as usual in lyra telling her to just come clean and lyra was left to find another way to keep her secrets safe chapter forty five harry friday passed by much too quickly i spent most of it agonizing over harry although even that couldntstop me from noticing that it was finally warm and sunny like a proper spring but then of course it started raining friday night and cameron and i had to sprint back to the castle through the drops saturday morning dawned cold and grey and worse and worse my alarm never went off and the clock was striking quarter til eleven when i finally woke up i d meant to scrounge around for different robes in the morning before i met with harry but that was clearly not going to work instead i was going to have to run just to meet him on time bloody hell i muttered jumping out of bed and running into the bathroom i brushed my teeth and my hair and washed my face in approximately thirty seconds and then i sprinted back into my room to throw on a marginally clean set of robes i hopped around for a couple minutes trying to find a pair of socks why is it that socks are always gone the moment someone really needs them so by the time i laced up my shoes and grabbed my cloak it was three minutes to eleven i was going to be obviously a slytherin and i was going to be late that was when my eyes landed on the bottle of felix felicis lying nearly buried amidst a stack of overdue library books i grinned if there was ever a perfect time to use the potion it was now enough good luck would fix everything i reached for the bottle uncorked it and downed it almost immediately the potion started to work i felt lighter practically weightless it felt like i could do anything if i jumped from gryffindor tower i was pretty sure i would float suddenly it didntmatter about the robes i had a good feeling about slytherin robes i had a good feeling about slytherin i made my way to the main gates i wasntworried about rushing or being late i knew the felix felicis would take care of that no one stopped me in the halls either to ask where i was going peeves who usually haunted the slytherin corridor was missing i got to the gates just as harry walked into sight he was dressed in muggle trousers but he had a cloak on too i wouldnthave recognized him that far away but the potion recognized him for me somehow i just knew it was him and i knew i should run to meet him hullo harry i called when i was a bit closer how are ginny and james and lily and al they re doing just fine harry said giving me a one armed hug harry never seemed comfortable with hugging people but i got the feeling he forced himself i guessed he thought kids needed physical contact or something how are you doing everything great i told him brightly at the moment it didnteven seem like a lie the felix felicis made the whole world ten times better harry looked a little skeptical hermione says you ve been getting into fights ha i thought it had been professor granger all along not really i said as we started walking it was just the one fight and i didntstart it or anything people were always picking fights with you in school werentthey yes he agreed slowly but i dontthink it was quite the same thing i wondered not for the first time just what harry had been like as a student i was pretty sure he hadntbeen such a stickler for the rules back then sure it was i argued he was just being stupid can we get going though i starving harry laughed and we walked a little more quickly down the path that led to hogsmeade but what was the fight about he asked after a few minutes i took a moment to think if professor granger had told him there was a fight she might have also told him what the fight was about there was no guarantee she would have heard the right rumors but if she d been listening to her students then she would probably have heard people talking about how i was gay i didntwant to tell harry the truth especially if he didntknow but if professor granger had told him already i couldntafford to lie he d never believe anything else i said but i had a good feeling about telling him i took a deep breath and said it was like this there this ravenclaw prefect mcallister and he a total idiot and he saw me kissing my girlfriend actually my ex girlfriend because she dumped me the next day and started hexing us so i hexed him back and then he hit me and i blacked out and woke up in the hospital wing i said it all rather quickly so he wouldnthave time to interrupt me are you all right he asked i fine i said i was just kind of shaken up pomfrey fixed everything i didntknow you were gay he remarked after a pause has anyone else been hassling you about it not really i said apart from mcallister everyone been nice well that wasnttotally true alicia hadntbeen very nice about it at all but i didntwant to go into that i dontthink hogwarts was a very nice place to be open when i was there he said but by that time we had reached hogsmeade so i didnthave to say answer him as we made our way to the three broomsticks found a table and ordered pot pie and butterbeer for both of us i was halfway through my butterbeer before he mentioned it again do your parents know i shook my head i haventtold them or anything do you need anything someone to talk to or something no it fine i said i talk to the other people in my house and it fine it really not a big deal harry he frowned like he was about to say something else and i had a feeling it would be a good idea to distract him you haventreally told me how james and al and lily are i said and what has ginny been up to lyra said you were all going to go to a quidditch game harry face cleared they re all doing wonderfully he said lily started taking violin lessons last month she planning on becoming a virtuoso and jamie just got his first broom we re going to take all the kids to the harpies game over easter we d have invited you but we all know how you feel about quidditch yeah i dontsee the point i agreed is ginny doing okay she fine he said with a smile harry always smiled when he talked about his wife she still writing ginny was a sportswriter for the quibbler and i think she ll be up for a promotion soon we talked about his family for a while longer it seemed like the felix felicis made him steer clear of my family entirely and then about teddy and whether he was going to be thrown out of school before he managed to finish his latest escapade had involved a night in the forbidden forest because he wanted to see what would happen we were nearly finished with dessert when i started to feel sort of deflated and sad i could tell the potion had started to wear off but luckily there was enough of it left to convince harry we should be heading back i told him i had to write an essay and he agreed to catch a carriage instead of walking i was nearly inside the castle doors when he said oh lydia yeah harry i asked with a sinking feeling what this hermione tells me about you being a slytherin i cantbelieve i d forgotten about it especially since you ve got a snake on your robes i knew for sure the potion had worn off then but i tried to make the best of the situation well yeah i said didnti tell you first year no harry said you left that part out oh i said feigning innocence i guess it slipped my mind harry frowned and mussed his hair you didntleave it out because you were afraid of what i d say did you no i said not really maybe a little bit lydia he said sounding frustrated whatever problems i had with slytherin when i was here that was fifteen years ago i know i said i guess was i just worried and then there didntseem to be a good way to slip it in later well i wish you had said something earlier snape not giving you a hard time is he no he been really great i said i ll write to you about it but i really have to finish that essay of course you do he said i d nearly forgotten well go on then send me a letter tonight he hesitated a moment there nothing else is there i not going to get a letter from hermione telling me you ve been caught raising dragons in the dungeons or something no i lied there nothing else sorry for not letting you know about all this sooner i suppose i can see why you left it out he finally conceded go write your essay then he pulled me into a tight hug and i remembered to thank him for lunch before making a quick escape back to my rooms it hadntgone as well as i d hoped even with the potion he d still found out too much but it seemed like he d already heard everything from professor granger at any rate there was no worry about her telling him about my parents professor snape was the only one of the staff who knew and even then i was pretty sure he had only guessed i d certainly never told him outright ooooo well lyra asked just before dinner how did it go it was fine i said professor granger had told him about about the fight and me being a slytherin and stuff but i don t he didntmind what did he say about your parents she demanded is he going to go hex them for being terrible people oh i said i didnttell him that part lydia she groaned deflating a bit why not he d have fixed everything i guess i said but i dontreally want him to know and i don t i guess i dontreally want him to fix everything either because if he made my parents i mean i wouldntwant to go back with them i like living at the leaky cauldron and i managing it all myself the problem was all tangled up in my mind but i knew for certain that telling harry would only make things worse it would make him feel sorry for me and he would insist on returning me home a place i hadnteven seen in three years or making me come to live with him or grandmother i knew they wouldntmean it like that but i would feel like someone poor unwanted relation it was different for teddy his parents had died bravely in the final battle of the war everyone knew they would have wanted to keep him if they d lived i still dontthink it a good idea lyra said i wish you d just tell him already so i could stop worrying so much and teddy worried too he going to guess you ve been disowned at some point and he ll be really hurt you didntsay anything the thought made me anxious i didntwant teddy to be angry with me or to think i didnttrust him but there was no way he d keep quiet about it that why i not going to tell him i said so he wontbe angry fine she said in irritation i guess it your call just if you change your mind i shot her a smile i ll tell you if i do promise but it time for dinner we dontwant to be late yeah guess not she said she squeezed my shoulder once before we went into the great hall it made my stomach do a weird sort of flip my stomach had been doing a lot of those around lyra lately it was actually really frustrating it wasntfair that i had a crush on a straight person although since there were only three other lesbians at hogwarts that was almost inevitable i was still thinking about it when i slid into a seat next to evan for a moment i considered asking his advice but then i couldntfigure out how to explain the situation he d only known for a few days that didntseem like enough time for him to have gotten used to me you all right he asked stuff go okay with your godfather yeah it was better than i thought it would be i said what d you do all day essay for trent he said and then some herbology with letta she had practical work in the greenhouse would you mind giving us a hand later actually i dontremember much of what sprout taught us last year yeah that fine i said i just have to write a letter tonight the rest of it can wait until tomorrow excellent evan said here have some pie we spent the rest of dinner helping to decide an argument between cameron and aaron over who had the most cunning plan for skipping out on exams in june so i was able to put the letter to harry out of my mind ooooo i met letta and evan in greenhouse three at eight thirty after an hour spent trying to finish my letter letta was supposed to be weeding a patch of tickling lilies i gathered that her class had been giggling too much to get anything done so sprout had given them tonight to finish rest of it instead of detention she didntmention why there werentany others there but she and evan werenthaving much luck i saw at once what the problem was here i said you re letting them get the upper hand you have to tickle them first or they ll get you i demonstrated grabbing the nearest stem with one hand and tickling the petals with the other then you can let go at the bottom and use that hand for the weeding oh so that what it was evan said we couldntquite get it the three of us worked steadily once she got the hang of it letta was actually pretty good she had just needed someone to show her how to do it again evan would have been better if he d been able to keep his eyes on the plants instead of her i wondered if he was always this obvious or if it was just that they were practically alone had she figured it out yet we were finished in forty five minutes or so evan said he wanted to walk letta back to her common room and i needed to go to the owlery so we parted ways just outside the greenhouse door perseus cooed as i walked in hey perce i called and he flew to my shoulder and nipped gently at my ear can you take a letter to harry for me it important perseus walked down my left arm to my wrist something which rather hurt so i could tie the letter around his leg it had taken me a great deal of time to write but i was proud of the results i scanned it once more before i folded it up and tied it on straight to harry i told him perseus clucked his beak and flew off dear harry i had written i think you re right that i was too scared to tell you i shouldnthave been but i was scared at first and then it seemed like it was too late to mention it because i would look like an idiot for never having said so before i didntmean to lie exactly but i guess i hoped you would read something else into it i meant what i said about professor snape being great i guess he doesntlike gryffindors much but he takes care of slytherin really well he actually been helping me out a lot with potions he wants me to sit my newt this june i feel pretty good about it i know it really unusual for a third year but i really like potions i ll have to spend all easter hols studying though i guess i wish professor granger hadntwritten to you but i glad too it a bit of a relief not to be keeping secrets from you anymore say hi to everyone for me love lydia it was true it was entirely true the only lies were in what i had left out part of me felt bad for doing that when harry trusted me but a bigger part of me felt like i was protecting what i had if harry knew the truth he would try to be a grownup and be in charge and i didntwant a grownup to take charge i was in charge oooooooooooooooooo a n so i know i know it been a year i sorry guys i dontknow why i so bad at this college is hard writing harry is hard but i very much hoping to get this fic back up and running so we ll see as per usual i dontown anything ill ame betad this for me instead of writing her final paper and she also did helpful things like email me and tell me to get writing so you should all thank her i also wanted to say thank you to the people who have reviewed or pmed me in the last few months and told me they were still waiting for an update i dontthink i d have gotten this written if i hadntknown there were still people waiting for it you guys are the best as always feedback is love chapter five a midnight oath avery i yelled across the corridor what do you want somewhere in the last two months we had fallen into the older slytherin habit of only using first name when alone we were the only house to do so your hand in marriage and half your father kingdom would be excellent but i ll settle for taking you to the feast tonight dontbe ridiculous avery no one does that for the halloween feast we could hey carmichael alicia called to me catching up with us is he asking you to go with him to the feast tonight he already asked me i guess whisp next john glared at us someday he muttered you ll regret turning me down why alicia asked him are you going to be the next malfoy or something well since the current heir seems to see no reason to marry i was about to form a reply when alicia murmured we ve got company let get out of here we turned to see andrew bagnold smirking at us ready for tonight he asked john lightly excuse me well halloween was the night they arrested your father wasntit threw him in azkaban shut up shouldntyou be in mourning plotting revenge what kind of a son are you anyway shut the hell up bagnold john muttered warningly taking a step towards the gryffindor avery don t alicia cried grabbing his arm what travers you re trying to stop him wasntyour family in it too shouldntthe two of you be planning to kill us all and bring back you with a shout john threw himself on bagnold and alicia followed suit four or five gryffindors jumped onto them and i joined the fray just as cameron aaron and adrian came running i dontremember much of the fight just that it was chaotic when professor vector finally waded in and pulled us apart it seemed as though all the first years in both houses had joined in what she asked us furiously is the meaning of this then turning to a nearby hufflepuff who started this him professor she said pointing to john he jumped on andrew he called m john broke in nursing a split lip that twenty points for starting a brawl mr avery and another ten for inventing excuses and the rest of you her gaze turned to the gryffindors ten points apiece for fighting in the hallways and dontlet me catch you at it again it was a clear dismissal they left presumably to compare battle scars vector gaze fell on us and you i should have thought you would have just a little more of an idea of oh nevermind a hundred points off and detention tonight in my office until eleven we stared at her that not fair you only maddison started miss whisp i ll take another fifty now all of you upstairs now silent we followed her to her office on the third floor she left us with several platters of sandwiches and pitchers of pumpkin juice and we arranged ourselves on the carpeted floor that was so unfair alicia was the first to say it out loud but soon we added our own complaints she didnteven hear our side of it what does she think we just go around beating up gryffindors damn that brat you know he was just talking about your dad right let kill him oy shut up people aaron broke in has this stuff been happening other places too i know they ve been pulling stuff like this in some of my classes maddison nodded briskly crowley never calls on me ever and i know the answers i know our entire astronomy book practically by heart sprout doesntlook at me unless something starts screaming cameron admitted and fawcett never lets me do anything adrian complained it makes sense evan said softly we turned to stare at him it sort of typical after a war people try and find a scapegoat and we re just easiest they probably look at us and see future death eaters or the death eaters that killed their friends and tried to destroy their lives so they act on it especially the ones who couldntdo anything before in the war it like they re getting their revenge now but we didnt do anything alicia objected that not the point he said patiently they dontsee us they see slytherins death eaters killers and they probably tell themselves we deserve it or that they re just trying to stop us or something he shrugged i never said it was right we were silent for a minute digesting this then evan spoke again the only way to stop it is to be better than them they think we re violent we have to be more peaceful than quakers and they think we hate muggles we have to be more accepting than anyone they think we but that stupid cameron broke in nothing we do will change anyone mind i say we just do it if they think we re terrible well then let be terrible what are you saying cam maddison asked sarcastically that we should join vo the dark lord and torture muggles cause that going to get us in azkaban some of us faster than others no i saying we make her life hell i say we make all their lives hell let swear it aaron suggested to him you and i and anyone else who wants to let swear to wreak havoc on the gryffindors on vector and anyone else who deserves it let swear to preserve the name of slytherin forever adrian looked up eyes eerily aglow in the light from the fire it halloween tonight he said the rest of the school at the feast whoever going to swear should do it now how maddison asked you cantjust swear it has to be by something adrian smiled there an oath my father taught me it very very powerful once you swear it you can never break it what is it alicia asked it not like blood or anything right adrian shook his head you have to swear by our line our tradition it the same oath salazar swore when he left hogwarts and promised to always protect us we looked blankly at him only john looked vaguely nervous here he continued i ll swear first then you can follow change it to suit he cleared his throat i swear by the day of my birth and the day of my love death to preserve the house of slytherin forever and to keep it as pure as the blood spilled to form this sacred house and the blood spilled to keep it alive and as pure as the blood running through my veins should my life be taken in the process i shall think of it as an honor if i should break this oath let the day of my birth never dawn and the day of my love death fall before the next new moon all those here remember this oath and hold me to it he looked around at us any oath you swear tonight has more power who next cameron looked at aaron you suggested it let swear together as partners aaron nodded i cool with that you want to start it or do we swear at the same time no you swear whatever you think is right and i ll add to it if i can then we ll both say the oath part aaron looked around at us nervously okay he said i ll start we swear to to wreak havoc on all the gryffindors who jumped us today especially bagnold and to make vector look at us as people actual people and not just slytherins and we promise to make everyone remember us forever he looked at cameron taking a deep breath cameron added we swear also to be like brothers and to never desert each other then he looked back at aaron and they finished the oath together and we swear this all by the the days we were born and the days our loves will die if we should break this oath let the first never come and the second come soon alicia looked at us i want to swear something too go ahead adrian told her she closed her eyes and began i swear to always do anything i can to help the slytherin house and any slytherin who needs it especially the ones in the room with me now i swear this by the day of my birth and of my love death if i break this oath may the former never dawn and the latter come within the next full moon we heard a low boom of thunder and evan jumped to shut the windows i pulled him down again let her office get soaked what did we care john looked at the clock it after ten are we supposed to stay here all night cause i sure not going to we cantjust leave maddison started well why the hell not i asked cutting her off vector probably at the feast who cares about waiting for her it ll probably be half the night before she back well i not leaving fine i said you donthave to wait no john broke in we stick together either everyone stays or everyone goes he looked at the two of us we re slytherins we stick together no matter what got it disclaimer it all mine all of it jkr just saying she owns harry potter sighs i can dream canti a n thanks to my betas vercisisolde ambika san haleth aldea and amelie i love you all please review it makes me feel so loved the mouse that roared you are amazing and wonderful i love it that someone actually following this dances around in her seat chapter six difficult advice maddison i asked slowly as we walked down the stairs to our room several paces behind alicia did that oath make any sense to you i mean the part about not being born if you break it wouldntthat create some sort of time paradox i didntunderstand it either she confessed all i know is that it totally unbreakable i mean even the founders wouldntbreak it does it frighten you yeah a bit just well i thought alicia was a little reckless helping any slytherin indeed someone going to use that against her my reply was cut off when someone called my name from upstairs i d better go maddison i said apologetically turning back the way we d come i found amanda wilkes sitting with eli rosier in the common room a fire crackled ominously in the background lydia please sit down amanda said softly gesturing to a nearby armchair we ve well eli and i wanted to talk to you we re a little worried frankly worried i why carmichael what happened tonight why werentyou at the feast eli asked well bagnold started talking about john father so john got mad and when alicia stopped him from doing anything bagnold insulted her family too so they jumped on him and some other gryffindors came running and so everyone joined in here i stopped to take a deep breath and vector came over and blamed us and made us miss the feast amanda paused to take in my lengthy statement are you all getting a lot of trouble from the gryffindors well mostly bagnold she opened her mouth to say something then stopped and looked helplessly at eli who turned to meet my eyes carmichael you seem to be getting rather close to wood i nodded we re not sure that entirely safe amanda continued slowly she becoming very well very popular with her house lydia i not entirely sure they ll approve of your friendship we dontcare what anyone thinks but carmichael that not really the problem eli elaborated you cantdefend yourself against the older gryffindors to begin with they re bigger than you and they know more and if you re outnumbered then there really nothing you re going to be able to do i not going to to break up with lyra i dontcare what the danger is i told them stubbornly eli threw his hands up in a gesture of surrender you re going to regret this carmichael he told me and then raising his voice called wenlock get over here zach appeared from a dim corner of the common room looking slightly guilty yeah eli you re to tutor carmichael in what i asked angrily in defense against the dark arts eli explained actually in offensive magic really i want her to be able to extract herself from any situation she gets herself into work her hard enough so she has neither the time nor the energy to be friendly with a certain gryffindor beater zach stared at the two prefects in disbelief you want me to convince her to break it off with wood no amanda told him we want you to teach her everything that could come in handy when she gets attacked by angry gryffindors who dontwant their little quidditch prodigy corrupted oh he said nodding wait donti get a say in this i asked in annoyance the three of them didnteven bother to respond but after an awkward moment zach turned to look at me go to bed kid we ll meet here monday night after dinner about seven although annoyed about being referred to as a kid i walked down the staircase to my room and tumbled into bed i was exhausted but even though i had been waiting all evening to finally sleep there was far too much running through my head alicia dangerous promise the glint in adrian eye during our feast vector unfair treatment of us the first quidditch match of the year which was the next day i couldntsleep hogwarts instead of being the carefree or at least exciting life i d expected was slowly turning into an insane nightmare i was frightened for myself for alicia for lyra i was afraid of the unbreakable oaths which had been sworn afraid of the older gryffindor students afraid of being a slytherin and i missed my parents after my mother curt letter i had heard nothing more from them and my casual denial had turned to disbelief and now despair only pride kept me from owling them now pride and perhaps also fear curling up under the down quilt on my bed the slytherin dormitories were beautiful mysterious and frigid i could no longer keep back the tears which had been threatening to fall for weeks i wanted nothing more than to see my mother smile at me and to hear my father boisterous laughter i wanted them to love me again after all what had changed between us i was still their daughter still the same dark haired girl with the same dark eyes their abandonment was like a physical pain somewhere in my chest and that night i cried myself to sleep that night i would have done anything to regain their love when i woke up the next morning i was the only one in our room with a smile i allowed myself to burrow down further underneath the covers saturday mornings were my favorite part of the week when i finally managed to coax myself out of bed sun was streaming in through our window i wasntentirely sure what that meant maddison had assured me that there was a correlation between our weather and what the window showed but i had been unable to figure it out and she refused to tell me well if you arentobservant enough to figure it out on your own then i certainly not going to do the work for you humming softly i rifled through my trunk for a clean set of robes feeling better this morning lass i jumped several feet in the air with a squeak who are you i demanded looking around for the voice my only answer was a laugh and then i behind you lass look up obeying i was relieved to see that the voice came from one of maddison paintings this one showed a rather chipper looking man in plaid robes he was carrying a set of bagpipes grinning he waved at me see i not that frightening now lassie what your name lydia i told him lydia medea carmichael well lydia i the lord byron urquhart friends call me lord byron it a pleasure to meet you likewise i replied and then fell silent i was no stranger to talking paintings there was a portrait of my grandmother at home which no one could get off the wall and she used to lecture me on purity of blood there had also been a shepherdess on the wall above my bed who gave me advice on life and occasionally love see sweetie if he asks you for a dance dontdance too close he ll think it forward i was just not accustomed to my reserved roommate painting suddenly striking up a conversation well miss lydia carmichael what troubling you i looked up at him in surprise lord byron well lass i heard someone crying last night and you re in the closest bed would you like someone to listen to your woes he paused i had three granddaughters myself you know i no stranger to the problems of little girls somehow i doubted that this man was quite used to my particular problems but i desperately wanted to talk to someone so i nodded and sat back down on my bed looking up at the framed canvas it my parents i began after i was sorted into slytherin they wait do you know about the four houses and the sorting why of course the lord byron exclaimed i was one of helga students myself but my sister was one of salazar s we made a great team i was stubborn as all hell and she could smell a conspiracy a mile away he smiled in remembrance oh i said although inwardly i was shocked a hufflepuff and a slytherin in the same family working together and what was all this first name stuff anyway well my parents werentvery happy with my sorting they think slytherin a house for dark wizards you know so they ve disowned me i couldntkeep my voice from shaking as i added i really miss them so that the way of things is it salazar house is full of the wicked dumbly i nodded and he continued they told me hogwarts had changed i just didntrealize it had changed this much he sighed so your parents ve disowned you what kind of ignorant bigoted folk must they be sir well miss lydia carmichael are you evil no wicked dark no sir then your parents should know that if they canttell that their own daughter is a good sweet little girl then they shouldntcall themselves her parents i stared at him but then i wouldnt have parents do you have them now for a long moment i could only gape at him in complete shock then finally no sir i told him and promptly burst into tears oh dontcry dontcry the lord byron exclaimed please dontcry i so sorry terribly sorry please cheer up it not really that bad perhaps they ll come to their senses oh do stop crying he was so comical sounding that i did in fact stop crying sniffing a little i looked back at him i all right now i said trying to smile i think maybe you re right you do he sounded so gratified that i could hardly help grinning yes i think you are if they arentgoing to be my parents i not going to be their daughter and i ve spent far too much time already crying about it i done they can go be their own annoying selves i crossed my arms decisively for emphasis and met lord byron painted eyes he grinned back at me excellent idea and now miss lydia carmichael you had best be going isntthere a quidditch game today i glanced over at the clock which read 12 19 in neon green and under that time to get going dontbe late you re right i shrieked i ve got to go i going to be late the lord byron watched with amusement as i scrambled to get ready and i waved to him as i dashed out the door and toward the kitchens for a quick snack and then to the quidditch pitch to watch the game disclaimer i dontown harry potter hogwarts any of that stuff i do own this fic so please dontsteal it or my muses will come after you be afraid be very afraid a n as always i love my betas vercisisolde ambika san haleth aldea and amelie they re the reason this fic is where it is if you read please review it makes me so happy spoilers for hpb beyond this point you have been warned i ve gone through and edited out dumbledore and earlier chapters will be re uploaded when i remember personally i think snape innocent good not evil and i need him later in the fic so he staying my reasoning for him returning to teach is that someone had to be there for the slytherins and no one else would so snape came back review review review chapter seven a bittersweet love story the wind was chilly but the sky was clear blue and the stands were packed i squeezed in between alicia and evan what going on i asked i thought i was late there some delay evan explained but here they come now the two teams came out from opposite ends of the stadium hufflepuff first the gryffindors sent up a huge cheer as their team came out and i half stood in order to spot lyra we watched the game with enthusiasm although being slytherins we didntcheer for either team commentary was provided by one of the older gryffindors and alicia added her own interpretation in my ear halfway through the game lyra spotted me in the stands and waved turning over in place and knocking a bludger to the side with one hand i was suitably impressed alicia muttered something from behind me but i wasntpaying attention gryffindor won the game two hundred and fifty to eighty and i sent lyra a note with perseus i didntfeel up to battling the hoard of triumphant gryffindors especially with her fellow beater glaring in my direction every few moments lydia alicia hissed at me that night before bed are you insane do you want to get yourself hexed stop being friendly with that gryffindor she popular she on the damn quidditch team their captain is bigger than all three of us combined and he knows more curses than my sister and that saying something maddison sleepily mumbled her assent but i couldntbring myself to care monday morning an unfamiliar raven made its way towards me and landed on the rim of my goblet tasting my pumpkin juice i stared at it in amazement and slowly untied the letter from its leg praying this wasntanother painful letter from my mother lydia i dreadfully sorry not to have managed to see you off at the station or to write before this ginny and i took the kids to greenland to meet up with the weasley granger family you remember them right hermione been looking for old wizarding relic things for the past three months she thought they were in mesopotamia but as it turned out she needed to go to greenland and visit old viking settlements and so everyone went with her we were supposed to be finished with this before your birthday but somehow every question hermione answers seems to lead to a dozen more she confiscated my firebolt because i might go do something stupid like try to fly solo across the northern atlantic and then where would we be and the floo not reliable over water and plus they dontuse it over here hopefully i ll be home before christmas but it seems less and less likely your parents haventowled me which i guess is understandable since it hard to get one to go that far so i have no idea about anything how d your sorting go i remember mine as being one of the scariest moments of my time at hogwarts excluding all the voldemort stuff are you having fun hermione looking over my shoulder at this and she wants me to remind you to study so study lydia but not too hard explore a bit it tons of fun and i d like to hear how many passages you can find watch out for filch though he got it in for the students leif that the raven will stick around for a few days for a letter he needs to rest anyway whistle for him when you want him the first few notes of happy birthday seem to work best just dontload him down with a ton of parchment hope to hear from you soon how the quidditch season going they manage to coax you on a broom yet lots of love harry ps we re enclosing a very late birthday present i hope you like it ginny picked it out for me she said it was high time you had some good jewelry and this is supposed to do something magical but i honestly have no idea what ginny didntexplain and hermione says she doesntknow and the woman we got it from was rather vague i hope the color all right i examined the small parcel before unwrapping it carefully resting in the box was a delicate looking bracelet made of what looked like twisted silver light green stones were set into the silver and at irregular intervals unfamiliar runes were cut into the metal i smirked he hoped the color was all right indeed carmichael alicia asked what is that who sent it to you my smirk turned to a grin as i answered her my godfather harry potter there was a rather long silence broken by one of the second years harry potter is your godfather he screeched at me in a rather un slytherin manner what in hell are you doing here i smiled beginning to see an opportunity i ambitious that why harry understands that after all he was almost a slytherin too after a pause i added he quite proud of me that why he got me this bracelet and i fastened it around my wrist inwardly grinning two hours and the school would know that the boy who lived was apparently happy with a certain slytherin first year monday afternoons were spent in a long double defense against the dark arts class which completely erased my good mood professor rufford was kind but i would occasionally catch him giving us really strange looks part disappointment part pity part horror why did he feel he had a right to judge us anyway yo carmichael one of the older gryffindors yelled from down the hall as i walked towards the door i heard potter sent you some kind of present what the hell for i smirked cause he my godfather i told him trying to sound as innocent as i could he loves me without waiting for an answer i waltzed into the classroom and sat down in the back professor rufford looked out at my class i think it saddened him a little to see us i knew he had been an auror during the war and evan had whispered once after our first lesson that he been one of the aurors who captured his parents after the war i wondered what he thought when he saw evan was he sorry for taking his family away did he think evan would turn out the same did he wonder if he remembered that night take out your essays mister trimble would you collect them for me thank you lad now today we re going to talking a little bit about how to recognize vampires would you all please take out your parchment and quills there was a general groan in response to his words we d spent months taking notes lyra said the gryffindors had practiced a few simple spells but we hadnttaken our wands out yet this year the lesson dragged by i could hear maddison making hissing noises in front of me like she didntapprove i didntblame her i didntapprove either how were we going to learn anything like this by the time rufford let us go my hand was cramping from so much writing i massaged it a little as i followed evan out the door he always seemed to be the first one out lydia someone said as i headed down the hall i turned to see an earnest looking boy with acid green hair my cousin teddy lupin he was a third year gryffindor half werewolf and a metamorphmagus meaning he could transform himself at will and transfiguration was never a problem for him i wished it ran in the family i was hopeless can i talk to you what about cameron snapped stepping in front of me i elbowed him it all right i said quietly he my cousin what going on teddy i he stopped looking pointedly at cameron until he rolled his eyes and backed up to give us some semblance of privacy what going on he asked finally i owled aunt acantha right after you got sorted and she said everything was fine but i ve been watching and she isntowling you are they he hesitated are they angry with you lydia is it the slytherin thing i tugged at my braid they re they re pretty mad teddy mum thinks i evil he frowned maybe the sorting hat just made a mistake i shook my head i dontthink it knows how teddy well he trailed off finally putting an arm around me in an awkward one sided hug d you want me to owl them harry grandmother dontbother they ll get over it and you know my mum ll go ballistic if she thinks we re talking about family stuff in public if you re sure he said doubtfully then his glance falling to cameron and evan he spoke up again you two what are your names they exchanged glances viridian cameron said finally and he rookwood you watch out for her teddy told them and lydia if you need anything me to owl your parents or whatever i know i answered i ll ask he nodded seriously then squeezed my shoulder again before dashing back down the hallway evan and cameron were staring at me what i finally asked he a cousin how evan asked well my mum and his mum were sisters i explained he spends a lot of time with us too since his parents are both dead he a gryffindor cameron sniffed i rolled my eyes i know but we re related and anyway teddy s he not bad you know he doesntcare about me being a slytherin dontbe idiotic evan retorted everyone cares that what idiotic i snapped back and cameron stepped between us chatting nervously until we got back to the common room disclaimer dude guess what jkr just sold me the potterverse for 6 57 now i own them all insert evil laughter and if you believed that there this awesome internet scam going on seriously though if it not jkr it is mine so dontsteal please a n my betas are all amazing i love them and i apologize for the really long delay there really no excuse at all although haleth aldea and i and jem another girl in our dorm have started a fanfiction club at our school so that totally gives me bonus points right please review chapter eight practical lessons after depositing my bookbag on the bed i rifled through my nightstand until i found my stationary box grabbed it and headed upstairs to the common room once there i took out a sheet of creamy parchment with my name embossed at the top and found a bottle of dark blue ink dear harry i began chewing on my quill i thought about what i wanted to say it fine that you couldntsee me off you re forgiven it was all very emotional anyway and i not sure i could have dealt with another bit of advice the train ride was fun and i sat with a really nice girl we stood together at the sorting and you re right it the scariest thing i ve done yet it like having someone inside your mind talking to you knowing everything we have flying every wednesday it the worst class i dontsee why you like it so much harry you re up too high on a stick they re not that reliable you know the first quidditch match was saturday gryffindor won 250 80 arentyou proud the next game against slytherin so we re a little nervous but i sure we ll win we have an awesome team one of my roommates maddison is completely insane she knows everything and she tells you about it and she way overconfident how do you deal with a girl who thinks she better than anyone else more to the point how do you deal with one that is better than anyone else at everything i swear she knows every answer to every question she prickly and she impossible you know what her first words to me were cantyou read isntthat horrible do you have any advice so far defense against the dark arts is boring but i dontmind transfiguration as much i not very good but professor fawcett is nice and she funny too i think potions is the best professor snape is all right and i good at it thanks a ton for the bracelet i dontmind at all about the colors and it gave me an excuse to brag about how you re my godfather i impressed a few people i must say what exactly are you looking for in greenland is it nice across the ocean please write soon lydia medea carmichael i looked over the letter then decided it was perfect and sealed it returning my stationary box to my room i headed to the owlery to look for harry raven standing in the doorway i glanced around without seeing him leif i called tentatively there was no response remembering harry letter i looked furtively around no one else was there quickly i whistled the opening to happy birthday and the raven flew toward me and landed on my shoulder you re a prat i told it quietly making me whistle like that d you know how stupid that makes me feel shaking my head i tied the letter to leif leg and sent him off after dinner i headed back to the slytherin common room to meet zach wenlock i took a seat in one of the leather armchairs and stared into the fire waiting for him the whole situation made me incredibly angry i didntwant to have special tutoring in dark arts or the defense against or whatever i just wanted to be friends with lyra and have it be okay lydia he greeted me quietly i hadntheard him approach and i started whirling around in the chair to look at him zach i replied almost levelly that the first thing then that we ll need to work on you need to be more aware someone a whole mob of someones could come and take you by surprise and there d be the end of our lydia so your first assignment is to tell me without looking how many are in this room i stared at him er there us and a group over in the corner and i dontknow i thought there was someone else near the door as well he shook his head wrong there are sixteen in the room right now eight around the largest table one at the table by the girls staircase three on the seventh year couch two playing chess inside the circle of chairs and us look around count them i did as instructed swiveling around to count the slytherins he was right there were sixteen how d you know awareness lydia is the single most important quality you can possess without it anyone can surprise you attack you but with it you ll know who around you he paused later of course you ll be expected to know who everyone is and how much of a threat they d be in a fight but for now numbers are fine i stared at him what i know these things all slytherins do it how we survive he seemed about to say more for a moment then he stopped well anyway let move on what have you learned in defense this year umm just the general overview you know what dark and what not and we ve covered a few of the easier hexes but that all he frowned no protective spells none at all er no none at all okay then we ll start with that there are a few basic types of protective spells shielding charms cause a magical shield to form around or in front of you blocking or neutralizing anything flung at you then there are blocking spells which are used against a specific spell and produce a beam of light that meets the curse or whatever head on and hopefully overcomes it then of course there are spells that make you invisible or just unnoticeable so you dontget cursed or hexed to begin with got that umm sort of shielding spells stop all spells blocking charms stop single spells head on and then there are ones that make it so people dontnotice you basically yeah now we re going to start with defensive charms which are your basic shielding charms the easiest is protego which creates a barrier to deflect curses or hexes thrown at you say it without your wand protego i said carefully right now try it again but use your wand swish and flick i swished flicked and spoke protego a beam of white light shot towards the wall nice lydia but can you hold it when i hex you ready i nodded holding my wand out ready furnunculus he shouted as i yelled protego my beam of light shot towards him spread in front of me and then collapsed i felt boils break out on my skin ow lydia you have to mean it i did mean it un hex me he looked at me in surprise you mean you cantdo that either have you done any practical lessons yet zach stop it this hurts i heard him sigh heavily the basic spell to end a spell is finite incantatem it will stop most magical effects at least at the level you re dealing with finite incantatem i half screamed wand pointed at myself it worked the boils disappeared and i was left with only faint red marks to show where they had been you call that teaching zach engorgio was all he said in response but this time i was ready protego i retorted and this time the beam of light spread into a shield and then held firm i lowered my wand only after he d lowered his and my shield disappeared see you learned and next time you ll do the same thing and the time after that plus you learned you could perform under pressure and you learned how to un hex yourself now what ve you learned in almost three months of defense well not much really we ve done the line between dark magic and other magic and we ve done typical punishments for dark arts and we ve done a general overview of the types of dark magic defensive magic dark creatures that kind of thing oh and like three essays on why ministry classification and restrictions on dark magic were imperative to our safety i paused didntyou ask me that already that all i nodded no practical lessons not yet he said maybe after christmas holidays did he say why i shrugged ministry rules i think or maybe the headmistress he sighed heavily all right then i wontsay anything when you wind up helpless in the face of danger anyway the next of the three basic defensive charms is the parmae charm it not as easy as protego but it stronger and it ll cover you for longer and against synchronized attacks so in a group fight it invaluable it ll start out as a small roundish shield and then expand to wrap around you the downside is it decreases hearing and sight from outside so you may miss key bits of the attack got all that i think so well then say it he told me in annoyance the parmae charm is stronger than protego and will hold for longer and against coordinated attacks it starts as a small round thing and then expands to encircle the caster but the downside is you wontbe able to tell what going on outside of it and it harder than protego i recited very good the incantation is parma and careful with that last a parma i repeated cautiously that good now try it out parma nothing happened trying not to sound disappointed i asked zach what i d done wrong nothing exactly sometimes it just takes longer to get it going try again he told me parma i tried but again without any result zach this isntworking i can see that he said and i could have sworn he was trying to hide a laugh this isntfunny zach and then he did laugh and i glared at him as he tried to regain his composure sorry lydia i know it not funny it just he stopped laughing again what so funny a girl asked turning an armchair around to face us i could hear zach laughing all the way from my room nothing funny i told her he just being an idiot i am not he told her when he d finally regained calmed down lydia just having some trouble with the parmae charm and well oh never mind sarah would you care to help me show her how this thing ought to work sure she replied holding her wand ready fire at will engorgio he yelled as sarah screamed parma a large round white shield emerged from the tip of her wand growing larger and larger until it had wrapped around her completely zach curse connected with it and stopped after a moment it vaporized and sarah lowered her shield see zach asked me that how to do it then belatedly he added sarah this is lydia carmichael the first year who fallen in with a gryffindor lydia this is sarah portsmouth fifth year pleasure sarah portsmouth said holding out her hand i shook it wordlessly right zach said let try that again lydia we ended the lesson with three charms to prevent fights from starting one to make the caster invisible one to make her inaudible and one to make her seem unimportant it wontwork if they re looking for you zach had warned me i wasntable to perform any of them although to my annoyance sarah portsmouth proved to be a master at all three is she worth it lydia zach asked as i started down the marble stairs is wood worth all this i didntanswer him disclaimer harry potter isntmine neither is sirius or snape or hogwarts a n many many thanks to my betas for editing this chapter i was going to give you all a double update for halloween but it didnthappen actually to be quite truthful my hard drive killed itself and i lost a lot of stuff including all of chapter nine also i taking november for nanowrimo so this is going on the back burner so i can attempt to write 50 000 words in 30 days wish me luck and please send lots of happy thoughts to amelie who is home sick and i love you all please review please it makes me so happy and if there something you think could be better then i ll only know if you tell me chapter nine slytherin against the world the first real blizzard came in late november on a monday afternoon we sat jumpy through professor rufford double defense class what he finally asked mid lecture is distracting you please professor cameron said with a barely concealed grin it snowing he turned to the window and for a moment i saw him smile be that as it may mr viridian you are still in class now can anyone tell me the reasons the ministry regulates dark magic maddison hand shot up professor rufford we ve done this we ve done it more than once she sounded impatient snappy it so we dontall turn into another voldemort and i understand you re worried about that sure but we get it we ve listened we ve written essays on this professor tons of essays and we haventtaken our wands out more than once yet this year i in this class for a reason it all right john broke in we ll all go to macnair house for christmas all right his father can explain it all adrian smirked at professor rufford for a moment i was confused and then i remembered adrian father was a convicted death eater who d somehow escaped an azkaban life sentence i hardly think mr macnair family would appreciate they wontmind adrian interrupted they simply adore having company professor be that as it may professor rufford tried again and i knew he was trying to backtrack trying to remove himself from the suggestion of anti slytherin bias because how could our teacher think we were evil but this time i interrupted him class is over professor the eight of us dashed out without a backwards glance bloody gryffindor supporter you can tell he just waiting for us to go bad john mumbled when we were in the hall he not that bad i protested if it ministry regulations fuck that he said the gryffindorks get to use their wands i followed hi outside where an impromptu snowball fight had started we separated immediately the fight ranging all around the castle pitted girls against boys the girls had taken over the quidditch pitch by the goalposts and a group of sixth years was building a large wall i ducked behind them sending a snowball in the other direction nice shot a girl hufflepuff by her badge congratulated me as it connected with a fourth year boy head i grinned at her and the two of us fought together sending packed snowballs across the field looking around i saw lyra fighting next to a tall slytherin girl alexis and alicia handing perfect snowballs to jillian holmes a gryffindor with coffee colored skin and perfect aim as the bell rang for after lunch classes i decided that i hadntyet had a better day at hogwarts as the older students filed inside grumbling and cursing the first years for their free friday afternoons those remaining pulled together for a few minutes more we were still boys verses girls but then someone turned sides and without even realizing it the fight became slytherins against the world the eight first years plus three older students whose names i didntknow gathered in a frightened clump in the middle of the quidditch pitch i dontunderstand aaron hissed at me this was supposed to just be fun they hate us evan said quietly and i thought he might be about to cry we fought as hard as we could i was startled to find myself thinking of this as a real fight of everyone else even lyra as an enemy and i realized that for the first time i hated them i tried to shield myself but for some reason the charms zach had taught me didnthold ow maddison burst out as an iceball hit her face that hurt of course it did said the tall white blonde girl fighting with us they meant it to damn them to hell added the boy next to her we ve got to get out of this how adrian asked him we re surrounded we have to run john said and hope we get lucky the other boy tall and skinny with shaggy brown hair looked around and then grinned grab the hand of the person next to you kids this is called obscuring your escape route watch closely he raised his wand and muttered something i didntcatch as a snowy tunnel opened in front of us we grabbed hands and dashed after him through the snow i heard yells from around me and ducked my head clutching alicia hand in my left and cameron in my right we reached a side door i d never seen before under cover of the snow tunnel it collapsed as we sprinted inside and the other boy this one well built with sandy hair slammed the door shut right he said you kids go down to the common room i going to get us some drinks nothing alcoholic the girl cried after him we ve got firsties with us we can drink adrian protested you re what eleven twelve last week he bragged mm hm well wait until there something to celebrate kid cause i not holding your hand when you get smashed adrian sulked all the way to the dungeons right the tall boy said when we were all seated around the fire and hot mugs of butterbeer had been handed out let do names i riley curtis seventh year annie hodgeson said the white blonde girl as she leaned against the burly boy legs and fiddled with her hair i a sixth year and a prefect taylor burke sixth year the boy told us aaron trimble cameron viridian adrian macnair maddison whisp alicia travers john avery lydia carmichael evan rookwood annie looked around at us are you all seriously firsties we nodded bloody huge year taylor commented are you all just that cunning death eater parents john explained couldntgo anywhere else looking around i saw adrian alicia and evan nodding well i a vindictive bastard dontknow about you cameron said lightly and i love commotion stealth subtlety aaron added maddison smirked i just that cunning i guess and ambitious and powerful i swallowed i just i want to be amazing unforgettable i want to make things happen riley clapped his hands and came close to cackling looks like i ll be leaving this house in good hands dontyou think annie she raised her mug to the ceiling i salute you all our little first years we were silent and then alicia asked softly is it always like it was outside us against the world annie nodded but it was taylor who spoke they hate us it doesntmatter to them that we arentall dark they dontcare it not fair she protested fair fair kid there no fair in this school not for us it just about survival just about annie put a restraining hand on his knee it ll be christmas soon we can get away from all this then not me cameron muttered parents taylor asked no i live at the ministry orphanage and well they think slytherins and death eaters are the same i cantgo

learning to use it to us he said raising his glass to slytherin to slytherin we echoed and drained our mugs alicia i asked when we were upstairs what your family like just my mum and my sisters and i what about your dad she shrugged he been on the run from the ministry since i can remember was he a death eater i knew escaped death eaters still existed hiding but i d never thought about one having
