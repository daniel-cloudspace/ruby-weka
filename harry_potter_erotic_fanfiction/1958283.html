 chapter 13 halloween and the big meeting harry awoke the morning of halloween in a bit of a mood the quidditch match against slytherin had been postponed due to the whole team coming down with a rare case of food poisoning which harry felt ron had something to do with both he and dean thomas seemed too happy about the whole team getting it so instead harry asked to have a pick up game with hufflepuff which proved to be very useful however harry had one monstrous bruise on his chest seamus was trying to get the hufflepuffs seeker who was tailing harry but just as he hit the bludger harry had seen the snitch and started to go for it this resulted in harry taking the bludger directly in the chest what was amazing is that harry didntfall off his broom but he hadnttold anyone about how bad the bruise looked he slowly pushed himself up on his bed and saw a card lying on his bedside table he didntrecognize the handwriting dear mr harry potter the headmaster wanted me to inform you that tonight after the feast he will ask those to join the cause he wanted to give you advanced notice so you could spread the word to the da to be prepared see you at the meeting sincerely dobby house elf this was what harry needed something to start happening now they could start getting ready for this battle with a renewed energy harry got up and headed for the shower when he left his room he found hermione in the same spot she was sitting in last night and still reading one of sirius books hermione did you go to bed asked harry oh yeah just a couple of minutes after you she said with out looking up from the page she was reading i just got up early so i figured i might as well read more of the book how it going asked harry as he sat down next to her well i learning a lot about the accident magic and how it revolved a lot more around emotions and nature but nothing about love yet she looked right at harry who was staring at her in the strangest way harry you okay yeah sorry about that harry had been watching how the firelight made hermiones hair come alive so let me see what you ve been reading he said hermione scooted closer to him and harry put his arm on the couch to allow himself to get even closer to see the book well you see here they re talking about how at night you can use this incantation to make yourself look like a shadow hermione turned to face harry in mid sentence and as before they were only inches from each other harry sensing the moment slowly reached over and grabbed her hand he rubbed his thumb over her palm as he continued to look into her eyes hermione i was umm well you see i want to ask if maybe the sound of ron door opening caused the two to jump apart before ron could see he slowly walked through the door scratching his head and yawning i starving lets eat said ron as he continued to walk through the portrait without stopping harry and hermione just sat there staring at the portrait closing behind him then they looked at each other and burst in to laughter i swear he could eat a horse and still be hungry laughed hermione no he d just wonder what was for dessert giggled harry he stood and offered his hand to help hermione up after she stood instead of letting go she laced her fingers between his the two walked hand in hand down to breakfast unaware of the people staring at them they both let go of each other as they reached the great hall and sat down across from ron who was stuffing his face with eggs and sausage so i have a confession said ron who was starting to giggle i planted some of fred and george new vendetta vapors in the slytherin locker room one night before they had a practice i knew you had something to do with it let me guess dean thomas helped said harry how d you know gasped dean thomas who was sitting next to ginny you guys both seemed a little too happy about the whole team getting sick teased hermione who then gave harry a smile what are vendetta vapors ron well there these little capsules that you break open leave them hidden in a room for about five minutes then whoever walks in that room for the next hour is going to be very sick the next day that why fred and george named it vendetta vapors so you can get back at someone with out them ever knowing laughed ron as he looked in harry direction harry had the sinking feeling he was going to experience one of these attacks after he and ron talked about hermione blast i forgot my books up stairs i ll see you guys in class ron said as he was getting up from the table harry and hermione continued to eat until luna approached come on you two we re going to be late to julia class said luna harry suddenly remembered the note he had received this morning and pulled luna down to sit with him and hermione i forgot to tell you guys i got a note this morning from dobby dumbledore is going to do it tonight after the feast whispered harry luna spread the word to all the ravenclaw da members to be ready it didnttake long for the word to spread to all the da members and to malfoy and the eight slytherin harry wrote a note and knocked into him after julia class at lunch he had seen draco give him a small nod of understanding harry could tell the teachers were nervous he didntknow how dumbledore was planning on keeping this a secret the students who didntjoin would surely write their parents who would in turn tell voldemort but harry soon forgot all about it the halls of hogwarts were still buzzing with excitement for the feast all the ghosts were in high spirits especially peeves who seemed to keep filch busy all day with one prank after another as dusk approached the grounds were soon lit with the soft lights from inside the pumpkins that hung all around the school it was soon time to head down to the feast but before the three left their common room harry asked for both hermione and ron to bring their order robes but wouldnttell them why all he said was that dumbledore asked him to pass the message along harry was actually planning on taking a picture of the new order of the phoenix which he would make copies of to give to everyone at christmas he had talked with dumbledore and colin to help him plan it earlier in the day the trio entered the great hall to the sweet smell of candy apples chocolates and any other type of candy one could think of the sounds of children laugher filled the hall friends and enemies alike enjoyed the feast that was before them harry took it all in he watched dean thomas try and win back ginny by impressing her with his charm but harry could sense ginny was watching someone else he followed her eye line until he was looking at draco malfoy but for some reason harry wasntsurprised ginny had spent a lot of time over the summer bringing the slytherin food and asking if they needed anything now ron on the other hand might go ballistic if he knew so harry decided to keep this little secret he discovered to himself harry also watched as luna lovegood continued to stare at ron who was trying to ignore her as much as possible then a sad thought entered harry mind some of these people who were now enjoying the feast with out a care in the world would soon be joining the fight and some might not make it through the battle he then felt a nudge from the person next to him you okay asked hermione yeah i fine just thinking about things to come that all harry tried to smile back but he knew hermione would keep pestering him but he was saved by dumbledore standing up to address the crowd i hope you all are enjoying the feast asked dumbledore a cheer rose from the crowd wonderful i would also like you to give a hand to those hard working house elves who take pride in there efforts to make every halloween better then the last again the crowd cheered also to our care of magical creatures professor hagrid for a marvelous patch of pumpkins this year the gryffindor table cheered particularly louder then all the other tables for hagrid the cheer died down and harry could tell dumbledore was preparing to talk about the battle some of you may remember that the sorting hat gave us a warning that the four houses need to unite and become one also that history books would remember what you did here and how brave you will be the sorting hat gave you this warning for a reason he paused and took a moment a battle is coming to hogwarts the hall became deathly quiet even the ghost stopped to listen to the headmaster many of you know that voldemort has returned to power but before he can take back the fear he used to hold over everyone he must first destroy this school these walls your teachers and you are the only thing standing in his way he knows this school is a safe house for all that oppose him and until he can stop us hope will always live he stopped and looked right at harry some of you may think that this is about voldemort getting back at the one person who stopped him last time this is not about harry potter versus voldemort dumbledore said in a very strong tone this is about controlling everything that is good about our world and it future tonight i stand before you not as your headmaster but as one wizard who will stand and fight for you for all children of magical power so that they can learn and develop their skill with out fear and hatred dumbledore slowly started to walk around the teachers table i stand here tonight as a wizard who will to do whatever it takes to make sure hogwarts will be opened to all who wish to learn and i stand here tonight to ask for your help for i can not do it alone gasps could be heard through out the hall some of you may think that the adults should handle this that we are more trained to handle death eaters but this is your school not there s you will fight harder and stronger then anyone to protect that which you love and i know many of you love this school as dumbledore spoke harry could see kids nodding their heads i am asking you to join me in fighting this battle to work with the aurors and other adults that will join us because with you we are much stronger then anyone can imagine together we can take any force who will join us asked dumbledore harry looked down the table and everyone gave him a nod he slowly rose and cleared his throat gryffindor will join said harry in a strong voice a cheer erupted from the table as everyone stood so will ravenclaw shouted luna as she and about three quarters of the table stood and hufflepuff said susan bones hannah abbott and about three quarters of hufflepuff stood both gryffindor and ravenclaw cheered but then a hush feel over the crowd as everyone stared at the slytherin table draco made eye contact with harry and started to rise what he doing he ll blow his cover whispered ron harry just shrugged his shoulders the crowd watch in anticipation as draco slowly stood the sorting hat said that the four house needed to united he paused to look down at the rest of the table about one quarter of the table stood to everyone surprise slytherin will fight after a moment the three other tables burst into a thunderous roar dumbledore gave draco a smile as he walked back behind the teacher table for those of you who do not wish to fight please understand that no hard feeling will be held towards you but i ask that you follow professor snape and leave the hall said dumbledore the group of ravenclaw hufflepuff and the majority of slytherin walked out of the front door once the doors were closed dumbledore closed his eyes and started to chant when he reopened them he looked at the crowd and waited for several minutes until the door reopened and professor snape and madam pomfrey walked in it worked headmaster they re all asleep and their memories completely wiped said professor snape as he walked towards the table thank you professor snape and madam pomfrey said dumbledore some of you might be wondering why we asked them to leave what we re doing must be kept a secret the dark lord must not known that you all have joined this fight and if any of you at any time feel that you made the wrong decision let me or any of the teachers know and we will give you a potion which will erase any memory you might have about this so know that once you ve made the decision to leave you cantcome back dumbledore looked over the crowd to see if anyone might want to leave but all the students stood still now if the party of slytherin could please move to either the hufflepuff table or the ravenclaw table we have some more guests instructed dumbledore so those people will have no memory of draco standing up whispered hermione to harry it was a good move to prove to everyone else here they were serious about helping us said harry yeah but they must have known beforehand that the other slytherin memories were going to get wiped i doubt he that brave said ron smugly dumbledore raised his hands and clapped them twice a second later the slytherin table was filled with the house elves the house elves have asked to fight alongside the students they care for and provide for everyday hogwarts is their home just as much as it is yours and they want to help preserve it i thank them for joining us here tonight and now i will let julia take over from here dumbledore took and seat and from where harry was standing he could see dumbledore looked tired julia slowly rose from the table and walked in front of it to address the crowd first thing first through third years will not be on the battle field said julia as groans came from the group of students i understand your displeasure but we need you all to assist madam pomfrey with the wounded and help protect the school from any of the death eaters who might try to break in while the rest of us are fighting fourth through seventh you will be on the battle field along side the teachers and aurors she started to walk down between the tables you all will receive extra training to prepare yourselves for this fight we ll split up into two groups the first through third years in one and the fourth through seventh years in another you ll have training every weekend and once a month we will meet in one large group julia walked over to the house elves and grabbed a box dobby was holding each of you will receive one of these necklaces when the time for your meeting has been decided it will show on the back of the medallion please wear these under all clothing so the students who are not fighting wontsee them also on the night of the battle these medallions will allow madam pomfrey and the house elves to monitor your health as long as you have the medallion touching your skin julia took a moment to set the box on a stool at the front of the hall genius i should have thought of that hermione said out loud hermione you did said a confused ron i talking about the health monitoring just brilliant said hermione who was still impressed by the idea by taking one of these you are fully committing to helping us fight and we ll know if anyone spills this secret julia gave the crowd a menacing look so again only take one if you know this is what you want to do julia instructed the crowd slowly made their way up front and people started to take the necklaces harry took a closer look at the silver chain in his hand the medallion was actually the hogwarts crest with the four houses together on the shield he put it on and suddenly felt a warm wave travel down his body you ll feel a warm sensation go through you once you putt the necklace on but dontworry that means it working said julia as students began to put them on julia then explained how every meeting would be in a different place so the other students wouldntget suspicious and again explained how no one was to tell anyone about their plans not even their parents once the group left if was just harry hermione ron and the teachers harry walked up to dumbledore to see if he had gotten word to the other order members to come where everyone else he asked they should be arriving now smiled dumbledore as mr and mrs weasley fred george lupin and all the others walked into the hall hey what are you guys doing here asked ron dumbledore asked us to come said fred who was wearing his order robe and he asked that we wear these thank you all for coming dumbledore said the group has seen many changes over the years and i wanted to take a picture of the new order so that we could always remember those who we fought bravely with smiled dumbledore who winked at harry so if you all will please get into positions colin will take our picture fred george stand over here said mrs weasley albus you should be in the middle grumbled mad eye what color should my hair be asked tonks something besides blue teased lupin hagrid you should probably stand in the back said mcgonagall as she put her order robe on after a couple more minutes everyone settled into place all of them wearing their robes and smiling at the camera harry hermione and ron stood in the first row on the lower step everyone ready asked colin behind the camera yes they all shouted okay 1 2 3 said colin as a bright flash went off okay one more oh god not another complained snape causing everyone else to laugh as another flash went off as the group began to break up harry ran over to colin and asked him to get one more picture hermione ron over here shouted harry colin will you take a picture of just the three of us sure harry said an excited colin harry grabbed hermione and ron and the three all held each other tight as colin took they re picture once he had the shot ron went over to talk to his parents and hermione went to talk with tonks and lupin how much will i owe you for all the copies of the group picture harry asked colin free of charge harry and i ll make copies of this last picture for hermione and ron he smiled please let me give you something harry felt bad no i wont except it he said as he packed up his camera but i do have a question sure harry thought it was probably something about voldemort how long have you and hermione been dating ask colin harry completely went numb he stood there for a moment thinking he might have miss heard him i i sorry what did you say asked a terrified harry how long have you and hermione been dating the school has been talking about it all day said colin confused by harry reaction if the whole school was talking about it that meant one way or another ron was going to hear about it even if it wasnttrue why do people think we re dating harry hoping it was just gossip you two were holding hands on the way to breakfast this morning it just seemed like you guys were together colin explained as he got ready to leave oh harry could feel his hands getting sweaty and cold how could he have been so careless well we re not dating harry said to colin as harry began to walk away he slowly realized he was going to have to talk to ron a lot sooner then he thought chapter 16 surviving the fall they may not make it dontsay that harry gave an angry cry as he glared at dumbledore and madam pomfrey lupin ron bill and charlie were now restraining him harry listen to me lupin had now moved to stand in front of him you have to calm down madam pomfrey is going to need all our help to get hermione and julia through this he looked straight into harry eyes harry body relaxed but his eyes and face were still filled with anger anxiety and above all fear hermione and julia bodies were transported back to hogwarts harry along with the order members followed them back mcgonagall stayed behind to try and help get the rest of the student body back into the castle as the first group walked back to the castle harry overheard mad eye talking with lupin the damn bastards got away while we were watching them fall huffed mad eye we ll try and do a sweep of the forest in a couple of days whispered lupin harry pretended he didnthear them but made a mental note of it he was going to get back at those death eaters one way or another once they reached the hospital wing madam pomfrey took charge lay them over there albus hagrid i need you to find these weeds in the forest she was running around in a dizzy trying to prepare anything that might help them professor snape if you can i need several phoenix tears along with these items she quickly scribbled down other ingredients charlie do you still work with dragons he nodded his head i going to need some dragon blood of a swedish short snout but it must be a female right said charlie as he grabbed his things and left the room albus and remus go clean up and put those nurses robes on the two did as instructed and have minerva join us when she can madam pomfrey then looked at harry what can i do his voice shaking pray she said in a serious tone the next few hours were the longest of harry life they had successfully stopped the bleeding but both women had lost a significant amount of blood and it was even more imperative that charlie get the dragon blood dumbledore created a 3 d model of the event so they could watch the impact to see exactly what happened all the adults along with harry watched as hermione and julia bodies collided with steel in slow motion right there said snape back it up a moment look he pointed to julia who was pulling on the broom now slow it down some more and watch julia he instructed the broom pulled out of the dive and began to skid along the ground julia sees that their going to hit the goal and knows she cantavoid it watch what she does with her right arm as the group watched they could see julia arm wrap around hermione head and body bracing the young girl for the impact let check her arm madam pomfrey walked away from the model and went behind barriers that separated the rest of the hospital wing from hermione and julia when she returned her face said it all her whole arm is crushed she said with a heavy sigh i dontknow if we should just re grow them or try and fix the bones i ve got those weeds yer were looking fer voiced hagrid as he barged into the hospital wing wonderful hagrid professor snape please take the wormwood and mix it with fawkes tears then take the ginger root and prepare it to be mixed with the dragon blood when it arrives asked madam pomfrey right away snape took the items from hagrid and left the room remus can you prepare some daisy root i ll need it to mix with the bone re grow instructed madam pomfrey who was becoming visibly tired along with the rest of the group poppy the sound of mcgonagall voice came from behind the barriers it time to change their dressing i ll do it take a moment to rest you ll need your strength once the dragon blood has arrived said a very calm dumbledore sir may i see them asked harry who had not said a word since he talked with madam pomfrey all right but only for a moment said dumbledore with a sad smile the two walked around the barriers and saw mcgonagall preparing new bandages hermione looked deathly pale her lips had a slight blue tint to them and her once brilliant hair was now tucked away behind the bandages julia looked even worse her arm was so discolored one couldnttell if it was real or not and the bandage around her head showed a hint of blood julia had taken the hit to the top of her head while the back of hermione head took the impact harry began to feel overwhelmed he had lost so much in his life and he couldntbare any more he loved hermione beyond words she was such a part of him that if he were to lose her half of him would die as well then there was julia a friend that harry had become very close to in these months she was protecting him in more ways then one and even though he didntknow why he felt a strong connection to her harry slowly made his way in between the two beds he looked at the sleeping form of the two women he bent down slowly and kissed hermione on the forehead and then did the same to julia a hand softly touched his shoulder harry knew he needed to leave once he was clear of the barriers he saw lupin preparing the daisy root and madam pomfrey preparing another round of potions to administer his eyes then rested on hagrid who looked as lost as harry felt harry slowly walked over to him how yer holdin up harry asked hagrid harry eyes were brimming with tears he felt so overwhelmed with ten different emotions that he didntknow how to answer but just then he began to feel light headed and before he knew it hagrid was holding him up and all the adults were surrounding him i all right just a bit light headed he said embarrassed that he felt weak hagrid remus why dontyou take harry down to the kitchen and have several plates made up for us said dumbledore as he took the bowl of daisy roots from lupin but sir i dontwant to leave pleaded harry my dear boy all we can do is wait for now if anything happens while your gone i ll send someone for you he said harry gave in and reluctantly went with hagrid and lupin the group slowly made their way down to the kitchen they ll be okay harry said lupin who nudged hagrid at the same time uh yeah that hermione she a strong one his laugh fell flat so is julia said lupin with a hint of pride they walked past the great hall and the hallway harry had dragged hermione into earlier that day i was going to ask hermione out harry blurted he didntknow why but he thought that maybe if he talked with someone besides dumbledore about how strongly he felt towards her that they would understand his need to be near her yer love her dontya asked hagrid who seemed to smile at the thought of the two young ones together i do said harry quietly just like his father falling for the brightest and prettiest in my humble opinion witch in the school laughed lupin as he slapped harry on the back dontworry harry if she loves you the way i think she does she fighting with every breath to come back to you the trio continued into the kitchen where they were greeted by dobby oh harry potter sir i heard what happen to miss hermione is there anything that dobby can do the house elf was truly concerned for his friend actually there is would you mind rounding up a few platters of sandwiches and stuff for us we ve been in the hospital wing all afternoon and haventeaten since this morning asked harry certainly just give dobby a moment the house elf said as he ran into the back of the kitchen after a few moments dobby followed by winky had many platters of food and jugs of pumpkin juice on the top level of a cart on the bottom were plates cups and silverware for them once you re back in the hospital just clap twice and this cart will appear when you re done clap twice again and winky will come and clean up everything smiled dobby thank you dobby said harry as he gave a halfhearted smile anything for the great harry potter he waved goodbye as the trio left the kitchen once they were back in the hospital harry clapped twice and the cart appeared he began to set the platters on a table so they could all grab something the room had become even quieter then before madam pomfrey had administered all the potions she could and was now waiting on the dragon blood professor said harry ever so quietly yes harry whispered dumbledore what so important about the dragon blood he asked well they ve lost so much blood that their heart cantproduce enough on it own to catch up so the dragon blood with the ginger root will help stimulate the blood to reproduce its self dumbledore trailed off what is it sir asked harry noticing the worry in his voice this potion is only used in extreme cases like this because of its possible side effect the dark sleep dumbledore frowned what that harry asked hermione and julia might not wake up injected lupin harry was about to ask another question when the hospital doors flew open and charlie ran in i ve got it he panted come with me charlie i ll need some help mixing the potion said snape who was the first to react severus called madam pomfrey from behind the barrier she appeared just a moment later hurry we re starting to lose them snape gave an understanding nod and left the room with charlie within the hour they returned with the potion ready to be administered madam pomfrey moved the barrier so everyone could see the two patients harry slowly made is way over to them and slowly put his hand on hermione s but he quickly brought it back as if he had burnt himself she icy cold he looked up at the adults concern on his face we must move quickly said madam pomfrey as she moved past harry and slowly poured the potion into hermione mouth then did the same to julia come on harry we need to let em work said hagrid as he put his arm around harry here why dontyer go into the bathroom over there and wash up i ll have dobby bring down some clothes fer ya harry didntrealize but he still was in his quidditch gear to tired to argue harry slowly walked over to the hospital bathroom and took a long shower sure enough when he was done his quidditch gear was gone and new clothes were sitting on a chair for him he walked out to find the barriers had been moved and now split the hospital into two halves the adults were all sitting on the beds across from hermione and julia talking in hushed voices we ll do shifts throughout the night whispered dumbledore poppy you should get some sleep the rest of the school will need you tomorrow she was about to protest when dumbledore put his hands up if anything does happen whoever is on shift will get you now i i ll stand watch tonight said harry daring anyone to say otherwise they all stared at him for a moment i ll keep harry company until the morning smiled lupin softly it settled then i ll check in through out the night to see if you need anything he motioned for everyone else to leave this side of the hospital harry talk to them both it will help keep them from slipping into the dark sleep yawned madam pomfrey if you need anything just clap twice and a house elf will appear several are on standby for tonight in case you need anything said mcgonagall i ve mixed several potions in case they wake up give them the blue one for pain and the green one for swelling but only if they wake up snape snapped but then softened his expression i ll have tomorrow class transcribed and sent up here for you to look at as he finished he whipped around and headed for the door if yer feel like getting outta the castle for a bit come visit me round lunch time grinned hargrid harry tried to smile back but he couldn t he just slowly nodded his head and went over and sat between hermione and julia the adults gave lupin some last minute instructions before they all left but harry paid no attention he continued to watch hermione sleeping form his mind replaying the events over and over harry went over everything he could have done until one option came to mind he hadntthought of why hadnthe transformed into a phoenix he could have held hermione and julia and they both would be awake and talking to him lupin who had been watching harry closely cleared his throat harry this wasntyour fault you know that right lupin had taken a seat on the bed next to julia yeah i know said harry in a non convincing way harry lupin said in a more serious tone this was not your fault how can you say that of course it my fault because she was my friend they went after her because i go to school here they ll go after more students it all because of me he shouted i should have saved them if i had transfigured into a phoenix i could have held them both harry lupin raised his voice there was no way for you to catch them rosie was already in the air and she couldntcatch up to hermione because she was falling to fast you cannot blame yourself hermione chose to be your friend and she chose to stand by you through everything you ve gone through julia is an auror and knows the consequences that entails lupin stopped and collected himself i feel like i talking to james all over again he said as he rubbed his forehead harry had a confused look on his face when you re mother told james about the possibility that they might die in order to save you james started to blame himself for putting lily life in danger what he didntrealize at the time was they couldntavoid it they were meant to be together and they were meant to have you those things are out of people control he finally understood this and enjoyed the little time he had left with her lupin began to look sad they were so happy even though they knew they were going to die harry looked over at hermione i was going to ask hermione out today i ve been waiting to ask her for so long but now i scared of what might happen if voldemort discovers i with her then you will face voldemort together said lupin he slowly got up and went over to a jar of tongue depressors he grabbed several and came back to harry here break this one in half he handed over one of the thin sticks harry took it and broke it in half now try and break these two together lupin asked while handing over two of the depressors again harry broke them in half but it took much more effort good break these four lupin handed him the group of four harry tried several times but could not break the group lupin then grabbed the four from harry this is you he put one of them on the foot of julia bed this is love of family he put the second one next to the first one this is love of a friend again continuing the line and this the most important of all is the undying love of another he put the last one down by themselves they can break lupin scooped them all up but together together their unbreakable harry finished the sentence i think i understand what you re getting at he smiled good so then what are you going to do when hermione wakes up asked lupin ask her out just like i intended to do harry yawned here harry why dontyou lie down and take a nap i ll take the first watch said lupin who was still standing at the foot of julia bed harry thought for a moment and then decided that sleep might be a good idea he slowly got out of the chair and tucked himself into the bed next to julia before to long harry had fallen into a restless sleep i swear we re all sick there was something with that breakfast i tell ya harry awoke the next morning to the sound of ron and several other people in the hospital wing yeah i think my spleen might be cracked said dean thomas mr thomas do you know where your spleen is asked an exasperated madam pomfrey harry slowly rose from the bed and rubbed his eyes when he opened them again he saw hermione and julia still lying perfectly still but something was different he reached for his glasses on the nightstand next to him he put them on and saw that color had returned to both hermione and julia face harry breathed a sigh of relief then notice dumbledore walking over to him from the window they will both live he smiled but we dontknow when they will wake up they didn t no not entirely they will wake up it just a matter of when i swear i gonna pass out harry heard ron say from the other side of the barrier go share the good news whispered dumbledore harry smiled at the old wizard and then turned around and headed for the cloth barrier he slowly stepped threw it and before he put his foot down he was being called from every angles several da members were there harry are they all right yelled ron is it true charlie went and got dragon blood shouted ginny do they still have all their fingers and toes asked luna this question caused everyone to stop and look at luna yes they re going to be okay and they do still have all their fingers and toes the group giggled well you know i feel better smiled ron yeah i think my spleen healed itself said dean my head doesnthurt so much said ginny as the group slowly made their way out of the hospital they grabbed harry and took him into the hallway so what have you got planned mate asked ron got what planned what are you talking about asked a very confused harry the group continued to walk slowly away from the hospital to get back at those death eaters said an eager ginny oh said harry i hadntthought about that well we cantjust go charging into the forest said seamus no that wouldntbe good said neville just then harry ran into something he looked down to see dobby picking himself up off the floor dobby i so sorry i didntsee you said harry as he offered his hand to help dobby up oh no mr harry potter it was dobby fault dobby started to clean up the sandwiches that had fallen on the ground when harry noticed his reflection in the silver sterling platter he bent down and slowly picked it up maybe we donthave to go charging into the forest but we ll make them think we are chapter 17 revenge of the da what are you talking about how can we make it look like we re there when we re really not asked a confused ron smoke and mirrors said luna she grabbed the platter from harry and held it against the wall so that ron could see himself in the platter yeah so he still wasntgetting they re point dobby can you get another one of those platters asked harry dobby snapped his fingers and another platter appeared he handed it to harry who gave it to ginny to hold now ginny stand over there and tilt the platter so it angled at me and the other platter instructed harry now ron move over a bit ron moved over and after a moment saw harry in the reflection but you re over oh i get it use the platters to reflect our images somewhere else it finally dawned on ron well not necessarily the platters mirrors would be better harry then looked at dobby dobby we re going to need your help an hour later harry was walking up to the defense classroom to find rosie they were going to need someone to lure the death eaters into their trap and harry knew rosie would be perfect he slowly entered the classroom and to his surprise it was full is was a group of first years practicing disarming their opponent he soon saw rosie fly over their heads she must be teaching the class he thought as he started to walk in the group of students started to head back to their desks and pick up their belongings they all stared up at him as they left the room the last group left and he could hear them in the hallway that was harry potter one young first year squealed to another harry smiled to himself he some times forgot about how much of a celebrity he was oh harry are they okay rosie flew over to him and landed on a desk yes it looks like they ll pull through we just dontknow when they ll wake up harry said out loud i sorry i couldntcatch up to hermione i tried but she was falling so fast said a very upset rosie you cut julia free and she was able to get hermione you cantblame yourself just like i cantblame myself he trailed off the bird eyed harry for a moment i imagine you didntcome to discuss them what on you mind she asked well i need your help but you have to promise not to tell anyone it was close to dinnertime and harry was sitting in the hospital wing swaying back and forth on a rocking chair that dumbledore had brought up ron was sitting on the bed next to julia reading the latest quidditch monthly out loud harry was sitting between the two beds watching the women sleep as he listened to ron hermione and julia had improved since he saw them earlier in the morning julia arm was mending nicely and they both had full color returned to their cheeks it was now up to them on when they would wake up harry and ron had been talking to them through out the day letting them know everyone missed them and wanted them back harry was just starting to nod off to sleep when he heard someone come through the barrier hey harry hey ron said luna softly hey luna ron said behind the magazine hi luna how are you doing but harry could tell that she was not doing well i umm i wanted to come and apologize to hermione she said ron slowly put the magazine down luna what are you talking about asked harry who stopped rocking in the chair it my fault the death eaters got her you see we were in the last group to leave the castle and she forgot her scarf she insisted on getting it said it brought you luck every time she wore it during a game i told her i d wait for her but she wanted me to go on head an get seats luna was starting to cry if i had stayed behind we might have been able to fight them off harry was about to get up and give luna a hug but to his surprise ron had put his arm around her luna you cantblame yourself no one could have prevented this said ron in a caring way i sure hermione will be glad that no one else was hurt and i have a feeling she doesntblame you at all harry tried to sound as positive as possible luna took out a handkerchief and tried her eyes thank you both for being so nice i hadnttold anybody yet and i was afraid people would be mad she said with the cloth in front of her nose dontbe silly besides what you should be thinking about is getting those death eaters back ron nudged her shoulder trying to get her mind off the subject she laughed a little bit well i better be off i ll see you guys after dinner she smiled back they both said their goodbyes and when harry was sure she had left he gave ron a look what i cantbe nice he said giving harry a mocked hurt face it not that you re just normally not nice to luna laughed harry ron then became serious oh well i figure so many people are trying to blame themselves about this that someone should tell them it not their fault said ron i mean hermione has always helped anyone in need and the one time she needs our help we fail her and the person who does help pays the price ron glanced at julia but what could we have done ron looked like he was trying to convince himself more then anyone else i know what you mean said harry as he slowly returned back to rocking the chair ron went back on the bed and grabbed the magazine and started reading again the two friends sat in silence for the next hour or so each going over what they could have done to help their sleeping friend it wasntuntil they were walking along the corridors heading to the room of requirement that they spoke again who are you going to take to the yule ball asked harry oh i dunno i might just go by myself ron seemed like he didntwant to talk about it why not take luna smiled harry i knew you were gonna say that and if hermione was awake she d say it too ron felt guilty about mentioning his hurt friend in such away you re right she would beamed harry he had a sense of pride that he was so in tune with her way of thinking the duo found the wall where the room would be and started walking back and for thinking of what they needed a moment later the door appeared and they walked into the comfortable room it had been when harry held the meeting the only difference was that two fairly large mirrors stood back to back in the middle of the room both harry and ron stared to walk around them harry stood looking at one while ron had walked over to the other after a moment harry began to see ron appear in his mirror and vice versa harry do you see me asked an astonish ron yeah do you see me he asked oh yeah gasped ron hello harry potter squeaked dobby from the door both ron and harry jumped at his voice dobby didntmean to scare you it okay dobby tell us what you did to these mirrors said harry who was still gazing at ron picture in the mirror it a simple spell sir these mirrors will receive images and sounds from each other explained dobby harry had a hunting thought it was the same as the mirror sirius had given to him he quickly brushed the thought out of his head as people started to file into the room so what the plan asked dean thomas as he took a seat next to ginny who seemed to ignore him first rosie goes and distracts a guard on patrol and leads them into our little trap ron said with excitement then two of you will be watching the mirror that will be in front of the death eater one person will be with me and the others will get ready to strike them from behind harry explained who is strong at charms most importantly the locomotor or wingardium leviosa charm luna slowly raised her hand good we need one more but no one raised they re hand harry then looked over at ron what about you you did the charm on the troll that was first year mate i dontthink i ve done it since said ron why dontyou work with luna all day tomorrow before we go i sure you can have it down in no time smirked harry ron quickly gave harry a dirty look before answering luna is that okay with you asked ron between gritted teeth that would be lovely smiled luna with her eyes as wide as a bug perfect now ginny you ll be with me and the other mirror neville dean and seamus you three will slowly creep up behind the death eater while i distract them when i give the word we ll all shout the incarcerous spell the same spell the death eaters use on julia once i tell them my little message rosie will pick the death eater up and drop them back at voldemort camp harry finished when do you go asked neville tomorrow after dinner i ll have dinner up in the hospital wing once you guys are done come up and act like you re checking in on hermione and julia we ll make a quiet exit and follow rosie to the clearing she found today said harry what about the mirrors asked dean harry took one look at them and saw how heavy they were he took out his wand and pointed at one reducio the mirror became small enough to fit in some one pocket he handed the first mirror to luna then shrunk the second one and put it in his own pocket okay let get going make sure tomorrow you wear your cloaks it going to be a cold night the group left in pairs so they wouldntraise suspicion as harry and ron were about to leave the squeaky voice of dobby startled them yet again good luck harry potter be careful said the nervous house elf dontworry dobby we will smiled harry if all went to plan he would be able to send a message to voldemort letting him know he wasntafraid harry spent the night in the hospital wing again he sat in the bed opposite hermione and julia watching as madam pomfrey made them more comfortable for the night if he ever had doubts about their plan all he had to do was look at them and he d begin to fill with rage madam pomfrey left to go get some supplies harry decided to go talk to the patients he sat down on the side of hermione bed and took her hand in his i ll get them back hermione he whispered to the sleeping beauty in front of him harry slowly leaned forward and kissed her lips softly hoping that maybe she d wake up he opened his eyes to see that she hadn t pain began to fill harry chest all he wanted was to talk to her hold her in his arms and tell her how much he loved her but fate had decided to make him wait even longer harry let out a heavy sigh come back to me he said as he kissed her on the forehead he made his way back over to his bed and got settled in he was going to need his strength for tomorrow the next day moved slowly for harry he had chosen to not go to class one more day just incase hermione or julia would wake up he read them the quibbler that luna had got for him and the daily prophet through out the day several members of the group came up and quietly confirmed things with harry dinner finally arrived from winky and twenty minutes later ron showed up to get harry they re waiting outside for us he whispered into harry ear harry glanced over at julia and hermione then looked at ron let go he said in a menacing tone harry was going to make sure this death eater understood that no one could mess with him and get away with it ron and harry made they re way to the back door where the rest of the group was waiting ginny handed harry his order robe once it was on harry put his hood on and indicated to the rest of the group to do that same both he and ron were wearing their order robes while everyone else was wearing the black hogwarts robe with the gryffindor symbol on the breast they all quickly walked to the edge of the forest making sure to stay away for hagrid hut once harry felt they were far enough away from the edge of the forest he instructed everyone to light their wands a small fog was hovering above the ground and the creaking of the trees and faint howls of animals could be heard in the distance all of a sudden there was a loud snap sorry whispered neville watch where you step we must be getting close said harry who then looked to the sky rosie hissed harry where are you over here said the bird as she flew over the group they followed her for several minutes until they came to a small clearing this is it okay she said this is it luna ron set up the mirror right here on the edge of the moonlight so the death eater can just make out what it is and you guys can be in the shadows or behind that tree harry pointed to a massive tree they had just walked by it was hidden in shadows just before the clearing okay luna put the mirror on the ground engorgio the mirror returned to its normal size ron hold the mirror while i get behind the tree and put the spell on it then once it off the ground come join me neville dean seamus see those tree over there harry pointed in the opposite direction of luna and ron spread out over there as the death eater walks closer to the mirror inch your selves closer to these trees here just on the edge of the clearing harry where do you want your mirror asked ginny who had taken it from harry and enlarged it lets have it over here on the side that way i can watch as the death eater enters the clearing said harry as he looked around to make sure everyone else was ready locomotor whispered ginny the mirror hovered above the ground and she started to direct it over to the side of the clearing ron you guys ready harry asked all set ron shouted from behind the tree neville ready smeaus dean yeah all set okay rosie go get em harry said as he walked into the shadows he stood right in front of the mirror and adjusted his hood so that you could barley see his face rosie how it going he thought i just spotted one on patrol she said harry then concentrated on neville dean and seamus guys can you hear me he said in his head wow harry is that you thought dean yeah rosie has found a guy make sure you re well hidden when he walks by you he explained okay said neville he chasing me rosie burst into their conversation get ready harry started to feel a little nervous he could hear the death eater approach get back here with my hat he yelled rosie dropped the hat ten feet away from mirror and then took off towards the sky damn bird huffed the death eater the tall death eater picked up his hat and dusted it off i must be close to hogwarts he said as he adjusted his hat scared of hogwarts said harry into the mirror his heart was pounding in his chest and he tried to stair right at the death eater he could just barley see in his mirror who that show yourself shouted the death eaters as he pulled his wand out he slowly scanned the area his eyes rested on the mirror who do we have here did a student get lost joked the death eater no said harry his blood still pumping hard but he soon thought about hermione and julia and his nerves started to settle i was actually looking for you oh you were looking for me and who might you be giggled the outspoken death eater harry slowly stepped forward but didntremove his hood i the one person your master fears harry confidence starting to strengthen oh are you laughed the death eater guys get ready thought harry when i say now hit him with the spell then once he tied up hit him with the silencing charm said harry the dark lord fears no one smirked the death eater as he quickly pointed his wand at the mirror a purple spell hit the mirror and fizzled out what the now shouted harry out loud incarcerous came shouts from all round the death eaters harry who peeked out from behind his tree saw the death eater bond and on the ground silencio shouted luna and ron as they crept closer to the death eater who was now squirming on the ground harry slowly made his way over to the man he bent down over him and slowly removed his hood so the death eater could see his face recognition written in his eyes good now that you know who i am said harry in a nasty tone he grabbed the loud mouth death eater by the collar you re gonna send a message back to your master for me tell him this i can get to him just as easily as he can get to me harry then pushed the man back down on ground and walked away from him also he turned to face him one more time tell bellatrix that she failed her master yet again julia and the girl survived the fall turn him over barked harry neville and dean turned the death eater over okay rosie thought harry take him back and if you can wait and see what voldemort reaction is are you kidding me i wouldntmiss his reaction for the world said rosie as she picked up the man and began to fly away come on we should get going said ron they shrank the mirrors and head back to hogwarts they all snuck up to gryffindor tower with out being seen harry and ron invited everyone to their common room to wait for rosie the look on their faces when they saw it was you harry was priceless laughed dean yeah mate they looked almost as shocked as draco did last year when you socket him in the stomach giggled ron you all did really well thank you for sticking with me smiled harry as he heard a pecking on his window he walked into his room and opened the window to let rosie in she flew right into the living room and landed on one of the chairs so what happened asked harry as he followed rosie into the common room you got them mad alright bellatrix was cursing up and down and was about to jump on the broom and come get you but you know who cursed her for not getting rid of julia or hermione he then told everyone to calm down and to not act on they re own they ll wait till we come back after winter break to do anything said rosie everyone seemed to cheer and give high fives harry felt a sense of accomplishment as he watched the others celebrate now all he could do was wait and hope that his loved one would come back to him chapter 18 one is the loneliest number what do you mean you re not taking anyone questioned ron as he finished off a sandwich if i cantgo with hermione then i ll just go by myself said harry plainly you could get any girl in the school harry piped up ginny guys i ve told you already it either hermione or no one he said as he finished eating his food alright i heading to the hospital wing i ll see you later harry left the hall and headed up to the hospital wing a routine harry had gotten use to in these last weeks before the winter break he d get up before breakfast spend a half hour or so with hermione and julia then go to class eat lunch quickly then visit them again and spend the majority of nights with them dumbledore had spread the word to all of the students in the army that they werentgoing to start training until they got back harry figured the teachers had enough to worry about trying to cover for julia classes and patrolling the castle grounds he entered the hospital wing to find draco malfoy and dumbledore standing at the foot of hermione bed harry quickly made his was over to them thinking something might be wrong professor is something the matter his voice showing signs of panic not at all harry i was just talking to mr malfoy about how we can try and prevent something like this from happening again said the very composed headmaster now if you ll excuse me i must talk with madam pomfrey dumbledore walked to the opposite end of the hospital leaving malfoy and harry by themselves i sorry i didntwarn you sooner said draco as he continued to look at hermione it okay we re just lucky julia was able to save her harry half smiled as he looked at julia the bandages had come off of both julia and hermione and they were now wearing regular clothes harry and draco stood in an awkward silence for a moment when did you know you liked hermione draco asked quietly for a moment harry didntknow how to answer he was lucky enough to be shown just how much hermione cared for him but then he also started to notice things about her little things that just made her seem perfect it was the night you told me about you guys spying for us he whispered what made you think that you might like her draco was being completely sincere well i started to look at her in a different light harry felt very strange talking to draco about this i found myself wanting to spend more time with her i was counting down the minutes to the next time i d see her but most of all when she gave me a hug i never wanted to let her go harry started to feel himself getting upset that he had not been able to give her a hug in weeks draco it time for you to leave before the other students get out of lunch came the voice of dumbledore draco didntsay a word as he left the hospital wing but harry had a feeling he was talking about ginny dumbledore was about to leave when harry remembered a conversation he had with hermione before the attack professor he said timidly yes harry he slowly turned and walked over to the young man before hermione was attacked i had a conversation with her and it sounded like she was hiding something she mentioned coming to grimmauld place for winter break and when i said that her parents might miss her she told me you had spoken to them over the summer harry couldntlook the old wizard in the eye he felt bad for asking the question do you really want to know harry asked dumbledore harry slowly moved his head up and down well we had a feeling that hermione and ron might be targeted for attacks once voldemort couldntget to you so in order to keep her family safe hermione stayed at grimmauld place for the summer so not only did the weasley have to go into hiding cause of me but hermione did to harry felt terrible they re lives were in danger all because of him dontforget what lupin said harry said dumbledore as be put a hand on harry shoulder they have chosen to stick by you until the very end they all know the risk and are willing to take it now i do believe you have a couple more classes before the yule ball tonight he smiled yes sir harry gathered his things and headed for the door he sat through the next class thinking about the tremendous sacrifices his friends were making for him the fire that was lit within him during the reading of sirius will began to burn again he was more determined then ever to end the fear and stop voledmort once and for all if not for his sake then for his friends as the rest of the afternoon rolled by ron continued to try and push harry to find a last minute date while ginny continued to keep dean thomas at arms length everyone was excited about the dance and winter break several of fred and george joke shop products were released in the hallway in celebration every time harry left a class some new prank had been pulled and filch would be running one way or another trying to catch who did it before to long harry was up in his room getting ready for the dance he put his dark navy blue pinstriped pants on then the non pinstriped but matching color button up shirt he had finished tying his new black dress shoes when he heard a knock on the door come in he said as he went to put his belt on harry potter sir dobby has your robe all cleaned and ready for you squeaked the house elf thanks a lot dobby harry finished putting the belt on then grabbed his dark navy pinstriped jacket and put it on what do you think harry did a little twirl for dobby dobby thinks the young ladies of the school will be very pleased said the house elf with a smile harry laughed then looked in his mirror he left his collar unbuttoned which gave him the not trying too hard look unfortunately there is only one lady i trying to impress dobby harry mood changed for a moment as he realized hermione would not be able to see how good he looked would harry potter be needing anything else asked dobby who snapped harry out of his sad thought oh no thanks again for cleaning the robe smiled harry anything for the great harry potter have a merry christmas sir said the elf as he began to leave harry started to put his order robe on when he got an idea hey dobby he shouted hoping the house elf didntget to far he heard the little pidder padder of his small feet coming back to his room is there something wrong sir dobby looked as if he was preparing to be hit oh no i was just wondering what the house elves do while the kids are away we just take care of the castle and any students or professors who stay said dobby harry continued to think for another moment dobby how would you and winky like to spend christmas at my house of course i d pay you to work for me i know mrs weasley would love the help and it gets you out of the castle for a while asked harry dobby began to cry harry potter wants dobby to join him for christmas the elf threw himself onto harry feet you truly are a great wizard he cried umm dobby harry slowly pulled his foot lose sorry sir dobby has never been invited to anyone house before smiled the elf it okay dobby laughed harry just make sure you tell dumbledore so you guys can be at grimmauld place tomorrow dobby will go to the headmaster right away the house elf was out the door before harry could utter another word harry adjusted his robe then ruffled his hair with his hand just like his father did he made his way out into the common room and sat down on the couch to wait for ron ron let go shouted harry hang on hang on ron said as he opened the door he had his dark emerald pants jacket and robe on with a white button up shirt underneath he too had chosen not to wear a tie and leave his collar open also both harry and ron robes had silver highlights to them when light reflected off of them in certain angles the dark blue and green were accented by this silver halo you look good said harry as he stood up from the couch you dontlook that bad yourself joked ron the two friends made their way out of their common room and stepped into the gryffindor common room where several first year girls swooned at the sight of the upper classmen dressed up harry and ron just laughed as they made they re way down to the front of the hall it was mostly guys waiting for their dates to arrive dean seamus and neville were all huddled together and waved harry and ron over to them gentlemen i must say that gryffindor know how to look good boosted seamus it was true that at least the sixth year gryffindor all dressed to the nines seamus was wearing black pants with a green button up shirt and matching green robe no jacket dean wore a deep purple robe with a matching button up shirt with a black jacket and pants neville was the biggest surprise he was wearing a dark maroon colored robe with a matching waste coat and tie white button up shirt and black jacket and pants neville who are you trying to impress asked ron he wonttell said dean as he nudged neville just then neville eyes became as big as apples he was looking in the direction of the hufflepuff girls who were making their way down to the large group hannah abbott slowly made her way over to neville she was wearing a daisy colored dress with a matching robe hi neville ready to go in she asked neville mouth hung wide open and if harry hadntnudged him he might never have moved uh yeah le let go in said neville as he nervously offered his arm to hannah once they were gone the rest of the group just stood in amazement way to go neville said ron to the rest of the group they continued to chat with each other until ginny and padma patil came down ron leaned over to seamus before the girls got to them good luck mate ron winked at him thanks smiled seamus as padma reached his side now it was just harry and ron and a handful of other guys waiting for their dates so are you gonna tell me who you re taking asked harry as he watched more people entering the great hall wonthave to here she comes smiled ron as he tapped harry to turn around harry saw luna gliding down the stairway towards them she was wearing a pale purple dress and robe the front of her hair was tied back into a ponytail that was curled and the rest of her hair was curled as well you look wonderful breathed ron as luna approached thank you blushed luna see you inside mate said ron as the two walked into the hall leaving harry by himself he waited for a moment and looked towards the hospital wing hoping that his date might emerge but after another minute of waiting harry slowly walked into the hall the four long tables were gone and now replaced by a dance floor in the middle and round tables filling the sides the ceiling was bright with stars and comets wizzing by and soft candle chandeliers hung in mid air all around the hall harry found ron and went over to the table he found a place card with his name on it and sat down ginny and dean were also at his table seamus and neville were at the table next to them harry noticed the empty seat next to him and saw the place card that sat on the plate it read hermione granger again harry felt sad that hermione was not beside him however he didnthave much time to dwell on it the food soon appeared before they started dumbledore stood and quieted the crowed before we start let give professor flitwick and our caretaker mr filch a round of applause for helping make this yule ball possible the crowed clapped you may dig in the old wizard cheered the hall was soon filled with the sounds of forks and knifes clicking against plates laughter could be heard all around harry looked round to see all the happy faces of his classmates from the slytherin to ravenclaws and hufflepuffs the fourth through seventh years were all enjoying this party i think i going to get some punch said ginny as she rose from the table i ll come with you said dean as he started to get up harry looked over at the punch table and noticed draco was there i ll go with her dean i need to get a drink anyway said harry as he quickly stood oh okay dean sat back down harry did feel a little sorry for dean he could tell dean really liked ginny but she had her heart set on someone else they started to walk to the punch table and ginny leaned over to harry thank you harry she whispered no problem harry whispered back harry and ginny stood several feet away from draco after a few seconds draco made a comment where your mudblood pal tonight potter that right still sleeping he hissed harry instinctively took one stride over to malfoy and grabbed him by the robe say something else malfoy and we ll see how long i can make you sleep said harry in a murderous tone give this to ginny whispered draco who slipped a piece of paper into harry pocket harry let draco go and turned back to ginny who had a horrified look on her face harry gave her a wink to let her know it was all for show they poured several glasses of punch but before they left harry slide the piece of paper over to ginny she eyed him for a moment draco mouthed ginny harry nodded and she quickly took the note they walked back to the table and handed everyone their punch what did that rat want growled ron just trying to egg harry on that all said ginny as she handed dean his cup so ya want me to talk to him said dean who looked like he was about to get up it okay dean i took care of it said harry as he took his seat the group continued to chat as they ate a little later desert carts were wheeled to every table what would you like luna asked ron strawberry cheesecake please she smiled ron had been very kind and considerate towards luna all night and harry could tell she was having a wonderful time what would you like sir asked the house elf harry snapped out of his train of thought and looked at the desert cart um chocolate cake please he said a rich chocolate cake was handed to harry who immediately started to eat it as people began to finish their deserts the lights dimmed and a spot light was shown on dumbledore it is now time for the dancing to begin he smiled but before we start the music i have a very special guest i d like to introduce whispered conversations began as kids tried to guess who dumbledore might be talking about i hope it no one from the ministry said ron with our luck it probably umbridge joked ginny but all she saw were grim looks from everyone at the table the door to the hall opened and a figure walked in can you see who it is ron asked ginny no its too dark she whispered as they all continued to crane their necks to try and get a glimpse calm down harry heart stopped as he saw the person walking to the middle of the dance floor there was one collective gasp as everyone now saw who dumbledore gust was oh my god its hermione whispered harry in a shaky voice the spotlight danced around her giving her an angelic glow she was wearing a pale blue dress and robe her hair was tied up in a french bun harry slowly rose to his feet still not convinced that the vision he was seeing was the girl he loved his knees were unsure of themselves but as he stepped closer to her he was more convinced that it really was hermione the air had become thin and harry found it hard to breath but he was soon face to face with hermione who was flashing her wonderful smile at him the hall was still and no one dared to move hermione whispered harry still shocked that she was standing before him she slowly nodded her head it me harry she breathed harry slowly raised his hand and softly caressed her cheek her skin felt warm and soft just as he remembered so many feelings overwhelmed him but one impulse was screaming for him to kiss her and so harry slowly bent his head down and kissed her with all the love he had that a boy harry shouted someone harry completely ignored the person and continued to kiss hermione pretty soon more cheers erupted from the crowd and as harry deepened his kiss the shouts grew louder once they parted harry picked hermione up and slowly spun her around music began to play and hermione leaned her head on harry shoulders as the couple began to sway back and forth i love you hermione whispered harry she lifted her head and looked him right in the eye i ve always loved you harry smiled hermione it was the happiest moment harry ever had a surge of energy pulsed through him he could take voldemort on with one hand right this minute if he had to he wrapped his arms around hermione and lightly squeezed i dontever want to let you go he whispered into hermione ear she pulled back slightly to look at him you know what julia said to me before we hit the poll she asked harry shook his head she said to me think of the thing that makes you happy think of harry and then everything went black but in my dreams you were always there to protect me she whispered and i always will be smirked harry they kissed one more time and continued dancing trying to make up for the time they lost no one dared to interrupt them even ron and ginny knew they could talk with hermione on the train over at the teachers table and old wizard drew a deep breath and looked at a women he cared for he finally happy albus smiled mcgonagall the boy who lived has finally found love beamed the old wizard albus when will you tell the boy about julia mcgonagall didntwant to bring up a subject that might dampen the mood after christmas i promise a look of concern on dumbledore face he may not forgive me for keeping this from him a n sorry for the delay works been really busy and i ve been pulling 15 hour shifts thank you for hanging in there with me chapter 19 new relationship same friend the train ride back to london was uneventful for the first hour everyone continued to ask hermione questions about when she woke up how did she get madam pomfrey to let her go to the dance then some how the topic switched to neville who went bright red when they asked how he got hannah abbot to go with him to the ball things began to quiet down and hermione leaned against harry and fell asleep it felt wonderful to have hermione in his arms he couldnthelp but smile he watched as luna and ron carried on a pleasant conversation and ginny and neville played wizards chess he turned his attention to the window it was a dreary day rain would fall here and there the grey clouds refused to let any sunshine through as harry continued to look out the window he saw a bird flying high above them it looked as though it was following the train rosie thought harry is that you up there ah darn you saw me said the eagle how hermione she sleeping right now i a little worried about how weak she is he looked down at hermione who had to be helped onto the train by hagrid dontworry madam pomfrey has her on every potion imaginable to get her back up to speed plus that potion they gave her last night so she could dance with you is pretty powerful said the bird trying to lighten the mood when do you think julia will wake up asked harry as he watched ron tell neville he could beat ginny in three moves soon i hope those first years are beating me up said rosie this caused harry to laugh out loud everyone in the compartment stopped what they were doing and looked at harry i talking with rosie he said casually is that how i heard you that night we got the death eater asked an interested neville yeah i used rosie to talk with you just like julia did in class to communicate with us said harry they spent the next several hours trying to communicate with each other using rosie it got particularly interesting when everyone started to hear one of hermione dreams books that she hadntread yet were chasing her everyone giggled until they heard a voice in the dream that sounded like sirius protect my godson hermione i counting on you harry and ron knew where they had heard it before it was in sirius note to hermione maybe we should take a break suggested harry everyone slowly went back to doing something else while harry continued to listen to hermione to make sure she wasntbeating herself up for anything else but he didnthave much time soon the train pulled into platform nine and three quarters hermione we re here whispered harry she rubbed her eyes and slowly looked around no one would make eye contact with her as the group grabbed their belongings but before they had a chance to open their compartment door two tall redheads appeared fred and george made funny faces at the group as they banged against the glass alright we re in charge here said george as he opened the door locomotor said fred as he pointed his wand at hermione she floated above the seat and slowly hovered over to fred reducio reducio um reducio oh and reducio said george who shrank all of harry s ginny s ron and hermione luggage okay throw the stuff in your pocket and let go oh sorry luna and neville reducio reducio and reducio you re gran can un shrink it neville dontworry smiled george as he followed fred who had hermione on his back the group just stood still for a moment in the compartment looking at each other now you all know why i wish i had a sister said ginny dully as they all turned to the window to watched fred skipping around the platform like a pony with hermione laughing hysterically on his back they followed the twins up into the main part of the station where mr and mrs weasley were waiting along with mad eye tonks lupin charlie bill and hagrid you two knock it off she ainta rag doll barked moody as hagrid came up and grabbed hermione from fred you lot where your belongings they shrunk it for us said harry

days trying to make sure nothing happens on the way to grimmauld place said fred the kids said they re goodbyes to luna and neville i ll write luna said ron no he wont he ll see you after break shouted moody from down the platform ron just stared for a moment at moody then looked at luna and gave her a frown it okay i ll see you in a few weeks she said as she went in to give ron a hug the group of friends watched as ron for a second didntknow what to do but soon returned the hug ron harry keep up yelled mrs weasley why didntshe yell at you ron asked ginny cause she knows i staying back here to make sure you dontget lost she smiled as she poked fun at her brother they soon caught up to the rest of the group and harry could hear hermione begging to be put down honestly hagrid i can walk there really no need to carry me she continued to protest as they went to the front of the station where a black limousine was waiting we re not all riding in that are we asked ron of course little bro the ministry doesntwant their one hope to defeat you know who to get hurt smiled george so we get to ride in style wait a minute this is a neverending limousine isntit gasped hermione the group of kids looked up at her she not even awake twenty four hours and she already pointing out things we dontknow joked ron no i ve heard about them too the outside keeps the same shape but it adapts to the amount of people inside by shrinking us said ginny who opened a door and peeked her head in to look what are you a hermione in training asked ron ronald stop being a smarty pants and get in the car said mrs weasley as she gave him a nudge we will return to full size right everything will be intact questioned a nervous ron why who are you trying to impress asked harry the whole grouped laughed except ron who went completely red and walked right into the limo hagrid you coming asked harry who was the last one to get into the limo no i riding in the ambulance with julia said hagrid as he walked to a large black suv that was parked in front of the limo harry was about to ask another question but he saw the back doors of the suv open to reveal madam pomfrey and several nurses from st mungo preparing to receive julia who was carefully being lifted into the car by mad eye that car has the same spell as the limo we need ways to transport witches and wizards who cantapparate themselves to st mungo or other places said mr weasley who was looking at harry from the car harry gave the suv one more glance before he stepped into the limo mr weasley why cantother wizards just grab them and apparate for them asked harry as he took his seat next to hermione you mean like julia and dumbledore did in diagon alley said mr weasley not many witches and wizards can produce enough magic to transport two people or three the way dumbledore and julia did it very rare but then again dumbledore and julia arentyour average witch and wizard harry didntask any more questions instead he just thought about what mr weasley had said after several loops around the block and dropping people off two at a time harry finally entered his home a thought that still seemed weird to him was that he owned this place he carried hermione up to her room and then proceeded to his as he enlarged his trunk and his birdcage hedwig gave a confused hoot as the bird returned to normal size sorry hedwig it wasntmy idea said harry who searched for a treat to give the well behaved bird as he settled into his room he heard noises coming from the room next door he peeked into the hall and saw julia body being hovered into the room he took a deep breath and went down to join his friends in the girl room several hours later the group was down in the kitchen eating a wonderful dinner that dobby and winky had prepared dobby winky this is fabulous i want the recipe asked an amazed mrs weasley its very simple mama i can write it out for you tonight piped up winky in her high voice oh winky dear that would be wonderful thank you said mrs weasley who continued to eat the wonderful beef stew the house elves made dumbledore mcgonagall and snape had arrived at the house just before dinner hermione was able to come down for dinner but everyone could tell she was quickly becoming tired along with the rest of the children well it been a long day why dontyou all get some rest tomorrow we ll be decorating cheered mrs weasley they all got up from the table harry made sure to help hermione up but as they reached the stairs she threatened everyone if they didntlet her try to go up them herself of course she made her way up them and only needed to stop twice to take a break madam pomfrey and mcgonagall who were following the group to give hermione her last potions for the night were very impressed with how well she handled them you sure you dontneed anything asked harry as he stopped in front of hermione room i fine dontworry about me she smiled if you need anything i ll be right next door harry seemed worried to let her out of his sight he had slept in a bed next to hers the night before in the hospital wing of hogwarts harry i ll be okay nothings going to happen hermione could tell harry reluctance to let her go i know said harry as he looked down at his feet hey she put her hand on his cheek it will be okay dontworry she stood on her tiptoes and gave him a sweet kiss on the lips okay okay she ll see you tomorrow morning harry said ginny from in side the room the two looked embarrassed as they parted from their kiss hermione grabbed the door and began to close it love you she whispered love you too said harry and i love everyone said george from the bottom of the stairs hermione laughed and slowly closed her door but not without giving harry a wink harry continued to his bedroom where he was meet with dumbledore lupin mad eye and snape when did you guys get up here asked harry who had just seen them all eating downstairs just minutes ago while you were sucking miss grangers face said snape unpleasantly it also known as kissing said lupin to snape the two glared at each other for a moment cut it out you two huffed moody we re hear to monitor you tonight said a very composed dumbledore oh yeah to see if i can block out voldemort said harry who wasntthrilled with the idea of snape watching him sleep harry started to undress then turn to the four men standing in his room still staring at him um can i have a moment the wizards all turned around and continued to talk with each other while harry stripped down to his boxers he jumped into bed and quickly covered himself ready he said nervously wonderful now harry i want you to clear your mind the headmaster took a seat next to harry bed while the others slowly took their seats around the room harry closed his eyes and began to clear out any thoughts he had from the day concentrate on your breathing said dumbledore whose voice was becoming very soothing and harry found himself quickly slipping into a deep sleep it seemed he was only sleeping for a minute when images began to take shape master we couldnttrack them the car kept driving in circles sniveled a death eater well then why arentyou still out there watching it drive in circles said the all to familiar voice the man began to cry out in pain as harry could see the crucio spell being performed on the death eater kneeling before voldemort now you said you had some sort of news what might that be said the dark lord the death eater took a moment to catch his breath then looked up at the evil wizard the mudblood girl is awake and is believed to be very close with potter said the death eater still in pain really voldemort began to pace maybe we could use this to our advantage maybe we could use her to draw potter out at this harry could feel his own emotions coming through he wasntgoing to let voldemort touch her even if he had to die to do it at that moment harry could feel a shift in voldemorts demeanor what is it my lord asked the death eater we re not alone i think some one is watching roared voldemort harry could feel his body being jerked up into a kneeling position pain coursed through him you would die for her potter just like your father the high pitched squeal of voldemort echoing in harry mind he could also hear dumbledore and the others try and help him albus can you break the connection yelled moody who was pointing his wand at harry trying to counter voldemort harry arms were spread out and his chest was protruding forward as if some one had hooked him like a fish and was trying to wheel him in harry screamed out in utter pain it was just like in the ministry his body felt like it was on the brink of death but unlike the other time harry did not wish to die he was trying with all his might to concentrate and push voldemort out of his head you wontwin yelled harry the group surrounding harry stop as they heard his voice harry keep fighting said lupin who along with snape was also pointing their wands trying to counter cures voldemort come on potter you can do better then that taunted voldemort harry gave out a loud grunt as he began to push even harder ahhh voldemort screamed out in pain harrys body relaxed for a moment harry keep fighting help is on the way said dumbledore albus where are you going shouted mad eye another wave of pain hit harry as voldemort recovered from harry moment of triumph i will kill you yelled a crazed voldemort not before i kill you first said harry between waves of pain he was starting to lose his fight with voldemort his strength was draining quickly but just as he was about to give up harry felt the warmth of another body he was suddenly at peace he couldntfeel any more pain but could still feel voldemorts presence and now the presence of someone else i love you harry came the voice of hermione voldemort gave out another cry of pain but this one was much deeper then the first he completely let go of all control over harry which caused the boy to collapse into hermione arms master are you okay said the voice of the death eater harry couldntbelieve it he was still connected to voldemort but with out him knowing you re right said voldemort out of breath the mudblood is very close with potter too close harry could feel hermione letting go of him and the moment she let go voldemort stiffened again harry blindly reached out for her hermione grabbed his hand which caused voldemort to calm down what should we do master said the death eater as he helped voldemort off the floor nothing whispered the dark wizard nothing sir questioned the death eater yes i must figure out what happened tonight and if it can happen again as voldemort finished speaking harry slowly lost his connection he slowly opened his eyes people were standing over him but with out his glasses he couldnttell whom here harry said a voice that sounded like lupin the man was handing harry his glasses and once on he saw the entire household standing in his room however the person he wanted to see most was the one sitting at the end of his bed still holding his hand what happened harry tell us everything said a nervous dumbledore a death eater was telling voldemort about not being able to follow us from the station today said harry as collected his thoughts i knew it said moody from the other side of the bed voldemort tortured him and then asked about any other news the death eater had harry didntwant to say it out loud not in front of everyone it would scare hermione what was the other news pushed lupin harry took a deep breath he told voldemort that the mudblood had woken up and that she was very special to me harry couldntlook hermione in the eye he just stared at his feet as he talked is that when he felt your presence asked a still nervous dumbledore yes then he started to torture me harry felt completely embarrassed how was he supposed to defeat the dark lord when voldemort could torture him miles away what did you do to stop him there was a moment where your body relaxed and it looked like you had beat him asked a very impressed snape i dontknow last time he did that to me in the ministry there was a gasp from mrs weasley mcgonagall and even a grunt from moody i just wanted to give up and die i didntcare i wanted the pain to be over but this time this time you werentgoing to let anyone hurt your friends injected dumbledore who saved harry from having to divulge too much about his feelings towards hermione right so i just concentrated as hard as i could and i forced him out for a moment harry was still looking down at his feet why did you reach out for hermione when he had let you go asked moody because when he let me go we were still connected when hermione stopped touching me he began to feel my presence for a moment but once we were touching again he didntknow i was there harry glanced at mad eye then back to his feet did he say anything else asked fred everyone turned and gave him a nasty look yes he did he said i was too close to the mudblood and that he didntwant to do anything until he could figure out if this could happen again i think he was referring to hermione forcing him out harry slowly raised his head to look at hermione all he saw was complete concern in her eyes she slowly crawled over to him and gave him a hug dontworry he not getting either of us with out a fight she said as she stroked the back of harry head he was wiped out he rested his head on her shoulder hoping that she was right the room was still as everyone watched the couple hold each other the most important thing now is to figure out how hermione helped you defeat him and figure it out before voldemort does said a grim moody chapter 20 winter wonderland the house smelled of hot apple cider and creamy hot chocolate mrs weasley wasntkidding when she told everyone they were going to be decorating she had dumbledore and mcgonagall decorating the hallways hagrid and ginny were preparing the tree for everyone to decorate later that night fred and george had gone with winky and dobby to buy food for the christmas feast lupin harry hermione and ron spent the day wrapping presents harry had received a huge package from colin with all of the photo already in frames he took the box and crept up to julia room knowing he d have peace and quiet harry put the box in julia room then crept back to his room to grab the wrapping paper on the way back he stopped for a moment when he heard humming coming from the hallway below he peered over the banister to see dumbledore and mcgonagall humming christmas carols to each other wait what that muggle song about gold rings asked dumbledore as he was lifting another red bow into the air oh honestly albus you ask me that every year chuckled mcgonagall on the first day of christmas my true love gave to me she paused and looked at dumbledore ah yes a partridge in a pear tree said a jovial dumbledore harry smiled at the cute scene between his two professors he noticed the box of decoration next to mcgonagall and saw the mistletoe lying on top he pulled his wand out slowly and pointed at the mistletoe wingardium leviosa he whispered the mistletoe began to float up wards towards harry he had to motion for it to fly faster because dumbledore started to turn around as the mistletoe floated up behind him once harry thought the mistletoe was high enough for them not to notice but low enough for people walking into notice he cleared his throat subsisto objecto whispered harry the mistletoe abruptly stopped in mid air and just stayed there as if on cue george and fred stormed through the front door with winky dobby and tonks in tow great job on the decorating professors said george as he walked by them wait a tic you two are standing under mistletoe piped up tonks who pointed up to it hanging in mid air well go on some one has to kiss the other yeah come on headmaster show us how it done cheered fred dumbledore raised one eyebrow at the young man who took the cue and quickly went into the kitchen with his brother oh come on its tradition smiled tonks dumbledore slowly leaned over and kiss mcgonagall on the cheek tonks clapped then headed into the kitchen with the twins i wonder who put that up there questioned dumbledore who looked towards the direction harry was in harry had slowly crept into julia room and was now just listening he had a huge smile on his face as he closed the door to the room he settled himself on the floor right next to julia bed he opened the box and noticed a photo he had never seen before colin had taken a photo of harry kissing hermione at the dance there was a note attached to second copy of the picture dear harry i thought you might want this picture since it was your first kiss with hermione way to go anyway i hope you have a wonderful christmas and i cantwait to start you know what when we get back all the best colin how did colin know it was his first kiss was it that obvious that he has never kissed a girl before as harry thought about it he continued to stare at the picture the picture framed all of their bodies leaving a little room at the top and bottom the spot light was hitting the back of his shoulder and just the edge of his ear while the light caught hermione hair leaving the actual kiss in a perfect silhouette harry looked up at julia and noticed the picture from her office had been place at her bedside table he put hermione picture down and stood up to get a better look at julia s harry had never noticed but julia parents seemed a little old to have such a young child he peered at it even closer and noticed julia father and how his hair looked as wild as harry s his was obviously gray but just as wild he then noticed how hazel julia mother eyes were and just as harry started to think about it he heard a soft knock at the door harry you in here came the soft voice of hermione uh yeah said harry who wasntpaying attention until he heard hermione next comment oh harry this picture is beautiful hermione was gasping at the picture of them kissing harry turned and realized he left the pictures out did colin take this yeah he figured we d want it said harry as he scratched the back of his head in defeat i was gonna give it to you as a christmas present but i guess i ll have to think of something else he laughed you already gave me the greatest christmas present i could ask for she said as she put the picture down and took a step towards harry your heart she took another step forward and wrapped her arms around harry who instinctively wrapped his arms around her harry had never felt this way about anyone and to slowly realize just how much she loved him back almost made him lose his balance how are you feeling he asked while leaning his head against hers better i think by christmas i ll be one hundred percent she learned back to look at harry what about you did you get any sleep last night i fine dontworry about me he let go of her and turned to look at julia harry you donthave to act like everything is fine in front of me if something is bothering you i want you to tell me hermione stood next to him on the side of julia bed it just harry took a deep breath and hung his head how am i supposed to beat voldemort if he can control me like he did last night harry looked up at hermione he was miles away hermione and the only thing that stopped him was you and we donteven know how you did it it wasntjust me harry it was us together we beat him but how how did we do it harry was becoming frustrated hermione put her hand on his shoulder its part of the riddle from the sorting hat with the love of a family member and friend you ll have enough power to destroy voldemort i believe in you smiled hermione harry just looked at her in amazement how did i get so lucky to have you smiled harry well it took you six years but you finally got it she joked as she leaned in and kissed him hey harry lets go shouted ron from the front door harry and hermione parted from the kiss and gave each other that knowing look where are you going asked hermione to diagon alley i promised ron i d help him pick out a gift for luna said harry as he began to pack up his stuff do you want me to wrap that while you re gone she asked would you harry was suddenly relieved he wasntvery good a wrapping sure besides your wrapping last year just scared me said hermione as she took a seat on the floor and grabbed the first picture of the order i assume there is one for everyone in the picture yes and there is one other picture in there for you and ron as harry spoke he slyly took one of the copies of the kissing picture hermione had given him a great idea for a real gift do you need anything while i out actually there is a package under julia name at the quidditch store can i trust you not to open it and wait till christmas hermione eyed him yes i promise not to open it said harry as he gave her his mischievous smile harry we aintgot all day came another shout from ron then stop yellin and i ll come down shouted harry over his shoulder anything else no i think that it but you better get going if i need anything dobby said he d run out and get it have a good time i ll try smiled harry as he began to shut the door oh and thanks again for doing that love you love you too said hermione as harry closed the door hearing hermione say those words could never get old thought harry as he jogged down the stairs did you check in with the misses to make sure you could leave teased ron as harry threw on his order robe i sorry arentwe buying a present for your soon to be misses said harry she just a friend said ron who suddenly became serious soon to be misses friend continued harry who heard fred and george complain as they left the kitchen we just got back from diagon alley said fred with a sandwich in his hand i know tonks will be shadowing you and moody will meet you there and once the boys are there you can come back but we must appear like we dontsuspect and attack explained mrs weasley as she pushed the twins towards the front door we cantcome back we have to re open the store it already been closed for two hours complained george then grab some food there and re open the store huffed mrs weasley alright alright you two ready said fred to ron and harry we ve been ready said ron trying to be cheeky been ready to take your favorite bus smiled george oh no said an exasperate ron meanwhile an hour later ron and harry were walking down the alley heading for the jewelry store ron we ve walked up and down the whole alley twice already said harry who was getting tired of pointing things out to ron okay then why are we going into the jewelry store said an even more tired ron because when in doubt buy jewelry for women said harry as they made they re way inside an hour later harry and ron were carrying they re jewelry cases into the now empty streets of diagon alley they stopped at the quidditch store to pick up julia package then walked up to the twins shop and helped them close out the day ron showed harry on the bus ride home the beautiful sterling silver raven necklace he got for luna harry could tell ron was excited to send it to her harry followed ron into the house and was completely floored to see the blonde slick hair of draco malfoy staring back at him along with the excited young face of padraig mcnair what are you doing here snapped ron as he saw draco standing in the hallway being held against my will retorted draco ron took a step forward towards draco who did that same ginny ran from the kitchen and stepped between them he not worth it ron ginny stepped in given ron a serious look and then gave draco the same look but harry knew that her look to draco was one of pleading more then threatening he still hasntanswered the question why are you here growled ron because i brought him sneered snape who came from the living room and stepped in front of ron do you have a problem with that mr weasley only if harry does considering it his house ron shot back snape was no longer ron teacher and harry could tell he had no problem mouthing back at him professor snape mr weasley said a very stern dumbledore would you two please excuse yourselves while i talk with harry everyone had crowed around the scene that had unfolded between ron and snape harry saw hermione on the stairway and she motioned for him to come join her after he was done harry nodded his head then followed dumbledore into the living room i sorry i didntget a chance to ask you this sooner and now that mr malfoy and mr mcnair are already here i know it makes my question even harder said dumbledore as he shut the doors to the living room since most of the students went home and most of the professors are doing missions for the order professor snape feels that hogwarts is not safe for his two students so the slytherins think draco and padraig are at school and no one saw professor snape bring them here harry was more concerned about the orders secrecy then draco yes professor snape made sure no one saw them leave and they will go back to hogwarts a day before you do so that it looks like they spent the whole holiday there dumbledore could sense harry concerns but if you do not want them here then i ll have snape stay with them through the break harry took a deep breath and slowly let it out then i guess they can stay but i dontwant draco behaving badly towards anyone in this house harry wanted to have a relaxing break not play referee then i will talk with mr malfoy and mr mcnair dumbledore smiled at harry selflessness hagrid put him down came the screams of hermione harry and dumbledore quickly opened the doors to the living room and were meet with hagrid holding malfoy by the collar with one arm and hoisting him up into the air if yer say one word that hurts anyones fellin i ll pop ya so hard ya wish buckbeak really hurt you roared hagrid put him down you big oaf yelled snape who was coming from the kitchen break him in half hagrid no one will miss him said ron who followed snape you shut up spat snape who turned around and started to go at it with ron lay off him severus you brought draco before talking with anyone of us of course they have the right to be mad said lupin hagrid just put the brat down laughed moody from the stairs within minutes fights had broken out between everyone ron lupin and snape were going at it ginny and hermione were yelling at each other dumbledore was trying to get hagrid to let draco go but mad eye kept egging hagrid on harry just took a seat on the stairs next to padraig who looked completely lost does this always happen asked padraig who had to raise his voice over the shouting only when we have guests said harry who was watching mcgonagall try and separate lupin and snape several hours later everyone was gathered for dinner no one spoke only the sound of utensils and cups could be heard snape draco and padraig sat at one end of the table while ron lupin and hagrid sat at the other harry of course was sitting in the middle with hermione dumbledore the twins mr and mrs weasley and mcgonagall moody and tonks happened to go on patrol right before dinner it wasntuntil dobby and winky entered that anything happened dobby did you and winky get some food asked harry dobby what he doing here said draco from his end of the table whatever he damn well pleases your father let him go said ron as he slowly stood he was tricked into letting him go sneered malfoy who also stood as if getting ready for another fight i hired dobby and he works for me said harry in a loud tone what about that one didntshe use your wand at the quidditch world cup asked draco who softened his tone yes and she now works for the weasley s harry didntfeel like telling draco that he was paying both of them to work draco didntask any more questions but just went back to eating harry potter sir dobby came running over to harry what is it dobby it snowing sir the whole group got up and headed for the back yard it had been snowing for what looked like many hours there was snow back at hogwarts but none had fallen near the city and now they were guaranteed to have a white christmas harry could feel his cheeks tingle with the crisp air while he heard the crunch of snow under his feet but the feeling he wasntexpecting was a snowball to the head got ya yelled ron who was making another snowball harry had quickly made one and threw it at ron who ducked out of the way causing the snowball to hit draco you re dead potter laughed draco pretty soon everyone was throwing a snowball even dobby and winky tried a few harry paused and looked around at everyone enjoying themselves with out a care in the world this is what life will be like said harry under his breath when i finally beat you deep in the forbidden forest an evil wizard sat and felt the surge of power that ran through harry as he spoke his last words potter is growing stronger hissed voldemort i say we kill the little brat now while he not in school suggested bellatrix do you know where he is snapped voldemort no master then hold your tongue voldemort stood and began to pace we do know the other one hasntwoken up yet she was being transported in a ambulance said bellatrix trying to impress her master are you sure it her bella are you sure it julia asked a concerned voldemort i positive my lord but why does she matter once potter is out of the way silence hissed voldemort do you not remember anything i taught you 16 years ago or has azkaban dulled your mind i sorry master i have forgotten why she is important said bellatrix as she bowed her head because of her prophecy if she fulfills hers then potter will succeed in his said the dark lord it was smart of dumbledore to keep her hidden even from harry she must have been blocking me from his mind before we attacked if so then she is much stronger then i anticipated what do you want us to do my lord asked bellatrix see if you can follow aurthur weasley suggested voldemort we ve had people try and follow him for months said bellatrix i want you to follow him bella said voldemort as he circled around her and if i find out where he goes she asked kill him chapter 21 christmas and the truth about julia its christmas morning everyone yelled padraig as he ran down the hallway and jumped down the stairs towards the living room doors slowly opened on the second and third floor harry rubbed his eyes and put his glasses on to look out into the hall ron and ginny looked half awake while hermione looked like she had been up for hours lupin was trying to tie his robe but kept missing the loophole severus i gonna kill ya grumbled mad eye as the group slowly made they re way down into the living room merry christmas shouted padraig who was running around in a santa hat the morning was filled with oohs and ahhs as gifts were being unwrapped from all around the room oh molly i love it cheered mr weasley as he looked at a television set mrs weasley had bought for him what does it do oh professors ya shouldnthave said hagrid who was wearing the new dragon hide vest that the order had bought for him oh merlin gasped mrs weasley at fred and georges gift what did they get ask ron who was downing a chocolate frog there was some space next to our shop and we bought it for mum for her to have her own knitting store smiled fred i mean if she has to torture us with these george held up his g sweater then why not torture everyone the weasley family all grouped together and had a hug as harry watched them he noticed hermione found her gift from him under the tree she unwrapped it then opened the box harry she squealed and threw her arms around him what is it asked tonks hermione showed the round hart shaped locket with the inscription my herat on the front of it then she opened it to show tonks the part of the kissing picture and opposite that was another inscription which read love h j p now i feel like my present isntworth giving said hermione still in shock at harry gift i ll love anything you give me just because it comes from you said harry as he hugged hermione oh gag me with a spoon said ron from the other side of the room i ll remember to say that when i catch you and luna together said hermione ron turned red as always and the twins began to give him guff here said hermione i saw the emeralds and thought of you then i realized what it was and thought it might bring you some luck harry opened the box to find a shamrock with three deep green emeralds as the leaves i didntknow if you d wear a necklace but i can have them make it into an ear ring or bracelet or something else hermione was nervous about the gift i love it said harry whose eyes sparkled a little brighter as he looked at the stones here he turned hermione around and grabbed the locket from her then clasped it around her neck he then gave her his necklace and turned around for her to do the same the shamrock rested just under harry neck while hermione locket hung just above her chest you should probably hand out the pictures now whispered hermione oh yeah harry went over to the corner where he hid the box he put it down in front of the tree then cleared his throat if you d all just give me a minute i have something i d like to say all movement stopped and all eyes were on harry i know we ve gone through a lot together and we still have one more big challenge to overcome but i wanted you all to have something to remember this time by the resurrection of the order and the beginning of voldemort downfall harry paused to look at his adopted family i will do everything it my power not to let you down i promise and with that harry started to pass out the wrapped picture of the order he also gave draco and padraig a wrapped present what this asked draco as he took the gift from harry you know colin never runs out of film said harry as he moved on draco and padraig unwrapped their gifts to find a picture of the eight slytherin all together by the lake by the afternoon things had quieted down significantly hermione was escorted to see her parents and wouldntbe back until tomorrow the weasley all went to check out the space the twins had bought for mrs weasley dumbledore and mcgonagall went back to hogwarts to check in and make sure everything was okay snape had taken draco and padraig somewhere leaving harry with lupin moody tonks dobby and winky harry had received a large photo album from the order the album was full of photos and small pieces of memorabilia related to his parents he went up to julia room to start looking at it merry christmas julia whispered harry as he looked at the still form of his professor i wish you d wake up it would make everyone happy it would make me happy said harry as he looked down at the bed sheets i have so many questions and i feel like you re the only person i can talk to about them oh i got you a christmas present harry put the order picture on her night stand next to the picture of her parents he then pulled up a chair and stared to look through the album they re head boy and girl badge was attached to a photo of the two of them standing at the front of the hall directing first years after the opening feast both james and lily letters informing them of their acceptance into hogwarts was also on the page harry took a long look at each page watching every picture with immense concentration harry soon lost track of time and before to long he heard a soft knock on the door harry came the voice of mcgonagall harry was startled and dropped the album professors i thought you were at hogwarts asked a confused harry i was this afternoon mr potter but it now dinner time she smiled wow okay i ll be down in a moment said an amazed harry mcgonagall smiled and closed the door harry reached down to grab the album and noticed it had opened to the wedding section an invitation to the wedding was on the first page there was a picture of james and lily and after a moment they began to talk james potter said his father and lily evens soon to be potter smiled james invite you to join us on this special day smiled lily what else are you doing joked james james lily smacked him then looked back at harry we hope you to see you there harry didntnoticed but a single tear had formed in his right eye he had no idea that hearing his mother and father would have such and impact he slowly ran his finger around their faces then looked at the next pages several pictures of the wedding were there sirius lupin james and peter all standing together in their finest dress robes and lily and james feeding each other cake a picture taken during the ceremony shows them looking up at dumbledore who holding a very large book then another picture caught harry attention it was a picture of james and lily stand next to two older people harry took a closer look at the picture and felt that he had seen those two older people before he looked up at julia then to the picture of her parents pieces to a puzzle began to slowly came together well first let me introduce our new guest julia is one of the finest auror ireland has but she is also a close friend of mine and i d trust her with my life he reminds me of james i know both he and lily would be very proud of him you cantpush them that hard yet they dontunderstand your reasoning for it everyday we donttrain them is another student we could lose i know you re upset from the vision upset albus if i cantfigure out what i suppose to do he could die i have severed the potter family for five generations as harry started to remember all of these details another came to mind the fear he saw in bellatrix face when julia had shown herself harry could feel the anger boiling within him had dumbledore truly kept this from him harry shaky hand took julia picture from the nightstand and he placed it beside the picture in the album they looked identical except that his picture in the album looked like it had been cut off harry slowly took julia picture out of the frame and noticed a part of it that was bent back he took a deep breath and bent the piece forward he was now looking at the complete picture of his parents with julia parents and julia he looked back at the album and read the caption underneath it james and lily with mr and mrs potter everything slipped out of his hand as he looked up at julia who are you he chocked back the angry tears that were forming at breakneck speed harry had ran out of the room down the stairs and was standing in the kitchen seething mad his eyes were red and his breathing was erratic as he stared at dumbledore harry dear what the matter asked a concerned mrs weasley who is julia roared harry dumbledore face lost all color harry maybe we should who is she harry screamed again dumbledore looked destroyed he knew that harry might find out before he told him the truth and now he could see the consequence of his actions yet again by trying to protect harry he hurt him even deeper this being the deepest cut of all there was no way out of this and the old wizard knew it so he took a moment then looked the angry young man in the face her name is julia genevieve potter and she is your aunt said dumbledore with a great sigh for several moments no one spoke harry continued to stare at dumbledore with complete hatred in his eyes lupin was the first to act and he slowly rose from the table and made his way over to harry harry did you know harry head slowly turned to lupin harry gaze was so piercing that lupin had to look away i did whispered lupin and you spat harry as he looked at mcgonagall who nodded her head he then slowly leaned down on the table and looked at dumbledore you promised you wouldntkeep anything from me again he whispered harry you promised screamed harry as he pounded the table with his fist she my family her blood could have protected me no she couldnthave harry her blood comes from your fathers side and even though he did die to protect you his sacrifice wasntas dramatic as your mothers said dumbledore in a calm voice no one had left the kitchen even lupin was rooted to where he stood all i ve heard in my life is how i have no family left and yet here i am asking you again why you kept something from me not only did you keep the prophecy from me you kept this as harry finished he could hear murmurs around the kitchen did he say prophecy said fred to george go on tell them tell them what the prophecy said you donthave to worry about lying to me any more jeered harry as he continued to give dumbledore and menacing look the lights in the kitchen began to flicker and dumbledore eyes rolled back in his head the one with the power to vanquish the dark lord approaches born to those who have thrice defied him born as the seventh month dies and the dark lord will mark him as his equal but he will have power the dark lord knows not and either must die at the hand of the other for neither can live while the other survives the one with the power to vanquish the dark lord will be born as the seventh month dies the reverberating voice that came from dumbledore scared everyone including harry but he did not show it the kitchen had become so still that no one was breathing even dobby and winky stood in complete awe now here a prophecy for you the one with the power to vanquish the dark lord doesntcare go find someone else to play hero because i done with that harry left the kitchen kicking the door behind him he walked back up to his room where he slammed the door to make it seem like he wasntcoming back out but he had another plan he grabbed his broom invisibility clock and his order robe and quickly tiptoed back down the stairs he never going to trust us again harry heard dumbledore say albus you had to keep julia a secret not just for harry sake but for hers said mcgonagall trying to comfort the headmaster maybe someone should talk to him voiced a concerned lupin no one going to be able to talk with him now professor he been betrayed by the only family he has ever known when all he ever done was love us you best leave it for tomorrow morning to harry surprise his best friend ron had just spoke those words but they werentenough to keep harry from leaving he threw on his robe then his cloak and quietly slipped out the door moments later he was flying high over london he flew for almost an hour until he landed in the back yard of a familiar house harry landed in the shadows and stayed there for several minutes keeping his invisibility cloak on mad eye might be crazy but he knew what he was doing because harry soon saw two death eaters land in the middle of the back yard why do we patrol this muggle house again said one of the death eaters just in case those muggles related to potter show up said the other who was looking around they re not coming back look they got sheets on the furniture the house hasntbeen lived in for several months complained the death eater lord voldemort wants to be sure so that why we check every now and then besides it nice to get out of the forest that place creeps me out said the death eater who looked right at harry you aintkidding well we probably could stop in at the hog head before we go back to the forest the death eater began to mount his broom the other death eater continued to stare at the area where harry stood harry had slowly pulled out his wand and had it pointing at the death eater just in case sure you can buy me a butterbeer said the death eater as he turned around and mounted his broom once they were gone harry waited another half an hour before moving he slowly crept up to the sliding glass doors and pointed his wand at them alohomora he whispered he heard the clicking of the door unlock and pulled it open and quickly stepped in he closed the curtains so that no one could see into the house he finally took off the invisibility cloak and stood for a moment in the dinning room lumos minimus a small light appeared at the end of his wand harry couldntbelieve he was back in the durley house but he knew no one would look for him here everything had sheets over it the house had an eerie feeling to it and for a moment harry considered flying to the leaky caldron he slowly walked into the hallway leading to the front door he stopped for a moment and looked at the now much smaller door of the cupboard under the stairs he leaned against the opposite wall and slowly slid down it until he was sitting on the floor facing the cupboard all those years i was trying to get out and now here i am trying to get back in whispered harry to himself he reached forward and opened the door it looked as though no one had cleaned it since he last occupied it those six years ago harry took out his wand and pointed it to the little cupboard scourgify the cobwebs and dust bunnies vanished and the cupboard looked bran new again harry squeezed himself into the small space and closed the door as he sat with his knees in his chest a strange feeling overcame him for the first time in years harry didntfeel like the boy who lived he felt like harry the boy who no one noticed a sensation he had wished to feel so many times in these last years he thought it strange how this small space which was his sanctuary as a small boy would become it again in his young adult life his thoughts then drifted back to julia as harry went over all the events in the last couple of months everything seemed to make much more sense he then thought about what he might have said if julia was awake would he have yelled at her too harry began to feel disgusted with himself it seems that whenever some new piece of information came crashing down on him his instinct was to run but what else was he to do he never had a mentor or a real parent to teach him otherwise all he had was his raw emotions and his gut instinct they had served him well up to this point what if something happened to julia while he was gone harry now cursed himself for only thinking about his needs he wouldntbe mad at julia when she woke up harry had the feeling that she was kept away by dumbledore but what if she didntwake up this thought now loomed in harry mind what if he lost one more person he could call family he drove the thought out some how he could feel that julia was going to be okay harry decided to get some rest he curled into a ball and put the invisibility cloak over him just incase any one wandered in his last thoughts were about the new family he might have an aunt that would actually love and care for him and a home he could go to any time he needed to an outsider it might seem ironic that in a place where harry only found misery and despair hope would blossom and a chance to finally have what harry has dreamed of all his life a family chapter 25 the elements of love ron what are you talking about luna could see harry getting angry behind ron what if lestrange knew that harry and hermione were together they wouldnthave let her go they would have taken her and expected harry to come after them as he always does he doesntrealize the trouble he putting hermione in ron looked down at his book ron i sure harry thought about all that before asking her out said luna who was still keeping an eye on harry yeah but there are things he doesntknow about hermione parents had to go into hiding this summer and that why she was at grimmauld place i just dontwant her to get hurt as ron finished speaking harry slowly began to step back behind the bookshelf and away from hermione memories of the night voldemort controlled him came flooding back harry what is it whispered hermione but as she reached out to touch him harry backed away he pulled an object out from behind his back it was the invisibility cloak harry quickly threw it on and ran out of the library as fast as he could he didntstop until he was safely in his room with the door locked behind him he took the cloak off and turned to see his reflection in the mirror how could you have been so selfish you knew she would be a target once you started dating came the reflection in the mirror i thought i could protect her i thought if we faced voldemort together voldemort is your problem not hers not only are you asking hermione and ron to fight in this battle but you want them to fight your battle too no said harry as he looked down when he looked back up at the mirror it was back to normal he stood there for a moment looking at his scar he turned away in anger and proceeded to go to bed ever since that night with voldemort harry had been getting restful nights he assumed voldemort didntwant to try anything until he could have figured out what was going on harry soon found sleep but he would not find rest as he began to hear voices what have are spies told us about this girl came the raspy voice of voldemort they found out that the teachers regard her as the brightest witch in school they even say she ll be one of the greatest witches of her time came the shaky voice of wormtail a mudblood will never be as powerful as a pureblood snapped voldemort have you been able to get back into potters head master asked wormtail no said the dark lord grimly i think this mudblood might be blocking me but i dontthink its conscience i think it has to do with how she feels towards potter said voldemort sir i dontunderstand whispered wormtail its ancient magic the kind dumbledore used to protect potter for so long at that muggle house said voldemort dismissively there is a book which contains ancient spells and their purpose there is only one copy remaining and it belongs to the images started to disappear harry tried to concentrate on voldemort as hard as he could but he couldntreconnect to him as harry began to wake up he heard a knock on his door harry you in there came the sweet voice of hermione he slowly got out of bed and headed for the door just as his hand was reaching for the door he stopped ron right whispered harry to himself he pulled back his hand and leaned his head against the door harry please let me in said hermione leaning closer to the door look i dontcare what the risk is we can do this together harry turned his back to the door and slowly slid down it his thoughts lingering on what lupin had said that night in the hospital hermione chose to be your friend and she chose to stand by you through everything you ve gone through what if you re wrong lupin whispered harry what if love isntenough to protect her harry crawled back into bed and decided to try and sleep again maybe tomorrow he could figure out what to do harry stayed in his room for most of the day getting homework done and trying to figure out what to do about hermione throughout the day both she and ron would knock on his door asking him if he would talk to them it was late afternoon by the time he sneaked out of his room several of the books that sirius left hermione were lying on the ground harry grabbed the faded green one on top and headed for an empty classroom he needed to get out of his room and take his mind off everything he opened the book to take a look as he walked down the hall the first page was written in a language harry didntunderstand it dawned on him that this was the book hermione had been talking about before she got hurt he changed his direction and headed for julia classroom hoping she might be in her office julia are you here he shouted as he entered her classroom yes harry no need to shout i in my office said julia in his head sorry he responded back harry made his way up to the office and placed the faded green book in front of julia before you and hermione got hurt we wanted to show you this book as harry finished speaking he noticed that julia had stopped writing and was looking at the book as if it were alive rosie called julia the bird flew over to the desk and looked at the book that it harry heard rosie exclaim that what asked a very confused harry this is the book we ve been searching for harry if i right this book as the spell the sorting hat was talking about rosie go get dumbledore and have him come down here right away the bird took off and left julia alone with harry so you understand the language it written in asked harry as he watched julia open the book of course it written in irish gaelic said julia as she kept looking at the book julia harry tone changing a little do you think i should not go out with hermione any more donttell me you ve stopped loving her i see the two of you at the gryffindor table all the time i couldntpicture a happier couple oh no it not that harry pause trying to find the right words i worried she going to get hurt because voldemort knows i love her oh julia seemed a little less concerned i believe lupin had a talk with you in the hospital while the two of us were sleeping did he not yes said harry so what changed why do you feel worried again well hermione and i were in the library and we overheard ron talking about how he couldntwait for hermione to realize that if she stays with me she going to get hurt harry couldntmake eye contact as he told the story so then what are you worried about voldemort trying to hurt hermione or hermione leaving you asked julia harry had to think for a moment maybe that was it maybe he was just assuming hermione would leave him but she hadntso far i guess you re right maybe i was more scared about hermione leaving smiled harry i going to let you in on a little secret harry it wasnta big surprise to anyone who knows you that you choose the strongest smartest and feistiest witch here to use a muggle expression you guys were made for each other the young witch smiled at her nephew harry smiled to himself it was good to have a family member again he thought just then an old wizard appeared at the door you sent for me julia asked dumbledore harry stiffened as he heard the old wizards voice yes i think harry found the book we were looking for said julia might i ask where you found it it was one of the books that sirius left hermione said harry as he looked dumbledore in the eye can you translate it julia i can but it going to take some time the spell is simple but the instructions are a little vague said julia still looking at the book i will cover your classes tomorrow so you can focus on translating it imperative that we perform the spell as soon as possible the seriousness in dumbledore tone caught harry attention why is it so important that we perform the spell so soon asked harry you see harry just like all things in life love can fluctuate some times it high and some times it low just like the ocean said dumbledore as he eyed harry if i not mistaken you and mr weasley are not on the best of terms today how did you know said harry sounding defensive well i actually figured it out harry said julia from behind the book you asked me about why i was glowing that day i stopped bellatrix i never really answered your question because once i told everyone about my prophecy i thought you d figure it out figure what out asked a confused harry we re connected harry when you re hurt i ll know when you re angry i ll feel it and yes even when your happy i ll know it i woke up that day because you were in danger that glow you saw was a side effect of a spell dumbledore performed on you and i when you were just a baby said julia have you always been able to do that asked harry julia didntanswer for a moment the first time i felt it was when you were six i sent an owl to dumbledore and he explained that dudley had beaten you up and threw you in a closet every time i felt something i would send an owl and every time it was because you were sad or hurt it wasntuntil you were in hogwarts that i felt true happiness she paused again and deep sadness from you i knew voldemort had come back after your forth year because i never felt you as scared as you were that night when dumbledore told me about it i immediately sped up my training at the academy how come i dontfeel you asked harry because the spell was meant for julia to protect you in times of great danger a side effect of the spell is that she can also feel extreme emotion from you yesterday julia felt a great sadness and she asked ms granger about it today explained dumbledore she told me you overheard something that wasntvery kind but you didntstick around to hear the rest julia rose from her desk and looked harry in the eye ron said he couldntwait for hermione to break up with me what more did i need to hear that ron didntmean it said julia what mr weasley figured out you and ms granger were hiding so he thought that by saying something that would upset you you d come out of hiding dumbledore slowly put his hand on harry shoulder hermione been trying to tell you all day but you wouldntcome out of your room smiled julia so that means you should go talk with ron and hermione julia continued harry began to leave the classroom harry you still haventforgiven dumbledore and he wanted me to talk to hermione to make sure we could clear up the mess for you harry heard julia say in his head harry paused and looked back at the old wizard he opened his mouth to speak but nothing came out i sorry was all harry could think of as he left the classroom he slowly walked back to gryffindor tower hoping that julia and dumbledore hadntbeen leading him on he walked into the common room to find hermione and ron both doing homework ron said harry softly harry said hermione standing up from the desk look mate i didntmean it i was just trying to get a rise out of you you know hoping you d come out of hiding i mean i figured you might pop me one but i couldntthink of anything else to say ron said nervously harry could see in his eyes that ron meant what he said so all those things you said asked harry complete rubbish look i told you before if it couldntbe me then i glad it you besides i dontthink my girlfriend would appreciate me thinking of another girl smiled ron girlfriend ron been keeping a secret from us said hermione who took a step closer to harry he and luna have been dating since we got back from winter break that great exclaimed harry you missed the tongue lashing ron received from luna smiled hermione oh dontremind me once hermione came out from behind the bookshelf she looked as thought she was about to kill me and so did luna so i quickly had to explain that i figured out you two were feeding her info about malfoy by the way hermione you never told me why you two were doing it in the first place ron gave her a look we ll explain all that after dinner she said trying to side step the question so then we re okay asked harry still trying to figure everything out as long as you are mate smiled ron great because i have some things to tell you said harry as he put his arms over both ron and hermione harry explained what he learned in julia office about the book and julia strange glow so it was in that faded green book said hermione as they walked to the great hall yes julia said it was the book they ve been looking for said harry do you suppose this spell is similar to the one dumbledore did on you and julia asked ron it must be it will link the four of us together and we ll probably experience some of the things julia has hermione said with excitement you re awfully anxious to perform this spell noticed ron well i ve read about the kind of spell it is word has it that merlin himself performed this type of spell with king arthur said hermione the group entered the great hall harry remained quiet for most of the evening he kept thinking about dumbledore face as he left julia office harry what is it asked hermione who had noticed harry silence julia reminded me that i still haventforgiven dumbledore every time i see him i take a different hallway or dart into a classroom just to avoid him said harry as he played with his food well maybe it time to forgive him suggested hermione you never know how much time you have with a person before they re gone harry could tell hermione wanted him to forgive dumbledore he slowly rose from the table and headed to the teachers table but as he approached he noticed the teachers whispering back and forth to each other what wrong asked harry as he stepped towards the table dementors said dumbledore they re coming chapter 26 the da is tested coming as in right now asked a worried harry yes rosie has just informed julia that they re massing at voldemorts camp and slowly heading this way a worried look on dumbledore face madam pomfrey do the children not fighting have those pendants you created yes headmaster said the nurse good activate them now instructed the wizard madam pomfrey took out a pendant and began to chant harry turned around to see all the children not fighting begin to fall asleep the rest of the students looked up towards the teacher table to see what was going on dumbledore stood and walked around the table to address the children it seems tonight will be our first test as an army at this moment dementors are heading towards the castle several screams echoed the hall i would ask that anyone who feels confident that they can conjure a patronus please follow julia to the main hall the rest of you remain here while the teachers and i split you up into groups to harry surprise people didntrun or scream everyone took out their wands and stood ready to fight he along with julia began to head towards the main hall several of the da members followed dobby fetch harry and my broom she asked the house elf as they left the great hall right here the plan ron ginny draco dean susan and zacharias head to the astronomy tower hermione luna cho neville seamus and hannah guard the doors ron will be covering your group from above said julia as she took her broom from dobby dobby also brought order robes for harry ron hermione and julia thanks dobby said harry as he put his robe on and started to head for the door dontworry harry potter dobby will be helping squeaked the house elf harry looked back at hermione and ron dontworry we ll be okay said ron in a shaky voice hermione walked up to harry and gave him a kiss remember that while you re out there she whispered in his ear harry gave her his boyish grin as he walked out side to mount his broom once he and julia took off the two groups just stood there for a moment you heard julia let take our places outside said hermione as she took out her wand right my group lets get up to that tower said ron as they ran up towards the tower it was an eerie night the moon was fighting to come out from behind the clouds and the forest which normally was restless was calm as a graveyard harry and julia slowly flew above the castle so they could see over the treetops the air began to get cold and harry knew the dementors were getting closer rosie what going on said julia out loud they soon saw the bird flying from the direction of hagrid hut they re coming from over there panted rosie julia and harry slowly flew towards hagrid hut ron they re coming from over there shouted harry as he flew over ron group ron leaned over the tower wall to shout out to hermione hermione over there she pointed to where harry and julia were flying yeah yelled ron hermione watch harry with intense concentration she knew that once he started to fight her group would be next wands at the ready everyone stick close to each other hermione instructed harry and julia continued to watch the treetops for any movement it wasntuntil the moon finally was able to shine that harry saw the hundred or so dementors heading towards them steady harry whispered julia when i say now we ll both shout out the spell we ll probably only get one shout before they try to circle us take you re patronus and circle it to cover us from behind the dementors approach was methodically slow and as they got closer they began to spread out ready harry whispered julia who broom was starting to freeze ready breathed harry now expecto patronum they both shouted a stag and eagle leaped out of they re wands and began to take out dementors but as harry swung his around it began to disappear from hitting so many dementors expecto patronum harry shouted but in the back of his mind he feared they might be out numbered hermione watched as dementors charged at harry and julia but once one group was taken care of another group would move in and each time getting closer and closer to julia and harry hermione shouted ron from the tower look he was pointing to a group of dementors that now appeared to the right of the one already attacking this new group was heading straight for the astronomy tower wait for this new group to get closer said hermione as everyone began to point their wands up towards the sky but hermione what about harry and julia asked neville i ll worry about them you worry about that new group said hermione yeah but hermione what about hermione neville turned around to see hermione sprinting towards hagrid hut harry to your left shouted julia as she attacked another group of dementors both julia and harry were getting weaker and weaker harry began to hear his mother scream but fought to stay awake expecto patronum he shouted but his stag only took out a few dementors julia was now shouting out the spell every second as the dementors closed in on them harry julia shouted he had almost fallen off his broom hermione was now right underneath harry and julia and saw harry almost fall from his broom she jumped into the pen next to hagrid hut and bowed to buckbeak but as she mounted the creature she felt someone watching her she looked over her shoulder to see a pair of snake eye stair at her from the forest voldemort hermione whispered to herself she quickly got buckbeak off the ground and headed towards harry as she got closer she pulled out her wand and cleared her throat expecto patronum she yelled an otter came hopping out of her wand and smacked enough dementors that allowed hermione to fly in and get julia and harry harry get on she said as she grabbed him and pulled him onto buckbeak she then helped julia get on just as the demntors were coming back for another attack let go buckbeak hermione you re flying breathed a weak harry dontremind me she said as they got closer towards the school hermione landed the creature and let neville help julia and harry off hermione look cried luna who was pointing in the direction of the lake hermione looked over to see dementors hovering on the other side of the lake they re just staying there said cho meanwhile up on the tower ron and his group were also starting to lose their battle everybody let get in a circle that way they cantget us from behind shouted ron good idea weasley said draco as he took his place next to ron malfoy we re not going to make it whispered ron hermione group continued to try and help ron but they would only get a few dementors here and there luna find a house elf and have them get some chocolate for julia and harry also have them find the other groups and have them meet me at the edge of the lake hermione yelled ron from the tower hermione looked up to see ron group was almost surrounded she got buckbeak in the air and again shouted the spell the dementors were pushed back far enough for her to get up to the tower granger let me on draco yelled as she flew over them hermione quickly landed buckbeak and helped draco get on head straight for them when i say now we ll both shout out the spell then we ll turn around and come back for another pass said draco has they took off hermione made buckbeak gather up some speed then started to charge the dementors now expecto patronum the otter and snake took out so many dementors that when they turned around for another go the dementors were gone ron get your group down here said hermione as they flew past the tower she landed buckbeak and slid off the creature and headed straight for harry who was being fed chocolate by winky winky where are the others panted hermione they re coming miss she said while handing julia some chocolate ron we have to get down to the lake hermione said as ron and his group appeared at the door why what going on at the lake asked harry as he slowly stood up that what going on julia pointed to the growing group of dementors that were waiting on the other side of the lake the two groups slowly walked down to the lake minutes later the rest of the school joined them dumbledore stood in the middle along with harry hermione ron and julia when i say now i want everyone to shout out the spell the headmaster instructed no one move until i say so the dementors finally started to move but just as slow as before harry was still weak and had to lean on hermione hold my hand she said and as harry did so he found more strength hermione looked over to the forest and saw the snake eyes looking straight at her what is it asked a concerned harry voldemort she whispered harry muscles started to stiffen and hermione could tell harry wanted to run over to the forest and face the wizard not now harry you ll have your time came the weak voice of julia the dementors were getting closer and people started to get restless steady dumbledore said in a strong voice ron grabbed luna hand as did draco with ginny s wands at the ready dumbeldore shouted in unison everyone wand pointed towards the lake which was starting to freeze dumbledore took a deep breath and harry knew it was time now in one glorious chorus the spell rang out into the night but instead of seeing a stag eagle otter lion or snake all they saw was one patronus a griffin that stood four stories high was standing on the lake the light emanated from everyone wand the griffin took one step and gave out a war like cry causing all of the dementors to flee it then turned to its masters and bowed before it disappeared no one moved nor spoke for several moments following until a familiar laugh echoed through the air voldemort harry scream as he started to sprint towards the forest hermione and ron were in close pursuit followed by julia and the rest of the school come out and face me you coward harry screamed as he ran but once he was close to the forest the eyes were gone only the faint sound of the laugh could be heard harry turned back towards his classmates and saw the worried look on their faces i not afraid harry turned back towards the forest do you hear that i not afraifd neither are we harry neville stepped forward and put his arm around harry neither are we the group slowly walked back into the castle harry saw lupin moody bill charlie and tonks all talking by the door as they approached the school is secure albus grumbled moody professor lupin did you see the patronus asked neville i did well done all of you lupin smiled with pride at all the students many of whom he taught many students were excited to see him and talked with him as they walked back into the great hall can all the professors and auror please follow me dumbledore asked as they all headed to the teachers table the castle is secure sir but i cantbe sure about the grounds huffed moody bill charlie and i were going sweep the edge of the forest and make sure there arentan lingering dementors said lupin good i think we ll keep the children in here tonight just to be sure said dumbledore who looked tired good idea tonks and i will keep watch over the hall while the ghosts and house elves patrols the rest of the castle said moody headmaster what about the other children asked snape we ll have to alter their memory and make sure they re in bed before the other children wake up tomorrow madam pomfrey added it going to get harder and harder to fool them especially if they re parents begin to send owls asking what going on at the school said dumbledore we ll just have to ask the ministry to keep any events like this one tonight out of the papers said julia as she watched house elves place bowls of chocolate on the tables for the children an hour or so later the children were in sleeping bags and lying on the floor harry managed to get a spot next to hermione who was watching draco and ron talk about different strategies for the battle how long have they been talking asked harry and he leaned on his elbows to watch about twenty minute and counting laughed hermione has the conversation been civil very they ve even laughed a few times yawned hermione she laid her head back down on the pillow and watched looked at harry he was watching me tonight she said in a low voice harry turned to look at hermione and he knew who she was talking about when did you notice harry also laid his head down when i went to get buckbeak i saw these menacing eye looking at me from the forest and for the rest of the night i felt like i was being watched hermione shivered as she spoke harry grabbed her hand and held it to his heart dontworry he not after you no he after us what makes you say that asked harry because together we re stronger then he is and once we perform that spell he ll be after ron and julia too whispered hermione but dontworry i not scared she smiled i know harry smiled when do you think julia will have the spell translated i dontknow dumbledore said he d cover for her tomorrow while she did it said harry that would be great a defense class with dumbledore teaching think of all the things we could learn hermione said as her eyes lit up harry chuckled it always learning with you yeah well one of the three of us should pay attention in class otherwise we d all be dead by now even when i was petrified i helped you figure out how the basilisk moved around the castle teased hermione it true i dontknow where ron and i would be with out your help brilliant weasley just brilliant came the voice of draco harry and hermione both laughed then closed their eyes draco glanced over at them then to ginny weasley is it weird to see potter and granger together draco whispered as he looks at a piece of parchment ron had drawn on to show draco several maneuvers the air squadron should perform it was weird at first but then it felt like they d always been together said ron who was looking at a piece of parchment draco had drawn on why do you fancy someone i do but it kinda complicated said draco trying to change the subject well does she like you asked ron looking up from the parchment yes then what the problem asked ron see the thing is her brother doesntlike me much and i dontthink he d approve draco said sounds like a big prat to me but dontworry keep doing things like you did tonight and i sure he ll see you re on the up and up smiled ron well i should probably get some rest i ll have to hate you again in the morning said ron as he laid his head down night weasel night money bags chapter 27 the bond is complete the great hall was uncommonly quiet the next morning the students who hadntfought would ask questions here and there about what their friends had done the night before each student coming up with their own unique answer but as harry ate his breakfast he could tell that the students now understood just how serious this battle might be it was in their eye now as if they d grown up over night this type of look was mostly in the older students but harry could see some of the first second and third years look away from their groups and think and he knew what they were thinking about the trio finished their food and headed for class even hermione and ron had that look about them which harry thought strange since they had been through so much already but then again this battle would be nothing like what they ve faced everyone took their seats and opened their books a moment or two later the door opened and all of the books closed themselves at the same time you will not be needing your books today said dumbledore as he walked to the front of the room if you all could move up to the back of the class room while i move the desks everyone did as instructed but instead of using his wand dumbledore waved his hand and the desks began to move on their own they neatly stacedk themselves on the sides of the room whispers began to spread across the class is he going to teach us wand less magic gasped hermione your assumption ms granger is correct smiled dumbledore how did he hear that whispered ron i hear a great many things mr weasley now if you d all come forward we ll begin said dumbledore the students slowly moved to the front were the headmaster stood to quote our dear professor hagrid did you ever make anything happen anything you couldntexplain when you were angry or scared memories of that night came flooding back to harry hagrid explaining that he was a wizard learning that his parents didntdie in a car accident and that he would be attending hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry harry closed his eyes for a moment and remembered walking down diagon alley for the first time everything seemed so new and interesting but little did harry know back then the burden he d be carrying six years later i believe you experienced something this past break did you not mr potter dumbledore said as he eyed harry it wasntuntil hermione squeaked and grabbed his hand that he understood what professor dumbledore was talking about i called for my wand harry said softly but you called it by using the same charm a wizard would use if they had their wand today i will teacher you to call for you wand with out words or movement for i feel this will help all of you greatly in the battle everyone began to whisper until dumbledore cleared his throat please place your wands over by me then form a line five feat away this is going to be amazing hermione whispered with glee as they walked back and formed a line the first thing you have to understand about wand less magic is that you need to want the object you re calling emotion plays a very important role in this form of magic dumbledore said as he paced back and forth it almost has to be instinctive crucio with out warning harry felt an immense pain but within seconds it was gone harry found himself on his hands and knees looking at the floor trying to catch his breath the group was in amazement and as harry looked around he noticed hermione was holding her wand and dumbledore wasn t what happened he asked as draco and ron helped him up no one spoke but all eyes kept darting between hermione and dumbledore it would seem dumbledore said quietly that has mastered the art of wand less magic fairly quick i sorry for any pain i might have caused you harry ron what happened asked harry trying to figure out what happened i uh i dunno it happened so fast ron said still in shock dumbledore used the crucio spell on you and then hermione had her wand all of a sudden and cried out the expelliarmus charm would you describe what you felt when you saw harry in pain asked dumbledore i dontknow i guess i needed to stop it some how and the only way to do that was with my wand hermione said with her wand still in a death like grip so the only thought you had was that you needed your wand dumbledore said with a mischievous smile hermione slowly nodded let see if harry can master the same thing and just as harry could see dumbledore forming the words he reached out his hand and his wand came snapping to it expelliarmus cried harry for the second time that day the class was stunned with what they saw the headmaster began to laugh as his wand came floating back into his hand very good harry anticipation this is the most important thing if you begin to anticipate what the person you re fighting will do then you can counter before they strike harry could tell in my mannerisms that i was about to perform the crucio spell on and acted pride that oozed from dumbledore as he spoke but professor how can we study people we dontknow asked draco ah a good point mr malfoy we might not understand every person in the battle but we know they re death eaters and that they have certain patterns that they follow that will be a lesson julia will teach next time the da meets as if on cue julia came bursting out of the office and ran down the small flight of stairs towards dumbledore and the group i got it she shouted but i need to know what the weather will be like tonight mostly cloudy piped up hermione what are you a weather man as well joked ron some of us like to know the weather so we can pick out a correct outfit she shot back what are you guys working on asked a confused julia wand less magic said harry can you do it asked ron julia smiled at him and walked over and placed her wand in his hand hold on to is as tight as you can she winked as she walked away she then turned towards the groups everyone ready the group shook their heads with excitement she stretched out her arm and a second later the wand was in her hand weasel she told you to hold it smirked draco i did ron exclaimed you want to try draco julia asked as she walked towards the group again sure he smiled with confidence as she placed the wand in his hand ready ready draco said as he gripped the wand with two hands but a moment later it flew out of his grip and into julia out stretched hand you could be the strongest man in the world but i d still get that wand laughed julia and why is that julia asked the headmaster because my need for the wand is greater then your need to hold it explained julia now i want everyone to place their wands five feet in front of them and work on having it come to you i dontwant to hear any sound while you do this i ll be back to check on you momentarily said dumbledore as he and julia walked towards her office the students all did what they were told no one was going to mess around when it came to the headmasters instructions surprisingly neville was the next person to get his wand to come to him how d you do it whispered ron who was standing next to him i dontknow i just thought about attacking the person that hurt my parents neville trailed off for a moment no one knew what to say until hermione stepped forward dontworry neville you ll get her a strange understanding past between neville and hermione at first harry didntunderstand why but then realized that hermione must still feel embarrassed that bellatrix got the best of her he made a mental note to watch hermione very carefully during the battle the rest of the day was very strange for harry it seemed that anyone involved with the da knew something harry didn t they would keep glaring at him and hermione sometimes ron would mention some of the looks he would receive walking down the hall but none of them could figure out why as harry got ready for bed that night he wondered why julia had not told him anything about the spell and when they would perform it but just as harry started to close his eyes dobby appeared at the foot of his bed harry potter sir squeaked the house elf harry sat up with his wand in hand but put the object down once he saw it was only dobby dobby what are you doing here he asked dobby was told to come get harry potter and have him come down to the lake smiled the house elf why asked harry dobby only knows that he is to give harry potter these clothes and ask him to come down to the lake to meet dumbledore the house elf started to head for the door when harry noticed the white t shirt and red shorts that were on his chair dobby am i allowed to wear anything else besides the t shirt and short harry asked as he eyed the items only wear what on the chair harry potter dobby said as he left the room harry quickly changed into the outfit and walked out of his room well they have the gryffindor logo on them he heard ron say as he walked into their common room harry what going on asked hermione whose shorts were rolled up a little and revealed more of her legs i dontknow harry said as he checked out his girlfriend but i ll guess we ll find out once we head down to the lake the trio briskly walked through the halls of the castle hoping no one would see them once they were outside they noticed a large bonfire and the da standing in a horseshoe well this is going to be embarrassing ron laughed nervously they continued to walk down to the lake and into the middle of the large group julia was also wearing the white t shirt and shorts while dumbledore mcgonagall and snape gathered around a table next to the fire dumbledore slowly turned and addressed them i sorry for the lack of clothing but this ritual is normally done in the nude smiled the headmaster this is fine ron laughed this ritual was first done on king arthur merlin guinevere and sir lancelot hundreds of years ago merlin knew that if he created this bond between the four of them that arthur reign of peace would last for many years unfortunately the only way to break this spell was if one of the members betrayed arthur as some of you may know guinevere and lancelot both betrayed arthur with their affair merlin performed the ritual in front of arthur brave knights to show them how dedicated arthur was in his mission dumbledore paused for a moment that is why i asked all of you hear tonight to witness the commitment these four people have for the task before us dumbledore walked over to the four standing in the middle and began to arrange them so hermione julia and ron were in a triangle and harry stood in the middle harry had to his back to the fire and dumbledore and was looking right at hermione julia was to his right and ron to his left dumbledore walked around and whispered things in everyone ear harry he said in a hushed voice these three each have a line they must say once hermione has said her line then you must say this and i am the element that binds them all together then you will drink from the cup that i present to you and once you finish it all of you will say this may these elements of love guide and protect us until we walk with the souls that came before do you understand harry asked a solemn dumbledore yes professor harry whispered then let the ritual begin shouted dumbledore i asked four of you to step forward and speak for the character of those before us harry was too scared to move his head this spell was a lot more serious then he thought he soon saw ginny standing behind hermione but julia and ron were standing right on the edge of harry vision so he could not see who stood behind them who speaks for julia potter character whispers began to circle through the crowd did he just say potter i wonder if she related to harry i didntthink harry had any family were several of the things harry heard before dumbledore cleared his throat remus lupin speaks for julia potter character lupin said in a clear voice harry smiled and was glad that lupin was some how involved in the ritual he had become a father figure to him in some many ways this year he hoped that once the battle was over he could spend some quality time with lupin and julia who speaks for ronald weasley character asked the old wizard the group became deathly quiet harry wished he could see but still did not want to move his head but when he heard the next person voice it took every ounce of discipline not to look draco malfoy speaks for ronald weasley character said draco harry could only imagine what ron face must have looked like when he heard draco who speaks for hermione granger character ginevra weasley speaks for hermione granger character and finally who speaks for harry potter character as dumbledore was saying the question harry started to race through all his classmates until he heard the person voice and new it was the right choice neville longbottom speaks for harry potters character then step forwards and perform your duties instructed dumbledore neville appeared in front of harry with a knife in his hand have you palms face up said a nervous neville you re doing great neville thank you whispered harry those little words of encouragement seemed to work and neville calmed down this will only hurt for a moment neville said right before cutting both the insides of harry palms harry winced a little but kept his palms up then neville stepped out of the circle along with the others dumbledore walked over to julia with a cup and asked her to let some of her blood drip in i am the element bond by blood said julia dumbledore walked over to ron next and had him do the same as julia i am the element bond by choice ron said with surprising clarity dumbledore then moved over to hermione i am the element bond by destiny hermione said as she let her blood drip into the cup the headmaster then turned towards harry and had him drip some of his blood into the cup electricity filled the air and harry could feel the hair on the back of his neck stand up and i am the element that binds them all together said harry who was presented with the cup harry took a deep breath and began to drink it it tasted mostly like a sweet fruit drink to his surprise once harry was done he handed the cup back to dumbledore who exited the triangle julia ron and hermione all clasped hands to create a circle around harry may these elements of love guide and protect us until we walk with the souls that came before they said in once voice for a moment nothing happened until harry notice hermione eyes were glowing the white glow began to take over her whole body and soon the glow began to transfer over to him harry had never felt such strength and energy before soon all he could see was the blinding white light that surrounded his group he looked up and notice the beam of light had shot up to the heavens the clouds parted and for a moment harry saw three figures looking down on him it was his parents and sirius dontworry harry said his mother we ll protect you his father added when the time is right smiled sirius a great sense of peace washed over harry just before he passed out chapter 28 the destiny of others for the past couple of months hogwarts had become a strange place after the ritual harry had woken up in the hospital wing along with ron hermione and julia once everyone was up dumbledore did a few tests to see if the spell had worked he sent harry to the lake and had moody attack him as soon as harry felt the fear dumbledore could see the glow appear in ron julia and hermione eyes this new bond made things a little more interesting they werenttelepathic but the trio and julia could pick up on things and communicate them with unbelievable speed the best example was when ron would slip away and try to meet with luna every time they began to snog luna would comment that ron eyes would glow for a moment ron would come back to the common room and try to act as if he just went to the library but every time he walked in harry and hermione would make kissing noises just to poke fun but the fun would only last for a little while until they remembered why they had the bond in the first place every saturday the da would meet to train and become more efficient and it was beginning to show they had recently begun to create mock scenarios and make the groups figure out how to handle them harry group had some how become surrounded by death eaters and the other four groups in his row had to figure out how to help him but not break they re line luna in the next row stepped her group up to fill the gap where harry group should have been then started focusing completely on hitting the attackers until harry and his group could retreat back they didntalways do physical training one of their meetings was about defense for the castle and the army dumbledore decided to have order robes made up for everyone but instead of the deep blue order color dumbledore instructed the house elves to create them by house colors and then make all the teachers and adults silver they also ordered extra brooms in case ones were destroyed during the battle moody and ron insisted that the air squadron was key to a victory all these things continued while the students tried to focus on their studies but as the end of term began to slowly approach all anyone could think of was the battle the only break came when gryffindor played ravenclaw for the quidditch cup you feeling alright mate you look a bit peekish asked ron as he stuffed his mouth with eggs i didntget much sleep last night harry whispered as he played with his food you were having some type of dream werentyou hermione asked i cantexplain it it was like that dream i had in the fall but different there were people fighting all around me but i was flying around and dodging most of it then i saw myself standing in front of voldemort harry paused for a moment you two were standing behind me and we each were glowing a little bit then somehow i knocked off the broom and i look up to see that blinding light again sounds like julia had another vision whispered hermione i thought so too but have either of you felt her today i can t harry said in a worried tone he looked up at the teacher table and didntsee her there she probably getting some extra rest before the game harry dontforget how tired seers get after a vision said hermione trying to calm harry down yeah maybe you re right harry said in a more relaxed tone hermione always did know how to calm his fears if only for a moment come on harry grab some toast we should start to head down to the pitch said ron as he went over to the ravenclaw table to talk with luna here hermione said as she handed harry a napkin with a little breakfast sandwich in side you play better when you ve eaten she smiled at him thanks he whispered softly hermione had been nothing short of amazing this whole year and harry felt bad he couldntdo more to show her how much he appreciated all her support hey hermione placed her hand on his cheek and a faint glow accented her eyes lets just focus on quidditch for the moment she took out a piece of paper that had some notes on it cho is probably the best seeker at shadowing she a very good flyer but isntquick enough to spot the snitch but she makes up for it by watching the other seeker wait a minute when did you become a quidditch buff harry laughed i not she said with dead seriousness but a smile began to form you are and if i can watch the game for tactical reason to help you then it makes the game more fun for me well then what else do you have for me cho also gives a sign to the beaters to start going after the seeker once she spotted the snitch so i think what you should do is what viktor did in the world cup go into a dive and fake her into following asked harry yes but you ll have to really sell it said hermione i think i can do that harry gave her a wicked smile before kissing her and heading down to the pitch an hour later harry was flying about the stadium trying to shake cho he looked down at hermione and gave her a wink hermione did harry just give yer a wink asked hagrid who was standing behind the girl he gonna try and fake cho on a dive hermione clasped her hands and held them as tight as she could harry decided he was going to need a little more altitude to get to the speed he needed so he causally floated a little higher and waited sure enough cho followed several moments later here goes nothing harry said under his breath he faked as if he saw the snitch then immediately went into a dive the crowd screamed as they saw the two seekers head straight for the ground hermione knuckles were white as a ghost as she saw harry getting closer to the ground screams of pull up could be heard all around the stadium and just as it looked like harry was in trouble he pulled out and skidded along the ground it looked at though cho might make it out of the dive too but as she pulled out her foot clipped the ground causing her to crash but harry didntnotices because he had seen the snitch by little padraig head and was heading straight for the slytherin bleacher harry potter has cought the golden snitch gryffindor wins the quidditch cup screamed colin in to the mic as the crowd roared all of gryffindor house came rushing onto the field harry soon found himself on the shoulders of fifth year students while ron and the rest of the team also began to get hoisted into the air harry began to look around to see where julia was sitting but couldntfind her as harry continued to search the bleachers mcgonagall and dumbledore approached the team with the quidditch cup unlike previous years mcgonagall didntlook happy something was wrong and it was written all over dumbledore face thirty minutes later harry still in quidditch gear ron and hermione were sitting in dumbledore office along with rosie and most of the order i asked you all here because one of our members has left us dumbledore said in a low tone it julia harry whispered julia huffed moody doesntthat girl listen to anything i say where has she gone asked a worried lupin every death eater in europe will be after her whispered tonks why dontwe read the letter and we ll all find out what she up too snape said in a condescending tone good idea professor snape said dumbledore as he took out the letter and handed it to harry harry looked at it for a moment then walked over to rosie would you read it in her voice rosie harry asked of course said rosie dear harry i sorry i couldntbe there in person to talk with you but i didntwant to worry you before the big game by the way nice fake dive harry smiled with pride for a moment at least he knew she had been watching i have no doubt you saw part of the vision i had last night the reason i say part is because i worked hard on keeping the other part from you and it in this other part of the vision that i must go i cannot tell you where i going because i dontwant any members of the order to follow i know what they must think moody must be mad because i didntlisten to him tonks must be worried that every death eater in this hemisphere will be after me and dumbledore will question why i must go please tell remus i sorry for not telling him but you need him there and i hope he understands the journey i am about to take will help us in are cause i hope you all can forgive me for my secrecy and my unwillingness to trust you but it for everyone protection if i get caught they wont be able to get any information from me all i ask is this harry do not encage the death eaters until i get there i have no doubt you ll face several things before that but whatever you do dontstart that battle with the death eaters until i there i promise to return love julia the familiar sound of silence filled the room no one looked at each other one of their great champions had left them and there was no telling if she would truly make it back harry folded the letter and put it in his back pocket typical potter always running off trying to play hero snapped snape shut your mouth severus growled lupin she has put us all in danger snape raised his voice she putting her life in danger to save us lupin said in a treating tone knock it off hagrid said as he stepped between them remus is right severus said a calm dumbledore julia didntsay anything important for a reason but i fear that whatever she is trying to accomplish might come too late dumbledore sat down in his chair and began to tap his fingers against each other albus you dontthink she trying to call on the last alliance do you mcgonagall asked i afraid that exactly what she is doing when she first described her vision in the fall i was almost certain that was what she was seeing and now that she had another vision part of which we dontknow i can say with utmost certainty that is what she is doing dumbledore sighed hermione slowly stepped forward and cleared her throat professor the last alliance was never called upon how could julia hope to figure out who had sworn the oath miss grainger you re resourcefulness never ceases to amaze me and if you re not a headmistress at this school someday i will be very disappointed dumbledore winked hermione turned a slight red at dumbledore compliment the last alliance was a group of wizards from around the world that swore an oath to raise as one and destroy voldemort if he ever tried to raise an army well word spread that voldemort was close to doing so until that night he meet you harry dumbledore paused for a moment professor if no one knows who took the oath then how did they know to call them for help harry asked that i do not know said dumbledore professor mcgonagall you and the children should go back to your house and celebrate if anything comes up professor lupin will come and get you the group did as dumbledore instructed and left the office you three go on ahead i going to stop by the kitchen and instructed the house elves that all gryffindor students will be allowed as much butter beer and food as they want the headmaster is right a little relaxing would do everyone some good and with that mcgonagall headed for the kitchen well i always up for a party smiled ron you re always up for eating harry joked back soon the gryffindor common room was full celebration even professor mcgonagall was having a good time the butterbeer was flowing and the kids were all enjoying themselves harry took a moment and watched as his friends would retell stories of old quidditch games or tell of this past one it was a moment all kids have in their youth and harry just sat there drinking a butterbeer and letting everyone else be the center of attention but as with most moments like these they always have to end we need another butterbeer run yelled dean mcgonagall walked over to a listed and started talking out loud the chaser went first and the beaters were the last to do it that means it the keeper and seekers turn she smiled chants of keeper and seeker started to fill the common room as harry and ron made their way over to the empty cart hermione followed and the trio wheeled the carts out of the common room and into the hall wall what a party smiled hermione to bad fred and george arenthere ron said they always knew how to have a good time the group continued to head towards the kitchen when they saw two students making out in a corner what should we do whispered ron who was pulling out his wand leave them alone hermione hissed but as they got closer they noticed the girl red hair hey that girl has the same color hair as ginny ron muttered as they got closer ron face began to get redder ron keep your cool harry said she has the right to make her own choice ron hermione added ginny ron yelled out and as ginny pulled away from the boy she was kissing a new look eclipsed ron face because the boy she was kissing was none other then draco malfoy for a moment no one knew what to do ginny and draco stood their holding each other while hermione and harry slowly positioned themselves to get in front of ron if he decided to attack to everyone surprise ron did nothing he simple kept pushing the cart and headed to the kitchen with a completely shocked look draco was the first to act weasley wait he jogged after him along with everyone else wealsey but ron wouldntrespond we have to do something said a panicked ginny you should talk with him ginny you re his sister harry said in a serious tone ginny nodded her head and slowly approached ron ron she said softly ron stood looking at the portrait of the pair ron please talk to me for a moment nothing happened until ron slowly turned his head the look of shock gone and the pain of deception now lingered how long have you been seeing him whispered ron right before winter break muttered ginny ron went back to staring at the pear what has he ever done to deserve you ron said loud enough for everyone to hear he not the same person ron a small plea in her voice how do you know ron turned back to ginny and slowly took a step forward what if we dontwin this battle how do you know he wont go running back to his father venom in ron voice my father is dead weasley draco said he died the day he allowed the death eaters to kill my mother how can any of us trust you ron yelled he been helping you guys all year ginny interjected really every time he has information it seems like it comes too late he tells harry at the quidditch match something bad is going to happen after hermione already had been taken he doesnteven tell harry about the escaped prisoners that tried to attack him and what about when dad was attacked ginny ron continued to lash out where were the slytherin spies then what do you want me to do weasley how can i prove that i not the enemy draco was beginning to get upset stand up in front of the school and tell everyone you love ginny ron blurted out ron you know he cantdo that hermione said in a calm voice but i know something he can do said harry no harry absolutely not lupin said as he paced julia office he and dumbedore had been taking turns teaching her classes you re just going to talk with firenze we re just asking that you take draco with you harry pleaded lupin lead harry away from the group what is this about harry whispered lupin let just say when firenze meets draco you ll understand something in harry eyes told lupin everything would be ok he took a deep breath and turned to the rest of the group meet here tomorrow night after dinner thank you professor draco smiled the group began to leave when lupin called out draco make sure you bring your wand chapter 29 draco worth did you know ron asked as the trio studied in their common room harry gave hermione a quick side glance then looked at ron and nodded i figured ron said in a defeated tone you guys were too calm last night not to know we didntwant to be the ones that told you hermione said as she peered over her book and you shouldn t ginny my sister she should have told me a small bit of anger in his tone you re handling it a lot better then i thought you would harry admitted i handling it a lot better then i thought i would part of me is angry but the other part of me thinks that maybe he really changed it confusing ron said as he read his muggle book they continued to study until it was time for lunch ron had decided to walk around the lake afterwards and think about his sister so harry decided to give hermione a flying lesson hermione had agreed to take flying lessons from harry just incase she had to use a broom during the battle harry is this really necessary hermione pleaded as she mounted his broom yes but he could also see just how nervous hermione was so he slowly mounted the broom behind her he wrapped his arm around her waist and grabbed the front of the broom ready he whispered yes her response caught in the back of her throat harry slowly kicked off the ground and he could feel hermione sudden intake of air they slowly rose into the air and soon they were above the castle overlooking the lake and forest oh harry hermione breathed this is your world when you want to escape from everyone and everything you come up here this is why you love flying so much harry pushed the broom so that they slowly glided over the castle and down to the lake the water sparkled in the afternoon sun and for the second time in her years at hogwarts hermione saw the castle in a different light but unlike the night they saved sirius when the castle was dark and gloomy it stood in the afternoon sun as proud and as powerful as the first time she saw it the wind tickled her cheeks and ears while harry soft touch kept the broom at a pleasant speed that she wouldntbe afraid of hermione slowly placed her hands over harry and together they stirred the broom she looked back at harry who gave her his boyish smile and pulled her closer towards him as the afternoon wore on hermione began to get more comfortable and before either one of them knew it the sun was beginning to set they landed the broom on the astronomy tower and watched it harry held hermione from behind as they stood there this is what we ll be fighting for whispered hermione she turned in his arms and looked up at him so that students can have afternoon like these and not fear for their safety so this castle can always be a place of learning not a place of hiding so that it will always be looked at as home her final statement hit harry the most because this was his home that what you were thinking about up there harry asked what do you mean whenever i need to think i always go flying some people walk he motioned his head to the lake where ron was on his tenth lap others head to the library he smiled at her but me i fly he paused but you re right it moments like these they both turned and looked at the setting sun then to each other if one was looking at the astronomy tower at that very moment all they could see would be a perfect silhouette of two young lovers sharing a tender kiss a kiss so sweet and innocent that it could last a lifetime but it only lasted until the sun set when they parted hermione shivered from the lack of warmth harry quickly grabbed her and wrapped her in his arms i love you hermione he whispered i love you too harry she said into his chest i wontlet anything happen to you harry squeezed her a little tighter as he said it hermione pulled back and looked him dead in the eyes i know they stood up there a moment longer then flew down to the lake and collected ron after dinner they gathered in julia office and waited for lupin and the others soon malfoy and ginny showed up so where is the professor asked draco as he and ginny stood together right here lupin said hagrid and tonks were with him you ready mr malfoy draco nodded then come with us the group headed for the hallway when ginny ran after malfoy and gave him a hug be careful i will draco kissed her on the cheek then followed the group out the trio and ginny stood in the classroom a moment if anything happens to him ron i ll never forgive you ginny meant it it was written in her eyes nothing will happen ron said as he began to head for the door where are you going harry asked to make sure nothing happens ron said before leaving come on hermione said following after him dontworry ginny we ll make sure both come back harry said as he followed hermione the three marched out into the night air and followed the group ahead of them i dontknow why she worried ron muttered as they walked nothing is going to happen then why are we following them harry asked bloody hell isntit obvious he looked at hermione and harry just in case it was a good half and hour before lupin group stopped the forest was dark and gloomy and harry group could barley make out draco and the others but they slowly crept forward until they were in ear shoot of what was going on firenze should be here by now hagrid sounded worried wands at the ready draco stick close to me lupin said soon the sounds of hooves could be heard in the distance we must be quick i can feel a great darkness coming said firenze as he approached his attention was drawn to draco harry potter was wise to have you come firenze said as he stepped closer to the boy very soon draco malfoy a choice will lie before you the centaur spoke take revenge on the one you seek or save the one you love but you will not be able to do both draco was shocked by his words but before he could respond the centaur turned his attention to lupin who now understood why harry had requested malfoy meet firenze remus he seeks to strike soon several of my kind has noticed giants arriving at his camp one claimed to have see a dragon a dragon exclaimed tonks dragon squealed ron harry and hermione both put a hand over his mouth i afraid this will be our last meeting before the battle firenze said as he looked around i sorry my kind wont help is this battle unlike them i know that we could be affected by the outcome you ve done all you can firenze dumbledore knows this lupin said as he shook the creatures hand one more thing before i go firenze looked over to where harry and the others where hiding hermione granger the trio slowly revealed themselves from behind a tree the centaur motioned for her to come closer he whispered something in her ear when a noise came from the distance ouch harry reached for his scar harry what is it tonks asked he is coming firenze panicked i must go good luck harry potter and with that the centaur was gone come on lupin said as he grabbed malfoy professor we donthave time we have to hide hagrid said as voldemorts voice grew louder hagrid grabbed harry hermione and ron and threw them into a tree log which he and tonks hid behind lupin and malfoy hid behind a tree opposite the other group are we sure the ministry hasntsent any extra guards to the castle the high hiss of voldemorts voice pierced the air harry scar was starting to burn more but he tried to ignore it he made his way over to a hole in the log and could see voldemort and another man walking my sources in the ministry have said no one seems to think that hogwarts is in any danger harry eyes widened as he finally saw the other man lucius malfoy harry could also see malfoy peering out from behind his tree snap what was that voldemort hissed as he looked over at the tree lupin and malfoy were hiding behind but before lucius and voldemort could investigate a wolf came flying out of no where ron both harry and hermione said at the same time ron began to growl and show his teeth what do we have hear said lucius in a condescending tone you picked the wrong pry today my friend just as lucius raised his wand a unicorn came charging towards the two dark wizards my lord lucius and voldemort dove away from malfoy and lupin when they got up the wolf and unicorn were gone something is not right voldemort said as he stood up the forest is trying to protect something but what the wizard looked around but could not figure it out we will attack the last day of school just as they finish they re morning exams and start to relax thinking they ll be home soon that when dumbledore will fall and harry potter will be no more the dark lords laugh echoed into the night we should get back no doubt dumbledore has those half brained professors making nightly rounds just in case lucius said as he stared in the direction of the castle what will you do about your son lucius voldemort asked i have no doubt he blames me for his mothers death and if he chooses to fight against me he will see no mercy a hint of sadness in his voice i surprised you re not as eager as bellatrix to fight voldemort injected bellatrix is eager to fight because she seeks revenge on julia potter for embarrassing her not just in battle but because bellatrix did not check to make sure she was dead all those years ago lucius smugly said i have no doubt bellatrix will flee in shame again you think julia is stronger then bella voldemort curiously asked i think we all need to be careful when it comes to her my lord if i not mistaken we wanted to destroy her because of a rumored prophecy lucius eyed voldemort dontworry lucius everything will come to an end soon voldemort said as he walked away but whose end will it be for i fear it might be mine lucius spoke just loud enough for everyone in hiding to hear he glanced back in the direction of the castle for a moment then started to follow voldemort back to camp once they were gone everyone slowly came out of hiding for a second all anyone could do was look at malfoy he doesntwant to fight draco whispered how do you know harry asked i just know draco looked at harry then back into the shadows of the forest where hermione and ron whispered lupin lumos we re down here hermione waved her wand the group walked towards the two you guys alright tonks asked we re fine hermione said as they headed back to the castle the group made it back safe and sound ginny was standing by the door when they returned see not a scratch on him ron said as they continued into the castle malfoy and ginny hugged yer three come with us hagrid said as they headed to dumbledore office weasley draco called out after ron the trio turned around and looked back at the couple malfoy you only have one assignment during the battle protect her ron said as he pointed to his sister if you can do that then maybe she can tell our parents about you dontworry weasley i can handle that draco smiled as he and ginny turned to walk away yeah well he better do it or i ll kill him ron said to hermione and harry the group continued to walk towards dumbledore office headmaster we have news hagrid said as the group entered the old wizard office i fear it must be bad news dumbledore said as he turned to the group voldemort sir he plans to strike in five days lupin inserted professors mcgonagall and snape joined the group professor mcgonagall professor snape i afraid we have bad news dumbledore sat in his chair so it true then he plans to strike a surprised snape exclaimed yes it is true we must start preparing the castle tomorrow night after the students have finished their dinner we will perform the sleeping spell and have those students safely transferred to the room of requirement i will make sure that only madam pomfrey and i will be able to access it once they are in there professor lupin please have alastor send word to the other aurors to be here tomorrow night yes headmaster today is sunday which means voldemort plans to attack friday we must do all we can to make sure the students are ready dumbeldore looked pale and tired professor might i have permission to take the students in my advance class and have them help me tuesday morning in preparing potions for madam just then mad eye burst in what going on here moody huffed we have news from firenze said lupin i guessing it not good otherwise you all wouldntbe here so spill it what going on voldemort will attack on friday harry said by now no one flinched when he used the dark lord name not even snape well that plenty of time to get the castle in order moody walked over to dumbledore desk and slapped down several pieces of parchment young mr weasley and i have come up with a plan i assume tomorrow night we re performing the sleeping spell on the cowards who arentfighting alastor a warning in dumbledore tone tuesday morning we make preparations around the castle which will include my advanced students helping me in making positions for madam pomfrey snape raised his eyebrow as he spoke how many students and how much time moody asked i will only need a few and if we start in the morning we should be done by lunch snape continued his flat tone that shouldntbe a problem i assume you re taking hermione i will require ms granger snaped paused and mr potter if that is alright me harry asked it would seem that your extra lessons this summer and the assistance of ms granger have brought your skills to a sufficient level harry could tell that snape hated paying him a complement as long as you re done with them by lunch moody growled mad eye continued to go over the preparations as the wizard spoke harry found himself looking out the window hoping that maybe his aunt my come flying in at any moment harry the soft voice of dumbledore snapped harry out of his gaze he turned to look at the headmaster what are you looking at i was just watching harry turned back to the window watching for what harry lupin asked for julia her name echoed through the room and everyone took a moment to look out the window she ll make it harry lupin said in a confident manner she ll make it chapter 30 race against time the next night at dinner harry ate and watched his fellow classmates who were about to be put to sleep for a week sometimes he d look at their faces and get upset with them because they d be safe and hidden while the other students would be risking their lives other times he felt sorry for having deceived them for so long but all of those thoughts were soon gone once dumbledore stood up i hope everyone enjoyed their wonderful meal the wizard smiled he then raised his hands and started to chant under his breath the familiar thud of the student heads hitting the table happened moments later dobby dumbledore called out house elves appeared behind every student that was asleep and with in seconds they were all gone gasps and whispers filled the great hall mr feltch will you please bring in our new guests the doors to the hall swung open and peoples began to file through mum dad ron called out as mr and mrs weasley poured in followed by fred george bill and charlie dad luna called as she spotted her father gran neville gasped as his grandmother came walking towards him many parents and aurors took the places of the students who had just left oh neville i so proud of you his grandmother said as she made a seat for herself next to him and i know you re parents would have been too she smiled why are you here neville asked still in shock well i too old to fight but i knew poppy would need some help i was quite good at healing charms and potions in my day she winked at him while neville and his grandmother caught up the weasley family was having a reunion what going on ron asked as they walked over to him what do you think said george we ve come to fight add fred you too ron asked his mother and father well your mother has come to help madam pomfrey said mr weasley i have come to fight ron could tell his dad was nervous after a few more minutes dumbedore cleared his throat i have asked the adults to join us because we have found out when voldemort plans to attack taking a breath this friday harry watched as his classmates began to look scared those whose parents were present grabbed onto them while others simply just sat in shock dumbledore took a seat while mad eye hobbled to the front of the hall alright listen up i professor moody and for the next three days i ll be running the show he shouted the first thing we have to do is get the castle ready so tomorrow morning after breakfast you all will be split up into groups in the afternoon we ll do drills and work on dueling and in the evening we ll go over things you ll need to know everyone understand moody asked as everyone nodded his or her head in understanding good now parents you ll find rooms have been prepared for you in the same house as your children aurors please proceed to the slytherin house for your rooms and so the preparations began harry and hermione found themselves making more potions then they ever thought imaginable with snape the following morning they were working with much larger caldrons and had to make sure their measurements were larger it was a small group of students draco was there along with susan bones from hufflepuff and a few 7th years from ravenclaw ms granger how are you and mr potter coming along with the potion snape sneered as he walked around checking on all the different caldrons we have about 200 vials full sir hermione said as she and harry continued to fill vials with a purple potion let see if we can have it at 400 before lunch mr malfoy snape turned and walked over to check on malfoy progess 400 harry complained it shouldntbe that bad you keep filling up the vials while i get ready to make another batch hermione said as she went to gather up more ingredients lunch couldnthave come quicker for harry he and hermione looked exhausted as they sat down next to mrs weasley and tonks you poor dears what were you doing all morning asked mrs weasley as she made up a plate for the two children making potions with professor snape harry said as he poured some juice what did you two do hermione asked well apparently ron has had the house elves make these large silver shields and we were planting them out side in the ground when ron gives the signal they ll pop up and protect the first row of the army tonks said with excitement which row are you in asked mrs weasley nervously we re both in the first row along with ron harry said in the nicest way possible but mrs weasley still looked worried at least dumbledore put fred and george in the second row she muttered the day progressed and soon harry was in the dinning hall again for dinner about half way through mad eye stood up to address the crowed you all can keep eating as long as you pay attention to some of the things i about to show you he growled the closer the battle came the grumpier moody got now it is still against the law to use any unforgivable spell but the ministry has told use they will be lenient on this rule for this battle but both the headmaster and i agree no one in this army is to use the killing curse is that understood the great hall became deathly quite as moody spoke instead i want everyone to try and knock out their opponent or tie them up once this is accomplished send up blue sparks and a house elf will come and take the death eater to a port key which will take them to a prison the ministry has set up now you all will be wearing your medallions so madam pomfrey and her staff will be monitoring your health if they see that you re in danger a house elf will come and get you no matter what moody continued to talk about how dumbledore and mcgonagall would be communicating with everyone through the same medallions and that security trolls and giants would be arriving at the school in the morning however no one noticed their presences at breakfast the next day instead everyone was watching as the house elves passed out the uniforms for the battle now these are special robes that can shield you from minor charms and hexes they also make you impervious to any weather and are as light as a feather dumbledore explained their just like our order robs ron said as he was handed his package you will also find a black long sleeve shirt black pants and black shoes called sneakers the muggles use these shoes to run around in dumbledore went on to say harry unwrapped his package to find a maroon rob with the gryffindor emblem on the left side of the chest and the name harry potter stitched underneath he then grabbed the long sleeve shirt which felt like silk very smooth and very light it too had the gryffindor crest on the same side as the robe next he pulled out the pants which were drawstring and made of the same material as the shirt and had the gryffindor shield on the left leg finally he looked at the black sneakers that looked very comfortable you ll notice the shirt and pants are very smooth and light to the touch it is made of a material which helps harness the magical power of a witch or wizard they should only be worn in time of danger or battle the shirt will adjust to the weather and become a short sleeve shirt if you wish just tap the shirt with your wand and say short the pants can also be shortened if you wish harry looked around and saw the blue of ravenclaw the yellow of hufflepuff and the small group of green for slytherin he then watched as mr and mrs weasley opened theirs to find a silver robe this afternoon after lunch we ll have you put the outfit on and practice dueling so you can get use to the new accuracy you ll have moody said as he stood up now let get to work the gryffindor spend the morning hanging bells through out the castle so that when some one spotted an intruder they could ring the bell and help would come the hufflepuffs constructed a board that correlated with where the bells were placed dumbledore and mcgonagall would have this board on the astronomy tower with them so they could monitor and send help where it might be needed the ravenclaws constructed the medical board with everyone name on it next to each name were four circles green yellow orange and red once the board was up and running everyone had the green circle lit indicating they were in good health afternoon dueling finally arrived and harry was very excited everyone went up to their room and put their outfit on minus the robe harry had made his shirt a t shirt but kept the pants at full length he was just finishing up tying the pants when he walked by his mirror harry had filled out over this past year the shirt was a little more fitting but with enough room so that he could move around freely this showed off the muscles he d developed in the arms and chest he was still skinny but at least it wasntskin and bones to give the kids a little fun moody started a tournament and as the afternoon wore on it was starting to look like harry might face hermione for the championship to everyone surprise hermione was quite the duelist even dumbledore and moody commented on it harry gonna have some trouble with her alastor whispered to dumbledore it would seem that ms granger has been studying the different techniques and has mastered them well the headmaster smiled it not just that moody eyed the girl with his electric blue eye there is a raw talent that hasntbeen tapped the professors werentthe only ones impressed as harry watched her he tried to figure out her style she wasntathletic but she moved with the agility and grace of a dancer while still being a quick thinker all right mad eye said as he walked to the center of the dueling platform it looks like it will be a show down between gryffindor s the gryffindor house cheered harry potter hermione granger please take your places hermione had also elected to wear her shirt short and her pants long causing the out fit to accentuate her womanly features she calmly put her hair in a ponytail and stepped in to the center of the dueling ring along with harry they bowed to each other then proceed to take their places wands at the ready said moody go expelliarmus they both shouted protego harry shouted to protect himself from the spell diffindo shouted hermione who dodged harry spell incarcerous hermione first spell cut through harry shield causing him to dive out of the way of next one locomotor mortis he shouted as he rolled but is aim was off stupefy shouted hermione harry just narrowly leap frog over the spell he rolled forward and pointed his wand right at hermione chest but as he was saying the spell he realized she had already put up a shield he quickly got up and prepared for her next volley they both stood for a moment examining the other they were about ten yards apart expelliarmus they both shouted both were direct hits causing their wands to fly out of their hands after a second hermione realized her wand had flown over harry shoulder and vice versa they started to run at each other while stretching out their hands calling for their wands at the exact same time their wands flew to their hands and each one pointed their wand at the other the wands were only inches from their faces the crowd hushed to see who would make the first move but unknown to harry hermione had already gotten him with a spell he realized it when he tried to move and noticed he was moving in slow motion hermione took several steps back then cleared her throat incarcerous she said the ropes quickly tied harry up moody appeared next to hermione and raised her hand hermione granger is the champion he shouted the crowd cheered and soon hermione found herself hoisted on people shoulders and paraded around the hall finite moody said as he helped harry to his feet they both watched for a moment as hermione cheeks turned red from all the attention you didntlet her win did ya moody growled no harry laughed no she got me that what i thought moody almost said with a smile but i dontknow how she did it i didnthear her say anything asked a confused harry well if i understand correctly ms granger has adjusted to wand less magic fast but i wouldntworry harry she probably the only one in the world who could beat you moody slapped harry on the back then proceeded to wish hermione congratulations harry watched for a moment and was glad he hadntwon watching someone else be the center of attention was a nice reality check for him he had been happy for ron the year before when gryffindor had won the quidditch cup but this feeling was different he felt more pride then anything else hermione was his girlfriend and he would gladly lose to her every time if it meant seeing that wonderful smile of hers the group that was carrying her brought her back to the dueling ring there was still a little red in her cheeks but harry could tell she was enjoying the moment a moment that lasted into dinner as the hall buzzed with activity for a time everyone had forgotten the looming battle and for that harry was thankful because the next morning at breakfast an eerie silence had fallen over the castle as everyone ate people would glance out the window or look towards the doors anticipating what was to come the morning and part of the afternoon was scheduled for drills and last minute instructions the rest of the day was free for people to do whatever they wish dumbledore even encouraged people to go outside and enjoy the weather at first no one seemed to think he was serious until some of the first years decided to play a pick up game of quidditch thus causing a ripple effect the trio soon found themselves walking the familiar grounds and watched all the activity around them hagrid had a line of students waiting to take a ride on buckbeak or one of the other hippogriffs the first years had taken over the quidditch pitch and were still playing their first game fred and george were showing off they re latest invention while the grown ups joined the children in they re various activities the sounds of laugher filled the afternoon and as he had done for most of the year harry stopped to take it in and remember what life was like before the battle in his mind these grounds would have nightmares and scary visions for some of these children after tomorrow a thought which harry hated dontworry mate ron said interrupting his thoughts everyone might think about the battle when they come out to play or relax next year but they ll create new memories and enjoy the castle again and for some the memories from this battle might not all be bad some people might remember how hard they fought and how they discovered how brave they could be hermione added i hope you both are right harry said as he looked to the sky searching for that one person who could turn the tide of battle soon night fell and everyone went into the castle for dinner it was a grand feast much like the first night at school and in the middle of dinner dumbledore stood to address the crowd as always i d like to thank the house elves for a wonderful dinner tonight dumbledore clapped and everyone followed suite he then looked down and breathed a heavy sigh tomorrow is friday a day which would normally be filled with final exams and the excitement of summer break but instead we embark on another challenge a challenge repeated throughout our history he paused the battle between good and evil a never ending battle that will continue long after tomorrow battle and long after we have left this world but we have a chance a chance to tip the balance in favor of that which is good and pure in the world a chance to make a statement that no matter the odds there are still those willing to fight and willing to stand up for what they believe in that chance rests with you all of you have the ability to show the rest of the world what courage and bravery means and you donthave to have a gryffindor on your robe to do it dumbledore looked over the crowd and started to tear up i have never been more proud of a group of students then i am of you no one spoke for several moments until suddenly fred and george stood up and raised their glasses they said nothing for a second or two then fred cleared his throat most of you remembered how we left hogwarts last year he paused as a cheer rang out in the hall but if dumbledore had been the headmaster we would have stayed and it because of dumbledore that we came back to help in this battle george added besides my little brother and sister a soft laughter filled the halls so lets raise our glasses to our professor our headmaster and the one guy you d be willing to die for besides your family george added to dumbledore fred raised his glass the one person who believed harry when he said that voldemort had returned and to the one person who seems to take action rather then sitting in the ministry thinking about it the crowd laughed again to dumbledore the crowded stood and raised their glasses to dumbledore the statement echoed through out the hall after everyone took their sips some sipped longer then others the old wizard cleared his throat again because we dontknow when voldemort might plan to attack tomorrow everyone will be sleeping in here tonight so feel free to go back to your common rooms and slip into your pajamas make sure you bring your outfit down with you just in case and by the time everyone comes back the hall will be ready and so it was when harry and the rest of gryffindor returned the great hall looked like a huge slumber party and for most of the night it was dumbledore had instructed everyone to hang out and visit with friends and family and at midnight he would cast a spell that would allow them to sleep since the beds were not marked people would claim areas of the great hall groups of friends and family were everywhere sometime through out the night harry realized his group had taken the center of the great hall and every now and then people would turn there attentions to his group and join in he and hermione had pushed two beds together so they were right next to each other as did ron and luna ginny had slowly made her way over to the group with draco in tow and was unsure what to do mum dad ron got his parents attention i would like to introduce ginny boyfriend ron gestured over towards draco and someone who helped harry out a lot this year draco malfoy the group was taken aback by ron bold move but his parents understood that if ron was fine with it then draco must have done something to earn their little girl mrs weasley rushed up and hugged draco welcome to the family dear she smiled at him and in draco eyes harry saw the feeling of acceptance and the possibility of a new home harry imagined he must have had that exact look in his eyes when mrs weasley had welcomed him into their home all those years ago soon luna dad and the twins claimed their beds around the trio as did neville and his grandmother dean and the rest of the gryffindor house talk would go from some adventure of harry to a story one of the adults would share with the children midnight came quicker then expected and soon chimes rang indicating it was time to sleep harry gave too many hugs and said so many goodnights that by the time he looked over at hermione he was starting to feel sleepy they quickly gave each other a kiss then held hands as they drifted off to sleep harry awoke the next morning feeling the most rested he d ever felt in his years at hogwarts but when his eyes finally focused he saw that hermione was gone he quickly sat up and looked around the great hall he could feel that she was near by but he couldntplace where the streaks of sun started to slip in through the windows of the great hall and harry realized that it was barley morning he threw on his slippers and quietly headed for the door hoping that hermione had just gone for a walk his worries were over as he slipped out of the great hall and looked towards the front doors there hermione stood watching the sunrise he slowly walked over to her i surprised you re up she said before he reached her harry had forgotten how good they had become and sensing and feeling each other presence since the spell i woke up and you were gone he said still a little groggy i just woke up a moment or two ago i just had this strange urge to see the sunrise she continued to look out into the horizon why to figure out what the outcome of today might be she said a little more distant how can you tell harry said as he wrapped an arm around her shoulders he looked out to the sun and saw the brilliant orange yellow and red streaks across the sky but then harry noticed that the sunrise was much more red then usual it a red sunrise she paused and looked up at him it means before the sunsets blood will be spilt on this day harry looked out towards the forest but whose blood he whispered ours or theirs a n i sorry it takes soooo long between posts but work has been very crazy these last couple of months i hope you guys enjoyed this chapter and i just going to warn you that it will probably take me some time to write the next chapter thank you all for sticken with me for so long i couldntasked for a nicer group of readers chapter 31 the battle begins life isntalways fair or forgiving sometimes it throws you everything it can all at once sometimes it is relentless and never once takes a break from its ongoing assault however sometimes life can be sweet and blissful giving you the greatest moments of triumph and happiness moments so full of joy and love that you never want to let go you just want to live in them forever but could life encompass all of these things in one day could it take away a loved one or a friend but also help defeat a great evil could a moment full of hope also be full of sorrow the questions went unanswered and soon harry realized that he and hermione were still staring at the red sunrise red could mean so many things like passion and love but not this day this day it meant death soon the quiet footsteps of fellow students broke harry out of the trance the red sunrise was causing whispers grew as more and more people came to the front door to look at the spectacle dumbledore soon stood next to hermione and also watched the rising sun for many long minutes come he said barley above a whisper let us prepare for the day and with that the group slowly walked back to the great hall after everyone had showered and changed into their outfit s breakfast was served the soft scratching and click of plates was all that filled the great hall that morning some people were able to eat a full plate of food while others could only munch on toast several people had rushed out of the great hall holding their mouths once it was obvious that no one could eat anymore e dumbledore clapped his hands causing the food to disappear people were split up into groups of four three children and one adult to start patrolling the grounds harry hermione ron and tonks were sitting in the quidditch stands watching the horizon taking a break from patrolling it was nearly time for lunch and nothing had happened yet what if he doesntattack ron asked as he laid on one of the bleachers he will harry said as he continued to scan the treetops of the forest yeah but what if he doesn t what if all this training was for nothing ron continued it wasntfor nothing said tonks if he doesntattack today he ll attack at some point yeah but what quiet harry hissed he looked back out to the treetops something was moving the trees in the far distance were shaking dumbledore harry called out yes harry the old wizards voice was so clear it sounds like he was stand next to the group ron whipped his head around in all directions until he saw hermione pointing to the medallion with an exasperated look on her face what ron whispered is there a patrol on top of the astronomy tower harry asked professor lupin and his group are on the tower i ll have him speak with you the headmaster instructed harry is something the matter lupin asked professor do you see the tree tops in the distance moving there was no response for a moment harry where are you lupin asked in a worried tone the quidditch pitch why harry get out of there get out of there now lupin was practically screaming before harry could ask why he felt hermione pull him towards the stair well what the matter harry asked as he yanked free look hermione pointed outside harry turned to see a large dragon hovering above the stadium bloody hell ron whimpered that a ukrainian ironbelly came the voice of charlie weasley as quietly as possible get to the bottom of the stands and a house elf will get you the group slowly started to head towards the stairs tonks went first followed by ron then hermione and finally harry they made it down one flight when one of the steps made a loud creak everybody stop dead in their tracks harry heart was pounding so hard in his chest it was a wonder the dragon didnthear after several moments harry let out a long breath he didntknow he was holding that was close ron whispered no sooner had the words come out of his mouth when a raging blast of fire exploded above their heads setting the top of the stands on fire come on yelled tonks the group began to run down the stairs just as harry made it down another flight another blast of fire erupted over his head this one closer then the first the blast cause him to lose balance and harry fell down the next flight harry quickly got up and found himself next to ron and he turned to see where hermione was when another powerful fire ball exploded above them hermione leaped down to the landing harry was standing on narrowly missing the fire raging above now harry and hermione were behind tonks and ron and just as they were about to go down the next flight of stair they heard ron yell watch out the stairwell in front of them disappeared harry and hermione were trapped between the fires above and the new one below but just as harry thought it couldntget any worse the stands began to sway from lose of support reducto yelled hermione from behind him she had blown a hole in the wall facing the forest they looked outside and saw they were about two stories off the ground hang on you two tonks shouted within moments both harry and hermione were lifted off the ground and slowly floated down to ron and tonks thanks for the help harry said once his feet touched the ground several large snaps caught they re attention the stand was going to fall and as it swayed the group realized it would fall on them they were about to run when the dragon came from behind the stands the moment of hesitation cost them and the group all braced themselves for impact but instead of fire and wood harry felt a very weird sensation that reminded him of apparition he opened his eye and found himself in the great hall harry lupin yelled as he ran towards the young man are you alright he asked while looking at the small cuts on harry face i fine harry breathed still wondering how they escaped harry potter sir was dobby quick enough the house elf looks up at him with his big eyes dobby you were brilliant harry smiled no time for pleasantries madam pomfrey said as she shoved purple vials into everyone hand as soon as harry finished he could feel the sting of the cuts and bruses starting to heal listen up shouted charlie wesley aurors i need you on the ground once the air squadron and i subdue the dragon you re going to have to start using the binding spell on it the rest of you stay here and follow mad eye instructions air squad mount up yelled madam hooch dobby can you grab my broom mine too dobby ron cut off harry i ll come with you hermione added no snapped moody we need you on the tower with the others if this dragon gets out of hand we need to fix any damage to the castle before it hurts anyone but professor no buts we need you on the tower charlie has plenty of help in the air and on the ground with that mad eye turned and headed towards a group of students hermione looked to harry they both knew how dangerous this was going to be and they could feel each other anxiety about being separated i ll be careful he gave her a hug i promise he whispered in her ear he gently kissed her forehead then headed for the back of the castle with the rest of the air squadron hermione turned to see a group of students looking at her colin stepped forward professor moody said we re supposed to go to the astronomy tower the group was comprised of seventh sixth and fifth years hermione knew that most of these students were strong when it came to charms what adult is coming with us hermione asked he said you re in charge colin smiled nervously right hermione could see everyone was nervous let get to that tower and help the air squadron with that her group headed towards the tower harry and ron mounted up in the rear courtyard of the castle with the air squadron they both listened to ginny and draco as the two captains instructed their team how they were going to proceed the quicker of the flyers would head in first distract the dragon as the stronger spell casters flew in next hitting the dragon charlie then took the lead ironbellys are the largest bread of dragons on the planet which gives us the advantage he not as quick as the dragon you all might have seen harry face in his forth year but his blast is powerful unless absolutely necessary avoid flying in front of him everybody understand the group nodded their heads then heard the shrieking call of the dragon as he came closer to the castle charlie turned to madam hooch and gave a nod ok group one mount up and head for the dragon group two hold back and wait for my signal to advance on the dragon she instructed as she took off potter you wait with group two weasley you and your sister lead group one draco called out as the two group rose in the air good luck harry ron called out over his shoulder hermione watched as the first group past over her head she looked over at luna who had her wand trained on ron just in case something happened she watched as the first group flew in and distracted the dragon it turned and started to try and chase after the group hermione then looked up to see harry and his group heading in next they made brief eye contact then harry turned and head in towards the dragon the sounds of shouting and spell casting filled the afternoon air the aurors on the ground and the children in the air were all calling out the stunning spell however it didntlook like they were having any effect on the large beast harry wove in and out as his group went back in for another round they had hit the dragon several times and the beast showed no sign of slowing down the dragon made a quick turn and soon harry and his group were now face to face with him draco took the team into a dive narrowly missing the dragon fire blast they were now underneath the creature and everyone tried to hit the dragon with at least two shots of the spell the dragon changed direction again and in doing so hit one of the towers of the castle everything happened in slow motion hermione saw the tower slowly start to crash and part of it was heading for the great hall she focused all her energy on stopping the collapse with the impediment jinx her group followed her lead and the top of the tower stopped several inches from the roof of the great hall along with the rest of the tower her group slowly began to use the repair charm to get the tower back in its proper place charlie ginny scream carried on the wind harry turned to see part of charlie broom on fire and plummeting towards the ground the aurors were able to stop him and quickly put out the fire whatever charlie had done it seemed to work and the dragon looked like it was beginning to be effected by the stunning spell the two groups continued to focus on stunning the creature until he was finally tied down once the all clear was given ron and ginny ran into the castle to check on charlie harry followed and started to look for hermione he had seen the tower begin to fell but he didntknow what had happened harry she called out as her group entered the great hall you ok he asked while looking her over fine what happened to charlie hermione asked as they walked over to the weasley s i dontknow i turned and saw his broom was on fire harry whispered as they approached the family the great hall was now split up into two halves the front was a staging area and set up area for the army while the second half was the new infirmary madam pomfrey and neville grandmother were working on charlie behind the curtain wall dumbledore stepped out to address the weasley s he suffered severe burns on his legs poppy is doing all she can to save them dumbledore whispered mrs weasley gave a silent sob as mr weasley hugged her bill held ginny while the twins and ron looked on he a weasley ron began to say he ll pull through draco slowly made his way over to the group what happened he asked harry ginny brother charlie harry whispered his legs are burned and they dontknow if they can save them draco was about to leave when hermione grabbed his arm ginny will need you hermione said in a low voice draco nodded his head and stood with hermione and harry and waited to help the weasley in any way possible the rest of the afternoon was uneventful ministry officials came to pick up the dragon the sun was getting lower in the sky and people began to wonder what would be next madam pomfrey had stabilized charlie but whether he d have the use of his legs again was uncertain dinner was being served early and people were beginning to finish up when a rumbling came from the forest dumbledore the voice echoed your time has come to an end this is it mad eye shouted form up robes were tied and sneakers were retied as everyone prepared themselves to march parents who werentgoing out in the field gave they re children last minute hugs and kisses tears were shed and promise of returning made the students were lined up and awaited the signal to begin marching towards the fight remember we all have loved ones affect by this evil remember them when you re out there dumbledore instructed as he looked over the students he then nodded his head to mad eye who gave the signal the students began to march out of the castle and down towards the forest there was nothing out there as they made they re way down the hill the first group made a sharp turns halfway to hagrid hut the second row filled in behind the first and the third group behind the second hold positions until we see something dumbledore instructed harry glanced back and saw him along with mcgonagall on the tower looking over the forest how cute dumbledore you created your own army the voice sneered but they wontsave you soon death eaters slowly came walking out of the forest and formed they re own line the two armies were about fifty yards apart and neither moved for several moments harry then saw a large black mass of death eaters rise up from the forest on brooms they re air squad was triple the size of dumbledore s people began to get restless hold the line harry shouted the order was repeated through out the ranks harry it no use the voice said give up and your death will be painless i might even spare the lives of your pathetic friends steady harry came lupin voice dontlet him goat you into making the first move harry took a breath voldemort this is between you and me tell your death eaters to back down we dontwant to hurt them harry shouted a large laugh erupted from the death eaters except for one harry looked over and saw lucius malfoy was leading the army but he didntlook amused like the other death eaters next to lucius was bella she was searching the crowd for julia where is your sorry excuse for an aunt potter she shouted too scared to face me again prepare for the first volley moody communicated through the medallions no harry whispered we must wait julia said not to engage them until she was here harry pleaded harry she not here we cantwait for her any more moody growled but the decision was taken out of their hands wands at the ready lucius shouted wands at the ready harry responded harry then watched as lucius communicated something with his group and just when it looked like they were about to start a faint sound carried on the wind it slowly got louder and louder until finally harry tried to make it out hold the line the faint voice called the death eaters looked around for the source of the noise as did harry and his group look one of the students pointed towards over the lake the sun was setting and it was getting hard and hard to see but the student was point to a large mast moving towards them the voice called again hold the line what is it ron asked but no one had the chance to answer because the next time the voice rang out it was clear who was coming hold the line julia screamed as she flew at break neck speed towards the armies she flew down towards harry group then jumped off her broom keeping her back to the death eaters i promised i d come back she winked at harry the large mass that was behind her was the last alliance everyone mouths were hanging open as the hundreds of witches and wizards on brooms became part of draco and ginny group in the air now it was dumbledore who had the advantage in size julia then whipped her robe around and faced the death eaters this is your last chance she shouted back down or be taken prisoner if anyone dies here it will be on your heads not ours then you re death will be on mine potter bella sceamed wands at the ready julia shouted almost a thousand wands pointed at each other attack a n before you think i evil i will be updating within the next week chapter 32 the battle for hogwarts at any point in time life can change in an instant this was one of those moments everything had slowed down to a crawl and harry could only hear his own intake of air and the blood pounding in his head as julia shouted the advancement he could see the death eaters shouting out spells and a spectrum of different colors came towards him it wasntuntil the silver shields came popping out of the ground that harry was jarred back into real time julia had jumped behind the wall of shields at the last minute prepare the stun spell she shouted the order was echoed down the line now stupefy the spelled rang out from harry side several death eaters were already down from getting their own spells bounced back at them another group went down from the stunning spell concentrate on getting those shields out of the ground lucius shouted to his group first row listen up julia shouted safely behind a shield once they get these out of the ground put up the shield charm she turned to the second row hit them with another round of the stun spell once our shields are up as the ground assault began so did the battle in the air madam hooch draco and ginny all gave the signals and the air squadron began to attack the death eaters in the air they would engage them at point blank range the first wave of the air squadron which was now comprised of members of the last alliance went in to distract the death eaters draco led the group and just as the death eaters shouted their spells his group pulled up and out of the way the second wave led by ginny was able to knock out many death eaters who werentpaying attention but they werentable to get out of the area with out losing a few of their own it was now going to be a dog fight and witches and wizards started to go after individuals back on the ground the silver shields were final pulled out of the ground causing the first row to shield them selves while the second row continued to use the stunning spell after several volleys dumbledore finally gave the signal to charge holding the third row back to protect the castle and help support those in the air come on julia shouted as she began to run at the death eaters die potter bellatrix screamed crucio protego maximus julia shouted her shield covered harry entire group stupefy maximus julia started running towards bellatrix while julia engaged with bellatrix harry and his group began to throw up the signals for house elves to collect knocked out death eaters harry behind you ron shouted but it was too late harry was wrapped up in ropes diffndo hermione called out cutting harry lose from the ropes dontlet them surround us she shouted the three friends and their groups came together as they were the spearhead of the charge defending and attacking they worked together to keep each other safe if any one tries to use the killing curse hit them with the silencing charm before they can finish came the voice of mcgonagall over the medallions hermione watch out neville knocked hermione out of the way of a jelly leg jinx expelliarmus she shouted stupefy neville followed the death eater was rendered unconscious hermione sent up sparks and a house elf appeared and collected the body harry ron shouted as he pointed to several people falling from the ski wingardium leviosa harry shouted several members echoed the spell helping stop the bodies from crashing to the ground the house elves have the bodies harry protect your group dumbledore communicated crucio the spell came out of no where and hit luna right in the chest causing her to scream out in pain crucio ron roared at the death eater who cast the spell incarcerous hermione said as the effects of ron spell wore off the death eater just then out of the corner of harry eye he saw bellatrix take aim for hermione expelliarmus harry shouted bellatrix called her wand back but before she could try anything again julia jumped back in front of her what the matter bella afraid to face me julia taunted the two witches continued to fight near by two fathers continued to dual each other look what you re doing lucius mr weasley shouted you re fighting children i did not want this to happen weasley lucius slowly regretting what they were doing how was it suppose to happen weasley shouted mr weasley ducked out of the way of one spell as did lucius meanwhile in the air ginny was having a hard time shaking a death eater as she weaved in and out of people in the air she sent up sparks for help she saw draco flying straight at her just before they would have collided ginny barrel rolled to the right allowing draco a perfect shot at the death eater the couple smiled at each other for a moment then continued on their separate ways the great hall was now transformed into a hospital the medical board was up and ten or so second year students were monitoring everybody calling out names to house elves and indicating what level of health they were at if someone was brought in and could be completely heal with in several minutes they were sent back out mrs weasley would continually check her family who were all in one spot after she checked on them her eyes would search the board for harry hermione and draco madam pomfrey padraig shouted as he ran into the great hall what is it the old woman asked giants have entered the castle hagrid and madam maxine who had arrived the night before took their group of giants and headed towards wear voldemort group had breached the castle they entered the court yard and saw as a patrol group of third years try to stun them when one of the children was thrown against a wall hagrid made his move and launched himself at the lead giant back outside things were becoming more chaotic to avoid being hit the witches and wizards in the air would dive towards the ground and fly between the people fighting dean thomas was chasing a death eater who was now diving towards the fighting on the ground while at the same time neville was sending sparks up for a house elf to collect another death eater what happened next only took moments but neville would never forget it he looked up and saw julia and bellatrix continue to fight julia had the upper hand but bellatrix would use other people as human shields the words formed on bellatrix lips get down julia shouted to everyone around avada kedavra bellatrix screamed at that moment dean thomas flew down to follow the death eater and was hit in the back with the killing curse neville and he made eye contact just before the flicker of life in dean faded he quickly ran over to his friends limp body once it fell to the ground dean neville said nervously harry hermione and ron ran over to him along with their group she killed him neville muttered the word quickly spread that the first killing curse had been use on a child mr weasley and lucius stopped dueling for a moment as they looked over and saw the growing number of children around the area arthur then heard the announcement over the medallion did you hear that lucius bellatrix just killed a child get your men under control mr weasley shouted you there lucius shouted to a near by death eater who turned to face him i want the word given that no one is to kill any children but sir that an order the mood in the great hall became somber as the first life sign went red madam pomfrey one of the students said we lost someone mrs weasley madam pomfrey and neville grandmother came rushing over to the board who mrs weasley said franticly dean thomas the student said he was in the green and suddenly went red the killing curse neville grandmother whispered dobby madam pomfry said her voice unsteady please go and collect mr thomas body the fighting in the air was halted for a moment as the air squadron collected themselves draco looked over at ginny and the rest of the gryffindor who were on the verge of tears or on the verge of using the killing curse themselves draco is it true cho chang asked yes the group hung their heads for a moment then madam hooch noticed the death eaters were getting ready for another pass at them alright let form up she said sadly wands at the ready the flying squad pointed their wands at the charging death eaters for dean seamus shouted the air squadron gave out a war cry that filled the night the group on the ground looked up and saw their flying companions charge the death eaters with new veracity harry looked around and saw the death eaters on the ground were also collecting themselves form up harry shouted the first row which was dramatically thinner formed up along with the second row wands at the ready ron shouted now hermione shouted the group charged again at the death eaters who were surprised at how hard the students were now fighting hermione hagrids group needs help by the side entrance of the castle dumbledore voice came over the medallion hermione looked around and realized that it would take too long to head back up to the castle the screech of an animal caught her attention hermione saw buckbeak and four other hippogriffs in a paddock by hagrids house come on she shouted to several students i coming with you lupin said as he ran over to her hermione harry shouted they looked at each other i ll come back she said as she turned to run towards the creatures she bowed quickly then mounted buckbeak the group took to the air and flew low in order to avoid the battle in the air harry watched as they disappeared into the night sky watch out mad eye shouted instinctively harry dove to the group and looked up to see bella and julia continuing their ongoing battle julia did a back flip to avoid a spell from bellatrix but she landed awkwardly and lost her wand bellatrix took aim at his aunt expelliarmus harry shouted at the witch this bought julia enough time to call her wand back bellatrix starred at harry for a moment when i done with your aunt you ll be next baby potter she spat not if i have anything to say about it stupefy maximus julia shouted as she jumped in front of harry on the astronomy tower rosie was flying back and forth keeping dumbledore and mcgonagall safe from any loose spells that might find their way over to them the old witch and wizard continued to watch the fighting from above they were winning in both the air and ground but students were still getting hurt there had only been a few other fatalities but they were aurors and members of the last alliance albus why hasnthe shown himself mcgonagall said as she continued to watch the battle in the air he waiting minerva the headmaster said as he looked to the forest waiting until absolutely necessary headmaster hermione group is engaging the giants squeaked winky dumbledore turned his attention to the new battle to the side of the castle stay on your hippogriffs hermione shouted stun them and if they throw any objects stop them from hitting hagrid and his group lupin instructed hagrid had several cuts and bruises on his face and body but was still fighting hard draco and ginny had their hands full with several death eaters who were going after them they both shot up straight in the air and took the death eaters into the few clouds that filled the night the split up and started going in opposite directions once the death eaters had split to follow them ginny and draco turned back around and started to fly straight at each other and just before they made contact draco dove to the ground and ginny shot higher into the night causing almost all of the death eaters to have a mid air collision ginny stopped and gave a victory shout but clouds obscured her view of draco who had been knocked off his broom by a death eater and was plummeting towards earth at that very moment hermione had started to fly high into the air to get a better shot at a giant and as she climbed she noticed some one body falling towards her up she shouted to the creature and hermione started to head towards draco falling body the wind kept pushing him one way then another and as buckbeak flew underneath him his body was carried just a little bit behind hermione draco grab on draco twisted his body so he landed behind hermione on the animal but bounced off hermione reached out and grabbed draco hand right before he completely fell land granger draco pleaded hermione started to guided buckbeak to head downward but with the awkward weight on one side it was hard for the creature to maneuver hermione was quickly losing her grip on the young man ginny started to come down from up in the air when she saw hermione barley hanging on to draco she pushed her broom towards them i canthang on draco hermione cried get underneath the trees they ll break my fall draco said as his grip continued to slowly slip i sorry hermione said as she looked down at draco draco looked up at her and gave her a smile so i get a couple of broken legs draco smirked better then being dead draco then gave hermione a nod as his feet began to touch the tops of the trees ginny was and arm reach away from grabbing draco as hermione let go noooooo ginny shouted hermione looked up to see ginny dive after draco who was now falling through the trees his body never made it to the ground a large branch broke his fall once ginny found him she slung him over her broom and slowly flew up hermione waited to see what happened she breathed a sigh of relief when she saw ginny flying with him if he dies it will be on your head ginny screamed at hermione but ginny he told me but it was too late ginny was already heading to the castle lucious and mr weasley were still fighting with each other only now they just shouted instead of throwing spells at one another as they fought mr weasley saw a shadowy figure emerge from the forest it was voldemort and he was taking aim for mad eye no mr weasley muttered he started to run towards alastor to warn him alastor behind you but moody couldnthear arthur over the other shouting that was going on weasley no lucius shouted as he began to follow mr weasley at last the great alastor moody will fall tonight voldemort hissed as he took aim at moody mad eye realized he had let his guard down and slowly turned to face the dark lord i wont be the only one to fall tonight tom moody growled only two people dared to call the dark lord by his muggle name and one was about to die avada kedavra voldemort screamed moody braced himself for the end but all he felt was someone shoving him to the ground alastor looked up to see arthur weasley body falling to the ground before moody could get up a body fell on top of him knocking him out and pinning him to the ground lucius watched in terror as arthur took the spell in the chest sure lucius and arthur had their disagreements on wizards but deep down lucius knew arthur was a good man and had a family to support he didntdeserve to be cut down like an animal lucius thoughts then went to draco and how much he had failed his son he failed to protect his wife he couldntdo the same to his son the instincts to survive took over and lucius realized what he had to do once voldemort had moved away from arthur he quickly ran over and collected his body and headed for the castle as he got closer students realized who he was and guarded the door stop death eater a fourth year shouted please let me through he been hurt lucius shouted the students recognized the red hair and quickly nodded their head and opened the door for lucius the man franticly ran to the hospital wing and ran through the doors he looked around for someone to help him lucius snape called out from giving a student a potion severus help please he laid arthur on a bed can you save him snape immediately recognized arthur and started to examine him it didnttake long for snape to see that arthur was dead was he hit with the killing curse snape softly asked yes voldemort was trying to hit alastor moody but arthur pushed him out of the way lucius huffed there nothing i can do lucius snape sad sadly a blood curtailing scream came from the other end of the hall as mrs weasley saw arthur body on the bed dad a girls voice from several beds away asked lucius looked up to see ginny weasley holding draco hand draco lucius breathed he ran over towards his bed just as ginny got up and looked over at her dad what did you do to him ginny said between gritted teeth lucius stopped short and look at the young girl i didntdo anything lucius whispered your father saved moody life how ginny asked on the verge of tears by giving up his own lucius too was beginning to feel overwhelmed as he looked around at all those who were hurt and fighting to live his eyes returned to ginny she was trying to fight the tears that wanted to take over how draco lucius asked he gonna make it ginny chocked as she slowly headed over to her father mrs wealsey finally made it to her husband body and began to sob as ginny tried to comfort her was it worth all this lucius snape asked was following him worth losing your whole family over nothing is worth that severus lucius chocked back tears voldemort been spotted on the battle field a student shouted let us hope potter is the savior we all hope he is snape said as he looked over to the four names which were now being moved to the top of the board it now read granger hermione potter harry potter julia weasley ron let us hope a n ok i sorry this took a little longer then a week but work was very busy i not gonna make any promises on the date for the next chapter but just know i going as fast as possible you guys are great thanks for the reviews chapter 33 let there be light julia was not going to let bellatrix escape with her life again this deranged human being had tortured people into insanity and killed a little boy if it took every ounce of julia strength she would make sure this woman last breath would be tonight what the matter bella tired julia taunted as they continued to weave between those in the battle i think i ll keep you alive long enough for you to watch the dark lord kill your nephew bella snapped back i dontthink so stupefy julia took a shot at bellatrix the two continued their game of cat and mouse while the battle raged on the original da had gathered towards the middle of the battlefield and were slowly pushing the remaining death eaters back into the forest whispers of voldemort being seen had reached them but if the dark lord was on the field he was staying away from harry and his group fred behind you harry shouted the twin ducked just in time for harry to hit the death eater with the stunning spell just then the familiar cry of buckbeak could be heard as hermione and lupin landed with their small group how hagrid harry asked as he retreated from the front line nothing madam pomfrey cantfix lupin said as he dismounted from his hippogriff you alright harry asked as he helped hermione off buckbeak she was still a little shaken from the draco incident and a little upset that ginny would think she would drop him on purpose harry felt her conflict and made her look him in the eye not now she breathed later then harry asked she nodded her head in agreement then pulled out her wand and started to walk back to the front line harry you re group is doing wonderfully but the death eaters could out flank us from the left hermione you come with me have ron head to the right and help with them lupin instructed hermione reached out and squeezed harry hand then left with lupin ron harry called as he approached lupin worried about that group over there he pointed to the right will you head over there and help catch them up to us sure thing luna neville george come with me ron shouted as he ran over to the right to help press the attack high above the battle dumbledore watched as the children pressed on his heart was heavy he had just received word about arthur weasley and was told lucius malfoy had brought him in dumbledore looked up into the air and on the ground once more before leaving the tower he had instructed professor mcgonagall to continue instructing the children while he tended to molly he appeared in the great hall moments later and watched as ginny tried to comfort her mother his eyes glanced over at lucius who was sitting by draco bed dumbledore decided to deal with the older malfoy first he slowly made his way over to him and cleared his throat lucius dumbledore said with out any emotion in his voice the man quickly stood and stared at the old wizard why are you here for my son lucius sneered he still harbored resentment towards the old wizard well since you are a guest here then i will ask you to keep your mouth shut if you insult one student or parent who arentof pure blood you will discover why tom fears me dumbledore emotions over arthur death took over for a moment i will make sure the ministry hears of your deeds in bringing arthur body back here weasley and i had our differences when it came to wizards and families but i not a monster albus lucius insisted no you only served one the headmaster whispered dumbledore turned and walked away from lucius the man sat back down again and looked at his son right then he made the decision to only do what was right for draco from now on he might still think that muggles were not worth his time but his beliefs had already cost him his wife he refused to let them take his son as well molly sobs had quieted down but her tears still flowed freely down her face ginny stood next to her mother in shock trying to help her mother but still coming to terms with her father death this family was one of the most selfless ones dumbledore had known and it pained him to see them pay such a price charlie might never walk again and now arthur was gone never before had dumbledore let his emotions get the best of him the old wizard knelt down next to molly molly he whispered ever so gently the woman turned with her tear stained cheeks and disheveled red hair why she softly sobbed why arthur he saved a man life he did what he felt was right and he will forever be remembered for his sacrifice dumbledore spoke i will go retrieve fred and george from the battle madam hooch has already instructed bill to come back to the castle what about ron ginny asked the headmaster ron must stay out there to help harry the old wizard could see the young girls fear for her brother ginny just nodded her head dumbledore stood and headed for the door he calmly walked past the row of children guarding the castle go get em headmaster a young gryffindor shouted dumbledore smiled at the student and continued to walk towards the fighting all night neville had kept and eye on julia and bellatrix deep down he wanted to be the one to end her life she had taken his parents and now a dear friend from him he started to shadow their movements as they continued to move around finally bellatrix grabbed a broom lying on the ground she was quickly in the air and high above the trees when julia caught up to where bella had been she in the air neville shouted to julia thanks julia smiled at the young man she closed her eyes for a moment and with in seconds her broom came flying out of nowhere to her side she mounted her broom and rocketed off the ground neville hadntflown a broom since first year but he couldnthelp the impulse to get revenge for his parents and dean he found another broom on the ground and slowly mounted it he took a deep breath and pushed off the ground and into the air harry couldnthelp but glance over at his friends every other minute or so he knew that both of them could handle themselves but he just needed to make sure he decided to glance behind him to see if any death eaters had gotten past them he saw dumbledore talking with fred and george both of whom seemed upset and ran to the castle ha retreated from the fighting to talk with the headmaster professor harry could tell something was wrong what happened dumbledore was surprised to see harry running over to him as the old wizard looked at harry he noticed a shadow far in the distance over the boy shoulder professor dumbledore turned his attention to harry i afraid something has happened harry the old wizard began mr weasley saved alastor life dumbledore looked away well that good isntit harry had a feeling he knew how mr weasley had saved moody life but he didntwant to believe it arthur was hit with the killing curse dumbledore said slowly harry slowly turned to look at his friend with the red hair that why you sent fred and george inside he muttered his voice betraying his emotion he felt numb all over the weasley had taken him in and cared for him since his very first year these people were his family they didntcare who he was or who he was meant to be they loved him harry the boy not the name or legend for a moment harry thought he was going to be sick until a slender hand lightly grabbed his shoulder dontlet his sacrifice be for nothing harry dumbledore whispered the young man looked up at the old wizard i won t harry voice was back dumbledore patted the boy shoulder and the two slowly walked to the front lines together in the air neville was having a hard time keeping up with julia and bellatrix they were faster and more confident on their brooms it wasntuntil they started to head for the quidditch pitch then neville began to catch up with them he flew to one of the stands and quietly landed as he watched the two witches throw one volley after another it over bella and you know it julia barrel rolled to the right then turned behind her to throw a spell at bella cruccio the spell barley missed bellatrix who was now preparing her own attack the only thing i know is how much i going to enjoy killing you bella did a loop then shouted avada kedavra julia easily dodged the spell then came around for another pass at bella the two witches were now face to face bellatrix back was to neville the boy had a clear shot at hitting her with a spell his hand was shaking as he raised his wand this will be the last night you draw breath bella you ran like a coward last time we faced if i have to chase you around the world i ll do it julia cold stare was unnerving the words were on the tip of neville tongue ah ava his whole body was shaking as he tried to whisper the words he had never wanted to cause anyone pain let alone want to kill them he swallowed hard and took a deep breath you caught me by surprise last time potter i ready for you tonight bellatrix hissed instead of killing you maybe i ll just torture you into insanity like the longbottom s those pathetic fools didnteven put up a fight a wicked smile spread across her face as julia stared at bellatrix something caught her eye looking past her julia saw neville with his wand pointing at the witch she could tell he was shaking i d watch your words bella julia muttered and why is that is their poor little pathetic son going to come after me he disgraces the wizarding name he wouldnthave the guts to kill me her laughter was even more taunting then her words neville took a deep breath then pointed his wand again at the witch this time his arm was steady as was his words bye bella julia smiled as she backed away from the witch avada kedavra neville shouted bella turned on her broom just in time to see the spell hit her in the chest her body fell into the blackness of night and it wasntuntil they heard the bone cracking thud on the ground that neville and julia knew she was finally dead julia flew over to the stands and watched neville for a moment his eyes never leaving the ground i glad she dead neville whispered so am i neville julia slowly put her arm around the boy shoulders so am i they continued to stand there for several minutes it wasntuntil the moon peeked out from behind a cloud that they finally saw her body lying twisted on the ground do you think i ll go to azkaban neville eyes were glossing over with tears no neville julia whispered i ll make sure of it some how i thought that if i were the one to kill her neville voice was unsteady as he trailed off he continued to look at the ground i sure when you tell your parents about what you did they ll be grateful julia continued to watch the boy closely no they won t he shook his head i killed someone just like bellatrix no julia grabbed neville by his shoulders and forced him to look at her she killed with no remorse she enjoyed killing neville you re nothing like her julia paused remember that neville harry scar slowly prickled as he continued to fight death eaters he was beginning to feel dizzy as he looked around for voldemort he dropped to his knees and through his connection began to call for julia who was still with neville when she felt harry calls for help julia quickly mounted her broom in a panic what is it neville asked harry in trouble julia breathed neville grabbed his broom and they quickly took to the air ron and hermione had also felt harry call for help hermione was the first to reach harry she quickly grabbed his arm when their skin made contact she could feel him relax at the same time she also heard a man cry out in pain both ron and hermione helped harry to his feet dumbledore was quickly by their side the death eaters slowly retreated as a black figure finally made his presence known the students slowly gathered behind dumbledore and harry i must say dumbldore you ve trained them well voldemort hissed as he approached the group it over tom you reign of fear and terror ends here the headmaster took out his wand oh no dumbledore that is were you are wrong voldemort said calmly he then began to mutter something dumbeldore protectively stood in front of harry and the rest of the students a black mist slowly started to roll towards them shields up the old wizard shouted but the mist continued its slow attack on the headmaster it ever so slowly seeped past his shield and the moment dumbledore breathed it in he began to spasm ventus tempestas hermione shouted a mighty wind came rushing from behind her sending the black mist over the lake it slowly evaporated but hermione attention turned to dumbledore clever girl but the spell has already entered his system you ve merely slowed down the inevitable not even his precious phoenix can save him now voldemort cackled why use a phoenix when we have roise hermione smiled the bird cried out as it swooped down to pick up dumbledore voldemort watched the bird and hermione wordless communication seconds later the bird was in the air carrying dumbledore back to the castle lupin now slowly made his way to the front of the line the battle in the air was still raging as julia and neville tried to make their way back to harry julia was dodging left and right trying to avoid an unnecessary fighting slowly she began to feel d j vu and then it hit her this was her vision these next few moments would determine the outcome of many lives her heart raced as she tried to get to harry scared potter you no longer have dumbledore coddling you voldemort taunted you wish harry snapped back as he took a step forward separating himself from the group hermione and ron followed each flanking harry you think that silly spell dumbledore performed on you is going to prevent me from killing you potter voldemort hissed no harry said calmly i going to prevent you from killing me riddle harry never flinched as he looked at the dark wizard his mind flooded with memories of his years at hogwarts his first year discovering the world of wizards the second year uncovering the mysteries of the chamber of secrets finding out about siruis in his third year the tri wizards tournament fourth year the prophecy reveled in the fifth year and now here in his sixth year finally facing the wizard who caused so much horror in his life julia was beginning to get clear of the battle in the air when she heard neville cry out she turned and saw him trying to shake a death eater quickly turning around julia pushed her broom to help neville neville duck julia shouted as she approached he bowed his head down on the broom stupefy julia watch out neville shouted as julia tried to maneuver away from whatever danger neville was warning her about she felt a spell hit her broom causing her to fall off the ground rushing towards her was the last thing julia remembered harry felt his connection to julia suddenly disappear he glanced back to ron and hermione both looked worried they all knew that in order to protect each other they needed all four of them i think i ll show your fellow students the lesson for defying me voldemort said as he raised his wand the trio matched his action and now it was a matter of who was going to attach first cruccio protego maximus the three friends shouted the black abyss julia consciousness was swimming in was so deep and thick she couldntfight her way out of it she tried to will herself to wake up but her fall was so bad julia doubted she d wake up the spell was causing her senses to scream out harry was in trouble and she couldntdo anything about it she had failed him and this thought caused her to give up her battle with the blackness she was about to finally fade into the dark when a soft light began emanating julia a voice whispered its time to call on us for help james is that you julia asked time to get up sis the voice of her dead brother echoed in her head a moment before the sounds of reality came crashing down on her julia slowly opened her eyes which were out of focus her head was pounding and her body felt raw her eyes slowly came back into focus and she turned to see harry and the students producing shield charms to protect them selves from voldemort attack julia noticed the inside of her right hand was cut remembering a side effect of the spell they performed julia quickly called for her wand and slowly started to get up your shields wont work against this potter voldemort wand slowly raised julia was wobbly and when she tried to stand she saw voldemort about to perform the killing curse blood of our blood protect us julia shouted as she pointed to the sky voldemort and harry turned to see julia pointing her wand at the sky hermione and ron grabbed harry hand as they felt the air trickle with electricity time to meet your parents potter voldemort cried out an explosion of light cascaded upon harry hermione and ron the light was blinding and julia had to shield her face the three friends looked up towards the heavens until three figures appeared in front of them james lily and sirius now stood between voldemort and the children just as suddenly as the light had appeared voldemort screamed out in pain he tried to shield himself from the light but he soon felt his skin begin to burn it over tom lily ghostly figure said voldemort shrieks of pain echoed into the night his very being was dying he tried to think of anything that could possibly save him he spotted a broom and with all his strength summoned it to him he haphazardly flew into the air as far away from the light as possible the three white figures turned to the trio you ll have to face him again harry sirius sadly said but you ll be ready james smiled we re proud of you honey lily white hand gently caressed harry cheek watch over these two hermione sirius laughed james looked over at ron we re watching over your father ron he in good hands james looked at the confused red headed boy we love you harry lily smiled before the figures began to blend in with the blinding light surrounding them dontever forget it son his fathers voice lingered in the air as the light began to retreat back to the sky as the light left so did the energy of the foursome they all collapsed to the ground the remaining death eaters fled for their life the air squadron landed along with neville they all continued to look at the trio bodies then they would glance over at julia body neville was the first to act he slowly walked over to harry body seamus followed his lead and the two friends hoisted harry body onto his shoulders luna and susan bones did the same with hermione body while roger davies and zacharias smith grabbed ron s lupin and tonks walked over and grabbed julia body leading the group back to the castle the students parted as their hero bodies were slowly marched back up to the castle the slow procession continued towards the castle as they entered the great hall all movement stopped the crowd watched as the bodies were place side by side mcgonagall pressed through the crowd once she reached the beds she saw lupin is it over mcgonagall whispered for now a n again i sorry it taking so long i really going to try and get the next chapter out as soon as i can thank you for sticking with me you guys are great chapter 34 repercussions the vigil had been going on for almost three days anyone involved in the battle refused to leave the great hall until the four heroes woke up it was a confusing time for everyone the world they had known was now turned upside down dumbledore was very sick and was kept away from the students and teachers mcgonagall who would normally be the next voice of reason was dealing with the ministry of magic while snape continued to try and help madam pomfrey as best as he could lupin refused to leave harry and julia side even to eat it was in this time that a new leader emerged whispers of his use of the killing curse continued to spread like wild fire around the great hall but no one dared to ask him he was pulled into a meeting with the ministry hours after the battle but again no one had the courage to ask him what happened neville no longer looked like the goofy unsure of himself kid the slytherin would pick on he was confident but behind the confidence lingered the scare from his dark deed he had told his grandmother about what happened in the quidditch pitch once things had settled down sometimes the only way to deal with evil is to use evil neville his grandmother whispered as she hugged the young boy neville was now coordinating the effort to take care of the families who might have lost someone during the battle dobby neville said softly have any of the weasley eaten their food no sir dobby looked down at the floor his big bright eyes brimmed with tears professor lupin hasnteaten either neville nodded his head then slowly walked to the area in which the weasley family was held madam pomfrey and professor mcgonagall put up walls to give them privacy they were all gathered by charlie bed once in a great while one of the twins or ginny would come out and grab some type of drink to give to their mother but other than that no one had seen them neville slowly pulled the curtain divider open and peeked in to see mrs weasley holding charlie hand while the twins and bill were standing so ginny could sleep on the bed next to charlie s mrs weasley looked up and saw neville neville dear mrs weasley voice was horse and could barley reach over a whisper mrs weasley neville slowly entered the room and closed the curtains behind him dobby told me none of you have eaten oh we re find dear mrs weasley tried to smile please mrs weasley ron is going to need you at full strength when he wakes up neville said softly the mention of ron seemed to snap mrs weasley out of her funk he right mum fred walked over to his mother and put a tender hand on her shoulder we ll all try to eat if you try mrs weasley gave a quick nod i ll have dobby bring you something right away neville began to leave when he felt a hand grab his arm it was george how lupin george whispered neville just shook his head then left neville found dobby and gave him instructions to send food to the weasley s the foursome had been kept together and unlike the weasleys they were in plain view for everyone to see people took turns watching over them though it was normally a crowd that watched over them as neville approached the group parted he could see lupin sitting between harry and julia how he doing neville asked seamus hasntmoved a muscle seamus whispered the inner circle of the crowd was all gryffindor they were protective of their classmates and wanted to make sure no one could disrupt them neville stepped up behind lupin and gently tapped his shoulder professor neville whispered hello neville lupin eyes were red rimmed from lack of sleep and his voice was scratchy they would want you to eat sir neville ever so slowly sat down on the edge of julia bed when i graduated all those years ago i never imagined i d be the only one left lupin muttered while looking at julia first peter betrayed lilly and james to voldemort and then i lost sirius silent tears welled up in lupin eyes harry and julia are all i have left lupin whispered before looking neville in the eye i cantlose them too you wont professor neville said cautiously but you re no good to them if you re in a hospital bed from lack of eating and sleeping lupin gave a slight grunt you re right neville lupin said as he stood the professor tried to stand but almost passed out luckily neville and seamus caught him and helped him over to a bed next to julia within moments lupin was asleep leaving neville completely alone to deal with everyone neville seamus said as his friend took lupin seat between harry and julia is it true what people er sayin what are they saying neville looked over at julia then realized that someone was walking up to him luna walked from the row of beds on the opposite side of the foursome they re saying you killed bellatrix the young girl bent down so that neville would look her in the eye is it true neville did you kill her neville eye never left julia face it true neville whispered as people closest too him gasped while others asked what he had just said i killed her neville eyes were heavy from lack of sleep he hadntrealized that he wasnttaking care of himself here neville luna took neville hand and guided him to a bed behind harry s we ll wake you if anything happens now what a first year asked we help those we can luna said as she now took the watch dumbledore would have been proud of his students they had reversed roles and were now taking care of the people who were supposed to take care of them the next night consciousness began to resonate within harry the first thing he was aware of was his connection to his friends who were also waking up whispers of conversations began to fill harry ears how the headmaster lupin voice was the first one harry recognized i dontknow poppy hasntsaid much the voice of mcgonagall was the next harry instinct was to speak but his mouth was so dry he couldntform the words he forced his eye open despite how heavy they felt wa wa harry tried to say he took a hard swallow and tried again water his voice scratchy and low oh my mcgonagall breathed as she saw the foursome eye open and close as the group tried to wake themselves up she then noticed harry slowly reach his hand up trying to get her attention remus they re awake mcgonagall practically shouted the normal crowd that watched over the heroes doubled in size instantly as everyone tried to get a look at them lupin neville luna and mcgonagall gently held their heads as they gave each of the foursome water what happened julia spoke first as lupin gently guided her head back down onto the pillow you dontremember lupin asked i remember a bright light ron said as he tried to push himself up on his elbows i remember seeing sirius hermione said after taking another sip of water at that moment all four sat up and remembered voldemort they shouted at the same time gone lupin helped julia sit up i dontknow what you were doing to him but he fled before you could completely destroy him where dumbledore harry asked as he sat on the edge of his bed both mcgonagall and lupin looked at each other he sick hermione answered that black mist was not just a spell it was something else ron started looking around for his family where are my mum and dad ron asked as he tried to stand silence fell upon the crowd no one had the heart to be the first to tell ron about his father something happened to your father ron the rough voice of moody broke the silence the old wizard stepped forward he had just woken up earlier that day i wasntpaying attention and voldemort snuck up behind me moody trailed off then james words came rushing back to ron he gone ron whispered lucius malfoy had pushed his way through the crowd when he heard the four had woken up he died bravely lucius said his voice startled everyone but ron who had seen him approach why are you here ron growled ron hermione tried to step in front of ron but he sidestepped her get out ron continued his low growl mr malfoy brought you father body back mcgonagall explained as she stepped in front of ron probably so the ministry wouldntsend him to azkaban ron snapped back i tried to stop him against my better judgment but i did lucius eyed the young weasley i d mind your place lucius julia now stood right in front of the former death eater if it isntthe famed julia potter lucius snickered it would seem that bella lost her battle against you i had help julia smiled oh lucius raised his eyebrow i killed bellatrix neville stepped forward you lucius scoffed yes he did julia took another step forward so that she was only inches from the older malfoy face enough came a wheezing cough from an old wizard dumbledore harry cried out headmaster what are you doing out of bed madam pomfrey looked like she was about to have a conniption the crowd turned to surround the tired wizard who was leaning on tonks for support lucius please check on draco while i speak with young mr weasley dumbledore eyed the man lucius bowed his head then left to sit with draco dumbledore gingerly walked over to the four heroes ron dumbledore voice was gentle and soft as he walked over to the red head you re father gave his life to save another he will forever be known as a hero in our fight against evil dumbledore put his hand on ron shoulder as he spoke where is he ron asked his voice his voice devoid of any emotion they re preparing him for his funeral dumbledore whispered trying to keep the conversation as intimate as possible can i see him ron asked of course several minutes later the foursome along with dumbledore mcgonagall lupin and tonks walked to a small private room the door opened to reveal a room filled with the dead fifteen in all had lost their lives in the battle it was a small number but one dumbledore didntwant to have to face at all dean had been the only student to lose his life while arthur was the only non auror last alliance adult to lose his life they walked the long row of lifeless faces until dean appeared they were all in plain gowns at the moment the families would choose dress robes before the bodies were taken to the funeral pyre the three gryffindor gathered around their friend body for a moment to pay their respect from dean they moved on to mr weasley ron very slowly reached for his father hand which was so ice cold there were so many things ron wanted to say but didntknow where to begin mr weasley harry spoke first trying to take any pressure off of ron you were like the father i d never had you took me in and treated me like another son even when it was dangerous to the rest of your family i ll never forget you harry finished while trying to battle the lump that had formed in his throat you were always asking me questions about muggles and you treated me like an equal and not a child your thirst for knowledge and your passion for a world outside your own made you more unique then any other wizard i know i ll miss you greatly hermione added julia stepped forward and cleared her throat all i can do is thank you arthur for taking care of my nephew when i couldn t i know that james and lilly thank you as well finally ron turn came to say some parting words dad ron started i know i wasntthe best student and i know i gave you and mum a lot of scares over the years but any time i was in danger i knew you guys would be there for me ron paused i just sorry i couldntbe there for you ron voice failed for a moment i promise to look over ginny and mum and i ll watch over your muggle collection the young man was running out of words to say i love you dad several days later those words were repeated as the large mass of people gathered to pay their respects to the fifteen dead the funeral pyres were constructed by the lake on the very ground on which they had fought on the house elves had done such a wonderful job cleaning up the field you would never know peopled walked on the grass let alone fought on it the dead were dressed in their finest robes and held on to their wands in both hands dean family had been contacted by dumbledore and mcgonagall personally brought them to hogwarts his mother and stepfather were in awe of everything around them they lined his funeral pyre with tokens and things dean loved about both worlds a jersey from the west ham football team his gryffindor quidditch outfit and a picture of dean with his family when he sent letters home telling us about all the wonderful things he was learning i never really understood it i also never understood why dean real father walked out on us but now his mother trailed off as she looked at her dead son now i understand they both were fighting against evil but what brings me comfort is knowing how much he was loved tears flowed freely down the woman face seamus stepped forward to say a few words about his best friend gryffindor will never forget yer seamus voice failed i ll never forget yer dean mother went over and gave seamus a hug it is now time to send them on their final journey dumbledore voice echoed over the crowd in unison those gather placed their hoods over they heads in a sign of respect for the dead a friend or family member of the dead went over to a large bonfire and grabbed a torch ron was the only weasley that seemed composed enough to perform the ritual charlie had been brought out in a chair with the levitation spell on it and had taken several pain potions so that he could watch the torchbearers raised their torches to signal they were ready may these lights guide you on your next journey but may they also help you to always find your way home dumbledore bowed his head and now a little irish blessing to send our friend on their way dumbledore stepped back julia now stood between the rows of pyres be they kings or poets or farmers they re a people of great worth they keep company with the angels and bring a bit of heaven here to earth as julia finished her blessing the torches were lowered and the pyres lit the firelight illuminated the lake and matched the fiery sunset above harry watched as the fire reflected in ron eyes which had been vacant to any emotions since he was told about his father harry worried that this fire he was now seeing in ron eyes would become a permanent fixture until they faced voldemort again a soft hand weaved its way into harry s he looked up and saw hermione watching dean and mr weasley body burn away into nothingness he ll pay for what he done she whispered even with the hood up harry could see her face glow from the fire light with a small stream of tears accented her features yes he will harry squeezed her hand as he turned back to look into the fire his eyes then followed the line of smoke as it rose from the pyre to the heavens harry then remembered his father words and knew that both mr weasley and dean were watching over them a n the next chapter is the last one just wanted to give everyone fair warning plus it will be posted before the 16th as you might have guessed i am planning on writing a sequal but i gonna take a month or two off before i start working on it as always i cantthank you all anough for the kind words you guys keep me going chapter 35 the new world nothing would ever be the same these words played over and over again in harry mind following the days after mr weasley funeral never again would he be able to walk the halls of hogwarts without thinking about the battle dean or mr weasley they were everywhere in the castle and any time harry would look at ron or mount a broom they would enter his mind for a moment it was the least they deserved it was finally the day in which everyone was leaving to go home the students who had been put to sleep had rejoined their classmates after the funerals the great hall was filled with copies of the daily prophet everyone wanting to read about their friends dumbledore was allowed to contact the paper and give them the full account of the battle a large picture of mr weasley and dean were on the front page with the title heroes among us the article was probably the most tasteful one harry had ever read it gave a complete accurate account of everything that happened from the dragon attack earlier in the day to the blinding white light that caused the dark lord to flee dumbledore however did leave a few things out mostly about the spell that was performed on the four heroes the trio now sat eating their breakfast and preparing to part from one another now that the dursley officially moved to the country where are you gonna stay ron asked as he piled his plate full of eggs and sausage harry smiled inwardly as he watched his friend eat as long as ron had is appetite harry knew his friend would be ok grimmauld place harry smiled thinking about having a summer free of the dursley and free of fear what about you mum looking for a place to rent close to st mungo s ron muttered as he ate some toast why dontyou stay at grimmauld i have more then enough room the thought of living alone in the house seemed a little depressing to harry thanks mate but we dontwant to be a burden ron said harry gave ron a look like he was crazy he then looked around for mrs weasley and saw her eating at the opposite end of the gryffindor table he quickly got up and walked over to her mrs weasley he said softly as he knelt down to talk with her harry she gave a tired smile how are you dear well i d feel a lot better knowing your family was staying at grimmauld the young man smiled please mrs weasley you re family has done so much for me oh harry i dontknow how long we d be doesntmatter harry cut the woman off you all are welcome to live there as long as you want harry tried to smile besides what will i do all summer by myself what about julia wontshe be staying with you mrs weasley asked harry and julia had barley had any time to talk since they had woken up she had to go to the ministry with the members of the last alliance and talk about their plans to look for voldemort i dontknow harry looked down at the floor but i have plenty of room and you ll be close to st mungo s mrs weasley thought for a moment we ll earn our keep i ll cook the meals and i ll have fred and george give you rent money mrs weasley started to rummage through her bag no harry put a calming hand on hers you re my family he said ever so gently as long as i know you all are safe and near me that all the payment i need mrs weasley quickly wrapped harry into a bear hug nearly squeezing the stuffing out of him thank you mrs weasley whispered we re going to st mungo from king cross to check in on charlie draco and dumbledore once we know they re settled in we ll come by the house would you mind if i joined you i want to make sure dumbledore is ok harry asked of course mrs weasley smiled harry started to get up and leaved when mrs weasley put a hand on his arm you are truly a great wizard harry your parents would be so proud of you thank you he smiled as he headed back towards his friends later that day the students boarded the train harry was desperately searching the platform for julia lupin or hagrid but he couldntfind any of them you going to leave with out sayin goodbye are yer s hargid voice boomed of course not harry walked over to his large friend will i see you this summer oh i reckon you will hagrid smiled he had taken quite the beating from the other giants but he had recovered and now only had small cuts on his arms and face especially since your aunt has taken over the order while dumbledore is sick she has again harry felt out of the loop again why was julia not contacting him or asking about him the train whistle blew indicating the final boarding call you best be getting on the train harry i ll see you at st mungo s hagrid winked before walking away harry boarded the train and found hermione and ron standing in the hallway apparently everyone from the battle wanted to sit in the compartment the trio was sitting in so harry decided they all could fit in the dinning car harry sat in the middle and watched as friends recounted some of their adventures through out the year what made harry laugh was that the students didntnecessarily want to talk with harry just be near him so many things had changed but harry was still alive and still fighting he was the one constant in all the chaos so harry was content to just sit and watch as people would tell stories then shout out to him a question which he would answer it was during the train ride that harry noticed the tension between hermione and ginny hermione harry whispered she was sitting next to him in the booth they had taken while ron and luna sat across from them during the battle when you came back from helping hagrid something was wrong it draco hermione said as she looked over at ginny i saw him falling and tried to catch him but i couldnthold on he told me to fly above some trees and drop him once his feet were touching the top of them as i let him go ginny came flying by she thinks i dropped him on purpose hermione looked at harry i wouldntdo that harry even if draco hadntchanged harry quickly wrapped hermione in a hug he knew she was telling the truth he could feel it but you cantexplain a feeling to a friend i sure once draco wakes up he ll explain everything harry said before kissing the top of hermione head as the train got closer to king cross it dawned on harry that he was going to have to leave hermione a thought he wasnttoo happy about especially with voldemort still out there after a moment harry saw ron and hermione looking over at him he realized they had felt his worries this connection was still a strange thing for harry even though it had technically saved his life however the connection was a little weak due to the fourth element being so far away dontyou worry mr potter hermione smiled i ll be visiting you this summer i ll keep an eye on him hermione ron smiled somebody got to keep him out of trouble then it looks like it will be me since your middle name is trouble added luna the group laughed a sound that was music to harry ears they all would move past the scars of this battle harry was certain of it an hour later the massive group of students gathered on the platform the camaraderie this group now had would last them all a lifetime goodbyes were shared addresses were exchanged and promises made to visit new friends after several minutes children began to filter through the wall harry hermione and ron were talking and werenteven paying attention until hermione parents called out her name the trio stopped and looked at each other splitting up was probably the toughest thing they had to do hermione put on her best smile and gave ron a kiss on the cheek please keep me updated on charlie condition i ll probably come visit in a couple of weeks if he still at st mungo s hermione said while hugging her friend take your time with your parents ron whispered back i ll write you everyday ron said as he pulled out of the hug i promise hermione then said her goodbyes to luna and neville she turned and looked at harry promise me you ll be careful harry said as hermione slid her arms around his waist they held each other for several minutes each not wanting to be the first one to let go i love you harry whispered into her hair and i you her eyes were wide and vulnerable as she looked up at harry hermione her mother called out it time sweetheart to everyone surprise including harry s hermione crashed her lips on to the young mans when they parted harry had the goofiest grin on his face just remember hermione whispered the ones we love never truly leave us and with that hermione slowly started to back away they continued to hold each other hands until their very fingertips were left and when the physical connection was lost harry desperately held on to the mental one it wasntuntil hermione was out of sight that harry figured out why hermione had said that last phrase sirius had spoken those exact words to harry in his third year right before taking off on buckbeak half an hour later harry was watching the weasley make sure charlie was comfortable the healers at st mungo were optimistic that he might regain the use of his legs as the day went on harry noticed ginny walk over to draco bed which conveniently was across from charlie s in fact harry noticed that the entire ward was full of everyone from the battle save one dumbledore had his own private room just across the hall from the ward harry learned that dumbledore had insisted on it harry made his way over to the room and quietly entered the old wizard was sleeping harry took a seat next to the bed and just watched as dumbledore chest slowly rose and fell the young man eyes became heavy and soon harry was trying to keep himself awake you dontneed to watch over me harry came the raspy voice of the headmaster i dontplan on leaving any time soon professor harry snapped out of his daze yes i alive and plan on staying that way for a while the wizard coughed save your strength professor harry said as he gave dumbledore a glass of water from his trey i fear this next year will be difficult harry the headmaster spoke softly voldemort is like a wounded animal anything that comes near it can provoke it or cause it to do bad things dontworry harry said i ll be careful good dumbledore closed his eyes for a moment harry he said suddenly i here harry scooted closer to the old wizard i proud of you the wizard yawned before falling back asleep harry sat stunned for a moment he never thought praise from dumbledore would feel so good a sad smile formed on the young boys face he knew with hermione and ron help they could find a cure for the headmaster harry a hushed whisper came from the door harry turned to see julia standing in the doorway it time to go home there was a time when harry would only associate that word with hogwarts but now harry could associate it to wherever his family was the young man got up and left the old wizard to rest julia patted him on the back as they joined the weasley in the hallway for the first time in his life harry would be going to a real home with a real family all of whom loved him dearly a n the first thing i have to do is thank my boy friend who read every single chapter trying to fix any spelling and grammar mistakes he could obviously he did get them all but i want to thank him for the effort as i mentioned in the last chapter i will be writinga squeal i going to take some time off but i thinking september will probably be when i start posting again i ll try to respond to your last reviews of this chapter please dontget frustrated if i slow to respond there were so many times when i was busy that i didntwant to

was already in progress i truly blessed to have you all as reads no amount of thank you could truly express my gratitude for your support i know i a lucky writer and it is with a heavy heart that i end this story but all stories must come to an end but in their ending there the possibility or a new beginning with love as always julia potter chapter 5 the preparation for battle begins it was the day before harry and dumbledore were to visit grinngotts to sort out sirius will grimmauld place was bustling with activity ater the sorting hat warning dumbledore instructed everyone to go home until he could find out whether voldemort was indeed going to act the way the hat predicted they were all to meet in two weeks the night before the new term of school started today was the first day of lessons potions and transfiguration was in the morning after lunch was defense against the dark arts and dueling with moody then after dinner would be occlumency harry was running late for his first lesson of the day he threw his clothes on and grabbed his books as he tore down the stairs he still had some bruising on his face but his ribs and head felt a lot better then yesterday this might be the summer and you think you can be a little more relaxed but i will not tolerate lateness at hogwarts nor here said an annoyed snape as harry entered the kitchen sorry professor said harry he sat down and opened his book to their lesson of the day now as i was saying today we will learn simple healing potions which can be made fairly quickly in the field instructed snape harry had a feeling that all of the lessons would be like this everything focused on the battle this battle was going to be it everyone hopes for a future without voldemort without the death eaters and most importantly without fear but harry felt that no one had confidence in him he would catch people gazing at him as if he wasntgoing to make it didntanyone have faith he could beat voldemort then harry realized all he had to do was look at his best friends as long as they had faith in him that was all he needed snape lesson went by fairly quickly and harry found himself walking to the living room for his transfiguration lesson he hadntgiven his animal much thought do you know what animal you wanna be harry asked ron no idea said harry dontworry this first lesson is to help us fined the right animal i heard mcgonagall talking to lupin this morning said hermione the three walked into the living room to await their next lesson they waited for a few minutes before harry spotted a cat sitting on the table just watching them professor asked harry the cat jumped down to the floor and slowly walked towards the three of them and as it walked professor mcgonagall began to take form very good mr potter how could you tell it was me asked mcgonagall you were looking straight into my eyes stated harry so it wasntuntil i stopped acting like a cat that you noticed me and that one of the first things you have to think about when choosing an animal what animal shares your qualities your modes and most importantly your strengths now i going to ask you a few questions and please answer truthfully mcgonagall paused then looked at ron mr weasly would you say you re a loyal friend to mr potter and ms grainger yeah said a defensive ron would you follow them wherever they went asked mcgonagall ron nodded his head would you consider trying a wolf as your animal mr weasley a wolf questioned ron a wolf is a fierce warrior and hunter but he loyal to his pack and will help catch food or defend it young at all cost explained mcgonagall try something for me mr weasley close your eyes and think about a wolfs howl okay said ron do you hear it asked mcgonagall ron nodded good now take a deep breath and try it ron paused for a moment then took a deep breath and let out a loud howl he opened his eyes with a shocked expression brilliant said ron very good mr weasley an impressed mcgonagall said as she clapped now ms granger actually professor i have an idea of what animal to become interrupted hermione oh and what might that be asked mcgonagall a unicorn hermione muttered well ms granger you do know magical creatures are a lot harder to do then normal animals said mcgonagall i know but i think i can do it said hermione with a little more confidence very well can you picture the horn asked mcgonagall hermione nodded close your eyes and begin to focus on the horn hermione took a deep breath then closed her eyes several moments past without anything happening a small stub began to protrude from hermione forehead it slowly grew until it was completely formed both harry and ron had their mouths a gaped bloody hell whispered ron and just as soon as it had grown it disappeared and hermione fell back onto the couch in exhaustion amazing ms granger amazing exclaimed mcgonagall who then turned to harry mr potter do you know what you want to be um not really harry said with a little embarrassment well what are you good at asked mcgonagall harry thought for a moment then it hit him he was good at flying flying professor said harry yes you re very good at flying harry mcgonagall paused what other qualities harry thought for a moment he might be skinny but he considered himself strong and he defiantly could be a leader if needed he also thought about his undying need to protect the ones he loved just then harry started to remember that night at the ministry when fawkes had jumped in front of dumbledore to save him from the killing curse his thoughts then drifted to when fawkes saved him from the basilisk and harry knew right then what he wanted to be a phoenix stated harry i thought you might say that mcgonagall paused and stared at harry why dontyou hold your arms out and focus on the wings of the phoenix suggested mcgonagall harry slowly raised his arms and closed his eyes and remembered the rush he felt when he was holding on to fawkes tail when he carried everyone out of the chamber he slowly opened his eyes and looked at his arms which were now stunningly beautiful red wings he closed his eyes and focused again and when he opened them his arms were back to normal excellent mr potter you ve all done very well now lets go see what for lunch shall we said an excited mcgonagall harry ron and hermione were all excited about their new animagus form and were bragging to everyone at lunch mcgonagall did ask that they dontlet anyone at hogwarts know about their special training she had no doubt there would be spies amongst the students this year the rest of the afternoon went well lupin explained how some spells need emotion to fuel them like the patronus spell and the crucio spell while mad eye began to teach them pain deflection by pricking their fingers until they didntbleed before harry knew it he was back in the kitchen eating dinner he noticed it was still light he rushed through dinner and ran up and grabbed his firebolt the backyard of grimmauld place was protected with the same charms as the house so know one could see him he stepped out side and noticed someone else had chosen to fly around it was the new auror julia she was practicing some complex moves speeding in one direction then turning on a dime and going the other tight barrel rolls and loop de loops then he saw her climb very high into the air and just as harry was beginning to lose sight of her he saw something that made his heart stop julia had jumped off her broom into a swan dive and was free falling towards him at an alarming rate just as harry was about to mount his broom he heard something accio broom boomed julia the broom which was once just hovering where julia had left it was now rocketing towards its owner at a high speed it caught up to her and she grabbed it and pulled out of the dive just before hitting the ground harry just stood there in amazement julia noticed she had a spectator and slowly came down to talk to the young man evening harry smiled julia that was unbelievable how did you do that a still shocked harry asked a lot of practice and people spotting me incase i couldntpull out in time laughed julia i ve heard you re quite the flyer i cantdo anything like that said harry well maybe in time i could teach you but you up for a game of tag asked julia tag questioned harry yeah you re it and with that julia jumped on her broom and was off harry quickly figured out the game and began his chase they had been flying for over an hour before hermione came out to get harry for their occlumency lesson he thanked julia and asked if they could play again some time anytime you want harry but if i not here rosie always up for it julia said as she walked up stairs to change out of her quidditch gear harry went straight to the living room with hermione ron and dumbledore were already waiting inside wonderful let begin shall we the first thing i want you all to know is what it feels like to have someone invade your head harry would you please perform the charm on hermione while i perform it on ron asked dumbledore hermione gave harry a worried look dontworry it will be okay just focus on pushing me out of your head once i there harry said softly he positioned himself in front of hermione ready harry harry nodded one two three legilimens both harry and dumbledore said harry all of a sudden began to see events from the last 6 years but in a different perspective he saw himself catching the snitch during his first year but a different sense of pride filled him as he watched then he saw the basilisk in herminone mirror flash again to the third year when hermione was watching harry perform the expecto patronum spell on all the dementors another memory of harry about to take on the dragon for his first task in the tri wizards tournament but he felt a tremendous sense of fear and worry came over him while he watched as hermione kissed harry good luck one more memory flashed as harry watched as the purple spell hit hermione in the chest and harry saw himself looking straight at hermione with a terrified look then harry heard hermione yell nooooooo screamed hermione she had forced him out of her mind but it took much effort she was on her knees on the ground and was breathing hard harry bent down to see if she was all right you okay he whispered yeah it not everyday someone sees all your memories she tried to play it off but harry could tell she was disappointed at herself for not being stronger it okay hermione it took me a while before i could stop snape said harry as he helped her to her feet now let change sides and let them know what it like to see into our heads harry said a smiling dumbledore who was also helping ron to his feet harry prepared himself and gave hermione and smile letting her know it was going to be okay ready ron asked hermione as i ever will be ron nervously said okay one two three legilimens they both shouted now harry was experiencing his own memories the first was that of sirius falling behind the veil then his memory snapped to the moment hermione was hit with the purple spell he ran over to her and he began to think the same thoughts he had that night dontlet her be dead dontlet her be dead it will be my fault if she dead then the fear that harry had that night came back to him as he looked at a lifeless hermione another flash and he was seeing hermione and ron play chess from the other day he saw that his focus was on hermione and he heard himself think about the promise he made to not let them be hurt again this was enough he couldntlet her see anymore harry thought and forced hermione out of his head ouch she shouted harry looked up to see hermione rubbing her wrist the same was snape was when he had unintentionally preformed a stinging hex now that you ve experienced both sides of this type of manipulation you can understand why it imperative that we have you as close to being ready as possible for the start of the school term i think that enough for tonight said dumbledore harry may i have a moment yes professor said a tired harry i just wanted to let you know that hermione and ron will be coming with us tomorrow it seems that sirius left a few things for them as well dumbledore said softly okay what time should we be ready asked harry nine o clock we ll be taking the night bus so make sure you have correct change smiled dumbledore i will sir have a good night said harry good night harry responded dumbledore harry left the living room and headed upstairs as he got closer to his room he noticed someone standing there it was hermione hermione you okay a touch of concerned in harry voice yeah i fine she paused i just wanted to let you know that i dontblame you at all for what happened in the ministry you cantlook out for all of us you know she half laughed the she took a step forward and hugged harry harry and hermione had given each others hugs loads of times but this time harry noticed just how wonderful she felt in his arms he could smell the vanilla shampoo she always used and he could feel her breathing against his chest he never wanted to let her go but he could feel her begin to pull out of the hug besides some one has to look out for you she smiled and started to walk back towards her room harry gave her a huge smile he loved his friend so much but something felt different this feeling was stronger then just friendship he thought he quickly dismissed the idea and went to bed for he knew tomorrow was going to be a rough day chapter 6 the last request of sirius black but master the boy figured out who we were we tried to grab him but dumbledore and his band of goody too shoes showed up groveled wormtail it doesntmatter the spell is broken and he is no longer safe outside hogwarts hissed a high pitched voice how will we get him a cautious wormtail asked it looks like we must go to him the voice paused wormtail get everything ready to move where are we going master asked wormtail to the forbidden forest we must prepare the voice trailed off prepare said a confused wormtail you fool roared the voice we re going to attack hogwarts once dumbledore canthide behind that school he ll be unable to stop me and i ll be able to finish potter once and for all laughed the unearthly voice master another death eater walked into the room we still cantfind narccisa or draco my lord and some of the others are missing too well it seems like some of my followers offspring dontshare our vision the voice seemed concerned find them and kill them all if they dontfight for us then they wont fight for anyone screamed the voice harry awoke with a start was that a dream or did voldemort let his guard down long enough for harry to see him he didntknow but if what he just saw was true then dumbledore needed to help the slytherins in hiding harry jumped out of bed and threw a shirt on it was still early morning and the house was deathly quiet harry tiptoed down the hall then crept down the stairs he looked in the kitchen but no one was there the living room was empty as well he thought for a moment then decided he needed to take matters into his own hands and went back up stairs and threw on some warm clothes grabbed his firebolt and headed for the back door he opened the kitchen door and was surprised to see julia dressed and ready to fly as well that broom maybe fast but not as fast as mine leave a note saying i took you to hogwarts because you needed to talk to dumbledore we dontwant to be scaring anyone now do we said julia handing harry a piece of parchment and pointing to where the quill sat on the table harry quickly wrote the note and placed his firebolt on the table ready said harry with a sense of urgencies julia nodded and walked out the back door she mounted her broom and motioned for harry to get on behind her wontwe need an invisibility cloak asked harry not the way i fly hang on shouted julia as she got ready to kick off the ground she took a deep breath then bent her knees and lunched into the air with such force harry feared he d fall off with in moments grimmauld street was just a tiny line beneath him harry could feel julia leaning forward to push the broom to go faster but they were already going at such a fast pace that the wind was deafening to harry and stinging to his face after about twenty minutes harry heard julia yell something but couldntmake it out what he shouted julia turned her head to the side we re almost there she shouted back to him harry began to notice the countryside slowly growing bigger and just ahead he could make out the towers of his school julia safely landed in the courtyard right in front of the hug oak doors that were shut tight harry knocked as hard as he could but no one answered then he had a thought harry whipped out his wand and pointed it at his throat sonorus he yelled professor dumbledore his voice now amplified it harry i need to talk to you harry paused professor dumbl the doors to the school slowly opened and a rather confused looking dumbledore stepped out profess harry voice was still amplified harry pointed his wand fixed it and started to walk towards dumbledore professor he going to attack i saw it he was talking to wormtail and then another death eater came in and said that draco was missing along with some others and voldemort ordered them killed harry was out of breath slow down harry did voldemort say when he was going to attack said dumbledore no but he told wormtail to get everything ready to leave and they were going to move into the forbidden forest harry said a little more calmly dumbledore turned to look in the direction of the forest and what did he say about draco and the others said dumbledore still looking in the direction of the forest a death eater came in and told voldemort that draco and some others are missing and no one can find them voldemort then said that if they dontfight for him they wouldntfight for anyone and he told the death eater to kill them all said a panicked harry he and draco might not be on the best terms but he did not wish death upon anyone with the exception of two people voldemort and bellatrix lestrange come with me instructed dumbledore they followed him through the halls of hogwarts and up into his office dumbledore then grabbed a letter harry recognized as the portkey that brought him to dumbledore office a week ago all three of them touched it and moments later they all dropped onto the sidewalk across the street from number twelve grimmauld place they walked into the house which was now full of commotion until ginny weasley spotted them standing in the doorway i found them she shouted harry could hear everyone run towards his direction mad eye and mrs weasley were the first to reach them i thought i told you not to let him take you on some damn mission moody scolded julia harry why didntyou leave us a note we thought you know who got you a hysterical mrs weasley squealed he did leave a note said a voice from the back of the crowd that had now gathered around them the person started to push their way through the crowd and harry could see the bushy hair approaching him hermione was waving his note in one hand and carrying his broom in the other she handed harry his broom and the note to mrs wealey we donthave time to worry about harry judgment molly i need all the order members to meet me in the living room at once stated dumbledore in a concerned tone tonk mad eye mcgonagall lupin mrs weasley fred george and julia all went into the living room but before dumbledore joined them he turned to harry ron hermione and ginny you three get ready to leave for diagon alley and ginny dear could you please write a letter to professor snape asking him to meet me at grinngots as soon as possible harry may we use hedwig asked dumbledore of course said harry wonderful you four get going and dontworry harry we ll take care of this dumbledore said as he walked into the living room bloody hell mate what happened a confused ron asked i ll tell you on the night bus a distracted harry said oh not the night bus again complained ron harry laughed and headed upstairs with all that had happened he completely forgot why they were going to diagon alley but as he entered his room all the memories came flooding back he sat for a moment and began to feel a lump form in his throat not wanting to become emotional harry pushed the thoughts out of his head and started to get ready an hour later dumbledore harry hermione ron and julia were all sitting on the night bus heading towards diagon alley harry spent the majority of the ride explaining his dream and that he got to ride julia broom to hogwarts how fast was it an excited ron asked let just say it took about half an hour to get to hogwarts harry bragged ron mouth hung open ron you might want to close your mouth spiders could get in teased hermione ron immediately shut his jaw and then suddenly flew off his seat along with harry and hermione it looks like we re here said dumbledore as he calmly got up from his seat all three gave him a dirty look as they picked themselves up from the floor they made their way through the populated ally and on the way noticed where fred and george shop was once inside grinngotts a distinguished goblin made his way over to the group headmaster thank you for coming the room is being prepared it will be just a moment the goblin said as he showed them to a set of chairs they all took their seats dumbledore asked hermione and ron how their summers had been leaving julia and harry to talk to each other how did you know i was awake asked harry being that i your next door neighbor i woke up and heard you moaning for dumbledore i didntthink much of it until i peeked my head out into the hallway and saw you sneaking around explained julia harry felt a little embarrassed that he didntknow julia was right next door to him he looked up to see the goblin from before walking towards them harry let out a long sigh was he ready for this it will be okay harry just remember sirius wanted you to have these things as long as you honor his memory he ll always be with you said julia softly harry didntknow why but those little words of comfort seemed to help mr potter we are ready said the goblin indicating that the group should follow him they walked down a long hallway once they got to the end a door on the right opened a goblin in robes was seated with several large pieces of parchment on a desk in front of him a dictation quill stood at attention on another table with a blank piece of parchment and five plush red chairs sat in a half circle around the front of the goblin desk come in mr potter said the goblin in the nice robes headmaster thank you for coming shaking dumbledore hand well now is everyone present all accounted for smiled dumbledore then let the reading of sirius black will begin the goblin looked at the dictation quill which had just copied his sentence all three friends gave each other knowing looks of comfort ronald weasley yes said ron tentatively you have been left the following the goblin took a breath dear ron your mother wouldntallow me to give you these as christmas presents but i knew she couldntdeny me in death so please except these two firebolts for your sister ginny and yourself good luck and keep harry out of trouble and that quidditch cup in your house the brooms appeared in front of ron once the goblin finished reading thank you ron whispered to the brooms hermione granger you have been given the following the goblin took another deep breath my dearest hermione i now know how ron and harry make it through the year you will become the greatest witch of your time dontever doubt that to help you achieve that goal i have left you all of the family sacred books some date back as far as the 13th century and talk about the ancient magic that only a few witches and wizards can practice today protect my godson hermione i counting on you the goblin cleared his throat with your permission we can ship the books to hogwarts gryffindor tower girls dormitory there are quite a number of them that would be wonderful may i also keep that note from sirius a sad hermione asked why of course will you sign here indicating you want the books to be delivered said the goblin holding out a piece of parchment for hermione to sign she took the quill from his hand and signed the parchment then took the note the goblin had read when will they be delivered hermione asked we ll have them there the first night of term for you responded the goblin as he wrote a note to himself thank you she whispered as a silent tear rolled down her check harry potter you have been given the following the goblin took the same deep breathe harry if you re hearing this then i ve failed you in life but in death i can at least make sure you re taken care of i have left you everything aside from the books that i gave to hermione grimmauld place now belongs to you along with the rest of the black fortune and belongings harry i want you to enjoy life you ve had so many hardships so early that i wanted you to not have to worry about anything once you re done with school i only ask for one favor in return defeat him with that last statement the goblin started to fold the note harry who had been looking at the ground the entire time slowly raised his head and looked at the goblin with his bloodshot eyes would you mind reading that last sentence again said harry with a shaking voice certainly mr potter the goblin opened the note again and took a breath i only ask for one favor in return defeat him the goblin paused and looked at harry harry sat for a moment in silence it was over he thought all of his moodiness being frustrated with people not telling him what going on and being mad that he was the one chosen to fulfill the prophecy all of it he will defeat voldemort and not just for his godfather but also for everyone else who was counting on him all the suffering pain and fear that voldemort had caused would all come to an end and harry was going to be the one to stop him a determination could be seen in his eyes now a new fire was lit within him do i need to sign anything asked harry now in full control of his voice uh yes mr potter we have several plans as to what we can do to make these changes easier on you first we can move your existing finances into one vault that can hold both the black family finances and yours second we could move them to be in two vaults right next to each other or third we could leave everything were it is explained the goblin why dontwe put them in two vaults right next to each other said harry as you wish mr potter if you could just sign these three pages indicating you are now the owner of gimmauld place and the rightful owner to the black family fortune then sign this last paper that will allow us to move the two fortunes into different vaults adjoining each other harry signed all four pieces of parchment here are you re new vault numbers and keys that go along with them explained the goblin harry finished up all the paperwork and left grinngotts dumbledore excused himself to meet with snape and instructed them to meet up with him in a half hour to catch the night bus they all decided to head to the weasley shop and say hi to fred and george while on the way hermione spotted a new snow owl at the emporium and asked if she could stop and look at her how much is she hermione asked the shopkeeper 250 galleons said the shopkeeper hermione heart visibly sunk she slowly made her way out of the shop followed by ron harry was about to follow them but stopped in his tracks julia will you tell them i ll catch up i just want to buy some treats for hedwig said harry as he headed back up to the stopkeeper hey hermione ron we ll be right there harry getting some owl treats for hedwig shouted julia harry turned and looked at her questionably were you go i go simple as that plus moody will kill me if i let you out of my sight smiled julia harry chuckled of course mad eye was that paranoid that voldemort might try something in the middle of the day and in the most packed alley in all of london harry turned towards the shopkeeper may i purchase that owl my friend just asked about asked harry it still 250 galleons said the shopkeeper harry wrote down his new vault number and a date to deliver it and handed it to the person charge it to that vault and can you deliver it on this date harry pointed to the date on the page whom am i sending it to asked the now impressed shopkeeper as she looked at harry information she took out a delivery form to fill out oh to hermione granger hogwarts gryffindor table said harry would you like a note to send with the owl asked the shopkeeper sure harry paused happy birthday hermione love harry okay mr potter we ll take care of that for you will you be needing anything else asked the shopkeeper um harry was about to say no when julia interrupted him you might want to get some treats smiled julia oh yeah can i have some owl treats for a snowy owl smiled harry harry collected his owl treats and made his way up to the weasley shop but just as he got there he saw dumbledore walking pretty fast towards his direction we need to leave now an out of breath dumbledore exclaimed what is it a concerned julia asked but dumbledore wouldntanswer hermione ron come here demanded dumbledore they walked out of the shop confused but they didnthave time for questions dumbledore grabbed their hands and apparated out of diagon alley grab my hand said julia harry did so and with in moments felt that strange sensation he felt the night of his attack so this is what it felt like to apparate he thought grimauld place began to appear in front of him both julia and harry followed dumbledore who was already in the house harry hermione and ron stood in the doorway for a moment trying to figure out what the urgencies was all about they found the slytherins in hiding said ginny who was sitting on the stairway they got there just as they were being attacked she said with a sad expression just then the doors to the living room burst open and lupin was running towards the kitchen with rags soaked in blood all four turned their attention to the living room inside they could see a group of children huddled in one corner while all the adults were standing around a body lying on the ground harry saw snape and madam pomfrey step back from the group snape face had little blood marks all over it and he looked completely destroyed i sorry draco we couldntsave her snape uttered at that moment harry could hear the devastated cries of draco malfoy echo the halls the group of adults parted and harry saw him kneeling next to a woman body and sobbing uncontrollably harry could hear lupin coming back and just before the doors to the living room shut he heard draco last plea mum come back chapter 8 the new term begins snape isntthe only spy said draco we re all going to act like our mums took us against our will make the rest of the house believe we re on their side it might take a week or so but we can gain their trust again but what if people ask what happened after the aurors showed up and rescued you a now concerned harry asked that where i come in the youngest slytherin piped up again you see mr harry potter sir we were on our way to a house much like this one one that only a family member can get too we ran for it as soon as the aurors showed up and no one can question us besides those death eaters didntstick around long draco smiled are you sure you re all up for this asked harry we re slytherins the youngest beamed well almost the group laughed harry knew he was going to like this kid we ll manage potter dontworry about us said draco he motioned to the others that it was time to go but before draco close the door he looked back at harry potter you know we re going to have to keep up the rivalry stated draco i know malfoy said harry good apologize to granger for me in advance but not weasel i at least want to have some fun this year smirked draco as he left harry just shook his head some things will never change he thought harry changed and went to bed at least he was going back to hogwarts he thought as he fell asleep the next morning harry awoke to the sounds of everyone rushing around getting last minute packing done he slowly made his way over towards his bathroom and got ready for the day half an hour later harry was carrying his belongs to the front door he noticed hedwig wasntin the house he figured she must have gone to get some last minute flying done he went to the backyard to get her hedwig called harry a few second later harry saw her along with another bird flying towards him it was rosie julia eagle hedwig landed safely on harry arm while rosie flew right into the kitchen and as harry followed he could hear mrs weasley shooing the bird to go away harry dear breakfast is ready informed mrs weasley as harry walked into the kitchen alright be right back said harry as he walked through the main hall to place hedwig in her cage come on girl in you go harry said to her but hedwig was giving harry that not again look and didntseem too pleased to go back in her cage then harry pulled out one of the treats he bought for her now hedwig hopped into her cage without a problem and harry gave her the treat once he closed the cage door he headed back towards the kitchen harry walked in and saw mrs weasley now standing right next to rosie and waving her arms for the bird to move but rosie wasntfazed i ll sit there mrs weasley dontworry said harry as he took his seat moments later he was joined by ron and ginny then finally hermione who sat as far away from harry as possible harry just kept his head down and slowly ate his food every now and then he would look up at hermione and try and catch her eye she never going to talk to me again thought harry oh she will dontworry she loves you too much said a woman voice harry head jerked up and looked around mrs weasley was on the other side of the kitchen and the voice was to old to be ginny s who was sitting across from him you alright mate asked ron who noticed harry looking around like he didntknow where he was yeah i fine said harry as he looked back down at his food great now he was going crazy you re not going crazy said the woman voice before harry could look again he felt a tapping on his shoulder he tilted his head and stared directly into rosie eyes hello harry said rosie harry just stared for a moment hi he thought how can i talk with you is this another one of those things i can do but dontknow about oh no it me i can talk to whomever i want i telepathic but unlike fawkes i can communicate back explained rosie phoenix are telepathic asked harry whom unknown to him was starting to get weird looks from everyone in the room in a way they re very perceptive about feelings explained rosie no way harry said out loud harry dear are you okay asked mrs weasley both harry and rosie turned and looked at mrs weasley uh yeah he said as he noticed everyone was looking at him including hermione it okay harry we ll talk on the way to hogwarts julia wanted me to stay with you today because she couldntbe here harry looked back down at his plate and kept eating as he talked with rosie where is she asked harry as he gave a smile to ron who was still staring at him this was actually kind of fun thought harry his own little secret she along with some other aurors took the slytherins around to their houses to pick up their stuff last night then put them on the night bus so it appeared they all stayed together at padraig house they ve been keeping a close eye on them since but i believe she moving her stuff into hogwarts right now said rosie who sounded like she was trying to concentrate who padraig is he the youngest harry asked yes he gonna be a wonderful wizard some day it a shame he going to ask to be put in slytherin he should really be in gryffindor said rosie but before harry could ask his question mrs weasley called from the front door the bus is here time to go called mrs weasley not the bloody bus again exclaimed ron everyone laughed at ron frustration with the night bus the ride to the station wasntas bad as before they all made it onto the train with time to spare hermione and ron went to the front to check in still being prefects they had duties to perform before they could join harry in the back car ginny and harry walked to the back of the train and put their stuff down harry then opened the window and rosie came flying in and landed on the seat opposite harry she a gorgeous bird isntshe said ginny as she sat next to rosie harry saw rosie buff up her chest i knew i liked her harry heard rosie say he laughed and then looked out the window he watched as all the last minute arrivals came barreling through the wall and running to one of the conductors to help get their luggage on the train several hours later the train was rolling through the countryside and ron and hermione had joined them hermione was still avoiding harry she would talk with ron and ginny here and there but mostly kept her nose in a book there were several times that harry caught himself gazing at her but turned away when he felt someone noticing rosie had flown out the window when hermione and ron came back but harry could still talk with her she was shadowing the train from above he was glad he had someone to talk too because this trip was turning out to be painfully long you know you should try and talk with her rosie suggested she will not want to talk to me thought harry as he let out a long breath oh harry you should we ll talk later we re getting close you should put your robes on i ll see you in the great hall said rosie harry got up and pulled his trunk down getting close asked ron yeah i was gonna change in the bathroom so hermione and ginny can change in here said harry as he looked in hermione direction hoping she might look at him but she didn t he and ron grabbed their clothes and headed towards the bathroom next to their compartment hey harry called ron from the adjoining bathroom stall yeah responded harry what did you see in hermione memory that making her not talk to you asked ron who was having trouble putting his pants on you know i canttell you said harry who was buttoning up his shirt just thought i d give it a shot anyway do you think she ll talk to you anytime soon asked ron as he pulled his vest on i hope so whispered harry who was putting his robe on what was that called ron i dontknow said harry who was walking out of the stall he and ron finished up and headed back to their compartment minutes later the train began to slow down the children departed and headed towards the carriages all the upper classmen took their seats at the tables and waited for the first years to arrive some how harry managed to sit next to hermione but he was still getting the cold shoulder he decided to give up for the night and just catch up with the other gryffindors it was several more minutes until the doors to the great hall opened and the first years walked in the shorting hat was placed on the stool the time has come for 4 different groups to become one this year rivalries must die and new allies must arise it shouldntmatter if you where a snake raven lion or badger the coming war will need all the houses together united as one you shall be and let the history book see what a great generation of witches and wizards you will be the sorting hat fell silent for a moment nothing happened until mcgonagall collected herself and called out the first name padraig mcnair she called harry felt a lump in the back of his throat form padraig dad was the man who attacked him he doesntknow his father is alive harry he thinks he died several months ago his mother told him that when mcnair went back to voldemort a voice that sounded like julia said to him harry then looked up towards the teacher table and saw julia give him a little wave it me i using rosie to communicate with you but you ll learn all about it in class so dontask me any questions i just felt you getting tense when mcgonagall read padraig last name and i wanted you not to hold any grudges towards him explained julia okay i wont harry laughed inwardly this was going to be one interesting year he thought he then tried to hear what the sorting had been saying to padraig you know you dontbelong there said the sorting had in a low whisper i accept your deal slytherin yelled the sorting hat padriag took a deep sigh of relief and went and joined malfoy at the slytherin table what deal did he make with the sorting hat harry wondered the rest of the sorting was uneventful once it was done dumbledore stood and the hall went quite another year at hogwarts is about to begin and i would like to introduce a new teacher to you all professor julia will be the new defense against the dark arts teacher good luck professor dumbledore clapped as julia stood up and took a small bow he noticed for the first time she finally looked like a witch she was wearing dark navy blue robes of a very fine material also the forbidden forest is completely off limits if you try and take one step into that forest you ll be met with a very nice repelling curse which i sure none of you can disarm dumbledore paused so donttry a small amount of laughter was heard and then dumbledore face became very serious and the laughter died down i sure many of you are wondering what the sorting had meant in his message as you all know we re entering a dark time our world is beginning to split into two groups as it once did before you were born however there is still hope and that is what the sorting had is telling us if we stick together as a school as one army we can defeat any enemy and preserve all that we have dumbledore looked around and saw the tension that filled the hall he beamed a great smile now my children off to your common rooms and may your dreams be filled with happier days the hall now was filled with the calls of the prefects asking their first years to follow them harry followed the rest of the gryffindors up to their tower once he was in the common room he started to head up to the sixth year boy dormitory harry ron called come here harry walked back down the stairs to see what his friend wanted what is it asked harry it looks like you re rooming with us ron said happily where a confused harry asked follow me said ron and he moved to a portrait of two gryffindor playing quidditch snitch said ron and the portrait opened harry followed him in to what looked like a smaller version of the common room where are we asked harry the sixth year prefects dorm sixth and seventh years get their own dorm but i walked in and noticed you had a door with your name on it explained ron just then hermione walked through the portrait what are you doing in here she asked in a slightly accusing tone i dontknow ron just saw i had a door with my name on it harry said matching hermione tone of voice the three stood there for a moment and then hermione spoke well maybe this will explain what going on she said as she picked up a piece of paper that was on the table closest to the fire dear harry hermione and ron it is necessary that you three spend as much time together as possible until we can figure out the key that unlocks how hermione and ron help harry in his battle the only thing we can do is hope that by you three being together it helps us find something also i would like to congratulate harry on becoming the gryffindor quidditch captain head master albus dumbledore hermione finished reading the letter and looked up at harry congratulations harry she said with not much enthusiasm well i going to bed good night her door was half way closed by the time she finished harry turned to look at ron who looked a little down ron i didntknow honestly harry felt that maybe he could talk ron out of being angry with him before he made up his mind harry couldnttake it if they both didnttalk to him i know ron said a little depressed i dunno i guess with you not playing last year i thought they might choose me but you know you ve been on the team since your first year it makes more sense for you to be the captain ron finished so you re not mad harry asked ron smiled up at him and shook his head good breathed harry i dontknow if i could take both you and hermione not talking to me it not me you have to worry about joked ron i know harry gave him a pat on the back we probably should get to bed night ron night ron said as he went to his room harry walked into his new room the bed was a little bigger then the one in the dormitory and he had his own fireplace and desk he looked towards the right and saw a door that looked liked it lead to a bathroom he walked over to the bed and laid down he needed to think of a way to get hermione to talk to him again but the harder he thought the heavier his eyes got and soon he was dreaming of catching snitches hermione and for some reason snape teaching class in a tutu he awoke the next morning fairly early he got a nice long shower and then put on his robes he walked in to his common room to see if anyone else was awake but no one was he decided to just head down to the great hall and have breakfast harry was only in the great hall for fifteen minutes before it started to fill up another five minutes went by and hermione came and sat down across the table from him he guessed the only reason she did was out of habit just several minutes after she arrived ron stumbled to the table they all ate in silence until the flapping of the owl wings signaled the arrival of their schedules as harry watched the birds fly over him he suddenly remembered the gift he bought hermione he smiled to himself all he had to do was wait it out for another two weeks and redemption would be on its way chapter 9 the return of the three musketeers just as harry suspected on the first night of term this year was going to be interesting his first defense against the dark arts lesson was one of the most fun he had in class since lupin had been the teacher back in his third year just as julia promised she explained how she could communicate with harry using rosie the class was a lot smaller then normal classes and for the first time they had assigned seating of course julia had put him with hermione harry figured that rosie might have had a hand in this julia came into class in her normal jeans and shirt at least this shirt was button up and not a t shirt now before we begin i want all of you to repeat after me she said as she sat on her desk julia julia the class echoed good because that is my name not professor not mrs so and so and not professor julia i only 26 and i dontwant to think i that old she smiled as the room laughed at her forwardness harry couldntbelieve how young she was and he soon heard some of the slytherin and gryffindors make comments maybe she could make a man out of me harry heard seamus whisper to ron the two laughed until they saw harry glare at them he didntknow why but harry felt a sense of loyalty to julia in a short period of time she proved to be the one adult who seemed to listen to him and not treat him like some damn kid he chalked it up to them being closer in age then the rest of the order oh mr finnigan i wont be making you a man this year so you can stop trying and before you start laughing mr weasley doing it on a broom is most uncomfortable and i strongly recommend against it said julia with her back to the class the rest of the class exploded with laughter both seamus and ron turned bright red and no mr malfoy i dontwant to know why slytherin boys do it better and if you think the snake reference is cute think again continued julia now it was seamus and ron turn to laugh while malfoy turned a very bright red finally julia faced the class now you all are probably wondering how did she do it well i ll tell you rosie within seconds rosie came soaring through the window and landed on a perch next to julia desk can anyone tell me what type of creature this is everyone turned and looked at hermione who wasntpaying attention umm she a founding eagle or an original eagle and in some circles called an elder they use to roam free in europe until witches and wizards started to abuse them they migrated to the states where the local tribes respected their powers and looked to them for wisdom said harry everyone in the room looked shocked even hermione gave him a look well done 20 points to gryffindor julia said impressed with harry knowledge of the bird can anyone tell me how this eagle is different from normal birds this time hermione raised her hand yes ms granger an original eagle shares many qualities of the phoenix their tears bring healing powers they can carry up to almost two hundred times their weight however an original eagle is telepathic it can communicate with humans and allow humans to communicate with each other through them what makes an original eagle the most sought after bird besides the phoenix is their feathers and the fact that no spell or weapon can hurt them only when an eagles head is cut off can they die today any original eagle left in existence is considered one of the wised magical creature left do to how long they ve been alive some original eagles have been known to be seers as well hermione finished and put her head back down very impressive 30 points to gryffindor now for this term you will be learning several things one how magical creatures like rosie can help you in a fight against the dark arts and two because rosie cantbe hurt with any spells you will be harnessing your dueling skills with her the rest of the lesson was spent with everyone trying to learn how to communicate with julia through rosie as the class was leaving julia called harry up to the front how did i do julia said nervously that was the best lesson i ever had said an excited harry really wonderful oh i was wondering if you needed any help with the quidditch team i heard you were named captain of the gryffindor squad and i just wanted to offer asked julia really that would be great i having try outs in a week will you come and help me run it an excited harry asked of course hey you better be off you ll miss transfigurations instructed julia harry picked up his belongs and waved goodbye to her as he left the room he heard julia say something to rosie he reminds me of james i know both he and lily would be very proud of him said julia harry stopped for a moment and looked back at the classroom julia had known his parents he was about to go back and ask her about it but realized how late he would be to his next class a week later harry was stand on the quidditch pitch watching ginny fly circles around the rest of the chasers ron had gotten more confidences with his goal keeping and surprisingly seamus and dean made pretty good beaters a fourth year girl and fifth year girl were chosen as the two chasers to accompany ginny she had mentioned to harry that these girls were very good and trained with katie bell all summer once the tryouts were done harry told everyone to head back up to the castle he ron and julia stayed behind for a bit to talk about the new team speed is going to be your greatest strength and i dontmean broom speed either ginny and the other two chasers are very quick with decisions and all three have great hands but they could have even better ones if they work on it they should be passing to each other everyday if they can the closer they become in understanding each other the better of you ll be harry same with seamus and dean julia said as they packed up all the equipment some of those plays you were showing us seem hard who going to call them out asked ron well since you see most of the field most likely you harry will be busy looking for the snitch most goalies are the on field captains explained julia do you mind harry asked ron nervously not at all you re perfect for the job harry said clasping ron on the back just then harry felt a chill run through his body he looked over in the direction of the forbidden forest you all right mate asked ron who had noticed harry staring off in the distance just thinking about the battle said harry dontdwell on that now harry let wait till christmas before we begin to think about that said julia has they continued to walk towards the castle the next day the three chasers were walking the halls throwing the quaffle back and forth they even got fancy and by the end of the day were doing no look passes dean and seamus were quizzing each other on different situations with the bludgers even harry arranged to practice with julia twice a week to learn better maneuvering techniques everything seemed to be going a lot better then last year harry thought the only thing that would make it better would be hermione talking to him the following week passed a little slower then the previous harry was knee deep in homework and without hermione help he had to spend extra time to make sure he d get good grades the middle of the week did bring an interesting event harry hermione and ron were all walking into the great hall to have lunch when malfoy ran right into harry as the two made contact harry could feel malfoy slip him a piece of parchment watch where you re going scar head hissed draco both hermione and ron were too shocked to say anything back that ungrateful git after all we did started ron shh said harry he grabbed both hermione and ron and pulled them out of the great hall and into a secluded corner listen i forgot to tell you something whispered harry as he looked around to make sure no one was listening malfoy is spying for us along with the other eight slytherin but in order to gain back everyone trust he has to keep up the rivalry between him and us he ran into me to give me this note harry showed them the piece of parchment in his hand what does it say an impressed harmione asked harry opened it and read it quick they re in whispered harry come on let grab some lunch the three walked back into the great hall and harry gave malfoy a small nod of understanding the three finished lunch and then harry and hermione headed to potions while ron went to muggle studies harry had noticed hermione slowly warming back up to him instead of just out right ignoring him she d talk politely to him in conversations or in class it was obvious to all the gryffindors that something wasntright with them everyone including ginny approached harry harry was doing some studying in the big common room knowing the hermione was in their common room when ginny approached him harry can i ask you a question ginny said from across the desk of course harry had no clue what she was about to ask why arentyou an hermione talking ginny said bluntly it kind of complicated harry said hoping ginny would drop the subject well why dontyou just say you re sorry ginny made it sound so easy it a little more complicated then that i really dontthink hermione wants to talk to me said harry looking down at his homework i dontknow you d be surprised how much a heart felt apology means to people ginny said as she packed up her belongs i ll try and keep that in mind ginny thanks said harry he thought for a moment about what she had said maybe she was right maybe hermione was just waiting for him to apologize and that why she still hasnttalked to him he quickly packed up his stuff and headed for his room he stepped through the portrait and looked around she had gone to bed harry shoulders slumped as he slowly walked over towards his room harry didnthave to wait too much longer the morning finally arrived for his delivery his plan was to wait until hermione and ron had left and then make his way down to breakfast he heard ron knocking on his door harry you coming down to breakfast he asked from the other side of the door i ll be down later said harry as he was putting on his pants he waited five more minutes until he was sure that both hermione and ron had left harry felt like it was christmas he put on his best looking uniform and headed down to the great hall he stopped and stood by the entrance hidden in shadow he decided to wait until the owls had arrived then run up the steps to make it look like he was just coming down to breakfast he stood by the door for what seemed like five minutes though it was only two the owls made their way through the hall but harry didntsee the snowy owl panic set in did he write down the right date did the shopkeeper forget to send her did the new bird get lost his palms began to get sweaty he couldnttake another day of hermione not talking to him just then a hint of white made it way into the hall it was her harry took a deep breath and watched in excitement as the bird landed in front of hermione all the gryffindors watched as hermione read the card then stood up to see where harry might be sitting harry quickly made his way to the staircase he ran up the first flight of stairs then turned around and slowly took each step harry hermione cried from the bottom of the stairway her face was glowing harry breath caught in his throat as he stared into her beautiful face they stood there a moment before hermione ran up the remaining steps and just threw herself at harry giving him a big hug oh harry she said in his ear i sorry i haventbeen talking to you it was so hard there were so many times i just wanted to turn to you and talk about how our days went i also saw how hard you were working on homework and i felt so bad she pulled away from him but still held on to his arms hermione i so sorry about what i did you trusted me not to hurt you but harry you could never hurt me besides lets not talk about it i just want my friend back she gave him another hug let promise never to fight like that again she said in a low whisper that made harry feel light headed i promise harry said in a low husky voice which sent shivers down hermione they parted from the hug again but were only inches a part harry could feel hermion breath become heavy they stood there staring at each other for a moment until a noise from the great hall broke the spell you must be hungry said hermione trying to recompose herself the two friends walked into the great hall and when they sat down the whole gryffindor table stared at them the two gave everyone a smile and the whole table knew the friends had made up harry was in a great mood for the rest of the day he and hermione sat next to each other in every class and caught up on the last two weeks harry did notice hermione staying after class to talk to julia but didntthink anything of it he collapsed on to the couch in their common room once he was done with quidditch practice he noticed a note left for him and ron on the table next to the fire dear harry ron when you ve cleaned up meet me in julia classroom i have a surprise hermione ron walked through the portrait and was heading towards his room when harry called out hey ron what this note about asked harry what note ron looked like he was hiding something this one we re supposed to meet hermione in julia classroom well i dontknow just clean up and we ll find out ron said as he gave harry a wink what are they up too thought harry twenty minutes later harry and ron we re walking down to julia classroom ron wouldntgive harry any hints about what was going on but he told harry to just enjoy it when they reached the door ron knocked twice come in said hermione ron opened the door to let harry in first surprise yelled the group of people hagrid mr and mrs weasley fred george julia dumbledore mcgonagall and hermione were all there smiling at him but it not my birthday mind happened already said a shocked harry we know harry but with all the happened over the summer we wanted to throw you and hermione a birthday party said hagrid as he handed over a large piece of parchment to harry what this asked harry i wanted ya to become a co caretaker of a certain animal that now resides next to my hut said hagrid giving harry a wink really an excited harry asked dumbledore managed ter get her off of the death charge smiled hagrid harry grabbed the papers and saw buckbeaks name at the top he signed under hagrid name then noticed that hermione and ron signatures were both on there the four weasley now stepped forward well now that we re the money bags of the family said george who quickly was slapped in the back of the head by mrs weasley we got harry a two year subscription to quidditch monthly and hermione a gold chain tag for her new owl said fred handing hermione the box with the tag and harry the september issue of quidditch monthly all you have to do is say the owls name and the tag will inscribe it explained george who was rubbing the back of his head well professor mcgonagall and i have wanted to give you this for a long time harry and with the battle coming we figured this was the perfect time to give it to you dumbledore pulled out a dark blue majestic robe that reminded harry of the one julia wore the first night back at hogwarts it felt as soft as hedwig feathers and when he put it on he felt warmth envelop his body this robe used to belong to your father it the robe of the order of the phoenix explained mcgonagall when you wear this you re impervious to any weather cold hot rain and snow it also protects you from minor charms and hexes the most important thing it does is alert other order members who are wearing their robe if you re in trouble and they can apparate right to you we also have your mothers robe and wanted to ask your permission if we could give it to hermione added dumbledore i think my mum would love it harry said while giving hermione a smile oh harry i canttake this said hermione you can take it and if you donti ll be very offended smiled harry oh dontworry ronnie we had one made for you fred said as handed ron his new robe everyone laughed and began to dig into the cake that julia had got from honeydukes she didnthave time to get him a gift so she told him if there was anything he could think of or needed to let her know and she d get it once everyone was eating their cake and enjoying themselves hermione took harry aside to talk to him i meant to give this to you on your actual birthday but with everything that happened i forgot happy birthday harry hermione smiled she handed him a small box harry opened it to find a golden snitch with the engraving of to hp love hg i love it whispered harry thank you he gave her a hug this was one of the best days harry had had in a long time it felt good to have his friends back and to enjoy being at hogwarts again
