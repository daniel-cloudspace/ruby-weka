 a n this is my first fic so please please please review i need to know what you think flamers are welcome but please be constructive in your criticism thanks disclaimer i dontown harry potter or any of the characters you recognize if i did i would be the richest woman in england i e j k rowling but i not so please dontsue me i donthave any money worth mentioning anyway so it would be a wasted effort chapter 1 the hogwarts express it all started on september 1 1977 well i shouldntsay that it actually started on september 1 1971 but for all intents and purposes of this story we ll start on september 1 1977 the first day of my 7th year at hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry i made my way across platform 9 3 4 feeling on top of the world it was my final year at hogwarts and i knew it was going to be good i was head girl i was 17 a full grown witch i would be starting a life for myself in the wizarding world and best of all i would never have to see my horrible sister and her repulsive boyfriend ever again not like they d mind nevertheless this year was my year and i was sure nothing could change that until i saw him evans hey evans i saw a boy with unruly black hair and glasses making his way towards me across the platform i quickly did an about face and tried frantically to board the train maybe he d lose me in the crowd i could pretend not to have heard him oh please dontsee me fat chance of that people always complimented me on my hair color true it was a beautiful shade of auburn but it stuck out like a sore thumb in a crowd evans that boy just didntgive up hello potter i said as i turned to face him trying very hard to be polite his best mate sirius black followed him closely i wasntsurprised you rarely ever saw one without the other fine day for quidditch isntit he asked as he neared me soon i was practically eye to eye with james potter the one person on the earth i positively loathed well petunia and vernon ran a close second and sirius was right up there too but anyway we were practically eye to eye i saw practically because my eyes were level with his chest as he was a good head and shoulders taller than i was and my eyes being level with his chest i noticed he had a shiny badge pinned onto his shirt well i suppose you cou omigod i said as i looked at the badge james potter how the hell did you get that badge he looked at me appraisingly apparently the same way you got yours evans he replied mildly i nearly exploded right then and there james potter was head boy what was dumbledore playing at james potter was an arrogant egotistic self centered conceited selfish big headed offensive rude mischief making prick and most certainly didntdeserve the position i couldntstand him and now i was facing an entire year of working with him well there was only one thing i could do listen to me potter and listen well you may be head boy but that doesntmean you can abuse you authority i snarled stepping towards him angrily if i find out you ve been causing trouble you or any of your stupid little friends for that matter i threw a dirty look at sirius i will hex every single one of you into the next millennium james cocked an eyebrow and looked at sirius who shrugged i better warn remus and peter then he replied nonchalantly you re insufferable i exclaimed angrily turning on my heel and boarding the train i couldntstand his carefree attitude and had no idea how i was going to deal with it all year i should probably pause here and explain a little about james and my history james was the ringleader of a group of troublemakers called the marauders there were only four members james potter sirius black remus lupin and peter pettigrew peter more tagged along actually as the other three were considered the most lusted after boys ever to roam the halls of hogwarts i seemed to be the only one who could stand up to their charm they were infamous for their pranks which occurred at least once a week i disliked james potter from the moment he played his first trick on me in 1st year which involved a tarantula like spider a jar full of frog spawn and dragon dung need i say more consequently i disliked sirius black sirius and james were the best of friends they were two peas in a pod those two good looking yes arrogant hell yeah and it was for that reason i hated them both on the other hand i liked remus a lot i became friends with remus in 5th year when we were both named prefects and i realized he was actually a very nice guy i thought it unfortunate he hung around the likes of james and sirius but other than that i had no problem with him and as for peter well you ll learn why i hate him with all my heart later on but as for james and me i was certain we would never get along he had developed an unfortunate crush on me in 3rd year which only cemented my fervent dislike for him as far as i knew he still had that stupid crush on me when we entered 7th year but i digress back to the story i made my way to the back of the train and found my friends in the last compartment octavia meliflua better known as tave alice prewett and drusa medlum were all crowded around the latest issue of teen witch once more i must interrupt and give some background information this time on my friends tave was my best friend of the three which is odd as we were complete opposites i had long wavy auburn hair and bright green eyes she had long brown straight hair and blue eyes i was a bookworm and a bit of a studying addict i loved getting good grades tave on the other hand loathed studying she was extremely bright and did well in all her classes but would whine and complain incessantly about homework she didntcare if she got a p or even a d she was extremely athletic and was arguably the best keeper the gryffindor quidditch team had ever had while i could hardly stay on a broom she loved to play jokes on people much like her second cousin sirius black she was a pureblood i needless to say was not the one thing tave and i had in common was that neither of us really dated we had occasional boyfriends but felt our valuable time was better spent playing quidditch tave and studying me and yet we were best friends go figure alice prewett was slightly plump but nonetheless beautiful she had short blonde hair and surprisingly brown eyes she was down to earth and often calmed tave and me down when we were too upset to think straight which was usually due to the marauders she was a good student and we would often have late night studying parties where we would really tell our deepest darkest secrets her boyfriend of three years frank longbottom had graduated the year previously but was an incredibly nice guy and last but not least was drusa medlum she was usually the quietest of us four mostly preferring to listen rather than to talk she had incredibly black hair and equally black eyes her silence and appearance gave off the impression of being mean and hard to approach but she was actually just extremely shy once you got to know her you absolutely loved her and now back to the story hi lily tave said vaguely as i opened the compartment door you guys help me i whimpered sitting across from them when they didntreply i plowed on james potter is head boy good for you drusa murmured obviously not paying the slightest attention to me drusa i exclaimed trying to pull the magazine out of their hands this is serious my three friends looked at me reproachfully i dontsee what you re so fussed about drusa replied any girl would love to be in your position i rolled my eyes well i not any girl tave shut the magazine and tossed it on the floor lily lily lily she sighed you canthonestly tell me you haventnoticed how gorgeous james is his hazel eyes are so beautiful his hair is a perfect black and it always looks like he just tolled out of bed she put a hand on her forehead and fake swooned earning giggles from drusa and alice of course i ve noticed i snapped then mentally slapped myself way to go admit to your friends that you think your worst enemy is attractive luckily i saved myself but i ve also noticed he a conceited arrogant selfish bastard oh whatever alice laughed honestly you re the only person in the entire school that thinks that tave added he cantbe that horrible if everyone likes him just because you fancy him doesntmake him nice i knew my comeback was pathetic but it was all i had that bullshit and you know it tave laughed i dontfancy james potter everyone knows he fancies you i had nothing to say to that and was quite relieved when alice chimed in you dontfancy james potter you fancy remus lupin tave turned bright pink but denied it anyway i dontfancy him i just find him incredibly sexy she replied with a devilish smile as much as i d love to continue this conversation i need to go to the heads compartment i said quickly eager to leave have fun drusa said suggestively and i rolled my eyes as i left i found my way to the heads compartment and was incredibly impressed with the d cor scarlet and gold covered everything and there was a lot to cover plush chairs were strewn randomly about the compartment and as were tables there was even a fireplace on one end a banner was hung above it with the words congratulations james and lily emblazoned upon it merlin be damned i heard behind me i turned around and saw james standing there language potter i said reprovingly okay so i swore occasionally myself but still sorry he said but didntseem it in the slightest i rolled my eyes and picked up a piece of parchment resting on one of the tables what that he asked walking towards me i shot him a withering look a piece of parchment i replied nastily he raised his eyebrows no need to be hostile evans i haventdone anything to you yet i muttered and his eyes danced exactly and i won t if you dontgive me a reason i ignored him so he read over my shoulder dear james and lily i would like to extend my congratulations on being named this year head boy and girl while the position is prestigious and highly coveted it is not an easy one to fill i have full faith in you ability to work together to make this a successful year you both will have several responsibilities to take care of throughout the year they include holding monthly prefect meetings and patrolling the corridors after curfew to make sure that there are no students out of bed you have the ability to dock house points as a teacher would however you must not use this as an excuse to harass any of your fellow students you may also assign detentions but once again you must have a legitimate reason any abuse of authority may result in a grievous punishment i am confident however that this warning is unnecessary and a punishment will be unneeded you will share a common room that is set aside for the head boy and girl each of you has a dormitory off the common room and there is a bathroom to share this is mainly because you will be keeping late hours and wouldntwant to wake your fellow housemates your dormitories are located on the 4th floor guarded by the portrait of igor the ignorant the password is for you to decide after you have finished reading this please go to the prefects compartment and instruct them of their responsibilities i have high expectations for you both this year dontdisappoint me sincerely prof m mcgonagall when i finished reading i looked over my shoulder at james he nodded indicating he was done to the prefects compartment then evans he asked i nodded biting back the harsh retort i had ready professor mcgonagall made it clear we were to work together and i felt the first step was being civil he held open the compartment door for me and i grudgingly stepped through we moved one compartment over to the prefects compartment and were met by eight 5th years and eight 6th years they were all talking amongst themselves but quieted the moment we entered er hi i said suddenly shy as sixteen pairs of eyes all focused on me i lily evans the head girl this year and i james potter head boy james jumped right in seeming to enjoy the attention i want to get this meeting over as quickly and painlessly as possible so let get down to business sixth years this ll be old stuff to you but bear with me fifth years listen up being a prefect means you have authority not much mind you but some you get to dock house points but only in sets of 5 you re basically here to keep the younger kids in line but you re not supposed to abuse your authority so dontgo knocking points off anyone unless you have a good reason to a sneering slightly familiar looking slytherin spoke up like you won t potter he asked contemptuously james eyes flashed dangerously as he pulled himself up to his full height it was impressive he had to be at least 6 2 to my 5 4 no i won t black he snapped but i unlike you have the power to put insolent gits like you in detention so watch your mouth as soon as james said that i realized why the slytherin looked familiar he was related to sirius i thought it odd that he was in slytherin as sirius and tave were in gryffindor but i put the thought out of my head as james progressed with the meeting too soon though we were alone i going back to my friends i said when the last prefect had left me too james replied and once again held the compartment door open for me he followed me all the way to the back of the train and it was all i could do not to turn around and yell at him he was after all looking for his friends that is if he wasntstaring at my arse i came to the last compartment and found not only my friends there but james as well sirius remus and peter were sitting across from tave alice and drusa lily sirius cried delightedly as i stepped into the compartment how simply smashing of you to join us and james old chap how sweet of you to drop by stop talking like that you re scaring me james said as he settled himself between sirius and remus and to what do i owe the honor of sharing a compartment with the marauders i asked sarcastically from between tave and alice family sirius replied and the fact that every other compartment is full right i had temporarily forgotten tave and sirius were second cousins unfortunately for me they got along extremely well and that meant i was looking forward to a train ride with the marauders well i thought bitterly at least it cantget any worse things can only get better from here i hope i had no idea what was in store for me disclaimer yadda yadda yadda same old same old i dontown harry potter or any of the characters you recognize because j k rowling does suing me would be pointless because i have no money worth mentioning extra little disclaimer thingy i ve had a few people comment on the shagging before marriage thing so i just wanted to respond to everyone in general i not an advocator of sex before marriage on the contrary i ve actually made a commitment not to have sex before i married this however is a personal belief and a lot of people dontnecessarily think it wrong if you want to go out and shag someone before you re married the main characters in this story are the equivalent of high school seniors living in the 1970 s and we all know how the 70 were wink wink so i guess my point is that if you dontlike them shagging deal with it pretend they didntor something but dontgo telling me to change my story just because you re offended i rated it pg 13 for a reason you know and now that that out of the way on with the story chapter 18 home again that kind of weird tave said when i told her and my other friends about the snape incident the next day doesnthe usually avoid you at all costs with the sole exception of potions class you know with his whole pureblood shit and the fact that you re a muggle born yeah it is weird come to think of it i said frowning slightly i propped myself up on my elbow on my bed so i could see my friends better the four of us were in my dormitory having some good old fashioned girl talk they had finally convinced me to take a break from studying and i was glad they did i had missed quite a bit while i was practically living in the library i ll bet he got a crush on you drusa snickered from her spot on the floor oh merlin i replied not wanting to think about that possibility you think snape has a crush on me like tave said i a muggle born he a pureblood he supposed to hate me which just makes you all the more enticing alice jumped in you re his forbidden love not to mention that you re dating his archenemy he cant fancy you therefore you re all the more tempting i swear you should be a psychiatrist or something i said rolling my eyes you always come up with reasons why people do things and what they mean by them it scary what a psychiatrist she asked curiously never mind it a muggle thing i said not exactly sure how to explain it to her but still i dontlike the idea of snape fancying me but james makes up for it doesnthe tave laughed he one of the most lusted after guys to ever roam the halls of hogwarts that should tip the scales a little i still cantbelieve you three managed to snag the marauders alice said shaking her head tave you ve held on to remus for five months now and lily had james for two months and drusa i cantbelieve you ve gotten sirius to stay with you for a month he different than he used to be drusa replied huffily he not interested in a one night stand woah calm down there tave interjected alice didntmean anything by it sorry i just really like him and i sick of people asking when we re going to break up she sighed they ll stop soon enough i said comfortingly tave and i were asked that for awhile too but when people realized that we werentjust the standard one week fling they left us alone the marauders sure have a reputation if you know what i mean yeah we know what you mean alice tave and drusa said together then all four of us burst out laughing actually when you think about it it very ego boosting to be dating one of them drusa said when we had finished our bout of giggles they ve made the rounds with many of the other girls and they didntlike any of them enough to get into a long term relationship i wouldntcall our relationships long term quite yet i said we re still counting by months but then again those boys are used to counting by days alice laughed for them even getting to a month is long term once again the four of us burst out laughing we re so mean to them i said shaking my head in amusement i sure they deserve it some way or another tave grinned just out of curiosity lily how long were your sister and her boyfriend together before they decided to get married i think somewhere around two years i said trying to remember when petunia had first brought vernon home but i really not sure i dontremember exactly when i found out they were dating and i was only told they were getting married when i got home over christmas break they could have been engaged since september for all i know and care they re getting married this month right tave asked yeah i going home on wednesday to help get everything ready for the wedding on saturday i sighed my mum thinks that my magic will be helpful i sure it will be i just not looking forward to spending two extra days with petunia and other various members of my family that i dontknow well my extended family is going to be coming in and out of the house all weekend apparently it going to be a looooong four days i d come with you but i cantafford to get behind in my classes tave said apologetically missing three days of classes would kill me me too drusa sighed me three alice said sorry lily we re just not as good at school as you are we have to actually be in class in order to understand the material dontworry about it i shrugged we were silent for a moment then hey you could ask james to go with you tave said suddenly james i asked frowning slightly yeah he just as bloody brilliant as you are it also a good excuse for him to meet your parents she said i thought for a moment before replying well i suppose it would be okay that is if he d be willing to go with me of course he d be willing to go with you drusa said rolling her eyes he gets out of school and he gets to spend that time with you so i asked james and drusa was right he was more than willing to leave school and come to my house we checked with dumbledore who said it was fine and that wednesday morning we were on our way to hogsmeade i had told my mother that i could just apparate home from there here my address i said handing james a slip of paper once we were inside the little village if you can try to apparate into my bedroom petunia will go completely berserk if you suddenly appear in the living room and she watching television you have a television james asked eagerly i ve heard about those it a little box with people in it right something like that i said grinning james had never been inside a muggle house before so this was going to be an interesting few days 0 the two of us apparated into my bedroom with no problems at all james was immediately drawn to the light switch on the wall and kept turning the light on and off i hate to break it to you but no matter how many times you flip the switch the light will turn on and off the exact same way i said smartly as i watched him he grinned sheepishly at me i think eclectic lights are fascinating he said defensively but he stopped flipping the switch electric lights i corrected a smile tugging at my lips come on i think my mum is downstairs we should go tell her we re here we traipsed down the stairs and into the kitchen where we found all three members of my immediate family eating breakfast lily darling you re home my mum exclaimed when she saw us come through the doorway she got up to hug me and petunia shot me a look that seemed to dare me to come within five feet of her hello mum i said then indicated towards james who was standing behind me this is my boyfriend james the one i owled you about oh hello james she said smiling warmly at him hello he replied it nice to meet you and that my dad and this is petunia i said faltering slightly when i saw the look on petunia face my dad greeted james much like my mother had but petunia just glared icily at him are you one of her people she asked menacingly staring at him hard petunia my mum said warningly be polite james met petunia gaze unwaveringly if by one of her people you mean a wizard then yes i a wizard a disgusted noise issued from petunia lips well at least i ve found someone respectable she muttered petunia that enough my father said firmly honestly i dontunderstand why you cantaccept your sister for who she is you re a grown woman and it just sickening the way you still pick fights with her petunia looked like she was going to make a harsh retort but then thought better of it instead she got up from the table in a huff and went upstairs we re so sorry my mum said apologetically to james petunia has never really understood magic and i think she covers up her confusion by hating anything associated with it including people donttake it personally i added she hates all magical people not just you it fine james said with a shrug there are wizards who hate muggles too so i guess it all balances out i smiled at him glad he understood and wasntoffended by my sister rude behavior do you two want anything to eat my mum asked moving towards the stove i can make some more eggs if you d like we re fine we ate before we came i said well in that case do you think you could help me with the dishes lily she asked as she began to clear off the table sure i said turning to help her do you want me to help james offered no it okay actually dad james has never been in a muggle house before do you want to take him out to the garage to look at the car i suggested my dad was a car enthusiast so to speak and i knew he would love showing james how they worked you have a car james asked excitedly i ve never seen one before you ve definitely come to the right place my dad said getting up from the table you ll be a car expert when i done with you the two of them left and i was left with my mum in the kitchen he seems like a nice guy she said looking at me intently yes he is i agreed here mum i can do it i pulled out my wand and sent the dishes into the sink where they began to wash themselves isnthe the one who used to aggravate you to no end she asked i sighed this had the makings of a long drawn out explanation yes i said sitting down in one of the chairs i used to completely loathe james potter so what made you change your mind she asked leaning against the counter and folding her arms he changed mum i said with a shrug i dontreally know how to explain it i guess you could say that i realized he not a stupid thirteen year old boy without a care in the world my mum studied me for a moment so you really like him then yeah i do i replied a small smile appearing on my face we were silent again and the only sound was the clanking of the dishes in the sink lily you may not appreciate me asking this she began then stopped what i asked thought i was fairly sure i knew what she was going to ask well i your mother and i also know you re nearly an adult and can make your own decisions but i need to ask you this are you and james sleeping together i looked into her inquisitive eyes and hesitated a moment too long lily came her disapproving tone dontstart mum i sighed getting up from my spot on the chair you said yourself that i can make my own decisions and i ve made that decision already i realize that but you re only seventeen she replied petunia hasntslept with vernon and she four years older than you are that not to mention that they ve been dating for two years how long have you and james been dating two months i said hotly not appreciating the fact that i had just been compared to my sister my mum eyes widened and she opened her mouth to protest but i didntlet her i know it not that long mum but things are different in the wizarding world so it acceptable to sleep with your boyfriend after only dating him for two months there is it she demanded i an adult in the wizarding world it not that uncommon for witches and wizards to get married soon after getting out of school i explained i still dontsee how that makes your behavior appropriate she said tersely your sister i not petunia okay i said loudly waving my wand angrily to send the dishes back to their places in the cupboards james and i sleep together get over it has it ever occurred to you that i just might sleep with him because i in love with him i hadntmeant to say that it had just slipped out sure my friends and i threw around the word love every now and then but we didntmean anything serious by it there was a big difference between fancying someone and actually falling in love with them i clapped my hand over my mouth scared of what i had just admitted my mother eyes grew wide are you telling me that after dating james for two months you re already in love with him i glanced out the window towards the garage i could see james bending over the engine of the car my father pointing something out to him yes i said suddenly completely calm i in love with james potter my mum came over to me and put an arm around me do you know if he feels the same way about you i shook my head i dontknow for sure my friends say so but he never told me so and come to think of it i ve never told him either i think he deserves to know how you feel my mum said rubbing my arm affectionately for the record i like him i only met him for two minutes but he seems very nice he has an aura of confidence but not so much so that he seems cocky i not saying that i approve of you sleeping with him mind you and just so you know your father and i wontstand for it while you re in this house i know mum i said feeling my cheeks grow red we wouldn t not while you re here good she moved away from me and looked out the window i suppose you d better go out there and see that your father doesntbore the poor boy to tears you know how he is once he gets going about his beloved cars i smiled at my mum before i left the kitchen so she liked james that was a good sign but then again she also liked vernon maybe liked was too strong a word for that scenario tolerated was more like it in any case one parent down one to go 0 a n alrighty here chappie number 18 cue applause everything all fine and dandy in james lily land or is it hmmm you ll just have to wait and see wontyou lol i so cruel and snape will be making more appearances once they get back to hogwarts so dontforget about him oooh now we re

something with that idea about snape crazygonutsstudent lol me too i totally obsessed with jl fics which just might be why i writing one lol miafia thank you so much disclaimer no person place or thing in the harry potter series belongs to me that includes any characters you recognize i make no money for writing this i just find it an amusing pastime the only money i make is when i babysit and that right around minimum wage considering i have measly pocket change at the moment i just went on another shopping spree i so bad i need to save my money lol it would be utterly and completely pointless to sue me if you could considering i under 18 so please donteven try a n i ve just added a teeny little bit towards the end because i realized i didntexplain something right it nothing too important it about two sentences i think but i felt i needed to explain just a tad more chapter 24 making up it soon became apparent to me that more than just my friends had noticed that james and i were fighting in fact a majority of the female population was aware and taking advantage of that very fact my insides churned with jealousy every time i saw a semi decent looking girl flirt with james it was only a very small satisfaction to me when alice pointed out that he never reciprocated i was glad he knew that even though we werentgetting alone so well at the moment we were far from actually breaking up unfortunately for me few other girls realized that so i was in a constant bad mood they were flirting left and right with him and there wasntmuch i could do about it occasionally i would yell at take away house points from girls who i felt were getting too forward and pushy i made sure in no uncertain terms that they knew he was still very much my boyfriend that however did nothing to deter them which just succeeded in irritating me even further alice had also very wisely pointed out that since he wasntreturning their favors there wasntany danger of anything happening in essence it was harmless flirting i knew she was right so i had to sit back and watch it disgruntledly i didntrealize just how many people were aware of the fight until snape said something to me in potions i heard that your perfect little man whore is no longer yours he sneered maliciously from behind me and who told you that i asked disinterestedly ignoring the snide remark about james i had long ago given up trying to get snape to stop insulting james it a rumor that been flying around for the past three days so it true then i didntmiss the glee in his voice hardly i replied testily sorry to burst your bubble but james and i arenteven close to breaking up now if you ll excuse me i have a potion to brew then where did those rumors come from i wonder he said disbelievingly most rumors have a basis in fact so something must be going wrong in your little paradise i dontsee how my love life is any of your business i snapped so i d appreciate it if you d shut your face and leave me alone mm a bit touchy today he said silkily i d warrant there is some truth to those rumors i had to bite my tongue and take a deep breath in order to avoid making a nasty remark and retaliating violently much as tave had done at the beginning of the year i could tell she knew exactly what i was thinking when she smirked at me that right lily deep breaths she teased it was all i could do not to reach out and slap her upside the head 0 that night tave dragged me from the library into the heads common room much to my protest dumbledore had also talked to sirius and drusa about the order and tave felt it fitting that all six of us discuss the pros and cons before reaching any final decisions i dontsee why everyone has to discuss this i said unhappily as she pulled me along the corridor it a personal decision i dontthink dumbledore wants anyone to join just because their friends are you re right about it being a personal decision she replied but it also a huge one this isntsomething we can all just jump up and agree to we re talking about our very lives here and i want to hear what everyone else has to say before i make that decision she had a fair point and i had nothing to say in reply but i was saved the trouble of thinking one up because we had reached the portrait of igor the ignorant we entered the common room and found we were the last to arrive remus james sirius and drusa had already made themselves comfortable in the chairs around the fire finally sirius muttered teasingly throwing a mischievous glance in our direction it took you two long enough to get here well considering i had to drag lily all the way down here i d say we made good time tave retorted settling herself down next to remus i threw her a nasty look and sat down as far away from james as possible drusa noticed this and raised an eyebrow at me but i shook my head slightly i wasntgoing to move since we re all here let get down to business remus began everyone was oblivious to drusa and my little exchange we need to discuss the order of the phoenix we were all silent for a moment then drusa spoke so what do you guys think about it i think it a good organization i offered when no one else spoke but dangerous remus added right we would be putting out lives on the line if we joined i agreed but at the same time we would be saving the lives of others tave said usually when you know who is stopped someone life is spared true but it more than just our lives at stake james put in it our families and friends too what do you mean sirius asked if voldemort finds out that someone works for the order i doubt he ll stop at just killing that one person i would guess that he targets their family and friends too he just that evil he explained i could feel his eyes on me as he spoke but isntthat just an incentive to be careful drusa countered by that logic none of us should join i didntsay no one should join i just said that it more than just you in jeopardy that something to think about james replied sometimes that just a risk you have to be willing to take i replied softly not quite meeting his eyes when i spoke i think it all comes down to one thing tave said slowly as the thought dawned on her the order of the phoenix is made up of people who are willing to give up their own lives in order to save the lives of others if you re willing to do that then by all means join but if not then don t that assuming you ll get killed remus said a wry smile on his face i wontdeny that there a good chance of that but there also a chance that we ll all live this is a really heavy decision sirius sighed i wouldntgive a damn if voldemort took out my entire family hey tave cried indignantly except for you and your dad you know that he amended anyway they re all a big load of dragon shit and deserve to be killed but putting myself in harm way well that another story drusa finished for him you know it the right thing to do but you dontwant to die we re all too young to die exactly sirius said i know i ve had more time to think about this than you but i feel it worth it i said i going to join i glanced at james as i spoke but his face was impassive me too remus said and me tave affirmed i in james said meeting my eyes in almost a defiant manner i guess i ll join sirius said thoughtfully all five of us looked at drusa expectantly i not sure she said apprehensively you donthave to join if you dontwant to tave said gently dontlet our decisions interfere with yours well i want to but i really dontknow how much of a help i d be she replied doubtfully drusa dumbledore wouldnthave asked you if he didntthink you d have a significant contribution to the order i pointed out he knows these kinds of things i dontknow what he told you but he told james and me that he usually waits until students are out of school before asking them to join he obviously sees something in us or he wouldnthave asked i suppose you re right she said then i in too great tave exclaimed jumping up let go tell dumbledore then the rest of us got up a little less exuberantly and followed her out of the common room and up to dumbledore office not surprisingly he seemed to know we were coming as the gargoyle had already moved and the spiral staircase was visible the six of us traipsed up the steps and james knocked on the office door come in dumbledore called and we filed into his office his gaze traveled along the line and he waited for someone to speak we re here to tell you our answers about the order of the phoenix tave said hesitantly when no one else spoke i presumed as much dumbledore replied benignly i glad to see that the decision was not taken lightly we ve all decided the same thing tave continued the rest of us nodded in agreement we want to join dumbledore surveyed us thoughtfully very good he said after a moment once again i must impress the importance of not speaking of this to anyone upon you you six are the only ones i have approached with this matter as i feel you possess certain qualities that are necessary for joining the order though they may not be evident at all times his eyes flicked amusedly to james sirius and remus i know that they are there just so you know you wontbe able to come to any meetings until you have graduated from school i will contact you when the time arrives i do believe that is all unless there are any questions no one spoke so he nodded his head in dismissal as we began to file out of his office he had one last thing to say i do hope you realize what an incredibly brave thing you ve just done i very proud of you 0 our friends found their way back to the gryffindor common room and james and i returned to the heads common room for a brief moment before going on our rounds i could tell that he was still very bothered by the fact that i had joined the order james i said gently when he had flopped down on the couch in front of the fire don t lily he replied tersely i not in the mood to debate over this again you obviously did what you wanted and i hope you re happy i stared at him for a moment trying to think of something to say that wouldntstart another row i couldntcome up with anything except well we should do rounds then go ahead i ll do my half in a bit i left the common room with a heavy feeling in my stomach this fighting with james was really starting to get to me i sighed as i traveled down the dark corridor i hated to admit it but tave and remus were right james and i were too damn stubborn and proud for our own good i meandered my way around the castle not particularly paying attention to where i was going i was incredibly surprised therefore when i almost ran right smack dab into snape near the entrance hall watch where you re going mudblood he snapped i dontwant you to touch my robes and make them filthy i glared at him how about you watch your mouth i shot back that ll be twenty points from slytherin a small slightly unsettling smile crept across his face you do realize that you re all alone with me in this corridor dontyou i stared at him for a moment why i asked suspiciously his smile only got wider i never got a chance to thank you for saving my life he replied i noticed a maniacal glint in his eye that i really didntlike that unnecessary i said not sure what else to say what you should do is return to your dormitory at once before i ask you what the hell you were doing out on the grounds this late at night quite frankly i find that suspicious since you donthave any werewolf friends and tonight isnta full moon and dontlook so surprised of course i know you were out on the grounds you have wet mud on your shoes snape looked down at his shoes for a moment as though contemplating them then before i knew it he had knocked my wand out of my hand and pinned me against the wall his hand at my throat pure terror filled me as i looked into his eyes which were inches from my own i tried to free myself from his grasp but he was much stronger than i had thought i was stuck fast and my wand was lying some ten feet away from me you re too smart for your own good he snarled i could smell his rancid breath and it made me feel sick that could get you into trouble one day it would do you well to mind your own business i could do nothing but stare at him feeling myself begin to panic there was no one around james wouldntcome this way because it was on my half of the castle not even to talk to me as he would have no reason to considering the fight we were in snape continued to look at me with pure contempt but then something changed i think i really do owe you a thanks for saving my life he said seeming almost thoughtful about it you know you re rather pretty for a mudblood my mind began frantically fishing around for some way to escape i tried to free myself again but i was unsuccessful you re not going anywhere he growled i ve spent too long watching you make that son of a bitch happy he doesntreally love you you know he ll dump you just like every other girl he been with he using you no he not i said finally finding my voice oh isnthe he asked silkily well when he dumps you dontsay i didntwarn you i glared at him my fear turning to rage james loves me i snarled and i love him we re happy together in case you hadntnoticed potter isntmaking you happy right now is he he challenged maybe it time you find someone else to make you happy who you i asked disgustedly sorry but i not interested a little disagreement doesntmake me think any less of james nor him of me he loves me and why the hell would you believe something like that he asked maliciously maybe she would believe something like that because it true i looked over snape shoulder and felt tears of relief in my eyes james was standing about three feet behind him with his wand out looking positively furious snape blanched when he heard james voice i smiled smugly at him i would appreciate it if you took your hands off my girlfriend james snarled snape slowly released me and i sank to the floor as my legs were unable to hold me up now get away from her snape backed away from me then whirled around with his wand out james sent a spell in his direction as he turned catching him square in the chest and hurling him towards the wall snape hit it with a loud thud donteven try to duel with me because you re going to lose james snapped his wand still trained on him you re outnumbered anyway two to one you d want the help of a mudblood snape spat and instantly knew he d said the wrong thing in front of the wrong person james no i cried but it was too late he had lunged at snape fists flying i could only watch in horror as james proceeded to beat the crap out of him snape tried to fight back but it was no use james was much bigger and stronger than him james stop stop it right now i demanded a moment later when i saw blood running down snape face james glanced at me then picked him up off the floor and slammed him against the wall his nose was gushing blood and both eyes were blackened as opposed to james minorly cut lip dontyou ever insult lily in front of me again he seethed pinning snape in the position that snape had pinned me only moments before she saved your sorry little ass twice now once from remus and once from me but i swear to merlin and agrippa that if i ever see you within five feet of her again even she wontbe able to stop me from committing murder is that understood snape tried to reply with a defiant stare but he was obviously in a lot of pain james shook his head in disgust then let him go he easily picked me up from the floor and began carrying me towards our dormitories what made you come here i asked relaxing in his strong arms the marauder map he replied simply i always watch you when you do your rounds alone just in case something like this happens i looked over his shoulder at snape who was glaring at us in pure hatred as we went down the corridor we should take him to the hospital wing i said softly feeling pity for the boy no we shouldn t james replied tersely he can get himself there if he needs it you really shouldnthave done that i said burying my face in his shoulder you really shouldnthave the bastard deserved it he replied he been asking for an ass whipping since he came here i not just going to sit back and let him do whatever he was going to do to you i sighed that still doesntmake it right dumbledore is going to find out if he doesntalready know didnthe ask us to join the order of the phoenix because we saved snape life this situation is rather different he attacked you lily do you honestly expect me to just sit back and twiddle my thumbs about it well no i admitted you re right if someone attacked you i would be pretty upset too i dontknow if i would go on to punch their lights out but i would be upset just the same come to think of it i would be more than upset maybe i would punch their lights out that drew a slight laugh out of james as we arrived at our common room he set me down on the couch and a sudden thought hit me as he sat down next to me that how i feel about the order of the phoenix i said you want to punch its lights out he asked clearly not following my random statement when you asked if i expected you to just sit back and twiddle your thumbs i said no that how i feel about the order i cantjust sit back and twiddle my thumbs while people are out there being attacked do you get it now i asked hopefully james thought a moment i suppose i do but you know how you said you would be pretty upset if someone attacked me that exactly how i feel about you i dontwant you to get hurt it a big risk that we re taking because we re putting our lives on the line if i lost you he trailed off and i moved closer so i could run my fingers through his hair yeah i understand your point too i bit my lip knowing what i had to say next and not wanting to say it i took a deep breath i sorry for not listening to you i guess i was too focused on me to think about you i sorry too he said a small smile crept across my face when i realized apologizing was just as hard for him as it was for me i wasntconsidering how you felt about it i still not thrilled about you being in the order but i understand why you joined tave and remus were right i mused more to myself than anything what oh they said that we were both too proud and stubborn for our own good and that we deserve each other they re right you know we are both too proud and stubborn for our own good james smiled at me and i felt my stomach flip flop yeah we are arentwe i guess we ll just have to work on bringing each other down a few notches in a nice way of course i laughed of course he pulled me onto his lap and kissed me for the first time in days as i deepened the kiss i wondered how i ever got through those days i figured it had to be my pride which if that would be the punishment i definitely had to fix a n wow i soooooooo sorry for taking so

time i fill up my gas tank sighs chapter 35 twice defied february turned to march and the weather became warmer spring was in the air and i found myself really enjoying the small garden in the front of the house i had never really been one for gardening and herbology had never been my favorite course but somehow when the garden was my own and i could do what i pleased with it it became much more enjoyable it became a bright spot in my day whenever i chanced a look at it and saw tiny green shoots poking their way out of the almost black earth isntthat the best i asked tave one day when she and remus were over for tea she cocked an eyebrow at me you need to get out more lils if seeing little green stems poking out of the ground excites you that much james and remus joined her in a laugh oh ha ha i said sarcastically you three have no appreciation for my hard work we have appreciation for your hard work she defended herself and the guys i just like giving you a hard time donti know it i said sarcastically i enjoyed engaging in banter such as that because we were hurriedly summoned to the order headquarters a few nights later and it was then that we came to the sudden realization of just how precious life was when we arrived it was all business we were very briefly clued in to what was happening there has been an unexpected attack on a wizarding family not far from brighton dumbledore said quickly i had never seen the old man so serious we re not sure just how many death eaters are there but it quite a few this is going to be an all out battle i going to the ministry to round up the aurors the rest of you need to get there as soon as possible to prevent anything happening to the family there were of thirteen of us in total james me sirius remus tave drusa alice frank gideon and fabian prewett benjy fenwick dorcas meadows and marlene mckinnon we were given the address to the house and apparated there we appeared outside a very large old house and i briefly wondered just how many people lived there are we all here marlene asked quietly counting heads good be as quiet as you can we dontneed to alert them of our presence until we attack all thirteen of us filed into the house and not one of us made a sound we could hear the tortured screams from someone and my stomach gave a great lurch i had forgotten the terror of facing voldemort followers i grabbed james hand and held on tightly he squeezed my hand reassuringly and i felt a little better we were in this together we continued down the hallway following the sounds of the screams the closer we got the more adrenaline was running through my system by the time we reached the door to the living room i was ready to go on the count of three we burst the door open and poured in we found numerous death eaters in the living room torturing the house poor occupants i was taken slightly aback at the number of death eaters in the room there had to be at least twenty the apparent leader turned to us in surprise when we burst through the door and instantly hexes were flying everywhere tave was right behind me when the explosion of spells began and we both quickly ducked out of the way of one coming straight for us shit to merlin she exclaimed from her spot on the floor next to me is this what all battles are like i had forgotten that it was the first time she had ever really faced a death eater the first time when i had been hit with the cruciatus curse it had been more dumbledore and voldemort fighting i dontknow i replied grimly i ve only ever been in one other densaugeo i sent the first spell that came to mind at an approaching death eater and we had a right laugh when his teeth began to lengthen beneath his mask nice tave laughed we separated ways and began dueling one on one with the death eaters well in some cases it was more like three on one i was lucky enough to not be in a situation such as that as i had my hands full with just one whoever i was dueling was very good and i only just barely hit him with a curse furnunculus i cried and the spell hit his right shoulder he howled in pain as boils began to break out over his entire body i grinned but i didntget to enjoy my victory long as i found myself thrown off my feet and soaring backwards through the air i hit a wall with a thud and the wind was knocked out of me i let out a choking groan and took several breaths trying to regain a rhythm as a female death eater advanced on me she threw a curse at me which i was only barely able to dodge i sent one right back but she was just as agile as i nice try mudblood she sneered and i thought i vaguely recognized her voice who was she there was no time to deliberate the point as a hex came too close to my head for comfort i sprang up from my spot on the wall and engaged in a fierce duel with her hexes curses and jinxes were thrown and i used whichever came to mind first out of nowhere a hex hit my attacker and she fell to the floor some strange things with wings attacking her face i found myself face to face with gideon prewett who was laughing what was that i yelled over the din bat bogey hex he replied it a specialty of mine so that what the bat bogey hex was i grinned my thanks and we both moved on i continued fighting for what seemed like only a few minutes but it must have been much longer i began to notice that there seemed to be more and more death eaters i quickly scanned the room trying to find other order members there was gideon and fabian marlene was fighting someone tave was over there where was james oh shit i spotted him lying on the floor apparently bound with invisible ropes along with sirius remus alice drusa frank dorcas and benjy and dorcas was writhing on the floor in pain before i knew what i was doing i began sprinting across the room throwing whatever spell came to mind at the death eaters surrounding the group i took several by surprise including the one torturing dorcas tarantallegra silencio impedimentia expelliarmus petrificus totalus i bellowed stupefy rictusempra diffindo i grinned when tave came running up beside me together we continued our assault occasionally dodging spells sent back at us suddenly i realized the distance between the death eaters and us was quickly dwindling i hadntexactly thought so far into the future to decide what to do when i arrived but the same thought struck tave and i we recklessly entered the circle of death eaters and began punching and kicking whoever was within reach being muggleborn definitely had its advantages and for once i was thankful petunia and i didntget along very well i was well versed in the areas of the body that hurt the most when hit and my aim was true very soon however tave and i realized that our assault really hadntbeen that bright of an idea there were about six death eaters to the two of us and it took one spell to trap our arms and legs to our bodies damn tave exclaimed as we were added to the group of order members on the floor now what nice try alice said sympathetically leave it to her to stay completely cool in a situation such as this get the others a death eater barked out no one here can do anything round up the others and we ll have some fun cold fear gripped my heart at those words their definition of fun most certainly did not match up with any of ours marlene was hit with a spell from behind and came soaring towards our group the only two left fighting were the prewett brothers i was impressed with their fighting skills they could dodge spells like no one i had ever seen this didntsit well with the death eaters however and soon five of them were fighting gideon and fabian spells were fired rapidly back and forth for several minutes but i knew it was only a matter of time before the brothers were captured they were getting tired and there were fifteen more death eaters that could jump in at any time get them dolohov howled the lead death eater impatiently there bleeding two of them kill them if you must my eyes grew wide as i heard his words they wouldntkill them avada kedavra a jet of green light erupted from on of the death eater wands heading straight for gideon he saw it but he couldntmove out of the way fast enough it hit him straight on in the chest and he crumpled to the floor no i let out a strangled scream unable to believe it gideon prewett had just been murdered and i had witnessed the whole thing avada kedavra a second jet of green light erupted from the death eater wand this time hitting fabian he instantly fell to the floor next to his brother to say i was shocked would be a huge understatement i was completely horrified at what had just taken place these people were ruthless i knew they killed people but reading about it in the newspaper and actually seeing it occur right in front of you are two very different things i felt sick and began struggling to hold the contents of my stomach down i looked over at the order members around me and each one looked just as horrified as i was they had killed gideon and fabian the death eaters turned their attention to the rest of us and i began to wonder where dumbledore was he had said he was going to round up some aurors how long was that supposed to take that was unfortunate said the lead death eater feigning sympathy his comrades snickered at his words unfortunate yet necessary let take a moment to remember their courageous fight he bowed his head then a second later lifted it moment over now who shall we torture first i glared at him my blood beginning to boil at his mockery of the prewetts anger coursed through me as i stared up at the death eaters the mudblood answered a female voice i recognized it as the one i had dueled earlier she was the one gideon had hit with a bat bogey hex no the leader negated we ll start with this one and work our way down the line he indicated benjy fenwick who was dragged forward with a flick of the leader wand benjy gave him a defiant stare and i shut my eyes i knew what was coming next sure enough screams filled the air as the cruciatus curse was thrown at poor benjy i screwed my eyes up tight willing myself not to cry i knew exactly what he was feeling and i prayed dumbledore would arrive soon did you like that the death eater asked with a sadistic laugh after he had lifted the curse benjy panted as he lay there trying desperately to regain his breath he shook his head slightly and a pained expression crossed his face as he did he immediately was sent soaring back to the rest of us and landed hard on the ground simultaneously the next person in line was brought forward my stomach lurched when i saw that it was tave no remus exclaimed beginning to fight against his invisible bonds remus don t james said sounding incredibly calm had i not known him so well i would have thought he wasntperturbed in the least by recent events you ll only make it worse i felt a glimmer of pride in my husband he was staying levelheaded and for once he was more levelheaded than remus was james never ceased to amaze me the death eaters ignored the exchange between the two men and a wand was raised ready to perform the unforgivable on my best friend but a loud bang from behind the group interrupted and i felt my heart leap dumbledore had arrived behind him came several aurors the only ones i recognized were mad eye moody and james father i briefly wondered if mr potter was in the order but i was distracted once i felt my invisible bonds release their hold on me i along with the other order members jumped up and joined the fight all hell broke loose as the battle was renewed i was certain we would be able to round up all the death eaters and throw them into azkaban this was not to be however as an unexpected person showed up several minutes after the battle began the second time i didntrealize it until the death eater i was fighting began retreating it joined its comrades behind a foreboding figure voldemort damn party pooper i heard sirius mutter as we followed suit regrouped behind dumbledore of course he has to show up dumbledore voldemort hissed when he saw the older wizard tom dumbledore replied cordially inclining his head slightly it was foolish of you to come tonight one might say the same to you he said out of nowhere a jet of red light appeared heading straight for dumbledore i watched in horrified fascination as just in time a large shield appeared in front of him the jet of light was absorbed by the shield before it disappeared i have every right to be here your followers did the unthinkable tonight the suppressed rage in dumbledore voice was just barely there i knew he was just as upset as the rest of us but he was able to mask it wonderfully voldemort shrugged they got in their way he replied they were muggle loving bastards anyway it serves them right and if you re not careful you ll end up the same way foolish old codger as a unit the order of the phoenix tensed to hear the prewett brothers and dumbledore talked about like that was downright insulting all of us would have liked nothing better than to throw every unforgivable at voldemort in quick succession that where you re wrong tom dumbledore replied benignly with a barely perceptible flick of his wrist a jet of blue light was sent hurtling at voldemort voldemort also conjured a shield just in time and it reacted to the spell just like the one dumbledore had used is that all you ve got old man he taunted dumbledore made no reply maintaining his calm composure voldemort set a jet of fire at him but just before it reached dumbledore it turned into droplets of water that fell to the floor with a small splash a small almost condescending smile tugged at the corners of dumbledore lips pure anger flashed across voldemort face but it was soon turned to surprise as dumbledore vanished i grabbed james hand dumbledore wouldnthave left us would he he couldntjust leave us alone with voldemort of course he didn t a few moments later he appeared right in the middle of the group of death eaters which was standing behind voldemort as voldemort turned around dumbledore sent a spell hitting him square on he howled in anger and pain as the sheer force of the spell knocked him clear off his feet this isntover he snarled just before he disapparated his death eaters followed suit leaving us alone in the now destroyed living room no one spoke for a moment until a voice was heard faintly from the corner how can we ever thank you we instantly turned to find the house owner crouched in the corner along with his wife and two children in the heat of the battle we had forgotten about them and apparently so had the death eaters they had been huddling in an out of the way corner since we had arrived there no need frank said wearily we can perform memory charms on you and your children if you would like if not we ll be leaving the man and his wife requested that memory charms be put on their children as the children were rather young to have witnessed such horrors they denied any medical attention although the owner had been tortured with crucio and we returned to the order headquarters james and i went home that night in silence we were both upset by the death of two of the order members it was rather unexpected to say the least i think that while we all knew we were putting our safety and our lives on the line we had never actually expected any of us to be killed james held me a little closer as we fell asleep and i didntmind at all it was times like these that i realized we were flirting with death for a good reason yes but we were flirting with it all the same yet i just couldntsee either of us being killed like the prewetts had been we were nineteen years old we were too young to die werentwe a n i am so sorry for the really really really long wait grovels at the feet of the readers dontbe mad my life has been upside down for the past month i ve had a beast of a time trying to find time to type my computer in my bedroom for the time being but that means my family is going in and out of my room all the time namely my brother grrr i will do my very best to update sooner next time i feel terrible for leaving you guys hanging for so long and in an effort to get this up sooner i going to forego the review responses this time thank you to everyone who reviewed you all make my day please keep reviewing and i promise to respond next time and if you do want me to respond right away just say so and make sure you put your email address where it says to and i ll email you i love you all disclaimer any of the characters you recognize never have been and never will be mine they belong to the ingenious j k rowling and i just like to play with them a little bit suing me would be rather pointless seeing as i practically broke at the moment but if you d like to go ahead actually don t because it d just be a huge headache for both of us chapter 36 and so life goes on james and i attended the prewett brothers funeral with a majority of our fellow order members we sat in the back out of respect for the grieving family it was a very nice service although it was very sad i felt a little bad because i realized i had been slightly distracted throughout most of the service but it was james who pointed out that i was probably just trying to push the reality of what happened out of my mind people deal with things like that differently but anyway my distraction came by a family sitting up front because i noticed all of the children had flaming red hair there were five of them all boys from what i could tell two of them were seated on their parents lap and the other three were sitting quietly in their chairs i think the fact that the five boys were perfectly silent was part of what initially drew me to them aside from their hair i figured they had to be related to the prewett brothers as the oldest looked no older than seven i got my chance to meet them after the funeral the two oldest were playing in the grass and their mother was having quite a time keeping them within her sight i couldntblame the poor boys they had just sat still for over an hour bill charlie she called to them you need to stay where i can see you just then the two youngest i assumed they were twins began crying and their mother attention was quickly turned to them she picked them both up and began looking for her husband arthur arthur he didntseem to be anywhere in the near vicinity so i thought i would offer a hand would you like me to hold one of your boys i asked as the babies crying escalated a grateful look crossed her face are you sure you dontmind dear of course not you look as if you could use a bit of help i answered she handed me one of the crying boys and he stopped instantly to try and figure out who i was and as soon as he stopped his brother stopped the woman shook her head they re always like that she said when one cries the other one cries when one stops the other stops it drives me near mental at times i smiled i sure it does i lily potter by the way i molly weasley that george you re holding and i ve got his twin fred they re eleven months old percy sitting under the tree over there and he three bill and charlie are in the grass they re seven and six respectively she pointed each of them out to me as she spoke that quite a bunch i exclaimed yes they certainly keep my hands full molly replied but they re good boys i was impressed that they remained so quiet inside i said a bit hesitantly as i wasntsure of their relation to the prewetts i ve never seen five boys sit still for an hour a sad smile crossed molly face they understood that it wasnta time to cause trouble for arthur and me gideon and fabian were my brothers i so sorry i said softly she gave a small shrug and i got the distinct impression that she was trying very hard to seem nonchalant how did you know them she asked i erm worked with them i said carefully not sure how much she knew about her brothers work with the order she opened her mouth to speak but wasntgiven time to question me further as right at that moment her husband appeared beside her we were introduced and i handed over his son a moment later james joined us and i was still amazed that i got butterflies in my stomach when i introduced him as my husband after four months i still wasntused to it the four of us conversed for a short while and then james and i decided to return home we didntwant to impose any longer and the weasley boys were becoming rather restless james and i arrived home around four o clock that afternoon we were rather subdued upon our return but we knew we were both thinking the same thing this sucks i sighed as i hung my coat in the front all closet all this dying and everything it everywhere i took james coat from him and hung it next to mine i know he said rubbing my shoulders gently he moved my hair out of the way and dropped a light kiss on my neck that why we re fighting voldemort lils so he cantkill anyone anymore he moved into the kitchen and began searching the cupboards for something he pulled down two teacups and continued his search what are you looking for love i asked after a few moments of watching him the teapot he answered i dontsee it where did you put it a small smirk tugged at my lips as i crossed the kitchen floor i dontbelieve it i said in a slightly teasing manner james potter is going to make tea when was the last time he ever did anything besides eat in my kitchen i ve done dishes loads of times he protested then how can you not know where the teapot is you must have put it away the last time you did the dishes i tried to look severe but i failed miserably i couldnthelp but smile as he put on his wounded puppy dog expression you must have moved it he replied his adorable hazel eyes looking as sad as possible mmm i must have i bent down to open a cupboard beneath the counter and located the teapot in less than two seconds i straightened up and handed it to james what was it doing down there he demanded going over to the sink to fill it with water james that where it always been i said condescendingly no it hasn t i wrapped my arms around his waist and set my chin on his back darling sweetheart love of my life i put it there when we moved in and that been its home ever since he turned to face me and our eyes met he opened his mouth to say something but then he shut it again i gave him a triumphant smile fine you win he conceded but i actually not quite sure what our argument was about in the first place me either so i only want to win if i get you for a prize i answered with a wink i think i can arrange that he kissed me gently but first i must make tea i surprised you know how to i mused as he set the teapot on the stove and the muggle way too i impressed bet you didntknow i could be so handy in the kitchen did you he replied proudly the tea will be ready in no time i hesitated a moment because i really hated to point out his error i really really did he seemed so happy that he could make tea the muggle way yet i couldnthelp but giggle slightly as i told him what was wrong er james you might want to turn on the stove i said as he began to walk away what he stopped midstride to give me a questioning look the water will never boil if you dontturn on the stove i felt terrible at his crestfallen face so i made up for it by covering it with kisses i still love you i offered as i reached behind him to turn the dial at least someone does he replied forlornly not looking at me and managing to look terribly downcast oh honestly i exclaimed while rolling my eyes be a little more melodramatic would you he immediately looked up at me and grinned i could be but i think that would be overkill a small sigh escaped my lips as his strong arms found their way around my waist and drew me close to him but for the record i love you too and a side note off the record snogging james potter in the kitchen is more than worth any melodrama thrown my way xxxxx it wasntuntil several weeks later that we learned why dumbledore had been rather late in arriving he had gone to the ministry to round up the aurors in the order but he arrived to find hardly any aurors there at all most of the ones on duty which was a substantial amount had been sent off on a report of a long string of muggle killings and many threats for more in wales a whopping grand total of four was left at the ministry none of them were in the order and that posed a bit of a problem dumbledore was faced with two choices he could either bring those aurors and try to contact the ones off duty or he could try his luck in locating the order members in wales he decided on the former james father had been one of those at the ministry and he was very helpful in contacting the off duty aurors that were order members nevertheless it took awhile for everyone to assemble they came to our aide and the rest is history those not in the order were given memory charms after the battle we couldnthave them know of out secret organization whether they were aurors or not it was simply just too dangerous mr potter just before receiving his memory charm told james just how proud he was of him although james just nodded and thanked him i knew how much the comment meant to him james idolized his father and his approval was everything to him and so life went on it almost seemed cruel really that we got to live while others around us were dying but there was nothing we could do about it the spring turned into summer and both passed without very much incident in regards to auror training and the order james and i both made the necessary advancements in auror training and we were engaged in a few skirmishes with some death eaters nothing too big happened however which i was rather glad of in our personal lives however there were a few events worth mentioning one was that drusa and sirius were finally officially back together that happened somewhere in june i think it really was rather a relief to find them snogging each other senseless in our guest bedroom when they were invited over it seemed things were getting back to normal and that was a much needed feeling another event worth mentioning occurred in mid july james and i were sitting in our living room having a lovely chat when tave apparated right into our front hallway lily she called are you home yeah i in here i replied from my spot on the couch she bounded into the living room excitedly her eyes bright oh hello james sorry for just coming over without asking but i just had to tell you two she exclaimed coming to stand in front of james and me she began bouncing on the tips of her toes and i had to laugh she looked like a little schoolgirl excited about something tell us what i demanded when she didntcontinue you cantjust i stopped short when a sparkle of light hit my eye it was coming from a ring on her left hand on the fourth finger of her left hand ohmigod i exclaimed in one breath jumping up from the couch i grabbed her hand and a huge smile broke out over her face are you she nodded remus proposed to me last night we re getting married lily i let out an excited squeal as i hugged her tave you re getting married i can hardly believe it so he finally asked did he james said with an amused smile he been carrying around that ring for weeks and you didnttell me i demanded james i not going to tell you something like that he protested you women talk about everything you would have let it slip somehow i know you would have i knew he was right but of course i wouldntadmit it i just gave him the look and turned back to tave well what are you waiting for we have to start planning i haventtold drusa or alice yet she said but i ll go do that right now and then we can of course go now invite them over here and then we ll plan away i said and with an excited nod tave disapparated i immediately heard a groan from behind me i turned and raised an eyebrow at my husband who was staring at me with a frantic look on his face what i asked completely clueless as to why he was giving me such a look four giggling girls here while i here he looked more than terrified at the prospect oh you poor thing i said sarcastically folding my arms across my chest somehow i dontthink you would have minded just over a year ago when we were back at hogwarts that was different i a married man now he replied i serious lily there nothing more terrifying to a guy than being stuck in a group of girls excited over something i sat delicately on his lap and grinned i ll bet you can conquer that fear oh how so i planted a chaste kiss on his lips but the look i gave him was far from innocent you find a way mr potter and i ll make it well worth your effort a wicked smile spread across his features at my words perhaps i will find a way mrs potter i ll hold you to your end of the bargain deal xxxxx true to his word james did indeed survive the day with four giggling girls he stayed out of the way mostly but he was able to summon enough courage to offer us tea and lemonade how ever did you train him so well alice laughed frank would have bolted right out of our house if the four of us were there i believe it was tave who once said that there are certain incentives i said delicately but my meaning was picked up by all our day was mostly filled by pointless chatter as it had been awhile since we had all gotten together but we did eventually decide on the color of the bridesmaids dresses they were going to be pale pink even though tave had never been one for pink i not the one wearing the bloody dress she shrugged when we asked all i really care about is my dress spoken like yourself i laughed tave was tave and that was that the girls left around nine o clock that night and james was waiting for me he picked me up and began carrying me like a baby up the stairs to our bedroom that was torture he muttered as he began to plant kisses along my jaw line terrible that and yet somehow you managed i proud of you i replied rolling my eyes you have to uphold your end of the bargain darling he reminded me you have to make it well worth my effort with pleasure i said with a grin and i made a mental note to make bargains like that with james more often a n wipes sweat off brow phew this chapter was a beast to write and even more of a beast to type up of course to be completely honest some of that had to do with my laziness yes i will admit it i have been terribly lazy when it comes to this story and i apologize profusely to you guys i ve actually been writing several of the chapters that will be coming up later because to me they re much more interesting so i can promise that later on the chapters will be coming faster in the meantime please hang in there please keep reviewing because i absolutely love to get reviews thanks so much banana princess thanks so very much i always thought flirting with death was a wonderful expression because it really rather an oxymoron when you think about it flirting and death they dontexactly go hand in hand unless you decide to flirt with voldemort secretly smiling yes i do know the third time is coming up and eventually sobs we wonttalk about that right now sugarmama thank you very much animefreak100 um ok i glad you like

ton kipsy wow thanks good luck on your story they can be beasts at times liliana thank you very much i glad you like it bandedwhiskey34687 well it good that you like the story but i d like you to keep a little something in mind this story is rated pg 13 well t now that they ve changed the rating system a tad and i rated it that for a reason if you canthandle the language then i suggest you find other stories that are less offensive to you i realize that one of the chapters maybe it 10 is a little excessive on the language but i was really pissy the day i wrote that so if you can find it in your heart to overlook it that great if you can t shrugs lupinlover922 thanks i glad you could stay up just a few seconds longer to review raynindawn oh hey thanks for the reviews it makes my heart go pitter pat whenever i get positive reviews and you gave me two grins dreamstar22 wow i honestly have to say i blushed when i read your review thank you so much it hard to believe that someone would invest two and a half hours of their life just to read my fic i floored i thank you from the bottom of my feet because they re lower than my heart for that and for taking the time to review keep doing so please serenity84uk why thank you and a little side note the uk rocks my socks disclaimer i unfortunately have no claims whatsoever to any harry potter related characters if i did i would be a jazillionaire which i not chapter 37 warfare of two sorts the month of august was filled with the hubbub of planning tave wedding i ll admit that we girls did get rather excited about the whole thing but that may have been given a bit of a boost when the daily prophet reported on her engagement hey look at that alice exclaimed when we were once again assembled in my house at my kitchen table but this time sirius remus and frank came too so james was able to escape with them to another part of the house she was in the quidditch section and pointing to a headline that read chudley cannons star to be married underneath the headline was a picture of tave and remus laughing with each other hmm i wonder where they got that picture tave asked it a good one i like it read the article i said to alice as i paged through a flower catalogue the catalogue just so happened to be the same one i had used for my wedding octavia meliflua starting keeper for the chudley cannons has recently become engaged according to a statement released by the team on tuesday alice read miss meliflua is going to be married to remus lupin her boyfriend of nearly two years said elias standling spokesman for the team the pair met at hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry and began dating in their seventh year no date has been set for the wedding as of yet and then it just goes on and talks about how great of a player tave is and all her stats but we dontwant to read that alice finished throwing a teasing look in tave direction of course we do tave replied with a grin how many saves did i have last season four hundred something wasntit oh shut it i replied we all know you re the best keeper in the league hey what about these flowers tave looked at the picture in the catalogue and shrugged those are pretty that what you ve said about all the flowers we ve shown you drusa exclaimed honestly woman do you even care not particularly she answered honestly i dontcare if i get married in the dungeons at hogwarts just so long as i get married but i do want a pretty dress she added as an afterthought well you re not getting married in the hogwarts dungeons so pick which flowers you think are the prettiest drusa said rolling her eyes this doesnthave to be so difficult is tave being difficult again the four of us turned and saw sirius standing in the doorway shaking his head behind him were james remus and frank all looking somewhat amused that exactly why i will have nothing to do with planning the wedding remus sighed making his way into the kitchen the other men followed hey i resent that tave pouted sticking out her lower lip and causing remus to go over and kiss it ewww gross sirius said making pretend gagging noises i really dontwant to see that i rolled my eyes as if you and drusa didntscar me enough when i walked in on you two snogging in the guest bedroom a couple of weeks ago at least we were in a room by ourselves sirius defended himself it was your fault for walking in yeah well i wouldntexactly say you were in a room by yourselves you left the door open i shot back a minor detail he said self righteously causing me to roll my eyes as much as i hate to i have to agree with lily on that one drusa said giving her boyfriend a sympathetic look an open door isntexactly privacy whose side are you on anyway he replied disgruntledly folding his arms across his chest in a pout oh honestly drusa said getting up and going to sit on his lap you know i always on your side lily just happened to beat you in this one hands down but i still love you she then proceeded to kiss him causing remus to protest oy padfoot if i cantkiss tave in front of everybody then you cantkiss drusa in front of everybody he said matter of factly it only fair you know sirius thought a moment well i suppose i ll allow you to kiss tave if that the way it going to be just make sure i not watching needless to say this sparked more arguments i dontremember the rest of them i just remember sharing a smile with james and thinking how our group of friends never really changed sirius always started little arguments about nothing in particular and we all jumped in ready to give our opinions little did we know that all of that would soon be just a bittersweet memory xxxxx james what i marched into our bedroom where james was pulling a shirt over his head i folded my arms across my chest and surveyed him raising an eyebrow as i did so what did i do he asked recognizing my stance as the one i did when he was in trouble why dontyou go into the bathroom and tell me i answered curtly he sighed and complied knowing we would be quite late to auror training if he didn t it was nearly ten months into our marriage and we were still having disagreements about the little things i had a sneaking suspicion we would be fighting over them until we were a hundred years old i not quite sure what you re upset about came his voice from down the hall i joined him in the bathroom oh really then you dontsee the water all over the floor from your shower nor the toothpaste spattered on the mirror from you brushing your teeth nor the toothpaste tube sitting on the counter squeezed in the middle he rolled his eyes yes i see it i just donthappen to have a problem with it dontroll your eyes at me how can you not have a problem with it the bathroom is filthy i exclaimed not exactly he said slowly you see the water on the floor will evaporate and be gone by the time we get home tonight there are about four dots of toothpaste on the mirror that no one is going to notice and i left out the toothpaste for you yes it squeezed in the middle but i always do that a small smirk on his face left me in no doubt that he did it just to irritate me you are such a male i exclaimed in exasperation if you live like this i thank merlin i never saw the boys dormitories at hogwarts there were three more of you to add to this you probably would have had a heart attack james agreed but if it means that much to you i ll clean up the water and the mirror he took out his wand and muttered a few cleaning spells he left the bathroom kissing my cheek as he went i looked down at the counter and saw that he had left the toothpaste tube just as it was james i called he reappeared from around the corner and grinned impishly at me i just leaving it out for you love he said mmm hmm i said picking it up i sure that making my life easier is foremost in your mind it always is he replied cheesily with a wink i sighed and began to squish the tube so it would be flat at the bottom instead of the middle unfortunately i squished it with a little more force than needed before either of us knew what was happening toothpaste squirted out of the tube and straight onto james clean shirt i clapped a hand over my mouth my eyes wide james stared down in his shirt a look of disbelief on his face i tried really hard to suppress the giggle that i felt coming but i wasntvery good at it a noise halfway between a snort and a choke emerged from my throat james looked up at me you did that on purpose he said he seemed quite shocked at what had just happened this was a clean shirt lily i i sorry i didntmean to i gasped feeling my eyes water with the suppressed laughter i i i dissolved into giggles and james shook his head unbelievable he muttered running a hand through his messy hair my wife is laughing at me i leaned against the counter for support wiping away a tear as i laughed you should have seen the look on your face i choked out it was priceless it was was it he demanded i see how things are with that he grabbed the toothpaste tube out of my hand and squirted it on my shirt james i shrieked stepping back several seconds too late it really was an accident i really didntmean to get you oops he shrugged sorry love my hand must have slipped a smirk tugged at the corners of his mouth completely negating his statement your hand slipped i asked quite unbelieving right well that just lovely i turned to the sink and turned on the faucet i began to clean my shirt and then i just slipped and managed to get james full in the face with a handful of water oh darling i so sorry i have no idea how that happened bad hand bad hand needless to say james and i then proceeded to become engaged in an all out war it lasted for several minutes and it involved toothpaste water shaving cream and several spells james hit me with a terrible tickling spell which gave him and advantage he wouldnttake it off until i declared him the all time winner unfortunately i didntrealize until after our battle that we only succeeded in making the bathroom as well as the bedroom and hallways a bigger mess than it had been to begin with and that not mentioning the matter of our clothes being completely trashed yet it wasntanything a few charms couldntfix and we were soon on our way to auror training we arrived rather late however to stealth and tracking our professor obviously wasntpleased and gave us the evil eye as we slipped into the lecture we sat near the longbottoms in the back and alice grinned at me in amusement she slipped me a note when the professor back was turned which was actually encouraged seeing as passing notes unnoticed was supposed to improve our stealth please donttell me you re late because you and james were shagging in the shower again i felt myself turn bright red as i read the note i shot her a nasty glare then quickly scribbled a reply that was once two months ago alice we got into a bit of a toothpaste war this morning and had to clean up and change clothes riiiiiight a toothpaste war whatever you say dear no really i yelled at james because he made a mess in the bathroom this morning and as i was fixing the toothpaste tube i accidentally squirted him it just escalated from there alice rolled her eyes you do realize that you ve changed dramatically from the girl i knew for seven years at hogwarts right what do you mean i mean that before you started dating james you would never have even dreamed of being late to something like this yet you ve been late several times since we started auror training he rubbed off on you i grinned as i read her note she was one hundred percent right james had rubbed off on me my reply was fairly simple yeah he has it funny what love can do to you isntit alice just nodded her agreement xxxxx that night james and i received an urgent summons from the order of the phoenix and we arrived as soon as possible many of the order members were there but no one seemed to know what was going on we waited a few more moments for dumbledore to arrive and when he did he immediately began to fill us in we ve received word of an attack on a family he said gravely i know that both of the parents both muggle borns have been killed i dontknow the status on their three children i not going to sugarcoat the situation it very dangerous gregory gable was the father and he had been very active in the ministry fight against voldemort there are at least twenty five death eaters there perhaps more i not sure if voldemort is there or not there were twenty of us order members present and we were all sent to a large house in the country it was reminiscent of the last time we had fought voldemort and i prayed that the outcome would not be the same dumbledore had told us that there were at least twenty five death eaters i never actually counted but i figured there had to be many more than that they were everywhere trashing the house and torturing the three young children sirius was the first of us to attack them and then as usual all hell broke loose every type of spell imaginable was flying every which way throughout the house drusa and i managed to get the children away from the death eaters and into a safe corner before joining the battle i had hoped that with every battle things would get a little easier not physically of course because fighting for your life is never an easy thing to do i was hoping that mentally i would withstand it a little better naturally nothing like that happened not that i would ever admit it but i was scared shitless at the knowledge that one wrong move and i was more than dead knowing that it could happen to my friends or to my husband only intensified that feeling but one wasntgiven much time to think about that in the heat of a battle adrenaline just sort of took over especially when you see your husband trying to fend off two death eaters expelliarmus i shouted hitting one death eater square in the back his wand went flying out of his hand and across the room james got the other one with a tickling jinx and he smiled his thanks at me i turned around and ducked just in time to avoid a jet of bright green light sent in my direction it hit a painting on the wall and blasted quite a large sized hole into it i immediately reciprocated the action but my attacker was too fast he dodged my spell with ease you ll have to do better than that mudblood came the cruel voice of a woman so my attacker was a woman the familiar sounding one so will you i replied stepping aside to avoid another curse that seemed to infuriate her and we immediately became engaged in a fierce battle a n yes i know bad place to stop as well as rather short i really wanted to get this up for you guys the next chapters will be longer as i already have them written it just a matter of finding time to type i would like to apologize again for the long wait i had some severe personal problems during the past few weeks and i felt i had to deal with those before doing anything else for the most part they have been cleared up and i hope to be able to update sooner in the future on a lighter note thanks so much for all the reviews they mean bunches to me i heart you all banana princess lol i glad you re excited for tave and yet sighs prue potter thanks for the review and i already answered that question grins pixi kitty why thank you taniita ah if only laziness could be my current excuse sighs i just seem to be full of excuses donti ah well i trying to do better dreamstar22

glad you like it i dontmind your rambling in the least lilyfan06 thanks bandedwhiskey34687 lol no worries i understand completely and i hope i didntcome off as a snappish jerk in my last response i

the bud and me a talented writer blushes i just write down what in my head and i glad you enjoy it thanks so much gred and forge weasley thanks serenity84uk lol sorry the next chapters may have some

lol ok mssrblaze i know it really sucks to write about the bad that happens when they re in their primes of life i do with we could change things just a bit but i going to follow the books it really quite a sad story when you think about it anonymous thanks ragzefire thanks and that a bummer glad you can get over it to read mine winks elily thanks princess52577 thanks disclaimer harry potter definitely isntmine chapter 38 thrice defied tarantallegra crucio i quickly dove behind a piece of debris narrowly escaping the curse thrown my way it hit the debris and blasted it into pieces i got up and returned the favor but i also narrowly missed my target again i was forced to duck as a stream of red light came straight at my head this time i threw two jinxes in rapid succession and was just able to hit my opponent he fell to the floor shrieking in laughter i had hit him with the tickling jinx i quickly bound him with magical ropes and turned to find someone else to duel out of the corner of my eye i saw james dueling with a death eater and had i the time i would have been impressed with his skills i didnthave the time however as i heard drusa shout lily behind you i threw up a shield charm just in time and a red jet of light bounced off it i sent a spell back at the death eater but she dodged it easily soon we were engaged in a ferocious duel hexes jinxes and curses were flying around the room and the death eater i was fighting got hit in the back with one she crumpled to the floor revealing sirius grinning triumphantly you looked like you could use some help he yelled above the din i grinned my thanks before looking around the room for other death eaters i took hope when i saw that the order members seemed to be winning several death eaters were bound on the floor with invisible ropes my hopes vanished in an instant however when i heard a high cold voice i recognized only too well my my what have we here instantly the dueling ceased and the remaining death eaters moved gleefully to their master as the order members grouped together i felt james take my hand tightly as we all stood together facing voldemort for the third time in our lives and it was still as scary as hell well if it isntthe potters and the longbottoms he sneered eyeing the group too bad i didntkill you the last two times when i had the chance that a mistake i wontmake again my heart sank as voldemort unbound the rest of his followers we were outnumbered by quite a few and with voldemort present we were as good as dead i wouldntbe so sure of that frank said boldly and i turned my head sharply to stare at him in horror what was he thinking he had been in the order longer than most of us had he lost his mind oh really voldemort asked seeming highly amused i can kill you all in a second but that would be no fun i prefer to go one at a time as usual mudbloods first the death eaters laughed sadistically as everyone quickly made a protective circle around me then i saw what frank undoubtedly had a single scarlet phoenix feather was floating gently to the floor behind the death eaters that feather belonged to fawkes and could only mean one thing dumbledore donteven try to touch my wife james snarled gripping my hand even tighter he had seen the feather too voldemort laughed in that high cold cruel way he always did but he was cut off when a door burst open and several aurors poured through dumbledore came in last instantly chaos reigned i fought with a new ferocity throwing every spell i d ever learned at the death eaters their numbers were decreasing we were winning everything would be okay then it seemed that someone had put everything in slow motion i got my death eater tied up and turned to find another when i saw a jet of purple light erupt from a death eater want and hit tave squarely in the abdomen a look of intense pain crossed her face and she crumpled to the floor she laid facedown and motionless tave i screamed rushing over to her i just barely dodged a dueling pair not caring for my safety as i saw my best friend lying on the floor i knelt beside her and rolled her over blood was trickling out of her mouth and she was unconscious no tave no please wake up i begged i looked around frantic for help but no one else seemed to notice they were all busy fighting for their lives a spell came dangerously close to the unconscious tave and i knew i had to get her out of the way i carefully grabbed under her arms and began dragging her across the floor her head lolled to the side and i felt tears sting my eyes as i did my best to steady it this couldntbe happening no tave come on come on i murmured somehow i made it all the way into a corner of the room i hovered over her deflecting any stray spells that came our way i took hope when it looked like the battle was ending tave could get help it seemed like an eternity before the battle finally ended but in reality it couldnthave been more than five minutes voldemort and his followers disapparated when it became quite apparent that they were losing drusa i called out she was a healer in training she would know what to do drusa get over here now oh shit to the mother of merlin drusa exclaimed under her breath as she hurried over to where tave and i were remus was right on her heels what did she get hit with drusa demanded feeling for a pulse had i not been so worried i would have been impressed with how she was handling things she showed no emotion she was all business i dontknow i said my voice shaking terribly it was purple but i didnthear the incantation will she be okay remus asked his face pale i dontknow this doesntlook good drusa murmured more to herself than to anyone around her not good at all then louder we need to get her to st mungo right away someone conjured a stretcher and drusa levitated tave onto it and out of the room i stared after her worriedly trying desperately to hold back the tears that threatened to spill over at any moment james gently pulled me into his arms and kissed my forehead we ll go to st mungo in a minute he murmured in my ear seeming to read my mind i know you re worried for her is everyone here okay dumbledore cut in surveying everybody we all nodded in assent good he said wearily be careful all of you i know you re all concerned for tave but we canthave all of us clog up st mungo s it would seem very suspicious but i have to go i exclaimed almost in a panic i have to see her me too remus said firmly dumbledore surveyed us for a moment with his kind blue eyes and they lingered a moment on remus emotion filled face dumbledore eyes were tinged with sympathy and a heartbreaking sadness that i had never seen before from him he had always been so strong the fearless leader that we all looked up to now he seemed like a very tired old man yes i think it would be alright for you two and james to go i going too and no one telling me otherwise sirius declared loudly folding his arms across his chest she my cousin yes that fine dumbledore replied count me in alice said immediately frank shook his head at her but she glared at him she been my friend for years it always been us four i not going to sit around while she in st mungo s she said forcefully that true dumbledore said seeming slightly distracted that makes six then i think that should be fine james sirius remus alice frank and i all apparated to st mungo without a word to each other the six of us strode into the lobby and drusa was waiting for us there i couldntquite pinpoint the look that was on her face but it didntseem to be a very good one come with me she said escorting us past the welcome witch we went to the fourth floor and down a long corridor to a waiting area we have to wait here for the time being we wontbe allowed in for awhile she said i noticed that even though outwardly she seemed calm and collected inwardly she was just as worried as us if not more so as she had a better grasp on the seriousness of the situation i looked at her ready to ask a question but she seemed to have anticipated it we dontwork on those we have an emotional attachment to she said matter of factly to be quite honest i dontthink i could handle being in her room right now i dontsuppose there anything for us to do but wait james said awkwardly after a short pause no one responded we were far too worried to an hour passed before drusa went to check on what was happening seeing as she was a healer in training no one had a problem with her being around she returned close to tears how is she remus asked in a strangled voice she shook her head sadly and bit her lip not good they dontknow what incantation was used so there not much they can do at this point sirius pulled her to him and held her murmuring something in her ear a few moments passed then a healer came out to talk to us you are all friends of octavia meliflua he asked looking at us one by one we nodded i afraid i have to be quite honest with you things are not looking good for her at all the incantation used on her has caused massive internal bleeding we ve tried just about everything to stop it but nothing has worked we ve been giving her blood replenishing pills for the time being but those just arentenough the incantation was an extremely powerful one and right now it doesntlook like she will make it through the night my stomach plummeted at the healer words and remus let out an odd sound halfway between a choke and a sob this couldntbe happening it just couldntbe sir may we please see her i asked fighting the tears that were burning my eyes he hesitated a moment but i think he was touched by how upset we all were and nodded for just a few minutes we filed into tave room which was already full of healers and trainees oh tave i murmured as i got a glimpse of her deathly pale face she was still unconscious the healers surrounding her bed moved aside to make room for us i could feel my heart break as i saw remus take her hand in his and stroke the engagement ring on her finger this wasnthow it was supposed to be they were supposed to be happily planning their wedding they were supposed to get married and make lots of little taves and remuses that played quidditch just like their mum it wasntsupposed to be like this i couldnttake it anymore and fled to the waiting area as tears flowed in torrents down my cheeks i pressed a shaking hand over my mouth trying not to make any noise lily baby come here james had followed me and gently pulled me towards him he held me in his strong arms while i cried sirius drusa frank and alice joined us soon after saying remus was staying by tave bed drusa and alice were also in tears several more hours passed i not quite sure how many it was some time after four in the morning when remus joined us in the waiting area and the look on his face told me everything she gone he said softly not looking at any of us she woke up for a brief moment and said that she loved me and then his voice broke and tears fell slowly down his face he couldntfinish his sentence but none of us neither expected nor wanted him to if my heart had already felt like it had been ripped in two now it felt as if someone had torn it out of my chest thrown it on the ground and thoroughly stomped on it tave my best friend since our first year at hogwarts was dead i was never going to see her again i was never going to talk to her again the pain and grief in remus face only doubled my own he loved her so much and she was gone i pulled out of james arms and walked into remus i held him as tight as i could it wasntfair really remus had so much grief in his life already he was a werewolf and the consequences of that were immense he deserved to be happy and he was happy with tave tave was my best friend but remus loved her more than life itself it just wasntfair that she had to be taken away he didntdeserve it i felt so bad for him a huge sob racked his body and i felt myself give a gut wrenching sob as well oh remus i so sorry i whispered through my tears hugging him even tighter if that was possible i am so so sorry sirius joined us tears streaming down his face as well the three of us held each other and james drusa and alice joined us a moment later we all stood there for a long time holding each other and crying together we all knew when we joined the order that were putting our lives at stake what we didntknow however was just how hard it was to pay the ultimate price a n terribly late yes and i very sorry about that disappointingly short yes but i not so sorry about that this is how i had written it in its original form last summer it was one of those chapters that i had planned right from the start and i didntreally want to touch it i like it how it is the next chapter is also one i have already written i dontknow how long it will be but whatever the length i will get it up as soon as possible from that point on i dontreally know how far apart my updates will be school out yes but that also means that i now have a job a family a boyfriend and several other friends that all demand attention i writing fervently in the little spare time that i have so i beg you to forgive me and to not give up on this story i going to forego the review responses so i can get this up tonight i thank all of you who bear with me through my unsatisfying excuses and chaotic life to bring this note to a conclusion i ll try to have the next chappie up as soon as possible of course we all know what happens whenever i say that looks around guiltily disclaimer not mine never has been never will be i can only dream chapter 41 spreading the news it was not an easy task to keep james quiet about my pregnancy for the allotted three weeks he nearly let it slip several times and the news was only saved by me accidentally stepping on his toe i dontknow why he just had to tell everyone right away but i figured it had to do with some sort of male assertion thing maybe the whole idea that he could successfully reproduce or something i dontknow but anyway i did manage to keep him quiet for three weeks right after the time was up however he told anyone who d listen the first of course being the marauders and james being james had to do it his way in retrospect i should have seen it coming too we had been married for a year and i should have known he d have his own way of doing it but alas i did not maybe it was the hormones but i digress he invited sirius remus and peter over to our house for dinner i naturally trusted none of them in the kitchen so i insisted on cooking for them the ensuing conversation was one of the most memorable between the five of us absolutely not i said when i saw the boys pulling out all the pots pans and cooking utensils i had in my possession i will not have you four destroying my kitchen aw you re no fun lily sirius whined we re good cooks i rolled my eyes and i dumbledore beard i said as i took a pot out of sirius hand sorry boys but i ll be the only chef tonight james leaned against the counter and eyed me i dontthink i going to let you he said folding his arms you need to be careful you know oh honestly james i said as i took the pot out of his hands and went to fill it with water cooking a meal is hardly what i d call dangerous but still he insisted prying my fingers from the pot i had just removed from sirius possession he moved me over slightly so he could begin filling it with water from the sink what if you spilled boiling water on yourself merlin james i exclaimed i not an invalid somebody gotten a little overprotective remus butted in looking slightly suspicious and i promptly shut my mouth i wasntgoing to accidentally let slip that i was pregnant sure the three weeks were up but i was still a little nervous about the whole thing i decided to let it go and not make a big deal out of it fine you four can cook yourselves dinner but you re also going to be doing the dishes i said james grinned at me and kissed me on the cheek i knew you d see it my way he said mischievously and i just gave him a wry smile the night continued and those four boys certainly did make a mess out of my kitchen but james made sure they cleaned the kitchen for me and although they were rather shotty with their household cleaning charms the effort was enough to make me happy after their work was done sirius being sirius decided it was time for drinks got any firewhisky he asked as we began seating ourselves in the living room that like asking if a dragon has scales i commented dryly a marauder without firewhisky is no marauder spoken like a true marauder wife james said fondly i ll go get some he returned within a few moments and i gave him a quizzical look when i saw he had five glasses with him i was even more puzzled when he filled one and handed it to me james love you know i cantdrink this i said handing it back to him i canthave alcohol sirius remus and peter all stared at me you canthave alcohol remus asked his eyes narrowing i knew he was putting two and two together and making four why not sirius asked not quite as quick to catch on as remus peter just looked at everyone dumbly i glared at james completely sure he had done this on purpose the twinkle in his eye only cemented my belief james potter i growled dontlook at me like that they were going to find out anyway the three weeks is up he exclaimed find out what sirius was clearly lost in our conversation but maybe i still not ready for anyone else to know i shot back completely ignoring his question for anyone else to know what sirius asked again looking from me to james and back again it been over a month james replied you wontbe ready to tell anyone until after the fact that not true i defended myself trying as hard as i could not to cry it wasntworth crying over he was right his allotted three weeks were up yet i still had the overwhelming urge to cry i dontmean to be rude but would somebody tell me what the bloody hell is going on sirius cut in james and i stared at him we had somewhat forgotten that there were three other people in the room after a moment of silence i took a deep breath to speak you re going to stop using language like that i said firmly though not looking in anyone eyes i wonthave you saying things like that around the baby so you d best get out of the habit now that goes for the rest of you too there was dead silence and i ventured a look into remus eyes a small smile had crossed his lips and i knew he had figured it out before i had even told him however it took sirius a moment to process what i had said a look of comprehension dawned on his face then pure excitement a baby he asked as in your baby i nodded feeling a bit excited myself sirius immediately jumped up from the couch and swept me into a huge hug a baby he exclaimed swinging me around in a circle oh i suppose i shouldntdo that he said setting me down quickly sorry i smiled trying to suppress a laugh it fine it wonthurt me or the baby i cantbelieve it he continued as though hardly hearing me you re going to be a dad prongs this is bloody brilliant er i mean it brilliant he amended a bit sheepishly when he saw my disapproving look sorry lily you have about seven and a half months to fix it or so i replied but let me tell you i not going to tolerate it from anyone around the baby yes ma am everyone chorused just think a dad sirius then went on that man had a one track mind when he got stuck on something i know james answered a hand flying to his hair i bet it ll play quidditch just as good as you remus put in and probably be just as much of a troublemaker james and sirius laughed and i think i was the only one who saw the brief look of pain on remus face i immediately felt slightly guilty i had forgotten what the news of our baby might do to him yeah and it ll be just as brilliant as lily sirius continued oblivious to his friend pain well maybe not not if it takes after james hey james exclaimed indignantly he gave sirius a playful shove which once returned was the beginning of a tussle on the floor i rolled my eyes muttering something along the lines of boys will be boys i turned to go into the kitchen to get something non alcoholic to drink hey remus want to help me in the kitchen he looked up at me seeming to snap out of a distant reverie what oh yeah sure we left the boys rolling around on the floor and peter looking on seeming somewhat confused i waved my wand towards the cupboard and a cup came flying out towards me which i caught easily i wasntexactly in the mood to do things the muggle way like i usually did i sorry remus i said rooting around in the refrigerator for something to drink what for he asked a bit too quickly you know what for i answered settling on the grape juice that had been slightly hidden in the back james and sirius arentexactly sensitive to what effects their words may have on others lily i fine he said and for the first time since we entered the kitchen i looked him straight in the eyes he was lying and we both knew it it okay to not be fine i replied quietly i dontreally know what else to say to you but i sorry dontbe he shrugged looking away it a fact of life i cantexpect you and james to not have kids it a part of being married it would be rather stupid of you to put your life on hold because you feel sorry for me i bit my lip but this time i failed at holding back the tears i know but i still feel badly i feel like we re almost flaunting our happiness in front of you it was rather insensitive of us lily i promise you that it okay he interrupted i want you two to be happy tave would be excited for you besides maybe one day he didntfinish his sentence but i knew exactly what he was thinking she d want you to move on and part of that is finding someone else to share your life with i said gently i saw a drop of water hit the floor at his feet and i knew i was going to lose it sorry he said roughly as i pressed a hand over my mouth to suppress the noise i was about to make i just hormonal i replied after a moment i turned away and got down another glass the muggle way after wiping my eyes grape juice remus mustered a half laugh yeah then i swear i heard him murmur women and their hormones the excitement of my friends helped boost my own confidence about the whole mother thing between james and sirius arguing with me over when the baby would fly on a broom for the first time and drusa and alice giving me ideas for decorating the guest room as a nursery i didntreally have time to be very worried that was i wasntworried until james brought up the fact that i had yet to tell my mother and his parents oh merlin i said feeling distinctly sick at the thought i forgot about that it not going to be that bad james said comfortingly i ll go with you if you want me to i sighed as i looked at myself in the mirror although i was only about a month and a half along my belly was noticeably larger well maybe it was wishful thinking but my pants really wouldntbutton they ll figure it out when we go for christmas anyway i bet i sure i ll have some sort of emotional breakdown my mum rather attuned to that sort of thing she knew my aunt was pregnant before my aunt even knew well do you want to wait until christmas he asked seeming to read my mind yes i answered immediately we ll tell your parents when we go to their house then too and so christmas came and james and i went to my mum house in the morning it really wasntas bad as i had thought it would be when i saw that petunia and vernon were there but they had their own surprise for me lily james it lovely to see you my mum said as we walked down the stairs we had apparated into my old bedroom which was the usual way to get to her house i almost stopped dead in my tracks when i saw her she had become very thin and pale she seemed almost sickly mum are you i began to ask but she waved a hand impatiently at me yes i fine she answered i just had a nasty cough for awhile but i doing much better i wasntconvinced but she turned around and escorted us into the living room where petunia and vernon were sitting looking all lovey dovey it made me want to vomit hello lily petunia smiled sweetly at me and i wondered what exactly she was about ready to gloat about she wasntgiven an opportunity at that moment as my mother was already handing out presents i found out not too long later though when petunia opened her gift oh mum it darling she squealed holding up a tiny white romper i thought white would be best since you dontknow whether it a boy or girl yet my mum said my eyes became as big as saucers as her words sank in my sister was pregnant lily i forgot to tell you your sister is going to have a baby due near the beginning of july my mum said turning to me i immediately forced a smile congratulations that wonderful i said trying to sound genuine i could feel james eyes boring into me as i then excused myself to the kitchen he followed soon afterwards lily i he began but i interrupted i not mad james i said not looking him in the eye i not even disappointed i just shocked that all the look he gave me was one of utter disbelief you know lying is generally not a good thing to do he replied i think that one lesson you re going to want to teach our child i rolled my eyes slightly irritated at his persistence i serious james i not mad at her having children is a part of life although i have to say the thought of her and vernon actually well erm i trailed off not wanting to think about it james gave me a rather disgusted look thank you very much for making me think about that he said giving a small shiver then he studied my face for a moment are you sure you re alright i bit my lip determined not to cry i really hated being pregnant in that aspect i cried over all sorts of little things fine i slightly disappointed that she goes and rains on my parade but i dontblame her really she doesntknow i not going to tell her either it wouldntbe very nice of me to rain on her parade he gave me his gorgeous smile and kissed my cheek that very nice of you but you have every right to tell them you re really an angel did you know that i sighed closing my eyes to keep the tears from falling yeah i do but i like to have you tell me once in awhile at that moment my mum entered the kitchen lily ev i mean potter come here right this instant i stared at her for a moment again struck by her sickly appearance what did i do now i asked more to humor her than anything else i really didntfeel like making any huge scenes her eyes narrowed as she studied me turn around lily slowly if you dontmind i had a sneaking suspicion what this was about but i really didntwant to tell her i knew she would tell petunia and then we would have a big problem on our hands i quietly acquiesced to her demand slowly turning on the spot what made you storm out of the room when i told you that petunia is expecting she asked shrewdly i didntstorm out i said clenching my jaw i was doing anything to prevent myself from crying i excused myself and came into the kitchen i was surprised is all i just needed to let the news sink in again my mother stared at me why are you going to cry i not i said but my voice shook slightly completely giving me away my mother crossed over to me and pulled at the waistline of my jeans well darling either you re just getting fat and are jealous that your sister actually has a reason to or you re pregnant too i closed my eyes but this time tears slipped through i dontwant to tell her i whispered she ll be mad at me and i just want to be happy i felt james arms snake around me from behind and i leaned into him i absolutely refused to look at my mum for a few moments and then i ventured a peek i wasntsure what i was expecting to see but it wasntthe big smile that was there i hadntseen her truly smile in a very long time i very happy for you she said james if you dontmind i d like to hug my daughter i stepped out of my husband arm and into my mother s and i was truly relieved i had half expected a tongue lashing about being much too young you dontthink i too young i asked tentatively wanting it to be done and over with if it was going to come you re a married woman she shrugged after letting me go you ve been married for over a year it your decision although i must admit i ll be happy to have grandchildren running around the house when is the baby due august i answered wiping my tears from my eyes can you please not tell petunia though she going to be mad at me she smiled again lily darling petunia been pregnant for a month longer than you have she ll just have to deal with it she going to figure it out anyway so we may as well tell her today i gave her a look that clearly said she was mental but james and i followed her back into the living room petunia and vernon i think lily would like you to know that she also has some very happy news i going to have another grandchild in august she stated very matter of factly moments after we had entered the room i had expected her to soften the blow slightly and apparently petunia thought it was a rather abrupt statement by the look on her face well i erm she spluttered at a momentary loss for words she seemed to be torn between two reactions and i was praying for the better of the two congratulations she said finally and i smiled weakly thanks i replied not able to believe we werentgoing to have a row especially with the hormones raging in both our bodies there now that wasntso difficult my mum said obviously pleased with herself come now let open the rest of our presents a n ducks as readers throw sharp and heavy objects in her direction i know i know it been 4 months i sooooo sorry i canteven express it i fail at life i know life has once again gotten in my way and my writing had to go on the back burner for
