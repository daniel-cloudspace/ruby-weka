juice thinking about all these things and now i thinking that i screwed oh hold on must add something to list of things to complain about father in prison check sister a bitch check mother insane check best friends getting together check am fat check about to lose boyfriend again check and finally have never been screwed am beginning to think i never should have told god to sod himself 9 00 a m but then c mon let think there is a bright side to all of this seriously there must be i mean jacques gets to be all happy and janine gets to be all happy and i i get to drown in a huge bucket of misery wait no no there will be no misery today i ve got to pull myself together and take charge and take control and and and get my groove back i mean supposing i ever had a groove because quite personally i dontremember ever having a groove can you have a groove you never knew about okay so after i knock back more of this odd tasting orange juice it definitely spiked but damn i think i immune i going to complete my list of things to accomplish if that doesntget me all back in shape well at least mentally i dontknow what will hold on while i check out what i have to do 9 12 a m okay so goal one is that i ve got to read some intellectual books no problem i ll just have to dig around in the attic and find some intellectual books hopefully ren e wonthave thrown them out she thinks most books are evil she has this theory that gutenberg was seduced by satan okay goal two lose ten pounds okay okay this i can do after all my mother s special friend is an aerobics instructor he worked wonders for her aah aah i take that back ewww what i meant to say was everyone in my family has lost weight and gotten fabulous so far stupid size one and a half ten percent body fat witches so why not me goal three was to meet up with janine again so big red check over there and now i can get the info on tristan and f nando and never see them ever again joy goal four cure my mother of her disease well that can be done in four easy steps put a stop to affair with aylesford bring dad back from prison make them re fall in love with each other and mum will be so cranky at dad constant doting that she will eventually revert back to her stressed out cursing ways i cantwait also return room to previous state of normalcy and steal self help books goal five spend quality time with grandm re and grandp re before they die of alcohol poisoning this is a definite can do situation i think i should stop stressing out by the end of this month i will be skinny and happy and normal and everything will be perfect and wonderful damn it yes quite so but first must go question jacques about the nature of intellectual books 9 45 a m shudder shudder have most mortifying image in my head now and it wontgo away damn damn damn should have waited until dinner to ask about intellectual books definitely bah went up to my room to see if i had any intellectual books still there and there was this huge shroud like thing just hovering over the floor which thank you comc i identified as an oh so deadly lethifold so naturally i just started screaming my head off like so aaaaaah i shouted running through the house like some sort of maniac headed straight for jacques room since i was going there anyway aaaaaaaaaaaahhh what is it he says all sleepily getting out of bed is it just me or did he sound oh so slightly not happy to see me because being myself i am appalled however i was far more appalled when i realized that jacques doesnt sleep in jeans and a t shirt which made me begin screaming even louder of course what the hell fleur i swear i am going to start counting the number of times he said that put it away put it away put it away i said jumping and screaming and pointing in a downward direction at jacques underwear what put on some pants no seriously what the hell fleur you pants need pants underwear mental scarring put on some freaking pants jacques just kind of stared at me for three seconds and then he went and he put on some pants so i could open my eyes but as if mental scarring like that can be cured just by some pants okay fine what were you screaming about in the first place he asked it has just occurred to me that jacques should be even more totally mortified than i am but he is weirdly calm must investigate this interesting oddity oh that i said having briefly forgotten the first reason i was having a monumental spaz there a lethifold in my bedroom there a lethifold in your bedroom jacques said in that deadpan holy wow fleur you must be kidding me voice of his mm hm i said nodding my head in enthusiastic agreement jacques looked like he was trying to figure out some huge colossal puzzle and you freaked out over my aaaaaaaaaaaaah do you have a disease no i just hate that word what word p aaaaaaaaaaaaah dontsay that word you need help he said finally well you needed pants i replied 10 34 p m so now we re all sitting down at the table eating a super late breakfast or early lunch if you prefer to think of it that way and i cantget this scarring image out of my head no seriously now it like i have x ray vision and every time i look at jacques it like all i can see is his underwear which is so screwed up of course does anybody else have this problem or is it only me alone in the universe with a picture of jacques underwear i am so sick but i was right he would make a good underwear model 12 noon jacques i am taking you shopping i announce beaming brightly in everyone general direction it just too bad that a jacques hates shopping b my six major credit cards are gone and c there are no wizard friendly shopping malls within like eight miles of here oh well oh god fleur please no says jacques oh crap he making the please have pity on me i haventeaten in six days my parents abuse me and at night i cry myself to sleep your generosity is the only thing keeping me from death so please donttake me shopping face it not fair how other people faces can say so much and all mine ever says is i look fat donti yes yes yes i say ignoring jacques with a smile we are going to walk to my favorite store or at least my favorite wizard friendly store in bordeaux oh god what is it he said like he was thinking i was going to say something horrendous like my favorite store was the happy meadows florist shop or the best damn aquariums period or something i smiled a maliciously deliciously wicked smile kind of like hee hee hee hee you re not going to like what you re about to hear but i will jacques continued to stare pleadingly at me you ll see i replied 2 45 p m i cantbelieve you brought me to a lingerie store groaned jacques staring ahead at the huge lovely sparkling sign that was before him beckoning to me the light from a lighthouse a beacon in a world full of darkness i cantbelieve you made me walk two miles to a lingerie store he said just as incredulously obviously unable to appreciate that drrty is not just a lingerie store it the best damn lingerie store period and he should just be thankful we re not buying aquariums come on stop complaining it not that bad i said resisting the urge to smack him club him over the head steal his wallet and sprint to the drrty girl lingerie section for a little personal shopping spree and you cantdeny the fact that you need new underwear briefs jacques tu ne sais pas que tu fais i sighed in sympathy i mean what else can you feel for a guy who wears briefs weirdly tight briefs jacques sighed about thisclose to getting upset there is nothing wrong with my under c mon i said grabbing his hand and making a mad dash towards the big red sign that said sale in humongous white letters sometimes jacques just needs to accept that at least in the underwear department i know best what you need i said turning briefly to him as we nearly crashed into the sign is a lot of boxers and when we get home we can burn all your briefs fleur i may just be hallucinating but i think we re in a lingerie store and you re talking about burning my underwear jacques said well what else are we going to do with them make papier m ch i briefly imagined a sculpture of jacques made up entirely of his underwear but that freaked me out too much and i erased it from my mind i blinked and then looked out hopefully in front of me looking somewhat like the man on the 40 year old virgin billboards and smiling at the wide expanse of what looked like heaven drrty boy sleepwear i smiled shaking my head in wonder it so dirty that they couldnteven spell it right fleur jacques said in that warning tone as if he was anticipating that i would get that wild look in my eye grab all his money and go dancing through the store in pure delight er which i would never do of course i dove right into my task picking up a pair of dark blue boxers and throwing them at him blue is your color i said tossing him two more pairs but then again i said overcome with the thrill of shopping and the smell of clothes so is black yeah sure fleur who is paying for all this he asked uncertainly standing before me holding one pair of underwear in his hand another draped over his shoulder and yet another one sitting on his head well we re going dutch of course i exclaimed pulling the pair of blue boxers off of his head and dragging him deeper into the store drrty girl and its affiliates drrty boy and the general drrty ness store are like the be all and end all to undergarments it like it like panties paradise or you know something like it and you know they sell other tr s drrty stuff too ooh heels you re buying shoes in an underwear store said jacques looking at me in that skeptical she may be insane kind of way noooo i buying shoes in an underwear emporium i corrected i picked up the purple box in eight and a half and squealed delightedly kitten heels jacques sighed no wonder you were voted most likely to be seduced by shoes jacques i said waving that thought away you need some cashmere underwear i headed due west you need a compass when you re in an underwear emporium and picked up a pair of gray boxers yes no jacques said it like he has an aversion to undies yes i said now jumping up and down you are insane fleur absolutely insane he said smiling faintly fine yippee you wontbe sorry now for some silk boxers two hours later we were standing in the checkout line with 23 pairs of underwear jacques looking as if he had no idea what had just happened and me with a humongous smile on my face drrty always has that effect on me and now my work is done i said smiling you ve got your boxers i ve got my heels and i gasped what i was seeing couldntbe real it was fleur my god what are you looking at now he was only bitter because the last time i gasped and stared like that he ended up getting eighteen pairs of silk boxers he followed my gaze no he said disbelievingly oh my god jacques it perfect it perfect it perfect i was staring at an absolutely beautiful matching bra and panties set by victoria secret it was like meeting god fleur i honestly think that after buying 23 pairs of underwear and a pair of shoes it would not be a good idea to get you victoria secret underwear but jacques i cried it lifts and separates i never want to hear you say that again and jacques i said trying out my own pitiable face i never told you this but it has always been my lifelong dream to own a matching bra and panties set fleur i think there a reason you never told me this replied jacques looking insanely uncomfortable like remus lupin loosening his tie turning magenta wow did she just say that uncomfortable i mean all my life jacques my bra and panties have never matched i sighed stop right there do you know how it feels to know that somewhere out there exists a cute little set just for you perhaps red with convertible straps and a push up yet with coverage and full support oh my god fleur jacques said by this time he looked like a beet but i was too lost in my reverie to notice but noooo alas it cannot be yours and you have to stand by wearing a black bra and blue underwear a black bra and blue underwear jacques do you hear me jacques sighed like he was in between a rock a hard place and an underwear emporium not today he said okay fine i said sullenly but i still getting the shoes 4 12 p m when we got back janine was sitting cutely on the sofa looking all cute and fabulous and wonderful damn her hey where have you guys been underwear shopping i said and i got heels did you get a matching bra and panties set she asked perched on the edge of the sofa looking at me with rapt attention the suspense was building no i frowned not today how long does a girl have to wait she said filled with indignation on my behalf see everyone but jacques understand this there nothing like a matching bra and panties set to make you feel fantastic she stood up giving jacques one of those looks god does everyone have a look did they give a look giving seminar at beauxbatons that i just missed or something that cruel and unusual punishment jacques she said but in a cute flirtatious way not a you suck jacques i hate you hate you hate you way that it would mean if i said it did i say damn her already he smiled and i got this crappy feeling kind of like i dontknow never mind okay jacques i said dragging him out of the line of fire you have to go try on your new underwear it has just occurred to me how weird that sounds jacques lingered a little bit and then went upstairs to try on his underwear god have got to find a new way to say try on underwear this left janine and i alone to talk janine giggled do you think he ll model it for us looks like the idea of jacques the underwear model has struck her too ewww janine that jacques you re talking about try to keep it pg s il vous pla t i said ewww if jacques and janine my god does the cuteness never end start going out she going to tell me every itty bitty detail jacques said this utterly sweet and adorable and romantic thing because he fantastic fleur you cant possibly understand and me thinking what the hell do you mean i cant possibly understand he been my best friend for eleven years damn it i know him better than you do and then she ll be like ooooh he so hot and sexy and i ll be sitting there having to listen to her thinking shut up shut up shut up joy how can anyone keep it pg when it comes to jacques she asked giving me sigh a look this sucks now she going to constantly going to be making nasty jacques references it going to be it going to be like oh my god let play the if you know what i mean game yep it going to be like the if you know what i mean game i haventplayed that in ages i said rather listlessly but then the thought of my favorite old beauxbatons game brought me around how can you not love a game called the if you know what i mean game but who are we going to play it on jacques that going to drive him crazy i said thinking about it briefly sure i smile thinking of all the times we used to play it on teachers in class every time they said something that sounded dirty we whispered if you know what i mean trying to beat each other to it our standing one day record for dirty phrases was 99 but that was at a field hockey game in london hello a game played with a stick and a ball how can you get under 50 okay let creep up on him and bug him to death until he says something dirty squealed janine no no no easy points if you yell at him watch and learn jacques i screamed jacques promptly came traipsing down the stairs fully clothed much to janine chagrin saying what he always says fleur damn it for the last time i just dontcome when you call me if you know what i mean janine and i jumped up and down and high fived each other in that childish join the club sort of way as if we were in some dinky special it was fantastic oh god not this game sighed jacques he has bad memories of this game unfortunately seeing as how it was always most fun to play it on him we could always get him to explain things to him and then just as he was getting all serious and everything we d both yell if you know what i mean and then he d stare at us and be like so i just explained cold fusion for nothing and then we d nod and he d be pissed i smiled it almost felt like we were a threesome again please no one say if you know what i mean but god knows that never lasts long enough 5 56 p m good god ren e is leaning over my shoulder in scary snooping mother fashion watcha doing she says wait did she lose more weight while i wasntlooking okay goal six bump off older sister i writing a letter to who jacques would have a fit he d be jumping up and down screaming to whom to whom and then smashing vases everywhere to dad why because i dontwant him to die in prison while mum shacking up with her interior designer i said turning around and shooting her a glare she just started laughing is this the typical reaction to a glare you think and then she started choking on her own laughter i took this as a sign that i should just let goal six run its course you think bwahahahahaha finally after i kicked her in the stomach she stopped laughing unfortunately fortunately she stopped breathing for twelve seconds as well will you help me help you what help me stop this horrible thing from happening to our family i screeched ready to take my favorite purple quill and jab in into her eye oh yeah sure what do you want me to do umm well you and aylesford you could i trailed off suggestively hoping my sister sick mind would do the rest what you know what you could s i said waggling my eyebrows encouraging my sister to guess the other letters she shook her head s e sell segment secondary school servants severus snape secular she said counting off s e words absently on her fingers s e d sediment sedan sedation s e d u ren e looked more confused than ever okay well i dontknow any words that begin with s e d u seduce him you could seduce him ren e smiled her evil annoying smile and pointed her little manicured finger at me hee hee i knew you d do that aaah will you do it i know she just plotting to drive me crazy with her annoying fake exercising and her belly dancing and her tall thin blondeness and her perfection that she just flaunting all over the place and now she going to lord this over me like she s she s her how much what holy knickers she is a prostitute i mean i d always guessed that she was because for some reason she always got so much more money than i do and because well look at her but whoa i dontknow how i feel about having my sister be a prostitute i have a feeling she wouldntbe very moulin rouge about it either and she doesntbring home any hot english writers if i do this for you what re you going to do for me she says because payment is apparently the first thing that comes to her mind shudders prostitutes i ll be your bestest bestest friend no this might just be humiliating for me as i seducing this aylesford she replied a little tiny smile she thinks i didntsee coming to her face i losing out on potential dates i mean that like one for every day i seducing him hell that like three for every day i seducing him i want three guys for every day i seducing him no fine like you could find three guys anyway she mumbled hey okay fine then how this i seduce aylesford and you have to go to your beauxbatons reunion whoa whoa whoa stop and rewind what beauxbatons reunion i refuse to see those people again i dontwant to see stupid nanette and fernando and tristan and all those people who hate me no and i dontwant to show up there all boyfriend less saying something like oh my boyfriend in london or something oh yes they ll totally believe me no i not going to the damn reunion no question i can do this by myself i ll just er um damn her damn her damn her i hate you here the invitation she smiled handing me a bright pink lacy edged square of paper as she pranced out the room probably singing rumplestiltskin is my name or something like that damn i dateless and doomed prostitutes ruin everything 7 00 p m it wontbe that bad says jacques handing me the pint of ice cream i requested oh yeah well if it not that bad please explain the junk food frenzy i sure your memory has just made this worse than it is hey my memory is fine i protest shoveling chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream into my mouth what did you have for breakfast yesterday asks jacques all logically i swear it like living with some kind of educator okay have definitely decided that prostitutes and former english tutors ruin everything objection on grounds of irrelevancy i said irrelevancy that a memory question and one you should be able to answer sh and who cantremember what they had for breakfast yesterday shh and it proves that you have a distorted and or not completely functional memory shhhhh i hissed at him dontbother insulting my fully functional memory i probably wontremember it anyway jacques just stared 7 45 p m am reading the invitation it specifically says tarts and vicars party but i am positive i have read this incorrectly because for what reason would we host a reunion how dumb is it to have a reunion after like a year where everyone looks like slut or vicar and what in god name is a vicar anyway have just had horrid vision of showing up in bunny costume with fat hanging out and bad whorish make up to find that everyone has changed their minds and decided that they d rather all be stuffy business people 8 00 p m jacques has just assured me that i not just seeing things it really does say tarts and vicars they probably think it funny he said i latched on to his arm jacques save me save me save me i cantshow up dateless and alooone they ll mock me and be cruel and wicked to me and then fernando will come up to me and look me up and down and be like ooh she let herself go and tristan will wonder what he ever saw in me and claudette and nanette will laugh and snicker and laugh and i ll cry by the punch bowl just like winter formal jacques help me no one going to laugh and snicker at you he sighed you re so paranoid you ll be fine noo but i ll go with you he said jacques snogging urges arose but i suppressed them and instead contented myself to dragging him off his butt and spinning him around in circle after circle after circle yay thank you thank you thank you it no problem but will you mind terribly if i dont dress up as a vicar he said stopping me and sitting me back down no of course not i smiled sigh here i thought he was going to take janine and i was going to be hopelessly alone but no parce que i can always count on my dearest darling jacques and now i ll beam brightly and scamper off to find something tarty day eighty four of free independence saturday april 11th 2005 my room 6 59 a m 6 59 a m all right so the date of the reunion is the 24th that thirteen whole days and i back in england in nineteen days so i have a little less than three weeks to get dad out of prison get mom and dad back together get mom back to normal er and probably some other things that i cantthink of right now as my mind is blank but right now the most important thing is find something tarty 7 34 a m you know as my sister is a tart she probably has something tarty doesntshe of course she must however i am still trying to figure out what i should wear if i simply must look like a tart and i am caught between filthy mad dominatrix and tr s slutty maid because as we have all undoubtedly learned from books and media maids are all tramps and sluts perhaps i shall be a milkmaid on the one hand filthy dominatrix perks 1 will probably get to have large whip with which to punish people i sorry that just makes me giggle 2 will get to wear inordinate amounts of black leather 3 will get to wear shoes far too tall sharp and pointy and that could possibly be used for punishing people giggle giggle 4 will probably have filthy dominatrix type name as can be found on freakish websites mistress something something mistress toad fang mistress naughty kittens mistress dirty possum 5 will get to wear dramatic wicked looking makeup 6 will get to scream all manner of things such as sit down did i say you could speak obey me and bow cheese boy bow 7 will get to name unimportant sex slave something demeaning such as cheese boy 8 handcuffs 9 this isntreally a reason but is it sick that i think it would be kind of cool for draco malfoy to be my sex slave i mean not so i could have sex with him but so i could whip him and call him cheese boy or monkey because it would really amuse me to call malfoy monkey or cheese monkey dance cheese monkey dance on the other hand slutty maid perks 1 i can whack things with my feather duster 2 instead of being demanding loud and bedecked in leather i can be flirty and dumb and being dumb is soooo much fun 3 i can wear fishnet hose 4 and a frilly short skirt 5 and say naughty french things all the time 6 and my favorite word can be oops 7 and i can pretend that i dontspeak english and make people try and speak french which is funny like when i was in america i kept on seeing these muzzy commercials that have this big monster teaching french or something and the girl in the video keeps on saying je suis une fille but if you went to france and said that people would assume you were a hooker or maybe i ll be an old fashioned slut with garters and tights and a bustier and such and then i can still wear a frilly short skirt and fishnet hose and my favorite word can still be oops and perhaps i shall find a way to punish people with my garters and then secretly call them cheese monkey behind their backs yes definitely 9 05 a m am now reading paper and am disturbed to find that harry potter favorite boxers still cannot be located good god what exactly can you do with a man boxers man i meant boy underage boy off limits stop thinking about that you nasty garter wearing malfoy whipping sex obsessed tart maybe this girl has an underwear fetish and is collecting men underwear men i meant boys or perhaps it is just a general obsession with harry and she wants to well i dontknow what would i do if i had harry boxers things i would do if i had harry lucky shamrocks 1 dance around in a merry circle around a large glowing bonfire shrieking yes yesss in manner of herbal essences commercial 2 imagine harry in them and then imagine harry without them and then imagine harry in them 3 check the label wonder where he could have gotten them go out shopping to buy him some more underwear and then at the checkout realize that i am not harry potter girlfriend and i should not be buying him underwear 4 i d try them on i nasty i know 5 i d see if there were some sort of wicked restricted spell i could use to make him love me but then who wouldn t 6 hold them ransom and send him a threatening yet sexy note informing them that either he agrees to become my lover or i ll burn his underwear if refuses will not burn underwear but instead content myself to keeping them and doing the above five things i am tempted to go on a sleuthing mission to find harry boxers i betting i could write a best selling novel about it too fleur delacour and the quest for the shamrocks or perhaps fleur delacour and the boy who lived to lose his pants i can see it now me racing across the world on a mission of top international secrecy i d be a secret agent with fabulous shoes and oversized chanel glasses and a gun because though avada kedavra is effective and all i d rather kill people with a gun i d have listening devices and a gps and a top notch broom and i d send secret messages saying things like agent fd89 here over the undies have been found repeat the undies have been found and then i d get an award from the ministry not too much to ask for order of merlin first class i mean after all a girl who can retrieve harry drawers from the hands of evil deserves a little bit more than a pat on the back i dare say 10 45 p m ah there an owl flying in an owl flying in mail i have got mail i promise it isntcompletely my fault that i am obsessed with getting mail it only that wouldntyou feel alone and excluded if people didntwant to talk to you if the only people that contacted you were asking you to buy their magical elixir and referred to you as current resident wouldntyou desperately crave a letter addressed to you and only to you and besides there something about the mystery of opening a letter unsure of what within it except my problem is that i forever reading through the envelope because i cantwait but my point mail 10 58 p m it was a note from dad thank goodness he has not died at the hands of evil singaporean gum hating wardens he wrote to say dear flurry pie i was touched by your concerned letter but i need you to know that i am fine i have convinced the wardens that i meant no harm by chewing gum in the streets and was not aware of the need to make a formal request i think they will be letting me out in about a week with just a fine and now a message for your mother my darling wife love of my life you cannot know what great sorrow it has caused me to be apart from you every day i am not in the presence of your radiance and sparkling personality i wither every last one of my creaky arthritic bones in my bones calls for you i miss you my love here praying you have not forgotten our anniversary end of message fleur i cannot wait to see you love your father good thing to know some things never change can you say doting mum worshipper and chances are she has forgotten their anniversary because she hasnttalked of it once i am beginning to wonder if there is some serious polyjuice going on here because usually she would be harping on and on i dontwant another crap anniversary gift from you two this year this year i want a dinette set 2 13 p m you know fleur i think we ought to have a big huge talk exclaims janine happily as if big huge talks are the cause of everything good and fabulous in the world when truly big huge talks are usually the bringer of the apocalypse for an instant i fear she is going to tell me something enormous and life altering like that she is my long lost twin or that she is secretly a man named cheese monkey but then she says you know like a big catching up talk after all it been a year and this is true we must get to know each other again and play games and read trash from the athena o hereagall romantic book club and stuff our faces with calorie filled junk food and laugh uproariously at everything all right definitely i agree thinking of high calorie junk food admittedly i should be concentrating on losing ten pounds but it so much more fun eating junk food than it is not eating junk food 2 58 p m truth or truth asks janine the question that leads to the most essential game of friendship ever because truth or dare is so tr s pass and because we are simply too lazy to think up dares we play truth or truth where the only rule is to tell the truth and admit it that rule is pretty hard to forget right oh let me see this is a hard one i say feigning indecision how about truth how nervous are you about the beauxbatons reunion she asked it was one of those questions you only asked when it was secretly only not so secretly a question that reflected on yourself nervous out of my head i replied reaching for a potato chip i mean i haventseen these people in over a year i ve forgotten what they re like but i remember a majority of them hate me and are going to judge me like the instant i walk in the door how much does that suck and then fernando i might kill him you know how you hate someone and then you dontthink about them for awhile and then you think you re over hating them but then you see them again and the stabbing stabbing stabbing urges return kind of like when you have a crush on someone and you tell yourself you re over them and then you dontsee them for a while but then when you finally see them you realize you ve forgotten how hot they are and how fabulous and all the crush ness comes flooding back no she totally not talking about jacques yes i said sipping my diet coke that exactly what i mean would this be the time to come out and say something in the vein of why in god name do you insist on pursuing jacques or would she take out a huge knife and scream possessive best friend possessive best friend because that what i d do okay my turn your favorite orlando bloom orlando bloom like he looks in elizabethtown but how he talks in pirates of the caribbean smiled janine and then we both sat and smiled at the thought of ber british orlando bloom whispering sweet dirty nothings into our ears day eighty nine of free independence thursday april 16th 2005 random costume shop 10 12 a m 10 12 a m i currently standing in some random costume shop you would be amazed at how many tarty outfits you can find in random costume shops so do you think standard tart mm hm classic tart definitely says janine agreeing with me classic tart as in classy yet whorish moulin rouge tarts with fantastic heels and slutty makeup squee classic tart squee 10 13 a m am now absently wondering why janine does not feel the need to purchase her self a tart outfit hey janine why no costume we re all not beautiful people like you fleur she sighed with this totally un seventh year janine like tone that suggested some sort of antipathy jacques word i only guessing what it means or something super revealing clothing doesntbode well for us since when is this us versus them and since when did we stop being us ah bah humbug why do things have to change when they used to be so good 2 00 p m baaaaaaaah beautiful people screw her 2 34 p m aaaaaackkkk she can die she can just die why is she so mad and emotionally distant and screw her screw her screw her gah i hope she burns in the depths of the depths of well the depths of her mental insanity that what she can do fricking us versus them theories and resentful comments i hope she dies damn switch bitching on and off friend 4 19 p m jacques wants to know why i am so tr s piss mais i do not want to talk about it right now whole fricking way home she was all sigh and then she d shift in the seat and then sigh switch bitch stupid idiot doesntshe realize nasty folds of fat that are going to hang out of ridiculous costume 5 13 p m jacques still wants to know why i so piss why is he so involved doesnthe have something better to do like tone his perfect biceps no one has perfect biceps like that naturally i know it or tighten his perfect ass because i know no one no one no one has a perfect ass like that naturally except maybe harry hee hee wait we re getting off track here arentwe 6 48 p m what is wrong with me i should forgive that one comment it only one comment yeah i dontwant to i too bitter orange juice yes definitely day ninety of free independence friday april 17th 2005 jumping up and down screaming squee squee 9 17 a m 9 17 a m dad back portly happy mother doting him and all yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay 9 19 a m and now he fainted from exhaustion 9 21 a m and now mum has waltzed in with a floating scented candle in front of her hoping to improve the aura of the room 9 30 a m and i ve just realized i haventseen ren e or aylesford in a two days damn she does her job well 9 45 a m there is giggling coming from the attic but i am not going up there because ren e is doing what she has been bribed to do and that is none of my business 10 00 a m though i getting a bit annoyed and disturbed 10 05 a m and she not being very discreet 10 30 a m aah here she comes now ren e delacour with aylesford no one cares what his last name is trailing behind her two disgustingly fit people making eyes at each other ren e is probably thinking god this is easy and aylesford is probably thinking i really want to do that again what a lovely world we live in 12 noon this is so pathetic but i actually out for lunch with ren e she going on and on and on about how aylesford does his business and about how she going to be part of their new marketing campaign and how it all so fabulous and i thinking do i have friends besides jacques i mean because i had all these friends at beauxbatons who i dontsee anymore and the only person left over from my school days is jacques i am ever so slightly screwed i need a posse no entourage clique coterie hm i just need friends that arentjacques otherwise i going to be a sad and lonely creature when i get back to hogwarts where jacques will not be as he inevitably always is practically living with me so it turns out that he been like in love with me since the day he saw me and he actually said that can you believe he actually said that it was so tr s fantastique and then she continues to talk but i have no idea what she saying because i am choosing not to pay attention to her i am instead absently thinking about tristan fernando and my underwear not in the same thought of course black bra blue underwear what sacrilege i canteven and so now we re getting married 12 30 p m i ve just spat up my coffee all over myself in the manner of a three month old child who will probably be stunted from drinking coffee come to think of it married i thought you were supposed to sleep with them not marry them it going to be a very long expensive affair so it ll have to be next year of course she says brushing back her hair in her cute little way just oh so casually and it fully coincidental that the light just happened to catch the skating rink on her finger what the hell is growing on your finger i shouted incredulously after my little coffee vomiting affair my ring silly she laughed her tinkling bitchy laugh you dontthink i d say yes without a ring do you you ve known him like a day what in god name is wrong with you ren e shook her head no you ve known him for like a day remember i was here in november and december and january i got to learn various important things about aylesford like his personality and his kindness and his bank account she said thoughtfully i realize that he is the kind of guy i want to marry she sighed happily seven figures i gaped at her oh and it funny fleur how you thought he and mom were having an affair we were laughing about you the other day you re so amusing she like twenty years older than him he twenty eight you know more gaping it going to be lovely but i want to walk down the hall to shut up he mine by the weird sisters i not sure aylesford would go for that but i can make him do anything there was a brief silence before magically ren e connected her last thought to he surprisingly limber you know you re trying to kill me you are trying to kill me i have something to give you before you go she said in her by the way manner an aneurysm you know what i ll just mail it to you i ll be too busy thinking about my gown to remember to give you anything oh and i thinking of lime green bridesmaid dresses she said a wicked glint in her eye retro chic dontyou think 1 12 p m on couch with ren e you do know that mum will shoot you you know i know but then she ll remember how much this guy is being paid and be thankful soooo thankful and dad i asked like he ll care he ll agree with mum once she agrees with me she smiles at the phenomenon of her always getting what she wants 1 20 p m mum has walked into room zen like in a flowing robe and carrying a pot filled with potpourri i have decided not to be fearful of her wrath seeing as now she is like buddha mom ren e has just stood up looking dare i say elegant and respectful which is so ruined by the voice in which she says mummy i getting married mum drops the pot what the hell yesss she said hell her face goes all red and her eyebrows go arched then narrowed and i see the classic now you ve done it face that i ve seen so many times before what in god name are you thinking you putain d enfer what is wrong with you i going to tear your hair out strand by strand until you listen to me yessss violence but mummy i love him i dontgive a i love him i love him i love him ren e whininess is not helping the situation but i honestly dontthink she cares about whether or not she has anyone approval i locking you up i always knew you d grow up like this i knew it irrational and irresponsible and god you make me old you re going going to a nunnery a nunnery i getting married married to aylesford and there not a damn thing you can do about it ren e shouted passionately as if she were calling to the heaven in a theatre one of those horrid coming of age things followed by a dance number aylesford hissed my mother one of those deathly quiet things that just alerts you to the fact that the worst is coming you re marrying an aerobics instructor mother i marrying into a fortune a limber gorgeous fortune at this i giggled discreetly i mean limber gorgeous fortune shut up i dontwant to hear your voice for a month i need to go drink she said sounding like her old self again i dontcare if you re marrying a millionaire wrong then what said my mother turning around in the doorway murderous she looks delightfully murderous ren e smiles as she seals the deal ten zeroes 2 12 p m i cant believe she won mother being a bitch about the wedding horrible and sour and ren e being horrible as well but dad back and ren e going to be off our hands and mum back the way she should be success day ninety four of free independence tuesday april 21st 2005 bouncing happily with newspaper 7 28 a m 7 28 a m because jacques insists that i learn about current events i am sitting well bouncing really on my bed reading the daily prophet witch weekly and the snitch report a tabloid that sounds like a quidditch magazine on the daily prophet cover there some wizard who has discovered a new and rare species of dragon living in the netherlands but if you turn to page 4 there the more gossipy news about wizard celebrities and the stuff that rita skeeter writes on page four there is nothing but harry harry and more harry the papers are very in love with harry this is completely not fair as he looks so damn cute flying around on his broom as he wins his quidditch game wiping a bead of sweat from his sexy brow and smiling at hermione his girlfriend gaaaaaaaaah i want her to die but i shouldntbecause he not mine damn jacques should not give me newspapers 7 44 a m am now seething at the snitch report cover story couple of the year couple of the year harry and hermione the entire dumb magazine is filled with pictures of harry and hermione eating lunch together smiling adoringly at each other at quidditch games together studying in total cuteness together and being generally lovely to each other and for some reason the wizarding world is eating this up because they fight crime together and still have time to tend the blossoming flower of their love and they are happy to know that she is not the scarlet woman she apparently was back when she was with victor krum excuse me must pause for hatred how in god name does she land harry potter and victor krum they describe her as the cleverest witch to walk the wizarding world harping endlessly over her fantastic grades and then they re like with her amazing brilliance this witch can do anything and with her womanly figure perfect complexion and youthful vitality she won the heart of the world most coveted seventeen year old quidditch player seventeen he legal gaaaaaaaaaaaaaah 7 52 a m jacques felt compelled to throw himself out of his bed and wander over to my room as he heard me shrieking and the sound of magazines hitting the wall good god fleur what going on in here since i was too consumed with fury and frustration i could only screech womanly figure i ll show you womanly figure after which i viciously beat page 22 of the snitch report with my fist until jacques forcibly dragged me away from my bed have you been possessed asks jacques turning me around and staring at me in a sort of should i hold you at an arms length kind of way no i said breathing deeply in manner of annoying video pilates instructor kathy or cathy i briefly searched my mind for some excuse for my behavior and then realized just how hard it is to find a non crazy sounding justification for screaming ferociously and clawing at hermione picture have you read about the couple of the year he guessed you and the rest of the world you re trying to make me crazy i said jacques smiled and shook his head you already are fleur he said you already are 9 29 a m i dontunderstand why everyone so freakishly obsessed with them i said sitting in the library with jacques who has removed the newspapers and magazines from my possession i mean seriously they re like pre breakup brad and jen mm hm whatever fleur says jacques pretending as if he knows what i am talking about which he should if he is as up to date on current events as he says he is but apparently they re very private about their relationship i said thinking that perhaps my spy mission should not be to find harry shamrocks but instead a quest to find detailed information on the harry hermione love fest however that can always be remedied by doing some hogwarts snooping and listening carefully to the whisperings of the secret staff grapevine yes yes fleur says jacques sounding serene as ever i sure grapes are a fantastic remedy are you listening to me oh well i like grapes he replies well i ll take that as a no 4 00 p m gaaaaaah i am dashing around my room with bundles of stuff trying desperately to stuff things into two suitcases having realizing that half the things i am packing are things that i did not come with oh what is it now fleur this is jacques who is probably standing on the stairs too afraid to enter the land of no return clothes well yes you have clothes trails jacques trying to discern my problem packing oh i see says jacques would you like some help my clothes wontfind in the suitcase well why are you packing now because i leaving in nine days jacques what do you think sorry just asking gaaaaaaaaaah 9 23 a m am taking an early night but cannot get to sleep because of outrageous and incredibly sweet pictures of harry and hermione somewhere in jacques room see i know they re there and because i know they re there i cannot rest 9 28 a m they should be burned 9 45 a m and i should sleep 9 57 a m i desperately need to sleep but i cantbecause i am insane 10 00 a m maybe jacques is right after all jacques is always right i definitely crazy oui je suis tr s fou 11 00 a m sleeeeeeeeeeeeeep day ninety seven of free independence friday april 24th 2005 pondering over what day it is 2 19 a m 2 19 a m day of reunion i m dead dying dying 5 23 a m it not even a what am i going to wear thing it worse it a i descending into a pit of vicious crocodiles disguised as human beings i know what i going to wear i just dontwant to wear it in front of them come to think of it 5 54 a m am freaking out and damn it i cantfloo janine because she hates me and now that she hates me i can no longer trust her merde 7 34 a m jacques might freak out if i ran into his room screaming again isntthere some kind of self help book on this why canti remember my essential teachings witches are from mars doesntdiscuss this witches in relationship ditches doesnteither that why i cantremember my essential teachings they were never actually taught to me damn damn damn that that one self help book i actually need right now has not yet been written 9 56 a m head practically in breakfast cereal with stress ren e and mother are arguing over how much to spend on the dress jacques is laughing at supposedly brilliant political cartoon mocking ministry dad is recounting the saga of the wicked people in singapore i am dying inside my head 10 00 a m hey fleur says jacques looking up from total brilliancy of these new political cartoons are you all right thank you for noticing that i ve been dying inside my head for the past eight hours no oh oh 12 noon walked into the parlor so that i could inconspicuously faint on one of the couches and not move until seven thirty but when i entered the room ren e and aylesford were already there feeding each other breakfast so then decided that fainting on the bathroom toilet was just as well and then i was mercilessly surprised by an unwanted floorgasm and decided to just drop down and sit by the bathroom door and bemoan my existence 4 24 p m ren e is standing over me but i going to pretend she not there shouldntyou be getting ready about now doesntit take you like four hours to get ready for a two hour event mmble mmm hmmm snuffle hm okay someone woke up on the wrong side of the broomstick today trills ren e for some ridiculous reason not leaving me alone you know what how about i ll help you get ready why i ask suspiciously raising my head from the fetal position i d been in as thanks for what if she thinks i going to trust her that easily she has another thing coming ren e grins for leading me in the direction of seven figures a ring the size of a small south american country and a wedding to rival all others for the next century or so and aylesford a nice treat too i groaned and stood up fine 7 30 p m three hours later i am ready and looking my sluttiest moulin rouge makeup moulin rouge hair and the all important moulin rouge outfit there says ren e after working her magic which involved an extensive and very complicated spell to make my hair stay up you re fantastic i mean yes you ll still continue to be shown up by me your entire life but when you re not with me i sure people will call you fantastic i beamed at the sort of half compliment half is better than nothing when it comes to my sister and me i take a deep breath and scamper downstairs to where jacques is waiting in his tuxedo i think honestly he just asking to get shagged in that tuxedo how do i look i ask twirling my tartiness around tarty he says i mean not tarty in a bad way tarty in a good way i mean not that tarts are good tarts are bad but you re a good tart i mean not that you really are a good tart it just that you look good i take a stretch and dash downstairs at the sound of ren e screaming leave already and hope for the best as i walk out the door come on i sighed i about to dive into a pit of hatred i need an escort jacques laughed fleur you are an escort 8 00 p m okay it time to walk in the event is being held on the second floor of a lovely hotel that jacques and i have just apparated into after about half an hour of wondering where this hotel is as i did not bring the invitation with me it quite lovely the room which you can see from outside through the windows all lights and sparkles and an enormous punchbowl but you see there one small problem no one is dressed as a tart i look at jacques and jacques looks at me fleur he says resolutely we ve been had 8 30 p m have had to rush home and find replacement outfit i suppose this is why janine didntpurchase a costume i suppose i was the only one who got a letter that said tarts and vicars instead of black tie 8 45 p m now i ve fallen into the what am i going to wear trap again 9 00 p m you look fine i promise jacques assures me he assures me of this despite the fact that i am wearing ren e dress and struggling to breath as she is now a size one and a half how i fit even my thigh into this dress i shall never know ack i suppose it really time to go in now er all right day ninety nine of free independence sunday april 26th 2005 pondering over reunion 10 23 a m 10 23 a m all right it wasntthat bad i mean yes we all got viciously drunk and yes because of the tightness of ren e dress i couldntbend over and yes fernando was drunk as usual and started being his lewd nasty self again however jacques did get to punch his lights out and then i got to stand over him singing can you hear the drums fernando so it was all right except for the hangover the hangover sucks 12 noon mum is so busy arguing with ren e over the amount of money to be put into flowers that she doesnteven have time to ask how the reunion went yay i all packed and ready to leave for london a whole five days early and so now they re kissing me off and saying goodbye and a whole lot of i ll miss you type things and jacques is saying that he ll see me soon which i believe because we always inevitably end up living with each other and ren e has just told mother to go die in a ditch but she still waving me off with the hand she not flicking the world off with and daddy saying his lovely goodbyes and that he ll write me everyday now that the singaporeans arentforbidding him to write more than once a week and so my only worry is erm when i get back exactly what am i supposed to do about harry a n you are an escort that something i said to my friend liz last week actually but she walked right into it unfortunately i wontbe able to update for quite a while as i inordinately busy but i ll do my best your reviews keep me from going off my rocker i really appreciate them oh gee i wonder if i being enough of a suck up filling out too many applications will do that to you i suppose i volunteer because i looooooooooove helping people not for any other ulterior motives at all anyway please review and hopefully i ll be able to get the next chapter more underwear related plotlines actually up soon much love femme teriyaki may in his pants day one hundred four of free independence friday may 1st 2005 may day safely tucked away in hogwarts 7 58 am 7 58 a m looks like i back back to a world of asp pumpkin juice potions with snape the irrepressibly obscene malfoy harry potter and my boyfriend michael and it looks as if i have been free and independent for over one hundred days i wish i d had a 100 days of free independence party and it looks as if as if well it looks as i am bored and late late for potions and therefore life as we know it is restored to its natural order 8 12 a m well it good to see that a month hasntchanged snape one bit he still my snappy snape snifflekins that for sure cranky and grumpy and ungrateful and greasy i arrived and he glared at me you re late get out the cauldrons and give them to the students i blinked at him for a second with an i delighted to see you too look on my face and then obediently did as i was told and now i am finished with performing my potions assistant duties so i am perched on one of the unused tables doing as i always do taking notes fleur notes what in god name am i going to do about harry i mean i shall have to see him in asp practically every blasted night and that sure to be awkward now that there that whole kissing thing and he must think that i am stalking him or something i didntreally get to catch his expression after i kissed him because i was too busy sprinting off in another direction so how do you reverse an impression that has been building for five months of being an insane fan girl and michael and i are back together now and there is no way in hell that i am screwing this up it is just not going to happen we re going to have lovely conversations at breakfast lunch and dinner and go on fantastic and lovely romantic dates and be golden couple number two and i am going to be happy with what i have instead of being the lust mountain that i am i have got to realize that what i feel for harry is nothing but but but a huge pile of lustification and if there is no justification for my lustification then the lustification must end 9 00 a m there a class of sixth years in here now and they re positively glowing over the snitch report i think we re so lucky to know them they re so cute together says one are you kidding me i hate her i wish i were harry girlfriend says the other oh join the club you know she says conspiratorially i ve heard yes yes what have you heard i ve heard that they re having problems she says stretching out the word problems so that it sounds extra serious there is a smattering of whispers and gasps and general excitement within the cluster of gossiping girls apparently she losing her patience with him i mean sure it something you could stand when he just your friend and constantly in danger and you know you ve got to hold on to him because he might die the next day she says but all that drama was last year and there are lesser things to worry about when it comes to the danger and all that i mean it was something she could stand then all the girls are nodding on and on as if this is the gospel and i just waiting for this girl to get to the point but hello it not as if she can keep him around forever it not as if he doesntget mail every day from girls far more attractive than she is asking no begging to be his girlfriend and then it not as if she could ignore the problem of his missing boxers the girls giggled i mean how is he supposed to explain that hmmm maybe i dontneed to go on a sleuthing mission to find harry lucky shamrocks maybe hermione already is 10 00 a m dropped by dada classroom on a quick break and was horribly shocked to find michael not there instead standing in michael habitual place there was remus lupin i swear the instant he saw me he started to go magenta again i suppressed a brief look of total embarrassment and found the strength within me to ask where michael is he sick no lupin said he in egypt egypt yes he on an important assignment in egypt lupin said i was tempted to interject that if he was going to go on a mission in egypt that he should take me with him but decided would be useless to complain to professor lupin about that oh all right i said slightly disappointed gasp but i have just realized that this means i shall have to be giving harry asp lessons all by myself i going to go cry be delighted it may be an interesting balancing act but i promise i can manage this my birthday is going to suck which has just occurred to me if jacques has forgotten that my birthday is tomorrow i am going to gun him down with owl pellets 12 noon boo i miss jacques why in god name isnthe here oh dear i guessing it must make me a freak to miss him so much i need an anti jacques missing topical cream 12 30 p m ack saw harry looking gorgeous as usual and he looked at me and i looked at him and there was this charged little second like a little moment of serious electricity and then he blushed and looked away to return to his dinner blushing that means he definitely remembers and semi enjoyed it though he is quite publicly taken would leave brilliant filled with youthful vitality girlfriend for moi well let not get ahead of ourselves yay 1 04 p m or maybe he just hideously embarrassed that the entire thing happened and realizes with remorse and amusement that he has kissed the most hideous person in the world and would kill himself if it werentso insanely funny that he wasted his time with his gorgeous sexy evil fighting lips pressed against mine in a moment of my uncontrollable passion 1 12 p m or maybe he wasnteven blushing at me maybe he was blushing because i had breakfast stuck in my teeth again or maybe every time he looks at me he has a brief flashback of me with big leafy green hunk of spinach lettuce fusion stuck in teeth rather similar to the jacques x ray underwear dilemma similar to entire female population instant zone in to lucky shamrocks region of gryffindor seeker dilemma because honestly i ve been staring at harry lucky shamrocks region all day and have had to take two showers so far because i so disgusted with myself but it not my fault he s he so so if you dontknow what i talking about then you re you re you re definitely not a hormonal french girl 2 48 p m sitting in on potions why is my world crap i miss having actual people i can talk to i have no jacques i have no michael and hell i donteven have ren e to confide in what am i supposed to do i cantmake friends with the faculty because they already think of me as an incompetent ho bag bimbo and either want to kidnap and shag me or want me to die a horrid blood filled death or are embarrassed because i uttered the word sexy in their presence and will not have sex with them and if i make friends with the students well let just say i ve had problems making friends with the students 4 21 p m letter letter stop that i can hear you making fun of me excuse me but mail is my drug of choice aah woo hoo letter is from jacques nts cure self of semi chemical dependency on jacques dear fleur have you spazzed out that i not there yet just wanted to say happy early birthday no i didntforget how could you think i d forget present is attached i think you ll be pleased though i hope it wontencourage you to be more insane than you already are all my love jacques p s and yes i am wearing your present are you happy i hope i haventcontributed to your silk boxer fetish and i cantbelieve you stole my briefs and buried them outside your house like i wouldntfind them present present a present that he believes i will be pleased with oh god what could it be more lovely perfume a very small and neatly packaged orlando bloom or possibly how to become a lean and sexy supermodel in 2 hours or less oh it doesntmatter i just going to open the fricking present opening opening opening all right it may not be the victoria secret bra and panties set but it is the complete works of agatha firebrick my favorite self help book author maybe can fix self destroy indestructible sex obsession 5 00 p m sitting in potions room harry class and ron weasley have finally learned name of freckle faced sibling of ex english tutor and best friend of underwear losing sex god keeps glancing over at me and looking at harry and being like oh ha ha ha which is making me want to jump up and hit him merde i think he knows why the hell would harry share this with people does he think it s it s appropriate to share the the intimate details of our chance romantic encounter with the entire world does he mock this relationship there is no relationship because i am not dating harry there is no relationship because i am not dating harry there is no relationship because i am not dating harry what is wrong with me 5 20 p m of course i pretty sure hermione doesntknow despite her suspicious glaring at me which has gone up from it all time high of 23 to 30 in one class oh god oh god oh god 6 34 p m i should just catalogue my current state of affairs before i have a nervous breakdown aac name fleur delacour height 5 foot 8 weight 136 whaaat how did this happen have the hg glares somehow added pounds to me has she found a way to telepathically send people excess weight hair blonde eyes blue lust situation gaaaaaaaaaah damn harry for being so sexy cyber boyfriend in egypt should have stayed around and then clung to his heels screaming dontgo pilates minutes ha yeah right just because i planned to start doing this four months ago does not mean that i actually going to follow through that just laughable orlie thinking minutes 45 jude thinking minutes 78 hp thinking minutes 541 hg glares 30 odd slytherin draco malfoy winks 62 overall lust to love ratio 934 to 1 overall day craaaaaaaaap and some lust but mostly crap self help books that was nice and then everything else was recycled crap no just crap recycled crap other people crap that has been reused to make the crappiest crap there is just so it can be crappy enough for me day one hundred five of free independence monday may 2nd 2005 my birthday awake staring at my windowsill 7 04 a m 7 04 a m lazily dragged my butt out of bed to a completely unforgiving hoo hoo hoo type sound and my curtains fluttering horridly open making a little presentation of the little brown package sitting serenely on my windowsill poussi re was hooting and fluttering her wings and hopping from suitcase to suitcase in my room i far too tired to unpack i groaned and wandered falling over about twice on the way to my windowsill birthday present i asked but poussi re only hooted and flapped her wings again i semi sleepily detached the ripped piece of parchment attached to it and read was going to sell it at auction after i borrowed this from hogwarts but had a moral spaz out and decided to return it kindly return to owner thanks ren e and why did i think ren e would send me a present i tore open the package feeling like oh god what crap ass thing is going to happen this month and when the standard brown paper fell away i looked at what was left and fell over the lucky shamrocks i was holding the lucky shamrocks so i referred to my list of things i would do if i had harry lucky shamrocks shaking off the remnants of disbelief all right there was no bonfire present lord knows i d already imagined harry in and out of the lucky shamrocks i couldntfind the label though i tried believe me i tried and i didnthave time to write a ransom note or look up a restricted love spell so as the list had limited my options i tried them on and let me just say hee hee hee hee hee and i definitely still wearing them and i definitely late for potions 12 noon oh my god oh my god oh my god oh god this is worse than anything i ve ever gotten into so much worse than my normal daily embarrassment oh crap it even more horrible than my normal monthly embarrassment oh god oh god oh god i not entirely sure how i ll ever really recover from this i had already sprinted down to the dungeons before i vaguely remembered snape mentioning testing potions on knarls today out by the forbidden forest fricking greasy haired wishy washy loser of a potions master i grumbled as i raced down to the forest maybe my notes in class should be on things like where we d be meeting next instead of kissing harry but i dontcare it my birthday i ll take crap notes if i want to so i hurried down to the comc area beside the ff and of course harry class was there to view my lateness so i slowed down and tried to walk with composure in an effort to make it seem as if i werentlate however this effort turned out to be completely useless as harry was still staring at me more electricity hermione was still looking at me suspiciously and ron was still snorting to himself and draco draco was just doing his thing i e being sleazy snape who had been saving his special glare for me gave me a menacing look an indiscreet once over then returned to barking at the class over what idiots they were the problem was everyone was staring at me that what sucks about being late grrr so i gave them my best avada kedavra glare despite the fact that it probably looked more like an i look fat donti face seeing as how i cantdo facial expressions properly so i walked over to the tree stump that i was apparently supposed to sit on i know the joys of nature right this month i thought i going to be normal when michael comes back we ll have fantastic and almost disgustingly romantic dates and be like if not pre break up brad and jen at least pre break up jennifer garner and michael vartan who totally never should have broken up because they look so fantastic together but that beside the point this month i am going to breeze through with no falling asleep on people no lewd valentines and no draught of peace induced stupidity this month i thought as i prepared to sit down i am not going to embarrass myself but then oh but then but then as i prepared to sit down a great gust of wind zipped through the trees and blew my little pleated boarding school chic skirt up and do you think that the worst part because no it wasnthe worst part no it wasntthe snickers of the gryffindor boys as they took a sneak peek or the dirty comments of draco malfoy as he got a royal look up my skirt it was the words of a certain ron weasley that got me hey harry arentthose your boxers 1 24 p m so now as harry walks down the hall he greeted by high fives and how was it man and me i greeted by the most expressive faces of hatred i do believe i have ever seen and do you want to know what makes this enter thing even worse creepy colin creevey who had come down to see harry to ask if he could take pictures of harry and him with his girlfriend okay how does he have a girlfriend caught it all on camera that right folks there photographic evidence so can officially go die now 3 12 p m dying dying dying i going to get fired i going to get dumped and then i going to commit suicide by jumping out of my bedroom window at hogwarts and my famous last words will be wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee and the last thing you ll hear from me will be splat and then the harmonies the very famous harry hermione advocates who have been peaceful creatures up till now would dance on my grave and beat me with tuna how in god name am i going to explain this 3 45 p m i mean eventually i going to have to answer the question why the hell were you wearing harry potter underwear and i am going to have absolutely no clue as to what to say oh well i made a list and checked it twice and figured wearing harry boxers would be nice right 4 00 p m oh god dumbledore requested to see me i am screwed on toast he probably going to say something like in light of recent discoveries we have found it necessary to dismiss you from your position or some other dressed up way of saying you re fired and then i ll have to use the little money that they pay me to rent a small crappy apartment in worksop or something 5 13 p m i was greeted by not only dumbledore but snappy flitwick trelawney lupin and mcgonagall in manner of hogwarts teacher conference was very intimidating as all were glaring at me with envelope on table following me with their eyes like creepy kitty cat clocks in unison sat down eventually once i recovered from pure intensity of their visual hatred dumbledore took the envelope whipped out a stack a thin stack but still a stack of photographs and passed them to me do you recognize these photos he asked took a good hard look at photos horrid full color depictions of me with a slightly mortified look on my face with my skirt blown up like a less gorgeous marilyn monroe standing over an air vent bright green lucky shamrocks in full view i sighed i mean i ve never seen them before but yes that me i conceded and your undergarments asked dumbledore if i werentin that situation i would have laughed at dumbledore saying undergarments oh those every fiber of my being was screaming lie lie lie lie lie and i realize that usually when every fiber of your being is telling you something you ought to listen to it unless it telling you to do something stupid like try on someone underwear for example so i said albeit a bit weakly those are boxers that i have you have men underwear asked mcgonagall for the love of god why are all these grave people sitting around talking about underwear of all things i glanced over at the other staff members naturally lupin was trying to avoid my gaze probably plagued with horrifying nightmares of me coming after him screaming soooo sexy at him and flitwick was looking at me with this most horrifying look of disappointment on his face trelawney was probably predicting my death in her head snape was twitching erm yes i find it more freeing i said fumbling more a reason i would prefer boxers to regular underwear noting how lupin had to look away as i said freeing snape who d been seeming a bit fidgety the entire time suddenly stopped violently twiddling his fingers and burst out slamming his hands on the table but why were you wearing harry potter underwear umm but i wasnt wearing harry potter underwear i shrieked my voice going up an octave asking an accidental question snape seemed to want to continue on with his tirade however despite my denial but it is it harry potter underwear how could you do this to to to the the staff right the staff but i wasntdoing anything wrong this is not what i should have said miss delacour you are screwing a student severus exclaimed mcgonagall shocked and appalled at snape use of the word screw in her presence i however was busy being shocked and appalled at his accusation i am not screwing anybody in this school you freak i exclaimed in future i will not call the person who may decide whether or not i end up in a smelly crappy apartment in worksop a freak those are not harry potter boxers and even if they were just because i wearing them does not mean i ve had sex with him for all you know he may have leant them to me because he wanted wanted wanted me to keep them warm for him or maybe he thought it would be a funny present from a celebrity you know akin to a signed t shirt or an autograph or a photo only it under wear instead of outer wear and they re not they re boxers that i got bought purchased in bordeaux i bought shamrock covered boxers in bordeaux they may look very similar to the famous lucky shamrocks but only because since their discovery the pattern has become very popular and is appearing underwear i mean everywhere professor mcgonagall looked at her colleagues before looking back at me excuse me dear if we have trouble believing you well believe it i shrieked once more before my anger faded into fear that they were going to dismiss me without wages you arentgoing to fire me over this are you because i really have done nothing wrong what i did was the byproduct of a lust that never should have actually existed and lust isntaction my friends no we arentgoing to dismiss you dear mcgonagall said sternly making it seem as if there was a however coming after the dear which there was of course but not from her how ever said snape hulking over me with this look of frightening madness on his face i will not allow you to work in my classroom any longer you can find some other teacher to assist though i doubt anyone will allow you to darken their doorways in this school ever again on that note i bolted 6 34 p m quite simply i am not going to dinner i simply cannot afford to i would much rather sit up here and cry over how in the name of all that is good this has happened to me one part lust two parts stupidity and one part meteorology damn wind how am i supposed to keep my job here snape wonttake me lupin wonteven let me near his classroom mcgonagall look could kill me right now and as for flitwick i feel so horrible just from the look of disappointment etched on his supremely old face trelawney oh god not trelawney merde merde merde merde this is the worst birthday ever and i still wearing the lucky shamrocks not so lucky after all i suppose day one hundred six of free independence tuesday may 3rd 2005 preparing to floo jacques 5 46 a m 5 46 a m i ve got to talk to jacques here i was thinking that i could be free and

mine and what does she mean she ll be saving my life today what if i d like to die hmmm bet she never considered that so anyway she just waltzes her butt on into my room spreading the smoke from her cigarette all over the room and then snaps it out of existence with a silent spell ren e is only vaguely familiar with one type of wand by now soooo she says strolling through and looking around as if poised to say what a dump how was it it it silence you know it with harry how was it with harry there was no it with harry what do you mean there was no it with harry of course there was it with harry no i swear there was no it with harry she stops and stares at me with a mixture of disbelief and exasperation you mean you ve gone and gotten yourself in every paper in the wizarding world made countless people hate you and embarrassed yourself to no end and you didnteven get laid well it sounds bad when you put it like that um yes my fleur you re an even bigger failure than i d thought she says succinctly looking at me as if she never seen me before i about to speak up and protest when she says never mind dontgo getting all mad at me i didntexpect you to have actually warranted all this media attention anyway though may i ask if there was no it with the boy who lived then why in the name of all that is holy were you wearing his boxers because you gave them to me you evil witch because really this is all damn ren e fault giving me harry potter boxers what was she thinking does she want to kill me i didnt tell you to put them on she says it was implied no it wasnt return to owner and try them on are not the same thing fine whatever i dontcare i sink down onto my bed and stick my earphones into my ears to continue listening to hollaback girl only to have ren e yank them out again of course okay no more of this she says what are you going to do now cry wrong she says eat wrong sleep no you re going to fix this that what you re going to do and i would very much like to know exactly how she plans on doing this 10 00 a m according to ren e i have to act and i have to act fast i have just played the role of angelina jolie to a brad and jen like split because undoubtedly harry and hermione have split and as far as ren e is concerned if i dontdo something quick hermione will end up like jennifer aniston much beloved while i am hated by all firstly you mustntlet yourself go she said clearly making a note of my turquoise bathrobe and planning to have it destroyed no emotional eating no whining not any of that you mustntlet people think that they ve gotten to you or that you re unhappy she said this seriously with the air of someone who well practiced in this strange field you must look fabulous but not so fabulous that they think you re trying to be fabulous and above all you must remember that you re the victim here how can i possibly be the victim i asked puzzled i was wearing his underwear how am i supposed to explain that how did you escape being fired she asked well i just told them it wasntharry underwear exactly just do that just say it was very similar looking underwear but not the same that you are shocked by the accusations towards you and that you and harry are you re nothing more than acquaintances and that all she said summing it all up happily but unfortunately for her i wasntas happy and grateful looking as she would have liked for me to be what the matter dontyou oh i get it you ve got a crush on him haventyou no god you re a horrible liar and worse one with no impulse control we should just lobotomize you and get it over with she suggested passively while inside my head i was screaming oh my god she knows she knows she knows she knows then again should i be surprised wouldnteveryone know considering that i was wearing his lucky shamrocks but still she knows she not supposed to know what did you think i wouldntknow she not supposed to know 11 02 a m i tried to reach for the nutri grain bars i have hidden under my bed only to have her throw halcius pottotius and the book of love at my head what do you think you re doing um well before i was trying not to starve to death in my own room but i suppose having my own books chucked at me is just as good what part of dontlet yourself go dontyou understand she shook her head and rolled her eyes oh right i forgot that in fleur world yes means no black means white return to owner means try them on and stay away from me you freak means kiss me please what do i have to repeat this to you all over again yes means no no i mean the part about stay away from me you freak meaning kiss me please how did that come into it oh darling dontyou read the tabloids you cantbe in the papers and not read the papers she says pulling the snitch report out from under a pile of self help books on my nightstand she tosses it lightly at my head and this time i catch it my eyes instantly going to the headline fatal attraction and of course i immediately thought ohhhhhhhhhh crap i donteven want to read it it probably horrid and evil bs that isnteven worth the paper it printed on and then i snatched for it because i knew i was going to read it and do you know what it was about some random fame grabbing ass wipe sold this dumbass story to this dumbass magazine on how i am stalking harry after reading it i proceeded to scream obscene words and rip the article to pieces rather like i would have if it had been harry and hermione couple of the year part ii after which ren e nodded sympathetically as if she in the same situation would have done the same thing you see darling people are going to think you are crazy if you dontshape up and make a statement make a statement do you think i sane enough right now to make a statement i screeched at her grabbing for my ipod and stubbornly sticking the earphones back in my ears only to find that ren e had changed the song to most people i know think that i crazy so i chucked it at her head which she deflected with a shielding spell which caused my own ipod to smack me in the face which caused me to fall down to the floor and start crying next to halcius pottotius and the book of love oh my god she said looking down at me in her own form of barbie sympathy it okay she says getting down on her knees to give me a hug she sighs i hope you know i will never do this again oh i figured that i said 12 noon when are you going to see him next this day after is absolutely crucial you will have to assess his feelings she says buttering her toast and do some major damage control and if you cantmake a coherent sentence fall out of your hopeless mouth then you will have to look really really hot she looked at me and shuddered what it not that unbelievable so i ll just suck in my stomach now asp oh god what she asks pausing with her toast halfway to her blinding white teeth seriously they re so white i sure they glow in the dark as if they are radioactive michael not going to be there i going to have to be with him all alone in the dungeons i ve experienced enough in life to know that nothing good can come of being stuck alone in the dungeons with a desirable boy man boy man boy man hybrid thing harry nothing good can come of being stuck alone in the dungeons with harry especially when i desperately want to back him against the wall and shag his gorgeous brains out which i will not do because though it is legal it is immoral as i have a boyfriend i have a boyfriend i have a boyfriend and cheating on your significant other is a fernando thing to do especially if it involves a quick shag in the dungeons so i won t nope not me not shagging boy who lived not fantasizing about shagging the boy who lived not drooling onto my french toast imagining self shagging the boy who lived fleur stop drooling on your toast someone is going to take a picture and sell it to the national inquisitor warns ren e i wasn t fine 2 34 p m i swear ren e can read inside people minds or perhaps i am just an open book stop thinking about him fleur she says in that all knowing way i wasntthinking that hard about him stop thinking about him stop looking at him stop imagining yourself furiously shagging his brains out in the dungeons just stop freaking out until you absolutely have to she says in her horrid bossy way ren e has it ever occurred to you that freaking out is what i do ren e turned around to look at me and smiled in that same familiar coy annoying way oh fleur sweet na ve fickle faint hearted absolutely insane screw up fleur i had already figured that out you can freak out all you want it just wonthelp you at all well thanks 4 45 p m now ren e is making fun of halcius pottotius oh my goodness fleur you know how completely absurd these books are why do you read them i mean think about it there supposedly this secret magical medieval world that nobody knows about and some orphan kid who has some sort of destiny to avenge the death of his parents according to some prophecy that he going to kill lord something and such bacilledemort i exclaim and so he runs off to knight school and becomes the greatest medieval wizarding champion ever and is almost killed by this lord bacilledemort like five times what are the odds of that happening why isnthe dead because he the knight who shined she picks up another book and ok this latest book halcius pottotius and the raging hormones for the record it definitely not called halcius pottotius and the raging hormones like for no apparent reason suddenly everyone making out with everyone in their dinky medieval clothes and shooting off love spells oh halcius hold me closer thou sexy beast i mean seriously i give her a look of exasperation the line is oh halcius hold me closer stir my cauldron you bubbling pot of love and it has just now struck me how completely odd that sounds when you actually say it ooh ooh and listen to this line when halcius saw geneva suddenly out of nowhere a monster rose inside of him purring geneva geneva no this is what happens when you let your sister mock parts of the book you haventeven finished reading yet halcius geneva halcius geneva why god why oh is that bad 5 00 p m am now rocking back and forth in my room in manner of mental patient whispering to self there is always fanfiction there is always fanfiction how could athena o hereagall do this to her loving adoring fans we have made her who she is because of us her books are bestselling she the richest woman in wherever the heck she lives and her books have been turned into award winning plays of the same names even though most people arenttrue fans they only attend because the actor who plays halcius nathaniel sutcliffe is really hot jailbait but hot how could she 7 12 p m oh my god oh my god oh my god screw halcius pottotius wish i could but not the point i have to be with harry in forty eight minutes all alone for two hours he going to rail at me on how i ve ruined his life and hate me forever and never ever want to kiss me again going to shoot self damn wizarding world equals horrid lack of guns but that what wands are for am just going to run over to the corner grab my wand and avada kedavra my problems away 7 33 p m stupid people who think suicide is not the answer ren e had to run over smack me upside the head and say go down to the dungeons and do it right or i ll have your head do you hear me you stupid little wench 7 55 p m okay i am going to get up and go to the dungeons now 7 57 p m i am trying to make myself get up and go to the dungeons and obviously it is not working as i am supposed to be there in three minutes oh dear seems that ren e is charging at me saying something about how if i dontwant to end up like some sort of angelina ho lie i should get my ass up and go talk harry into making a statement good lord she scary am beginning to feel remorse for poor innocent aylesford day one hundred eight of free independence friday may 6th 2005 breathing heavily going mad reliving everything 2 00 a m 2 00 a m i know it two a m and everything but how can i expect to be asleep after what has just happened all right calming down now i shall stop being so dramatic i a drama queen this is what i do breathe breathe so i shall recount the events of the night to you and then destroy these pages before they are used against me in a court of vicious teenage girls have just realized that i am no longer part of this sect as am mature twenty year old not hormonal nineteen year old any longer though actions may say otherwise so i walked through the door asp handbook in hand all nervous wishing that when ren e fixed me a gingersnap cocktail to go with lunch that there had been a little more snap in it and he was there leaning on the desk looking at me walk in hello i said but it wasntjust a hello it was a squeaky high pitched question of a hello as if i were asking whether or not hello was the actual english word for bonjour or bonsoir taking into account the whole dark nocturnal night ness of it all hello see when he says hello it more of this sexy i ve got something on my mind hello not a question at all okay so we have this lesson thingy today that we have to do i said breathlessly naturally since i had to sprint to the dungeons to get there in time nts stop being so late to everything because you will have to take the aspire at the end of the month i am going to have to speed through everything and prepare you even though michael really better at these things but he off with some house elves doing his thing in the ground aspire oh i said having just then realized that i d been whizzing through everything so fast that i d never bothered to explain what aspire stood for the aspire is the alternative self protection international requisite exam it just to make sure that if some crazy person kidnaps you you ll be able to stun them with your good looks long enough to get away i smiled and then i realized that smiling might seem creepy so i tried to retrieve a poker face from behind my am i fat face okay and then i started going crazy why isnthe asking me about what happened why isnthe yelling at me what going on what going on so i started reading about how meditation helps with the issue of self control yanking out the french meditation book that i bought when i decided that being zen was cool and it was until my mother started with it we both sat down on the ground in our zen cross legged position and i began to read from meditation for the teenage soul okay the book says that now you should take hold of your fantasy place harry blushed um i dontusually take hold of my fantasy place in public which caused me to gasp and drop meditation for the teenage soul you know harry that probably a good thing i think we should move on flipping through the asp handbook i searched for the next lesson which happened to be 11 6 kissing lessons and that seemed like a bad idea so i decided it would be question time harry do you have any specific questions as a matter of fact i have one he said looking at me tentatively okay go ahead shoot why exactly were you wearing my underwear okay it wasntlike i didntexpect him to ask this question but i felt like a deer in the headlights when he did or perhaps snape faced with the prospect of washing his hair similar reactions shocked stunned perhaps facing death um you see okay i really donthave a good explanation for why i was wearing your boxers except that i was being really stupid and it not that i actually stole them or anything because that was my crazy sister who was going to sell them at auction before she had some random spasm of morality and decided to fob them off on me and okay at this point i probably should have just given them to you but you re like a celebrity okay and you re a very attractive celebrity and it not just that you re a celebrity because that not all i care about you know but you re so cute and you were so nice to me before and so your underwear was right there how could i not put it on i mean yes that sounds creepy and it is creepy but it what i did and i swear i washed them okay it not my fault i have a crush on you you have a crush on me crap why did i have to use a childish teen phrase like have a crush instead of a mature 20 year old phrase like have feelings for nts attempt to be more 20 years old well i dontmean crush more like emotions of a romantic nature i said forcedly searching for mature words in my vocabulary however all those mature words were dirty so i had to scrap them there was a long silence so i searched around in my mind for something anything to say but that doesntmatter you know i blurted out suddenly it doesn t he asked pensively looking at me in his lovely gorgeous way and then he had to stand up and look down at me in a way that is even more lovely and gorgeous which isntfair because we were in a place of education it may have been asp but that is still educational it was sacrilege how he was looking at me like having sex in a church no because because because i a teacher and i a student exactly and i 20 years old i a mature individual and i a teenage boy there the spirit exactly and we should have nothing to do with one another nothing he agreed vehemently because neither one of us in this room want to shag each other because we re not attracted to each other all the rumors about this supposed attraction are lies where do they get these things we re not interested in each other he exclaimed right because that would be wrong sick and wrong so we wont do anything we wontdo something we might regret because we will regret it here to not being attracted to each other hear hear and somewhere between all these hear hears and declarations of sick and wrong our lips became inexplicably close to each other and then just completely by accident in a moment of confusion we both accidentally moved forward instead of backward the way we meant to go and our lips accidentally ran into each other about four or five times scratch that really it was just that there was confusion and then they sort of fused together i think it was some sort of chemical reaction none of it was our fault really i swear he a really good kisser he is an extraordinarily good kisser and then there came the aftershock which consisted of us just staring at each other in shock and horror and some minor wishing that some sort of mystical lip fusion would reoccur it was minor i swear it was major i just gasped you know that never happened the sooner i forget this happened the sooner i can return my life to semi sort of normal i canthave people finding about this and sending me more hate mail i really dontthink i can handle it but now there this lovely image of harry and i skipping into the sunset in my head that i cantseem to erase you re exactly right never happened he said a look of minor okay fine major disappointment on his face the boy catches on fast i think we should end this lesson early i suggested with the disgusting remembrance that i am actually his teacher nts find some way to erase disgusting teacher feeling right he said with this horrid uncertainty on his face okay i going to go forget this ever never happened i said scurrying towards the exit wait fleur said harry in that heart wrenching voice that people are allowed to have in movies and in trashy romances but not in real life because that just too much for an actual person to handle and then he rushed up to me and started kissing me again oh my god and i just had to ask what about hermione mood killer much oh god you re right you re so right fleur harry said in his sweet sad voice was altogether too close to him his voice is all the more horridly heartbreaking when it inches away from your ear it made me wish i that i could be wrong if it werentfor i mean she my best friend fleur and i i know he her best friend she his best friend he doesntwant to lose her and all the other usual sweet tosh i i could help help why did i offer to help help my mouth just keeps moving it just keeps moving against my will i mean i a girl and she a girl and we know what girls like and i think if you said it the right way i mean hell if you said anything the right way anyway i think she ll take you back i dontwant her to take him back if she takes him back i ll go insane i ll have to see them back together again gazing in adoring commitment at each other and her gleaming triumphantly in my direction oh good good no it not good it so bad that i going to feel physically ill every time i around her um so just come by later we can figure this out next asp and then you can start studying for the aspire i guess am horrid teacher do not know why am still here in fact wish i werentstill here being here is like being slowly toasted with cheese it horrible wanting something you cantand shouldntwant to have am drawing horrible parallels to harmonia granker la halcius pottotius and his fair lady feel as if am watching my own personal halcius slip into the hands of someone else geneva snitchley or similar horribly wonderful image of harry on a horse as i sit in castle tower comme une rapunzel moderne he is shouting dontworry just hold on as he is on his way to rescue me and is swelling wave of faith within me which leads to more warm fuzzy emotions should erase this short film from head is not doing any good only causing more inevitable mushiness and sadness so anyway dashed out the door and back to room before we could start kissing again thank god goddamnit 4 00 a m kissing harry in my head i am still kissing harry but really i should be what am i supposed to be doing sleeping right 4 05 a m sleeping is impossible there nothing else to do so i will do the only thing i can do despite the fact that it will probably result in more smashed containers floo jacques squee he there gaaaaah underwear though much improved boxers is still underwear i shall have to add this to the forbids list in the rules of fleur handbook oh goody pants jacques do you know what time it is fleur 4 o clock 5 minutes and 38 seconds jacques anyone else feeling the d j vu fleur okay before you yell at me i have to yell at you okay okay deep breath oh my god do you think i am some kind of whore you stupid idiot do you think i go around molesting teenage boys where the hell do you get off reading dumbass tabloids and thinking they are true you are my best friend you are supposed to know me you are supposed to know that ren e is the only whore in my family okay fleur delacour is nobody whore okay i done jacques i know you re right i ve been incredibly stupid fleur no this is the part where you re all defensive and then i all but i right and then you concede and we re best friends again you re skipping a part jacques you re hilarious fleur okay this is just as good i flooing you because a i am sad out of my mind because everybody thinks je suis une tarte b ren e is not a big help since all she ever does is makes me feel bad and c the 3rd book is halcius geneva oh and i ve just been very stupid and done something crazy and wrong but that not the point jacques halcius geneva oh fleur i sorry fleur sigh it to be expected i suppose you never know when all those really annoying people turn out to be right i mean not to be all against them and everything but why jacques everyone knows athena o hereagall is on crack fleur fleur really jacques who else but a person on crack would write a series about an orphan boy with a constellation on his forehead fleur so she really on crack jacques no i just trying to make you feel better fleur oh jacques so tell me about the crazy and wrong thing that you have done fleur i was hoping you d forget to ask me about that jacques well i didn t have you forgotten who i am fleur it not really that important jacques are you sure fleur i totally sure jacques should i come up there i mean i have no problem with coming up to england again fleur but jacques doing that would take the independence out of my free independence and then i d just be free and who gives a crap about being free if they re dependent you might as well not be free jacques somewhere in there you have a point okay are you sure fleur completely sure spend your time up there with whatever people you spend time with without my knowledge jacques janine fleur right spend your time up there with j oh my god janine is up there jacques well yes fleur why is there some reason that you have secretly spirited away my ex not really best friend up to your individual meant for one person unless that other person is me apartment see this is the part where the suppressed possessive best friend leaps out with her knife of ocd ness and starts harping on everything this was probably a side effect of kissing harry extreme paranoia nts never kiss harry again further nts pick notes to self that are easier to follow jacques well yes we re sort of fleur seeing each other jacques sometimes i wonder my being here is necessary for this to be a conversation fleur but jacques she is the incarnation of all evil jacques i could have sworn that was ren e fleur well it is but she family so that kind of evil is a given janine isntfamily so she doesnthave the right to be so darn evil to me and since when have you been such a bad judge of character jacques actually as i sure you ll recall i ve been wrong about people before fleur okay so scratch that are you sure you know what you re doing i mean you haventbeen in a relationship since gretchen are you sure you re ready to be back on the market again jacques why am i like a carton of milk is there an expiration date or something fleur no darling men donthave expiration dates except death death definitely rules out being on the market for most people jacques i dontunderstand any of your rules fleur that because these are new i ve never had to make up rules for best friend dating incarnation of all evil before besides gretchen seriously trampled on your heart as i recall since the end of your relationship with gretchen you have been totally non responsive to any sort of romantic notions it like you re still in love with her oh my god are you still in love with her jacques no fleur i am not still in love with gretchen fleur are you sure is this your extremely late reaction rebound relationship are you just using janine to make yourself feel better about what happened with gretchen jacques noooo fleur what did happen with gretchen anyway why did you guys break up jacques it doesntmatter fleur of course it matters witches in relationship ditches says that the only way you can prevent more painful breakups is to learn from your mistakes in past relationships jacques the more you say relationships the more my head hurts it five twenty two fleur why dontwe both just go to bed fleur you should know i cantsleep after this you re dating janine the switch bitching ex friend who could have spared me a potential lifetime of embarrassment and didnt ren e here making me feel like a fat stupid hag compared to her with her thriving engagement and horrid fabulousness and i ve just spent an entire asp session getting snogged the boy who lived and now i am consumed in a fit of guilty passion do you know how stressful jacques you did what fleur erm nothing jacques oh my god fleur but i swear i didnthave sex with him jacques but but but kissing him is just as bad fleur except you cantget pregnant kissing jacques so you can get mono from kissing fleur it better than an std jacques you could get herpes from kissing fleur so jacques you are going to die from herpes fleur i am not going to die from herpes no one dies from herpes jacques there a first time for everything fleur you re being hysterical jacques what if you die what am i supposed to do if you die from herpes fleur okay chill relax chillax okay i am totally never going to do it again because i have concocted a brilliant albeit hypothetical plan to get harry and hermione back together and then i am going to make a statement to the effect that i never screwed the bwl okay and then the school year is going to be over and i will never see him again and i can probably find some job temping at some agency or something and launch a career at a place that doesntsmell perpetually of pumpkin juice and ferrets okay and then you can forgive me and i can be okay with you and janine and we can all go to ren e wedding and be happy right and then and then well it all ends when we re happy jacques really you talk faster than the speed of sound it a miracle that anyone ever understands a thing you say fleur well did you catch the part about us all being happy jacques yes fleur okay good because that the only part that actually matters oh crap ren e waking up she going to throw more books at my head and tell me to work out kiss kiss love you miss you see you jacques love you miss you see you too fleur what about the kiss kiss jacques fleur my pain tolerance goes about up to the word chouchou after that i canttake anymore cute fluffy words fleur fine just love you miss you see you then you forgive me jacques if you forgive me fleur i adore you jacques then i forgive you 7 37 a m yummy jacques reconciliation bliss is unfortunately counteracted by icky harry guilt was unable to eat breakfast anything which made ren e insanely happy she says i am taking a step in the right direction but if i have to contract harry guilt to stop overeating is this even worth it 10 34 a m life is very boring right now especially as all ren e will say is work out stop eating life might seem less boring if you were drunk however since hogwarts doesntserve alcohol i have no access to either bellini or martini unfortunately ren e has exhausted the supply of vodka in the room so am sitting here in depressing sobriety it definitely no fun going outside at hogwarts once all the snow has melted 12 noon oh dear i was very much focused on not eating lunch when snappy had to come and approach me i rarely rush into anything he begins which is a sign of strange things to come and i dontdecide anything without careful meditation so you should consider yourself lucky that i am welcoming you back to the potions classroom ah and twenty year age gap lust prevails um well i began drumming my fingers on the bagel that ren e ordered me not to eat i very flattered you should be he said after which he proceeded to slink off back to his coffin before the light of day killed him or colin creevey hopped up on ritalin ran after him wielding garlic and a wooden stake um yay 1 34 p m suppose will restart potions job on monday but this is definitely not affecting decision to find alternative income through job not involving cute underage boys nts do not apply for incredibly appealing job teaching at all boys boarding school after this year will have to go conjure up lucrative career involving world travel and enough expendable income to spend on fabulous things like shoes and plus cher jeans fleur delacour possible careers 1 secret agent could be like asp ed up jane bond and wander around countries doing cool secret agent y things however unlikely as face has been plastered on papers across the world and everyone would recognize me a bit discouraging for the whole anonymous career thing will just have to buy cool chanel sunglasses that record everything you see on black market 2 journalist despite grudges held against nasty newspapers who run bs stories on supposed trysts that never happened except for perhaps after said newspapers were printed would like v much to reform journalism industry and write hard hitting stories on tough issues or i could do the style section and tell everyone that iris is the wizard version of michael kors meets dolce gabbana meets chanel on acid 3 trashy novelist i mean not a novelist that is trashy but a novelist who writes about trashy situations involving fictional characters i mean how hard could it be tall dark and handsome boy meets absolutely gorgeous but no one knows it but him girl there are some complications but through the power of their love they pull through unfortunately would rather read trashy novels than write them somehow reading them makes me feel less guilty than actually writing them would 4 ambassador i could be a french ambassador to england except that all of england world sort of despises me at the moment which they may or may not ever get over but then every ambassador got to start somewhere eh nts am not canadian stop saying eh 3 00 p m ren e is looking at me suspiciously staring at me silently for an unsettling length of time suddenly she gasps oh my god you made out with him who what do you mean who who the hell do you think you made out with harry potter you tramp at least she whisper shouts unlike jacques who might as well use megaphones to communicate but what right does she have to call me a tramp that tramp i not a tramp and how did you know she shook her head and sighed here a comb you have make out hair make out hair there nothing that says i ve just made out with someone i totally not supposed to like make out hair with my luck i ll have to use six bottles of shampoo to reverse it make out hair is the one hair problem i ve ever encountered that withstands six different types of bad hair day spells 4 30 p m so how was it smiles ren e smoking another cigarette against my advice by the end of this seemingly never ending school year i ll have lung cancer from all this second hand smoke meanwhile ren e will smoke a pack a day and live forever it yes kissing harry how was it does she actually want me to describe kissing harry does she actually think that possible it was he was and it was really and he was like and i donteven i mean it really strange but i canthelp feeling and so after we it was just so so yeah it was just yeah that good huh thank god that someone understands that when one is at a loss for words it doesntmake someone stupid it just means they probably have harry potter syndrome which is a legitimate disease thank you well i ll have to warn you it doesntcome without side effects i know i said it not like i haventbeen kissed phenomenally before admittedly these times have been few and far between and just over half of these instances have been imaginary but it still been done i sure this wontbe much different obsession impulsiveness fainting and the like no you dontknow fleur you think you know you dontknow you ll see though whatever 6 45 a m the usual affol d affaires courant name fleur delacour height 5 foot 8 weight 132 yay five pounds lighter perhaps telepathic weight is like water weight and can eventually go away hair blonde eyes blue lust situation what do you think cyber boyfriend away thank god i d have to get rid of the cyber boyfriend section of my state of affairs if he were actually here though am feeling really guilty damn you you sexy thing harry damn you pilates minutes 45 i haventdone this much pilates practically ever ren e is mean orlie thinking minutes 60 a good even hour good for me oh wait should be de americanizing bad for me jude thinking minutes 123 he gotten hotter bouncing back from the brief period in which he wasntas hot as he used to be thank god for you you hot british creature hp thinking minutes 230 but that is not my fault wouldntyou be thinking about him too but if you are dontwaste your time if too many people in the world start thinking about him at the exact same time i ve got this theory that he ll spontaneously combust too much cosmic pressure hg glares 12 i ve been hiding from her so that all odd slytherin draco malfoy winks 33 i ve been hiding from him too but somehow he seems to show up everywhere looking sleazy and pale and confident as always i d love to crush his annoying spirit but it doubtful that is possible overall lust to love ratio 56 to 1 overall day jacques forgiveness squee day one hundred eleven of free independence monday may 9th 2005 on the scale 6 40 a m 5 40 a m oh my am standing on the scale not quite believing what i am seeing and ren e is standing behind me with this told you so look on her face i told you there would be side effects fleur and you were all whatever when you should have listened to me this isnta side effect this is wonderful i skinny i skinny okay not skinny but not as fat as before 120 i am one hundred and twenty pounds i have never been one hundred and twenty pounds before not all this year 6 00 a m ugh feel horrible was skinny was happy am now just horribly icky feeling am horrid invalid and ren e still has her told you so look on would kill her but donthave the energy see now you feel sick why dontyou just tell me what wrong with me and get it out of your system i know you re dying to tell me i said wishing i could dash up to my room and retrieve the box of nutri grain bars that is oh so far away unfortunately ren e is standing in front of me looking triumphant she looks at me with a modicum of pity oh fleur you have harryrexia anyone who ever even looked at a modern magazine has heard of it girls everywhere after meeting him losing a dramatic amount of weight growing weaker eventually having hallucinations and more recently sending you hate mail he just has that effect on women she said thoughtfully and dramatically you re not serious okay maybe i exaggerating but you re not hungry are you no but exactly you have harryrexia you wonteat a thing for days and you wontcare because who are you thinking about harry you must see my point the boy like a disease gets in your system nearly impossible to get him out but you ll be skinny like me shut up you may start to feel dizzy as a matter of fact you should have started feeling dizzy yesterday you may start fainting when you see him but that rare after all you ve been teaching him for like three months or something your side effects wontbe that severe you re really enjoying being my doctor today arentyou i ask feeling whiny wondering whether or not i ll be hungry enough by dinner to eat the chocolate cake that the house elves are carting off to the kitchens i told you i d save your life you ungrateful flake you her mouth keeps moving but all i hear is evil 12 noon i actually had to teach evil double crossing snappy i not his assistant after all he left me the entire bloody post i the mother fricking potions mistress he gone and bloody retired the bloody bastard i had to freaking pay attention instead of taking notes and fantasizing the outrage i couldnteven and worse he didnttell me so i walked into the classroom hopped onto my usual spot on the desk and swung my legs childishly waiting for a potions master that never came and then i realized with shock and horror that i would have to teach the lesson all by my lonesome in front of the people that hate me why the hell does harry class always have to be right there whenever i have to do anything just imagine him there why dontyou sitting there with his gorgeous green eyes tapping his quill on the table wondering when class would begin perhaps absently scratching his nose in a weirdly sexy way or adjusting his yes i make nerd look hot glasses or flipping through his potions book imagine how unbearably attractive he must have been and he was he was how does anyone expect me to concentrate when that is sitting in front of me and then and then just turn to the other direction and there she is smiling like she does her unbearably bushy head of freakishly smart hair radiating her victory i wanted to leap across the room and shout victory i laugh in the face of your victory you think you ve won you think you ve won win this you stupid bitch and then break her face but i am not a ninja i am fleur delacour potions mistress come to think of it i should have a book series like sabrina the teenage witch except that i am fleur the 20 year old virgin potions mistress oh crap ren e is probably going to remind me of that every day until i get laid perhaps should stop being so picky no that would make me slutty bah humbug anyway potions so i jumped up like a cat rolling in gasoline on a hot flammable summer afternoon today is longwinded dumbass southern accented similes day and stared at all the students looking at me expectantly like rabies infected dogs at the pound looking out for their new owner oh my shit in his infinite helpfulness the masterful severus snape left a lesson book propped up in the front of the room for me to teach from if he had been there i would have seized it and hurled it at him screaming you stupid ass idiot you however as said stupid ass idiot was unavailable i found myself with no options other than to go up to the book and try to teach a class um so those were my first words as a potions mistress to my class um so i so freaking articulate when i want to be arenti umm can anyone tell me where you left off in the book of course hermione granger raised her hand like we could expect anything else she smiled at me but it was a smile that was really just hate baring its teeth page 274 clarus animi the clear headedness potion what i would give to have been clear headed at that moment but i dumbly went along with her and opened the book to page 274 all right so you will make the potion observe its effects in an essay i suppose which you will turn into me tomorrow i suppose and try not to mess it up i suppose well is there anything else i d like to suppose in her almighty annoyingness hermione granger had raised her hand again yes ms granger i so proud of myself that i remembered to call her ms granger and not hermione wontyou need to pass out the ingredients arentthey already on your desk severus evidently had done a nice job of setting them up with their materials before he jumped town to go live in florida in a retirement community or something well yes she said sweetly she scares me to death when she sweet but you see we re missing an ingredient i scanned the list in the book they had everything eye of newt snake venom phoenix tears and then there was the one ingredient that was missing oh i said finally after staring at the book for over a minute i ll just pass out the lucky shamrocks then 1 30 p m the rest of the lesson wasnttoo bad though aside from the titters of the amused students as they found the irony in the situation all except neville who for some reason didntget it but aside from that it was fine though draco did say that his finger hurt and that he wanted me to stir his cauldron to which i replied with a kick in the shins and though i could have sworn parvati patil coughed the word whore at me and though hermione continued to correct me throughout the entire lesson and though i spent the whole time wondering if there was something wrong with me from the way harry was staring at me and though pansy parkinson spilled a cauldron full of clarus animi all over me i sure on purpose it was fine no i totally serious 5 23 p m ewww i have to spend even less time contemplating my dumb life now that i have responsibilities i think i am actually a legitimate hogwarts teacher now though this must upset the staff very much i wonder if there are meetings or something that i will have to attend in snape stead or something or if i now have subscription to some sort of staff newsletter or if there a secret room filled with gold and diamond shoes that i will now have access too or if there a staff sauna that snape obviously never uses oh probably not 6 12 p m ren e is staring at me again so do you feel old yet of course she d ask me this and make me feel bad even though she is the older one no why i dontknow why i always ask why even when by all right i should just stuff my head under a pillow and scream na na na na na i canthear you at the top of my lungs well honey you re woman in her twenties graduated school and everything and you re making out with a teenager if i were you i d feel like his mother or something she smiles as if her saying this is akin to saying oh but dontworry the weather report says tomorrow it will rain chocolate well now that she mentioned it i do feel sort of old i twenty i am no longer a teenager i can no longer use that as an excuse for my angsty hormonal hedonistic lifestyle i even feel ashamed about the books i read and the shows i watch now are those too teen what about the magazines i read the music i listen to am i somehow obligated to read faulkner and listen to beethoven now that i am twenty and eat oat bran as i read the wall street journal am i now supposed to use words like ira and 401k am i supposed to know what those mean do i have to start planning for my retirement and invest in the stock market oh my god i twenty admittedly i am having a late reaction as my birthday was a week ago but still apparently this was all completely visible on my face oh darling dontdoubt your music choices and stuff like that you can still listen to your my chemical underpants sell out boy why does everything have to be about underpants it my chemical romance and fall out boy and they re brilliant and i refuse to stop listening to them i will sneak down to closet muggle and get every one of their cds if i want to then rushed out into hall to hide in faculty bathroom from insecurity inducing sister 7 45 p m oh god oh god am back in my room rushing around in frantic insanity as ren e looks on amused evidently she does not understand what is going around in my tossed and tumbled head oh my god ren e help me i dontknow what to wear i going to meet harry in fifteen minutes ren e glows looking proud good going little sis no not like that it asp i exclaim tugging on boots before realizing that it is may and i shouldntwear knee length slut boots but instead kitten heels or stilettos or something strappy shouldnti what do you wear to get your famous one lesson stand back together with the girlfriend who is publicly humiliating you asp you mean the adult sex party i stared at her i positive she didntmean that seriously i hope no i mean alternative self protection you psycho i replied trying to find a skirt before realizing that skirts only get me in trouble and perhaps i should wear something that isntprone to flying up at the slightest disturbance finding clothes is the single most stressful thing in the world men should try being fashion victims some time i just saying i hope you use protection said ren e looking at her fingernails as if she was wondering whether she should tough out her french manicure for another week or redo her nails perhaps in vamp red i gawked at her i am not going to have sex with him because i am not that desperate and he is not that desperate and we are not horny teenagers oh honey you re definitely not a teenager anymore stop trying to make me cry 10 35 p m i should just stay in my room and never ever leave it because every time i venture outside of it something happens first of all i never should have offered to help harry win back his brilliant capable vindictive girlfriend because i dont want him back with his brilliant capable vindictive girlfriend ugh let me tell you about it so i strolled down into the dungeons which are now apparently my domain since i am fleur delacour potions mistress and harry was leaning against the wall looking so jude law on magical dark lord defeating steroids that i nearly broke my ankle in the stilettos i eventually chose why do i even wear stilettos just because they re pretty um yes actually never mind so he was standing there looking thoughtful painfully thoughtful and then he saw me oh hey fleur because to him i am not fleur delacour i am just fleur that girl he can trust or tongue i could be just fleur that girl he can tongue damn hey i said trying to make my ankle support itself he looked so adorable in his lanky sexy way i have a thing for the tall sinewy i play quidditch type but even he exceeds expectations i am not going to purple prose about him i swear he gorgeous he gorgeous he gorgeous um so i guess this is not a lesson it s applying asp to an actual real life situation which is what we should be doing from now on yes sure don t you agree um yes he stopped leaning and i stopped myself from screaming no harry you look so sexy when you lean he held up an official looking piece of paper well i ve been nominated for a lifetime achievement award but you re like seventeen i probably should have said something in the way of congratulations but way to make me feel bad about being a twenty year old who canthold a job and cantmanage to be faithful to her boyfriend dontthink i dontkick myself over that one when here a villain vanquisher hottie who is winning a lifetime achievement award at seventeen years old not to mention the fact that now i am going to want to shag him more he should go to azkaban for conspiracy to make me keel over with lust i know you know that you should go to azkaban for conspiracy to make me keel over with lust oh right i mean you save the world as if you are superman but you are seventeen that crazy you haventlived your life yet i know it is insane actually it on friday evening gasp a school night there a ceremony and everything it pretty formal very formal and i need someone to escort me you want me to be your escort of all the things i could have said he grinned and blushed and i jammed my heel into my toe to punish myself for making him feel like he was asking me to be his prostitute or something um i was hoping you would go with me yes as your asp coach thing sure i murmured if i dontthink of it as a date then i wontgo crazy as fast if i dontthink of it as a date then i wontgo crazy as fast actually no dontcontradict me so is it like a dinner thing or is just the award ceremony it a dinner ceremony after party event he said and then suddenly he broke out into a ridiculously cute boyish grin they even specify that there will be an everlasting chocolate fountain then i will definitely be there i smiled oh god picturing me and harry making out in front of a chocolate fountain underneath a chocolate rainbow stop that stop thinking about that he laughed but i have no idea where i going to get something to wear for this it seems so serious and i just have no idea there a store it right around the corner from diagon alley i can take you there i have to get a dress anyway we could stop there on thursday or maybe on friday afternoon that way you wontmiss any class or anything and you can finish your homework on saturday and then we can go where is the ceremony again 137 warwick place he said quizzically naming a place that i have certainly never heard of and pointing to the address as i leaned over his shoulder he didntseem to have any more idea of where it was than i did let just hope you dontmind getting floo powder on your dress oh if only he knew how little i d mind being stuck in a fireplace with him only if you dontmind getting floo powder on your tux i replied tux yes harry we re going to dress you up like a penguin and parade you around london i smiled oh he really going to be shaggable in a tux i ll have to blindfold myself you may get a few odd looks here and there but when you walk into the room everyone will turn towards you and say damn that one hot penguin and then we broke down laughing honestly if harry dressed up like a buzzard everyone would turn towards him and say damn that one hot buzzard he just one of those people but unfortunately my stilettos finally gave way and along with them my ankles and i fell straight into harry however being a seeker he quite adept at catching things including falling potions mistresses ewww i hate being a potions mistress i sound like i should tie my hair in a bun and purse my lips and wear mauve but then we started looking at each other and that was a bad thing for us to be doing because in harry case looking leads to kissing which leads to tabloids which leads to crap so i found myself with no other choice than to say so harry about you and hermione it didnteven need to be a complete sentence because after i said her name he let go of me grrr i hate reminding him right right he has such integrity i wish i could corrupt him so what do you think i should say to her i d be surprised if she d even talk to me right now i thought for a moment harry lying is a horrible thing to do but everybody does it not to compromise your moral standing or anything but you are going to have to opt for some white lies and half truths is that okay with you what sort of white lies and half truths damn integrity well here what i think you should say i began realizing that after some five years my extensive knowledge of trashy romances is finally paying off first you should call her name go all out let the pain ring through and if that doesntstop her you re going to have to rush up to her and gently not roughly gently take her arm and you have to look her in the eye and say well first of all you re going to have to tell her you think that i crazy and you have no idea what the matter with me but fleur i dontthink you re crazy i think you re never mind what you think i am i squealed covering my ears tell her that i some sort of crazy insane maniac who is all over you all the time but that it is true that those were not your boxers tell her that you know how this whole incident has damaged your relationship but that she means too much to you to let her go without a fight and then say some stuff about how you ll fight for her even if she turns you down no matter how many times she turns you down and then you ve got to take her in your arms and kiss her really really fantastically and if she still doesntforgive you then she is like an eighty year old woman in a teenager body and there is no hope for her okay could you run through that one more time i sighed and thought over what i d said okay i ll be hermione and you ll be you i walking away i said walking in the other direction in slow motion fleur wait right but i keep walking away i said continuing to walk away and then as planned he gently not roughly gently took my arm spun me around looked me in the eye and said i not letting you go and then he kissed me really really fantastically too fantastically congratulations 007 i sighed you re licensed to kill day one hundred twelve of free independence tuesday may 10th 2005 staring at the ceiling 7 05 a m 7 05 a m role playing thing was horrible bad idea from now on i will make him read and take notes all class long definitely he will keep his eyes to his paper and i will keep my eyes to myself wash your hair you tramp says ren e stumbling out of bed knowing her she has a hangover somehow blindly as she has a rhinestone covered sleep blindfold thing that reads princess over her eyes some people get wake up calls from jovial staff as they recline in the ritz wearing fluffy bathrobes and i get this you canteven see my hair so how can you even tell i have make out hair i ask wondering if my sister really just has esp or if i really this transparent because you smell like him go hop in the shower daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaamn 7 23 a m ren e is sitting primly wow ren e and primly are in the same sentence on my bed legs crossed looking at me expectantly so still couldntkeep your hands off him as if she the virgin mary or something it was not my fault he kissed me i was all set to not do anything and then he had to actually kiss me i still think you should jump his bones sweetie she smiled but then there is the cradle robbing mommy factor she continued doing her best to look as if this was disconcerting her when really she was just happy that i am in a screwed up non relationship while she getting married to a billionaire aerobics instructor who is surprisingly limber dontcall it the mommy factor now i have to bang my head on the bathroom sink until that thought goes away oh honey it just so icky she said happily he taking me to this grand ceremony thing so he can receive this lifetime achievement award so i going to have to find a dress what should i wear oh why am i freaking out about this now i have a whole three days oh crap i have only three days i thought shaking my head frantically he taking you out are you still making a statement asked ren e perhaps actually slipping a note of concern into her voice however this may just be her getting worried that her sister will embarrass her yes that probably it sure sure i ll ask him tomorrow er tonight i ll ask him tonight we can make a statement at the thingy we re going to the award ceremony no problem i mean by tonight he ll probably be back together with her so it ll be nothing dontworry i never said i was worrying said ren e with a sniff sure you weren t 12 noon i going to close my eyes and not do anything until the ceremony thing it just occurred to me that there may be dancing and media coverage and i going to need a really great dress and according to ren e not to eat for several days 6 00 p m and the same as usual affol d affaires courant name fleur delacour height 5 foot 8 weight 123 perfect perfect hair blonde eyes blue

one hundred fifteen of free independence friday may 13th 2005 on the town 4 35 p m 4 35 p m am standing in the single iris store in london dontforget iris is the wizard version of michael kors meets dolce gabbana meets chanel on acid with ren e looking for a dress something that doesntmake you look like a cow that important says ren e as if i haventconsidered this i ve lost weight you know i say desperately whatever even skinny people can look like cows and something that isntslutty is important too she mentions as she has never worn anything slutty in her life annoyingly today she is wearing a white suit skirt set that makes her look professional and fantastic after all england already thinks you re a whore and no one will believe your statement if you look like one she turns to the saleslady i ll take the black one in size eight please four i correct her six four whatever get it in a four then she turns around and surveys the dresses surrounding her you ll have to look sexy but virginal i am virginal i remind her in the right dress even virgins can look like hookers and even hookers can look like virgins and in iris anything is possible she says but i am no longer paying attention for before my eyes is the perfect dress it like a slightly less formal ball gown in black and white provocative yet elegant and absolutely beautiful ren e realizes what i am gawking at are you sure i not sure it the right balance of risqu and innocent and i definitely not sure you re a size four i look at her with pleading eyes please just let me try it on it perfect i even have the heels to go with it didntyou break those last night looking at harry no that was my ankle i almost broke my ankle last night looking at harry i take the dress off the rack i ll go try this on and you ll see how absolutely perfect it is 5 17 p m i came back and twirled around in the dress some five times before ren e told me i was making her dizzy but isntit lovely i persisted jumping up and down in front of the mirror excitedly isntit just the most gorgeous thing you ve ever seen fleur may i say that you have never looked more like my sister and for that i am proud of you i might actually admit that we re related now i smiled why thank you i pulled out my wizard express i have managed to get one credit card back and danced happily over to the clerk if you can put this dress on my card please i said cheerily planning on wearing the dress out of the store she took one look at the name on my card before she said in a completely dead voice i sorry we donttake wizard express but your sign says you take all wizard credit cards wizard express cauldron card it listed right there i protested oh she said angrily dropping my card into the card slot though i could have sworn the box squeaked out an accepted she turned back to me with narrowed eyebrows and said i sorry your card has been denied but i put money on it yesterday there no way check it again no i sorry your card has been denied so either you put the dress back or i ll have you thrown out of this store she said slapping my card back on the table i just stared at her disbelievingly glancing at ren e wondering what the hell was going on evidently this was not a fairy friendly store but i have to have this dress you can t she glared at me but no this isntfair i continued on looking at ren e wide eyed as she just stared back at me ren e i didntbring any money fleur i sorry i have like two galleons and that it i so sorry she took a look out the window however i have a good feeling about this dontworry and amazingly at that very moment clad in a dazzling tuxedo in walked potter harry potter are you ready to go he asked really when i made that 007 comment i didntexpect him to really seem like james bond in a tuxedo i tried to talk but my mouth had gone dry so ren e spoke up in my stead pointing an accusing finger at the salesclerk we would be but apparently her card has been denied harry walked over to me and put his hands on my shoulders reassuringly it okay just let me pay for it ren e and the clerk both raised their eyebrows as he said this i dontmind really you re kidding i cantlet you do that i want to just tell me how much it costs umm harry just tell me 200 galleons and 5 knuts harry gave a low whistle admittedly i have expensive tastes but i never expected him to have to pay for it i have a hundred with me you donthave to pay for the whole thing you donteven have to pay for it at all actually here you go harry said sliding 200 galleons and 5 knuts onto the table um wow ren e proceeded to stare at the money along with the clerk who gaped for a good thirty seconds before sweeping it off the table and into the register come on he said taking my hand and leading me out of the store we have a party to attend bye i mouthed at ren e giving her a look that hopefully conveyed my feelings of can you believe this she smiled and gave me a thumbs up which clearly conveyed her feelings of use protection and the clerk looked pissed as hell 7 00 p m well to their credit there is a chocolate fountain a lovely gushing nonstop river of chocolate because nobody in the world respects that i am on a diet but whatever so i was looking around trying to look past the blinding flash of cameras at the waiters walking around in their little suits with coattails and i realized that considering the fact that there was apparently a lot of media attention focused on this event i was going to have to chloroform myself to keep my hands off of harry um i was thinking we could make a statement sometime during this ceremony i whispered as we entered the room what sort of statement harry asked leaning towards me but looking forward at the throng of reporters notably rita skeeter who seemed absolutely hell bent on dragging harry into a corner and beating an interview out of him oh just a statement that says we re not you know i said scanning the room for the table with our names on the place card oh no problem harry said come on let sit down we were seated in the very center of the room so that people could ogle us better however who really gives a crap about that because we were seated next to the chocolate fountain 10 00 p m i will say nothing about the night but this things begun and things ended we made the statement there were many photos taken and for once in a gorgeous dress and if you see the photo of the chocolate fountain in the daily prophet and look very carefully that girl making out with harry potter behind it isntme i swear day one hundred twenty two of free independence friday may 20th 2005 at breakfast 6 12 a m 6 12 a m since i am actually a hogwarts teacher now i am sitting up with the teachers feeling exalted and important dumbledore and mcgonagall are whispering about something probably something important and life changing they seem so serious and focused as if the fate of the world is in their hands they re whispering to lupin now and their whispering is growing more upset and agitated i tell you i right demands dumbledore more furtive whispering lupin finally turns to me would you mind stopping by the history of magic classroom and delivering this to professor binns he requested pressing a folded piece of paper into my hand what is this doesntmatter just deliver it okay no problem i say 11 23 a m well i delivered it and i must say it was the strangest experience i ve ever had in my entire life quite seriously i skipped down to the hom room and gave it to binns who was muttering to himself something about giants and elves and trying to make conversation with me so anyway i started to doze off because it was six o clock in the morning on a saturday and i really wouldnthave been up if ren e hadntbeen up at five drinking in her nightgown and then something binns said jerked me awake did you just say find the virgin why would you like to play find the virgin asked binns what i stared at him for a while my eyes popping out of my head with shock he dead what in the world would he be doing playing a game called find the virgin what kind of game is called find the virgin i only ask because it was a personal favorite of our former potions teacher binns smiled jovially actually i supposed to invite you to join our club club well yes you want in on the money dontyou money drop by albus office later we ll let you in to the room the room it worth your while i promise you he said i turned around and dashed out of the room i mean honestly what the hell 12 noon so i should be eating lunch but instead have just left the secret staff game room after being passed a scorecard a deck of cards and a pencil everyone welcome fleur delacour to the club smiled dumbledore i have this horrid feeling that they re going to blackmail me into doing horrid things now fleur you must understand how boring it can be being a teacher yes we just like to amuse ourselves amuse yourselves find the virgin is a hogwarts tradition you must understand he said moving in the direction of a humongous book these he said opening up the book are the names of every student in the school it updates itself of course but throughout the year when teaching becomes an awful bore we take out our scorecards and our pencil and dedicate a few minutes to finding the virgin he thought how mortified i felt was funny you could tell so you just look at people and guess whether they re virgins or not basically it wasntour idea it just tradition besides it helps us keep track of the troublemakers he smiled you have a lot of responsibility should you chose to join us as you know you are filling severus snape place but as you probably dontknow severus was the find the virgin champion three years running he already won 260 points thus far all you need is a few hundred more to win you re serious well he going to be upset if he doesntwin the golden condom again i think i ll pass i said horrified suit yourself he turned to the rest of the staff okay minerva i raise you 13 sickles that colin creevey is and i was gone before i could find out whether colin creevey was a virgin or not shudders day one hundred twenty five of free independence monday may 23rd 2005 at breakfast 6 43 a m 6 43 a m sigh i knew they d blackmail me they were going about their own weird business arguing over ron weasley and i was just focusing on my muffin dumbledore shook his head two galleons that he a straight virgin three that he gay and he not a virgin suggested mcgonagall suddenly lupin piped up i bet eight that he not quite straight and half a virgin they all turned to look at me i stared at them with incomprehension go and ask ronald weasley whether he a virgin or not mcgonagall demanded with a stern serious look on her face no i not even playing this stupid game i dontwant your stupid money do it or you re fired whaaaaaat so i ended up strolling down to ronald weasley pulling him aside and asking him trying to keep a straight face ron would you describe yourself as a virgin a straight virgin or a crooked virgin what a crooked virgin i almost straight if that what you re asking bisexual but mostly gay but that doesntmatter i said in a whisper are you a virgin well i half a virgin that all i need to know i exclaimed and rushed back to the rest of the teachers leaving ronald weasley looking as if he d just been hit by a bus i stood before the staff and said like a jury foreman reading the verdict he a not quite straight half virgin i said lupin right and you are insane they nodded their heads in agreement pretty much said dumbledore 4 56 p m oh dear oh dear oh dear i in trouble not underwear trouble or creepy find the virgin blackmail trouble or even jacques left you a message with just the words mono herpes and syphilis on it do you know what he means by that trouble boyfriend trouble michael back and he wants me to move in with him and i ve gone and said yes well at least i donthave herpes a n okay i have to explain the find the virgin thing because it is the most bizarre thing i have ever actually written down my friend paige was talking to me about something and i thought she said find the virgin so i burst out with find the virgin what is that some sort of sick freaky game show later when my friend elizabeth and i were talking one of us brought up so how exactly does one play find the virgin do you just go around like hunting virgins or do you have a scorecard so you can look at the people around you and write down virgin virgin virgin not a virgin virgin and then as it inevitably does fanfiction came up you have to put that in your fanfiction elizabeth exclaimed and who was i to keep an inside joke not so inside anymore out of a humor fic the rest is as a true find the virgin aficionado say sexual history please donttake me seriously i love you for your support happy holidays and i sorry i suck at updating sooo sorry love femme teriyaki june not so far from the madding crowd day one thirty three of free independence tuesday june 1st 2005 receiving advice from the reincarnation of all evil the original 10 18 am 10 18 a m ren e is looking at me curiously but i dontunderstand the way i was thinking about it you wanted to shag harry and harry wanted to shag you so why are you moving in with the boyfriend you are not shagging because he is my boyfriend and i owe it to him to be faithful and loving and committed to this relationship which i am i will not be tempted by every adorable guy that walks by i am not that kind of person it is my half year resolution i am rededicating myself to michael and his wonderfulness even if i may have harbored feelings for harry they were mostly due to um um sexual frustration and now michael here and i donthave to be er frustrated okay whatever you want fleur but may i offer some advice she asked cocking her head to the side she didntfeel the need for me to reply to her non question dontmove in with him move in next door to him you still get to be close together but you can think about what you re doing by continuing this relationship when you have feelings for somebody else isntthat the worse for both of you i was inclined to stare at her after this self help book like profundity and we were greeted by silence until she spoke again well let me help you get packed after which she realized that she wasntbeing mean enough to me oh and by the way never wear that color skirt again it looks like a dog crapped on it and thus my daily dosage of ren e infinite wicked wisdom was dispensed 12 noon i packed again it feels like this year has been filled with packing and repacking so much packing that i fear i will never want to travel again i sitting on my suitcases which very obligingly close when ren e packs them because even my suitcases hate me and wondering at what a situation i ve found myself in yes all well on the jacques front and i have a job to come back to when summer ends but so much time away has started me thinking in a direction that leading far away from where i was in march i haventseen michael in almost two months first when i was away in bordeaux and then when he went away to egypt admittedly he still adorable but now there harry of course there was always harry there wasnta time when harry wasntmy object of lustification in some way or another but now it as if it realer than it was before i thrown into his path all the time and it harder and harder to avoid him in the way that i could other people and worse still we ve gotten caught in this underwear scandal so that if we are seen in the same room together people would be looking for stension that sexual tension some people confuse tension and sexual tension but they re completely different things one involves wanting to smack each other the other involves wanting to shag each other and the two should never be confused yes harry potter is proving to be an actual problem and here i thought i was just going to fantasize on him for a couple of days nothing ever turns out the way it supposed to damn i ve gone and depressed myself i ll just wander down and see what michael doing perhaps more time spent with together would be beneficial for our relationship and then i could complete half year resolution to get shagged 1 45 p m well i was going to dash out of the way and go eat my feelings but then michael chanced upon me lurking in the hallway he greeted me just in the way a boyfriend should with a kiss and a hug and an expression of regret at our long estrangement i feeling so very jane austen at the moment so forgive me if i inclined to say mr darcy mr darcy and cry at nothing at all it was the most upsetting hug anyone has ever given me it was almost infuriating that he had dared to miss me for i found i ve barely thought of him except in cases of oh god what if michael finds out i ve been an utterly disgraceful girlfriend and i need to find some way of making amends and i really need to purge my mind of harry if i can do that i can return to a state of worrying over pleasing michael instead of what the boy who lived might think i swear when i was more french being with one person and adoring another was so much easier damn americanization 2 45 p m i am beginning to echo ren e sentiments on the whole matter maybe i should move in next door to him it would certainly be less claustrophobic that way i d have my space and i could privately get over harry this would of course mean no subscriptions to any magazines or newspapers at all i should be out of here by tomorrow michael has an apartment in town in a nice complex with plenty of vacancies so surely i could move in next door to him this should be easy i wontsee harry at all it summer he ll probably be off gallivanting across europe with hermione shudder drinking lots and laughing at everything he ll be happy and i resolve to be as well 3 15 p m this is me being happy you see it going very well 3 20 p m as a matter of fact i am so happy and completely not nervous or frightened that i have managed to devour my entire stash of nutri grain bars in the space of five minutes that is how happy and un frazzled i am 4 00 p m and i cantpossibly be unhappy if i ve just eaten about a pound worth of chocolate only happy people eat nutri grain bars and chocolate and root about their room in search of vodka and vermouth only happy people 4 10 p m only happy people drink an entire bottle of vodka in ten minutes see how merry and delighted and completely un unhappy i am how could you possibly consider the slightest chance of my being scared or anxious or confused it simply impossible i the happiest and luckiest girl alive things have turned out well enough and i happy happy 5 00 p m i miserable 5 23 p m pourquoi why am i so malheureux why canti be contente avec le f licit du chocolat that i experienced in our affaire de coeur and move on avec ma vie devote myself to my lovely copain bizarre je parle plus de fran ais que l anglais quand je suis so l o est l alcool j ai le besoin d une boisson 6 00 p m why does everybody seem to think i am drunk just because i never noticed how unusually large the dots on the ceiling were before wow they just turned purple 6 45 p m elle ne peux pas ordonner moi de dormir je d teste la 7 12 p m fleur you are drunk off your ass go to sleep love renee day one thirty four of free independence wednesday june 2nd 2005 having god swing his mighty hammer down upon my head 9 24 am 9 24 a m perhaps should not have had entire bottle of vodka perhaps should have restrained self to a glass or so instead of entire bottle would have stopped self from puking up a pound of chocolate and a stash of nutri grain bars now that secret stash of nutri grain bars is gone what will keep me living why does ren e talk so loudly doesntshe know that god is crushing my brain as she is freaking shouting in my ear 9 49 a m this is the worse hangover ever had horrible wonderful dream about harry wontdisclose the nature of such a dream for fear of diary rejecting such x rated thoughts but will say that it was an odd yet delightful mixture of fireplaces ties chocolate fountains and interestingly jonathan rhys meyers 11 12 a m so who is jonathan rhys meyers ren e asked chucking a bag full of stuff at me as we re packing up my room her to go back and plan her wedding with mother and me to go live next door to michael which i have to remind myself to tell him you read my journal ren e smiled no darling i was just wondering why you were screaming oh jonathan oh jonathan oh jonathan rhys meyers in the middle of the night that all oh um mortifying he this guy from bend it like beckham and velvet goldmine and vanity fair but you wouldntknow what i talking about he s um repulsively attractive um ren e only blinked confusedly at me did you just describe him as being repulsively attractive exactly i exclaimed eager to share the phenomenon that is jrm with poor unwitting ren e it extraordinary he so unattractive he has a bad haircut his nose looks like it been broken several times and he always squinting for no reasons at all he smirks when there nothing to smirk out and he pouts and he grinds his teeth in the most annoying fashion possible and yet you look at him and you think oh my god i want to have his child because he shouldntbe but he is almost maddeningly sexy he is at the same time the ugliest creature i have ever seen and this pure god because ren e he is gorgeous and i am jealous of anyone who gets to make out with him in a cornfield you are so weird she says and then wanders off to go crush and snort her breakfast 12 noon it seems as if effects of harryrexia are reversing themselves noooo evil scale one hundred thirty this is horrible horrible horrible if michael breaks up with me after realizing that living next door to me is almost as annoying as living with me i am going to spend the rest of my life alone because of disgusting unattractiveness of thighs which resemble baby whales if you ask me maybe i should go on the south beach diet again no is too damn hard plus can cause ketosis whatever that is and i love carbs okay what would my self help books say um losing weight is not necessary for me to be a valuable contribution to society i have a dream that one day people will be judged by the content of their character not the size of their jeans i am worthy of love whether i eat chocolate or not no good stomach is viciously contradicting me with evidence of its pooching out like so i have no abs my thighs look like baby whales in themselves as opposed to ren e who has the thighs of a miniature pony my hips could take over the world i faaaaat sigh maybe this is not my fault maybe once i have my own apartment far away from hogwarts where they ladle pumpkin juice down your throat and ask you to find the virgin i ll be able to focus on my health regimen nts create health regimen 3 10 p m all right have bags sitting faithfully next to me as i look upon the great hall for the last time until next year tear michael is rushing up beside me being infuriatingly good looking ooh ties oh right must tell him about next door arrangement 3 20 p m all right went v well considering how v badly it could have gone i was very much um michael i know you asked me to move in with you and i know i said yes but i think that it was hasty decision making on my part i still want us to be together of course but maybe it would be better if i just lived next door had horrible slightly crestfallen boy thing going on was not fair to anyone especially passers by who might have swooned oh all right he says making it painfully evident that this is not exactly what he wanted or expected i wanted to grab him by his tie and snog him beyond reason but realized would not help situation except that he might think i was crazy then i realized i am crazy so i grabbed him by his tie and snogged him beyond reason i just want to take it slow that all i said but not so slow that we donthave sex or so slow that we start going backwards and begin to just hold hands or that i suddenly have cooties and am icky he gave me this look this if i lean in close i can see your soul look and then he nodded and said okay damn you american boys and your damn soul searching looks and damn your sexy ties 5 04 p m oh my he does have a nice apartment flat building thing i mean it great i begin to wonder if he gay because no man decorates like this it very together and with very soft carpeting but i dontlive here i going to go remind myself of that and peek in next door that right dragging my suitcase along to the next door apartments now 8 23 p m am in bed in spartan new apartment drinking oh shut up stop judging me was carting boxes back and forth from hallway into room eventually had dumped truckload worth of stuff into apartment mostly in one corner though and all things like scented candles and little mini foe glasses that i dontthink work anymore and was carrying empty box downstairs to dispose of and possibly grab soda or similar got to top of stairs happy and sprightly because a boyfriend and i are on marvelous terms as of late and no chance of him chucking me re any affairs i may or may not have had b have realized apartment mine not boyfriend s has lovely view out window and c have started new chapter in life to paraphrase mum but then was humming one of fall out boy songs with distressingly long titles when a certain sight caused me to drop cardboard box down stairs in shock god fleur said sight smiled first you steal my underwear and then you try and murder me with a cardboard box lord voldemort has nothing on you i assure you so spoke harry potter 9 00 p m am not sure how this has happened still in bed drinking yes i realize this is a very popular nice apartment complex yes i realize that there was a very attractive ad in the papers just a few weeks ago on it i realize multiple vacancies due to deaths and heart attacks and random vanishing etc would make this place a likely target for those newly out of the whole school thing as would the reasonable rent but harry harry i am being very calm i think relatively considering normal state of calm yes v calm aaaaah harry harry feel like might as well be yelling stella stella humph life is ruined 9 30 p m well is bloody good thing never had life in the first place 9 45 p m half year resolution as is june never get life will only wreck it i shall proceed with losing my life immediately er in manner of reverse get a life syndrome 10 00 p m okay have reached reasonable level of calm not to insinuate that i wasntcalm before but this version involves less capitals and exclamation points so what if harry and all his friends have moved in to the apartment complex that i happen to be living in so what if ron and harry and her will be sharing my living space i will be calm and composed in manner of princess di will not however marry big eared unattractive husband who should not be so childishly prince anymore but rather king or duke or similar would rather be a duke than a prince at his age beside point i am calm and composed and i will walk by them and be damn what that word poised i am poised you couldntbe more poised than me i am like the poise queen or miss poise or empress poise i am so poised that i should have the very word copyrighted damnation wish i were poised day one thirty five of free independence thursday june 3rd 2005 trying to look seductive while eating breakfast 11 30 am 11 30 a m so have popped over to michael and am realizing that this arrangement will be just like living together except we wontbe sleeping within the same walls perhaps decreases chance of fulfilling resolution to get shagged however am sure sleepovers can be arranged he is making me breakfast even though he wonders at how one can wake up at 11 30 on a thursday and eat breakfast well that is just the wonder that is me plus i stayed up far too late last night memorizing definition of word poised with dictionary and bottle of sherry in hand only to wake up this morning and not remember it at all so we are making lovely conversation he is talking about egypt and describing the breathtaking scenery and seeing the pyramids and conversing with house elves over important issues interject based on acquaintance with one such house elf forward thinking coffee offering dobby from hogwarts love that little elf even when he walks around carting chocolate cake though i am on a diet looks can be deceiving i swear i am suddenly he is very much so how did asp go while i was away horrid question hooorrid was drinking orange juice with breakfast spat it back out again looked at michael red eyes wide in gaping horror little bits of orange juice dripping from my chin excuse me how d asp go while i was away panic panic oh i say cheerily great lessons harry took the aspire i ll just pop over and see how his results were 12 noon thus bolted out of apartment to find hallway was frightfully cold as was only wearing oversized men oxford shirt in attempt to appear sexy and seductive for morning pop over to eat breakfast with hot lover in manner of trashy pride and prejudice sex romp crossover but kept running down halls and found door 16 which is harry door which he told me after cardboard box massacre and insanely burst through door broad smile on and not much else to find harry and her on the sofa hermione just looked at me as if she was thinking horrid slut i bet she planned to come over here like that and harry was looking at me like if am not mistaken whose shirt is that i wish she would take it off which was very unsettling did not take off shirt might have had hermione not been there perhaps am horrid slut no too many trashy novels anyway how d your exam go i twittered wishing i d worn shoes then realizing wearing shoes and then forgetting pants seems stranger than not wearing clothing for entire lower half of body in the first place harry was examining shirt oh um flying colors the examiner said i should look forward to a career in getting kidnapped and weaseling my way out of it with a wink and a well placed have you lost weight laughed then realized hermione was glaring a hole in my flesh and stopped um well that all i wanted to ask i said now realize that i must have sounded like i had just made up aspire question as a reason to come over making hermione hate me more right because she totally didnthate me enough before so then i dashed out of the doorway and back over to 24 michael apartment he passed with flying colors i said waving arms wildly in attempt to hide nervousness all attempts are failures i now realize arentyou cold asked michael gesturing vaguely at too big shirt then i suddenly realized that i must look horrible with half of thighs also known as killer whales in view plus cellulite and no make up on and demi hangover arentyou cold probably meant you look like hell oh cold me no why should i be cold i only practically naked well i suppose i a little bit cold turned out to be skillful come on he was very much here some tea and then i was very much thank you kindly and then we were very much snuggle kiss snuggle snuggling is very nice in overlarge oxford shirts i highly recommend it 3 00 p m am back in own apartment am still pure okay not pure virginal being but considerably more snuggled i suppose i should write a letter to jacques informing him of current situation and new floo address so that i can bother him in emergencies and he can know where to bother back will not include account of snuggling and tea in letter though am tempted is sort of thing one would write to a female friend about but am in short supply of those at present time i will instead console myself in thinking about it constantly hmmm snuggle afterglow 4 00 p m i think michael should be a bit more perturbed about the fact that students are living down the hall i am then again i have a very good reason to be perturbed at certain students are living in the general area but one would think that being a teacher and living around students during the summer would be like working as a lumberjack and spending all summer in the forest i suppose he intends to just ignore them i think i shall adopt this attitude 5 00 p m v tempted to dash over to harry again have already changed out of oxford shirt but still but am resisting the overpowering temptation by sitting in my apartment which is still not really set up yet and reading lord of the necklaces an enchanting fantasy tale involving elves and curious creatures called moppets that have hairy hands and one such moppet named freud o who has come into possession of a necklace that is pure evil it been very good so far except for the one paragraph in which freud o says i was born completely bald with hair only on my fingers it my one single vanity i brush them three hundred strokes a day i am now reading a detailed account of how the moppet is preparing for tea it all very riveting but i do wish the tea set could talk it would make things a bit more interesting 6 00 p m still making tea 7 00 p m still making tea 8 00 p m for god sakes the damn moppet has been making tea for the past 200 pages does this person have nothing better to do than describe how imaginary people eat and drink 9 00 p m okay a sexy and feminine man with a long blonde mane is fighting with his bow and arrow now so i forgive the author for his thing with the tea sets only problem is from picture on cover i keep expecting the sexy blonde man to stomp his feet and whinny hm wish sexy and feminine blonde horse elf man would shag the mysterious dark fallen king one who never bathes perhaps the description of their break to eat lunch would be more tolerable if two very sexy people were slashing it up on the picnic table gaaaaaaaah they re making tea again will never finish this book will go watch play instead maybe in the play the tea sets will talk and give commentary on the elf and the king slashing it up on the picnic table day one thirty six of free independence friday june 4th 2005 preparing to go exercise v good 8 30 am 8 30 a m look i have woken up earlier than usual and am going to go exercise and thus promote a healthier lifestyle or at least i can trot around in adorable new exercise outfit for a few hours and come back and eat chocolate as reward for all the exercise i ve been doing sure am going to jog out the door now and take to the streets running my little french heart out mm hm 9 45 a m v unsettling bumped into horrid blonde oddity that has no long blond mane akin to sexy fantasy elf creatures i would have thought draco was too high and mighty to get an apartment of his own rather than sticking with his family in his manor thing but perhaps has become disowned because of some un evil behavior would investigate if cared but do not care so will not investigate anyway bumped into draco who gave me both a wink and a once over which was really more like a twice over before launching into a monologue in typical draco fashion ah couldntkeep your hands away from me could you even got into the same building as me i quite impressed he said somewhere between ah my love kitten has followed me home and let take this party somewhere more private love love kitty i dontappreciate that draco pet name for me is now love kitty draco i didntfollow you here this is just an unfortunate coincidence i maintained as he gave me a look that makes some extremely perverted slytherin girls melt come on fleur let not deny it any longer you want me and for a little while he said with a dirty smile i ve been entertaining thoughts about you i think it would be a crime against nature to hold back this passion any longer he said flying at me had to duck then rush to side of him to escape overeager mouth of draco malfoy was afraid he would start purring at me saying here love kitty here love kitty in manner of nightmares draco this is sexual harassment was unable to even get out of the front of the apartment complex so was dashing around our hall trying to get draco to stop diving for me which is annoyingly difficult since he has been training really hard for quidditch and dontcall me love kitty of course of course harry opened the door just as draco pinned me to the wall and i screamed dontcall me love kitty because that just the way things work in my life what the hell and then harry was staring at me and then at draco and then at me again but not in a shirt analyzing manner which was rather thrilling if i do admit but rather in an disquieting conjecture making sort of way and then after a few seconds of pensive looking he marched out of his doorway tore draco away from me and punched him in the nose bless his sexy heart fleur are you all right i will be i said resolutely i then proceeded to kick draco in the groin several times now i fine have now realized that kicking draco is solution to everything if every person in the world could just step up and give the boy a swift kick there would be no unhappiness for it is the greatest satisfaction harry looked on as if he were trying to suppress his amusement and then he grinned and invited me inside for tea 12 noon i dontthink you re supposed to have tea at ten o clock in the morning though how would i know since i not usually awake at ten o clock in the morning over the holidays but it was quite nice especially as after party to having participated in a joint flogging of draco malfoy i have a feeling the malfoy winks will be lessening considerably from now on but anyhow sat there and drank tea which is all anyone ever does apparently and was relieved to find that harry does not have an ornate 200 page tea ritual to complete before he eats his seventh breakfast of the day like some people do but then hermione came back from buying a book at flourish and blotts and gave us a look as if to say harry how could you do this to me and be seen with this cheap pick up after you said those lovely things and promised that there was nothing going on between you similar to soap opera looks that say everything and very expressively with exclamation marks so i smiled as best i could and thanked harry for tea and scampered back to my own apartment and realized that staying away was v hard and if i can manage it i will deserve some sort of prize 5 00 p m affol d affaires courant name fleur delacour height 5 foot 8 weight 125 which is where i always end up anyway though it would be nice if could lose six or so pounds and be under one twenty so could dance around and wear the

was tea i suppose five points back for tea day one forty two of free independence thursday june 10th 2005 trying to look seductive while eating breakfast 10 10 am 10 10 a m am lying in bed afraid to pop over to michael as has become comforting custom because i am still wrestling with dilemma of foolproof stay away from harry plan ideas for foolproof stay away from harry plans 1 have constant sex with michael will be too busy shagging furiously in flat four doors down from harry to have tea with harry however is not foolproof as how much can one shag before it just becomes boring and boyfriend begins to wonder if after years of pent up virginity one has transformed into nymphomaniac 2 be so obnoxious annoying etc that hermione files restraining order against me and i wontbe legally able to see him anymore however flats are too close together and would have to move all over again plus would upset boyfriend 3 go on campaign of totally repulsing him constant nasty food like brussels sprouts stuck in teeth foul onion breath etc would never want to kiss me or be in the general vicinity with me ever again however would undoubtedly repulse boyfriend as well this is not going very well 2 05 p m trying to keep reading lord of the necklaces but there some sort of waterfall or something i dontknow i not really paying attention to what happening as every other line is my sweetie my sweetie over necklace anyhow my mind keeps wandering back to harry why is he always there around is someone trying to tell me something about dear sexy harry that i am not getting grrr doesntmatter as he and i are both taken admittedly love being taken my michael who is sweet and funny and adorable and makes good tea and has no objection to oxford shirts whatsoever but i still wonder exactly how harry would like oxford shirt snuggling oh god what have i done it the middle of the afternoon for god sake and now i ve brought on images of harry and i oxford snuggling damn it would be bloody lovely would oxford snuggle before the view of the city until the sun goes down and then i would make toast and he would make tea and we would wait until the stars came out oh it ruddy lovely i cantstand it not at all will have to go drown self in bottle of sherry again i mean it after noon right there nothing wrong with drinking after noon 6 12 p m remind me not to drink after noon as a matter of fact i ve got a new half year resolution shall stop drinking so much as solution to every problem or else i going to end up with the livers of grandm re jeanette and grandp re gustav which would be tr s distressful half year resolutions 1 be honest caring loving girlfriend to michael 2 stop with the harry fantasizing and strange sexually charged encounters bad for psychological state mm hm 3 find good self help books that dontcorrupt and ruin mind into believing things on rubber bands though whole rubber band thing may be right because i pulled really far away from draco and he sure came snapping back find self esteem improving book and learn to be independent and not to need boyfriend to complete me at same time maintaining said boyfriend in non hypocritical manner 4 mend fences with hermione otherwise push her off one 5 get lovely career involving travel and good pay and preferably not teenage boys or harry or quidditch players or people who frequently wear ties or silk boxers 6 be less sex obsessed 7 lose five pounds look like i ve lost five pounds stop wanting to lose five pounds or have everyone tell me i dont need to lose five pounds 8 stop obsessing over people who arentobsessing over me and obsessing over how i can make them obsess over me in a reciprocal obsessive manner 9 be lovely friend to jacques who has been wonderful and kind though i have not always deserved it for some like twelve years or so plus buy him something nice for christmas not soap or really feminine vanilla sugar bodywash as that will be for me 10 drink less as is not solution to all of problems rather the above 9 items are everybody knows the world would be filled with bunnies and rainbows if i could lose five pounds 7 00 p m is very strange i think that i have left hogwarts and it is in the very middle of the summer holidays and yet somehow to think of mr hardy i no farther from the madding crowd a n ha ha teriyaki triumphant i have mastered the computer the internet cannot

everything it just what i do all right that it love you review femme teriyaki day one forty three of free independence friday june 18th 2005 locking the liquor cabinet 9 00 am 9 00 a m mm hm i locking the liquor cabinet no drinking cold turkey no harry also cold turkey i am successful good valuable human being who does not need a teenage lover or a cosmo to make me happy though i do love the delightful pink color 11 12 a m numbers looked out of door to see if harry there twice walked by harry place pressed ear to door and sighed when realizing he isntthere 8 times briefly imagined harry snogging self 25 times saw hermione imagined pushing her off a fence hands twitched with delightful sensation that would come with said pushing and had to run back into apartment to stop self from throwing her off a fence 6 times wanted to go on a recon mission and discover just how close harry and said girlfriend on well all day attempted aborted recon missions 17 times number of times floo d jacques only to find he isntthere but probably gallivanting in wonderland with janine 20 times times wondered if will die alone then remembered boyfriend 31 times times wondered why i attractive enough to kiss but not attractive enough to leave girlfriends for 149 times number of sadness induced binges of chocolate eating 5 number of pages completed in lord of the necklaces 2 i saw the word tea and threw the book across the room halcius pottotius is more interesting 2 00 p m popped over to michael s but he wasntthere he was off buying groceries or something sensible isntthat ridiculous i have a sensible boyfriend so i was wandering around the apartment when i decided to leave him a little note michael it fleur i thinking we should go out on the town tonight and celebrate the end of the school year and the beginning of the summer holidays drop by if you agree xoxoxo fleur see if i go on a date with my boyfriend then i am obviously not thinking about harry at all if i go on a date with my boyfriend harry is the farthest thing from my mind i will just have to throw myself head on into my relationship with michael that all very simple so simple that it will be so wonderfully difficult damn it oh well i got in a new order of trashy books to read including a new series of pure shallow vapid trashiness named wealthy witch which features a host of rich attractive shallow people who spend their lives in designer clothes and chronicles their scandalous activities but one witch somehow knows all the goings on in london where the story takes place including what going on between all the main characters something she keeps the world privy to through private owl posts c est vraiment scandaleux anyway it all beginning with some impossibly lovely girl returning to her old school after transferring to some other stupid magic school much to the chagrin of her old best friend i only two pages in but it gratuitously name dropped eighteen times i have a feeling this is going to be like reading a magazine without the pictures ooh expensive shoes ooh expensive dresses restaurant name dropping celebrity name dropping wow someone obviously obsessed with the iris summer collection 3 00 p m you know it true the new jean cavell line exclusively for witches of tall stature is not as enrapturing as advertising made it out to be these vapid shallow trashy type books make very valid points if only i didnthave to hide them under the bed every time i hear footsteps in the hall for fear someone would catch me reading them it only the fact that they just scream this is where the disaffected youth gets all of its bad ideas from otherwise i d proudly okay not proudly considering the semi pornographic bikini pictures on cover indicating sexiness within on covers read these in parks and in lobbies across the country as it is however i must content myself to reading catcher in the rye and pretending i know what the hell it about 4 00 p m jacques i cantbelieve you dontknow what catcher in the rye is about he saying okay how is it that jacques has read every book in the wizarding world and in the muggle world cross continentally and how is it that he has managed to actually understand them bastard it a classic coming of age story salinger masterpiece in my opinion perhaps better than harper lee to kill a mockingbird despite the pulitzer prize she won for it name dropper you dontfreaking floo someone in the middle of the day and then when the person tries to strike up a lovely conversation about things you both like oxford commas books with shiny covers pickles etc tell them about their literary ignorance w shameless name dropping evil harper lee ing and salinger ing and steinbeck ing and keats ing just because he knows i have no idea who truman capote is does not mean he has the right to name drop him or worse name dangle him because he knows i do not know who that is and must nod ignorantly he a name dangler it about the search for self chasing identity striking out on one own the strange and lost period between adolescence and adulthood good god fleur pretend like you re listening why dontyou just because my belly button lint is more interesting than your literary critique of a book i will never understand does not mean i not pretending like i listening you re a crappy pretender jacques says shaking his head oh why thank you i trying to be a more real person i admitted carefully kicking wealthy witch book two you must be aware that you are harboring affection for me under the bed twenty more words and it would be as long as an alternative rock song title you know less shallow more in touch with the importance of today world what is that whaaaat i ask quizzically reaching for book three with my toe with one more nudge i sure i can discreetly place it next to book two underneath the bed and save contemplating how small the font has to be to put the scope of everything i desire encompasses everything there is on a book cover for later the book you just kicked under the bed is that oh crap he looking shocked oh no ohhh no not a wealthy witch book fleur noooo what they re addictive it okay to live vicariously through things sometimes isntit is it my fault that i personally think it would be kind of cool to be living in london being beautiful and having lovely romantic adventures with my boyfriend and having perhaps a scandalously sexy tryst with the boy down the hall fleur you freak what i have a feeling i going to spend my entire life asking jacques that very question that is your life jacques clarifies he must be referring to the london tryst with boy down the hall type thing which is not as fun as the books make it seem like it would be especially with tiring aspects of aborted recon missions sure minus the scandal sex and beauty i sometimes want to walk up to your head and see if anybody home you re very random oh trust me i not he replies his eyes dart a bit and i assume that he is scanning the room oh god fleur please promise me that underneath your bed is not the third worst book ever written for the sole reason that that my value that and book five i adore it in that particular fashion i replied smiling weakly you have the entire collection dontyou he asks eyes wide jacques is afraid of anything with an iq of less than 120 which makes me wonder sometimes why he ever hangs out with me as i have the most erratic iq known to man for example at the time of lucky shamrocks incident my iq was at about 27 these books must seem to be the inauguration of the death of human intelligence sigh that what you get when you re brilliant fleur do you have the entire collection you exist as the singular being that i covet there isntanyone who can achieve it in a superior fashion and like a rock band we ll fall apart eventually yes i have all eight books please dontkill me i haventread all of them yet you scare the crap out of me you really do jacques says i donteven understand it when i around you i feel like i living in the twilight zone doo dee doo doo doo dee doo doo i going to have nightmares and i going to blame you doo dee doo doo doo dee doo doo well if you re going to be like that i going to send you pictures of mick jagger in the mail and see how you like it and mimes no okay everyone is creeped out by the twilight zone it is completely evil for jacques to play on my irrational fear of mimes and mick jagger i sometimes have nightmares about his old crinkly self jumping out of a dark alley with a hacksaw screaming i mime who wants to maim you to the tune of i cantget no satisfaction though as jacques points out this dream is totally illogical since if mick jagger really were a mime he would be violently miming maiming me instead of actually speaking right because i totally thinking about the logic of my dreams as the oldest man alive is trying to kill me jacques that was mean and evil i am shivering look at me the thought of mick jagger has chilled me to the bone my apartment is no longer safe what if that nut job breaks into my apartment fleur i want you to stop and think jacques says slowly do you really think that mick jagger would really have an interest in breaking into your apartment you never know what a skinny rock star like him might do next i proclaim it the skinny ones you have to watch out for i thinking of going on a feed the rock stars campaign i will start with feeding that drummer from velvet revolver then i will run away as fast as i can what is it with you and rock stars blame jules casablancas i tell him seriously jules casablancas is my life if i d never gone to america i might have tragically continued living without the knowledge of his beloved existence his voice is like a calvin klein underwear model his face is not who cares i had this intense dream about him singing alone together to me while wearing a red silk cravat in the manner of fabio once i could have sworn it was real but jacques says there is no way a rock star would be wearing a silk cravat you re crazy really crazy and i telling you there is no logical reason jules casablancas would be wearing a silk cravat jacques is now buzzing around in his apartment tidying things up in the ocd way that he does i sometimes want to throw a duster at him but i usually refrain what if his grandmother gave it to him and then she found out he was going to be on tv and she was all julie are you going to wear the cravat i gave you last christmas and then he couldntsay no as he has not only the voice but the heart of a calvin klein underwear model and so after some protesting of nana stop calling me julie i know you wanted a granddaughter but this is going too far nana hang up the damn phone will you i have to go onstage in like thirty minutes he finally gave in and started looking for the cravat but then he couldntfind it so he had to go to the fabio store jacques is now choking on his own laughter so he had to go to the fabio store the only store in new york carrying red silk cravats and buy a cravat so he could wear it onstage to please his grandmother it perfectly logical or maybe since he a rock star he needed something to throw at the screaming female fan girls and all his other clothes were too valuable to him to throw at them so he found the red silk cravat which was the only thing he hated enough to throw away and decided to perform a cravat striptease later on in the show jacques has now fallen and he cantget up he is officially dying of laughter what i would not be opposed in any way to a cravat striptease as performed by jules casablancas as a matter of fact i should make a t shirt cravat striptease oh yes please jacques has now restored himself to his rightful position wow fleur without you there d be a lot less laughter in my life hmmm not sure whether or not to take that as a compliment 5 00 p m i am not sure whether i should stop over and see whether michael is back from being sensible on the town i am however very sure that it would be an extremely bad idea for me to pop out into the hall and see if harry is there is it popping out into the hall if only my head pops out of the door well i sure it not i going to go look out 5 25 p m aah he was there he was looking gorgeous he was laughing animatedly he was leaning against the wall in his trademark shag me shag me i am asking to get shagged manner he was torturing me the damn eye candy he was torturing me he is in direct violation of the geneva convention okay fine i lived in a america for a year do you seriously want me to know what that is 7 35 p m michael is currently dropping by as per my request and says he is happy to celebrate the end of the school year with me he taking me to a french restaurant in honor of the french ness i know you thought was gone hee hee plan for de lustification is going beautifully 10 45 p m beautifully beautifully i said no my plan is just about as beautiful as shivers steven tyler crap now i have to lock my windows and doors hold on 11 00 p m done locking windows doors plugging crevices and blocking fireplace have had to turn all of the lights on like i did when i was ten i ve had to plug my ears with the sounds of alone together just to stop feeling shivery and scared i should listen to more pop music i think rock is doing nothing for me fleur delacour personally most influential music stars of all time 1 jules casablancas for obvious reasons he has recently surpassed jude law in amount of thinking minutes i believe this is a sign he needs his own category in my aac of course the fact remains that all my j boys jude jules and jonathan will stay in my heart forever no matter who happens to be first in the minute count still when did jude law last wear a cravat exactly 2 tie steven tyler and mick jagger because i am equally scared to death of both of them steven tyler looks like a caricature of himself with his skinny little body and his huge head and overlarge collagen lips of unsurpassed width and his screaming at concerts as opposed to singing how the hell did he father liv tyler and then there mick jagger who looks like he belongs in a tomb at giza and someone has illegally dug him up and intends to sell him on the black market 3 fall out boy adore them despite recent shot to fame because i loved them before that though i am not sure whether or not take this to your grave is as good or better than from under the cork tree i am very sure that i can look forward to great things from them except for judging from a recent snl performance not to be all judgmental or anything or to suggest anything that might result in lawsuits of libel slander etc i pretty sure one of them is on drugs i not saying which one especially not the one with the penchant for smucker uncrustables but i just saying you re not supposed to play your guitar like that i not saying which one though but it definitely not the one who looks like he should be on the addams family as he has stolen the skin of the lead singer in good charlotte and put it on definitely not 4 britney spears as you can tell my life ambition is now to be a pop star slowly spend my youth wearing less and less clothing then finally have my backup singer baby in a culmination of everything trashy somewhere in there i will also abuse my baby and walk through public bathrooms with no shoes on because everyone knows rich people cantget e coli anyway i honestly must say that after having spent the majority of my life in a school uniform at beauxbatons there had to be someone i was channeling she sparked the sexiness of uniforms i must say what a trailblazer oh baby baby how was i supposed to know that babies should wear car seats 5 relient k they taught the united states how to incorrectly spell reliant and single handedly lowered everyone verbal sat scores by 10 points also thanks to them while i was in the us i lost two pounds before i gained eight on sheer vomiting it was the emo i allergic levels of over eight parts per billion can be toxic 6 the killers not only is their music lovely but their mr brightside music video

date tomorrow before john legend and adam levine beat me in my sleep day one forty four of free independence saturday june 19th 2005 contemplating aesthetically displeasing quality of de lustification plans 10 20 am 10 20 a m as i was saying last night my date was not beautiful michael and i arrived at the restaurant being generally happy with each other laughing amicably as i was noting to myself how having a boyfriend who is not harry potter is just fine we were seated and we were served with lovely french cuisine we were still laughing amicably nothing was going wrong everything was going in a generally lovely manner then then i really glad we went out tonight says michael eating in a very admirable manner i mean most of the time when guys eat it like watching a cannibal eat someone leg however michael was very neat about the entire thing and he was courteously not paying attention to the girls across the room that were giggling and smiling suggestively in his direction i haventhad fun like this in a long time he smiles he says all the right things it almost as nice as it would be if it were harry saying all the right things but this is good it heartwarming in a very demi platonic way it nice having such a safe girlfriend i was happily sipping on chardonnay which is not liquor but fine wine and completely different from regular alcohol enjoying the ambience of the room and the music of the self playing violins i was happily partaking of some very excellent escargot and then all of sudden the brakes screeched in my head excuse me so i did what i always do in my infinite attractiveness the escargot rocketed itself out of my mouth onto the front of michael shirt and i stared at him in terror as if he had suddenly turned to mick jagger before my eyes is there something wrong he asked wrong wrong well yes there something wrong i your safe girlfriend no i said politely and meekly my eyes looking for something other than him to concentrate on until sanity and composure were regained and my eyes found something all right harry and hermione across the restaurant happily eating together they were sharing a plate excuse me i said making my way towards the bathroom composure where are you poised i poised though apparently i am not poised i am safe like seatbelts and birth control pills so i stood in the bathroom unsure of whether to vomit tear my hair out or cry after several minutes of contemplation all of them seemed like very bad very useless ideas what would jesus do i thought and then i wondered why jesus was being called safe by his boyfriend what would grandm re jeanette do of course then i realized that grandm re jeanette was happily married until my grandp re tragic death and would not need to deal with this stupid problem what would ren e do ren e always has answers for everything then i realized that ren e is probably the most unsafe person i know she should have hazardous tattooed on her foot wait she does so what did i do i suddenly developed a stomach bug and went home 12 noon nobody ever told me i was safe i wish someone had i would have joined a motorcycle gang or something i could have started chain smoking or gone touring with a rock band or dear god i so safe that i cantthink of any more dangerous things i could do 1 04 p m perhaps the dictionary will understand what i cannot safe sayf adjective comparative

me at any given time otherwise he will just go partying in las vegas and not worry if i ll be there when he gets back my being safe equals him being free free to do whatever whoever whenever he wants noooo 3 45 p m i must make a list unsafe things that dangerous people do 1 dangerous people do crazy things like jump off buildings and walk across hot coals but i really dontthink any of that is very sexy unless perhaps johnny depp did it in his pirates of the caribbean costume 2 dangerous people are always moving on motorcycles private jets and in fast cars of course you turn around and they are suddenly gone leaving you wondering for days where they went and why dangerous people also do these things wearing fabulous clothes however as am in the wizarding world random disappearances arentall that exciting so the only thing left is the fabulous clothing 3 dangerous people are hot people who wouldntworry that their significant other could be lost at any given time when their significant other is hotter than the surface of the kitchen stove when it on especially when everyone else has come to notice how dangerously hot aforementioned significant other is 4 dangerous people have mysterious histories of dangerous activities like for example aylesford is marrying ren e who is dangerous and has a list of dangerous activities in her past that is a mile long to her credit ren e has chain smoked in eight different countries all spur of the moment trips been in a french motorcycle gang had 37 different boyfriends been praised as beauxbatons hottest alumna ever by the pretty sticks monthly magazine and she has spent 87 percent of her life in naughty lingerie she has modeled in italy gotten a jailhouse tattoo reading hazardous in a turkish prison and jumped off a bridge in the cayman islands and when she was twenty she spent two months touring with the weird sisters naturally when aylesford realizes this probably when the caterer they hire for their wedding remembers her from an excursion in moscow he is going to be scared to death he is going to lose her thus ren e will have the fastest most expensive wedding ever i unfortunately do not have a mysterious history of dangerous activities because i am the least mysterious person on the face of the planet i could not be mysterious if i tried the only dangerous and mysterious things i have done are things i do not want my boyfriend to know about i e certain underwear incidents 7 23 p m i am still thinking of ways to be dangerous and it is not working i would be scared out of my mind to jump off a bridge i too scared to jump off my bed in the mornings walking across hot coals would ruin my already unattractive feet forever and then it would probably hurt to wear flip flops slingbacks or sandals i d probably have to rub salve on them in the mornings after i cautiously step out of bed how disgusting oh dear in the wizarding world where are the private jets and fast cars and motorcycles somehow riding off into the sunset on a fast broom doesntconjure the same feelings though i must admit when it comes to certain high flying broom riders i wouldntmind so much as for hotness i ve tried to be hot i have tried soooo hard i have tried working out every diet book in the world and i still 127 pounds bah humbug i look flabby i feel flabby and i so lucky that i was the second child instead of the third because otherwise i would have the unfortunate nickname of flabby gabby for the rest of my life the only people who would flock to my supposed hotness would include snape and draco malfoy how promising i ve never smoked a cigarette let alone chain smoked one the only countries i ve ever been to are france england and america quite predictably my boyfriend count stands at 6 the entire administration of beauxbatons can only recall my name in connection with the words oh it that girl who embarrassed us at the triwizard cup let spit on her memory all my modeling has been in front of the mirror i deathly afraid of needles and even more afraid of tattoos given without needles i ve never been to prison all my experiences with naughty lingerie and underwear in general have been a bit bizarre at best and mortifying at worst i only tour with rock stars that d be julian casablancas in my dreams and i definitely dont have excursions in moscow my mysterious history is less than riveting i donthave an adoring band of followers who believes ardently in my hotness i dontdo crazy dangerous things unless you count certain stupid childish inadvisable things i have done over the past say two months or so i dontrandomly disappear or leave the country leaving questions in my wake and i have now been crowned safe queen of the northern hemisphere goody i so wish i hadntlocked the liquor cabinet day one fifty one of free independence saturday june 26th 2005 defining dangerous 8 17 am 8 17 a m haventseen michael all week as i am still sick with the sudden stomach bug that viciously attacked me at dinner last friday dontcome over love fleur have instead been brainstorming on being dangerous dangerous activities this week none dangerous activities this month none dangerous activities this year well i did flee to bordeaux for a month but that wasnt exactly dangerous i did end up in a lucky shamrocks scandal but of course michael doesntknow that i found a cigarette yesterday i could have smoked it however i couldntfind matches or a lighter so i threw it out good god am i a witch or arenti i couldntfind matches or a lighter so i threw it out good god it like i ve been turned into a squib or something 8 45 a m i have just set fire to a bar of soap just to prove to myself that i am still a witch wait does that count as being dangerous 10 00 a m i am so pathetic i just going to go to flourish and blotts and buy a book on being dangerous i might as well since i cannot manage it on my own 11 37 a m i am at flourish and blotts slowly coming to terms with the fact that there is no how to be dangerous section in this store and now i simply wandering through the reference section over and over and over ohhh crap 4 47 p m how dare harry read books he practically a superhero he definitely does not need to read that just ridiculous and if he does need to read canthe just be content with the daily prophet or something canthe just sit at his coffee table and read about the successes of wizards across the world perhaps the latest news at gringotts damn now i thinking of a very shirtless harry sitting at a coffee table reading the paper anyway i was in the reference section looking for books on general dangerousness fruitlessly and harry was there it like he has nothing better to do than be wherever it is i am i swear he trying to seduce me it all thanks to asp lesson 14 2 seducing your superiors or as i always called it getting the people above you under you so he was standing in reference fingering spines etc and generally looking for things and then he heard me gasp at the mere sight of him no less and looked up god he looks so sexy when he just looking up shivers so anyway he looked up at me and smiled the i undressing you in my mind as we speak smile no less and said v casually hey hey since when does hey sound anything like i love you fleur let make haste towards the dictionaries and make passionate love because that what i heard hey i said in return wishing i hadntchosen the grey skirt to wear out it too short and too lightweight if ever there was a skirt prone to blowing up at the slightest disturbance it that skirt so books i said i sounded very intelligent not he laughed yes books at which point i started looking frantically towards the dictionaries wondering at which point we were going to make passionate love why is it that from harry words like books and hey are immediately translated into something sexual then he started walking towards me all slowly and wonderfully as if he knew i really really really wanted to make a mad dash for the dictionaries then brief and blinding images of chocolate fountain bliss flashed into my head and i afraid i let out another little gasp which stopped harry what must have been feet but felt like inches away from me are you all right i had lost the capacity to utter entire sentences hiccups i whispered it doesntmake any sense that i suddenly hoped that a common cure for hiccups included prolonged snogging you should get some water he said why were we whispering that what doesntmake sense why were we whispering oh i get it he was whispering just to seduce me you re right i whispered back the feet between us had finally reduced to inches dangerous inches you know i have lots of water in my flat he said for a moment i forgot that the world is 75 percent water and that i had a tap in my own flat oh really i queried he nodded and grinned in far too suggestive a manner for someone straight out of school follow me i have the perfect cure for your hiccups he said while i frantically thought to myself please let it be kissing please let it be kissing please let it be kissing all right everyone in the world should know that hiccups even fake hiccups invented to cover up one own lust cantbe cured by making out furiously with harry potter i was just praying that harry didntknow that so we got to his apartment which i remember from the tea drinking incident of june 4th and he very graciously got me a glass of water i could swear harry water tastes better than my water then again everything about harry tastes better damn damn damn why do i think these things so i was sitting at his table drinking water as he wandered around the apartment as if he were thinking about something highly serious and then he stopped and started looking at me and looking at me and looking at me and then i started grinning which lead to full on beaming which led to giggling harry i giggled probably seeming as if i had no less intelligence than a stick of butter harry why are you staring at me i not staring at you he said smiling yes you are you re staring at me and i want to know why no i swear i not staring at you harry said blushing in a truly adorable way that only he ever does it like he never did asp at all and he just a blushing adorable little boy a blushing adorable little boy who happens to be the snitch report sexiest teen two years running fine i said giving him a suspicious look finally draining my glass and making my way towards the sink i supposed that since i had come to his flat for water and now i had retrieved and sipped as slowly as possible this water i should leave but i didntwant to leave and besides as i was setting the glass on the sink as slowly as possible i could feel harry eyes on me and with the glass barely crossing from the outermost rim of the sink i couldnthelp but turn around to find harry not feet not inches but millimeters away from me of course i not complaining harry what are you doing whispering again and within a few seconds i realized exactly what harry was doing rather he explained it to me the french way with his mouth kissing and kissing and kissing and kissing and kissing and kissing and harry continued kissing me like a romance novel hands in my hair and everything ridiculous but as if you arentjealous of my ridiculous activities until we got so carried away that the glass i had set on the table fell and shattered into the sink smash i think i should go i said making a break for the door before i turned around and flung my arms around him this is this is a bad idea so i got to the door before harry stopped me with just seven words but your hiccups are gone arentthey he grinned when he right he right 7 12 p m i am pretending as if i have not had harry tongue in my mouth today i am going to concentrate on being dangerous for my boyfriend and for my self esteem i am not going to bite my nails into itty bitty pieces i am calm calm calm i am calm why does he do this to me why does he kiss me and then and then and then kiss me he is taken i am taken we should be respecting each other taken ness instead we are behaving like oversexed teenagers i stopped being a teenager more than a month ago no help help wait a minute when a hormonal french girl calls for help there only one name that comes to mind jacques 8 00 p m i am so glad i floo jacques whenever i do anything as serious as sneezing except for when he pisses the crap out of me jacques why why why are you flooing me now fleur you almost sound as if you arentecstatic to hear from me i sure that just a mistake on my part jacques it was a mistake to floo me yes janine over we re having dinner fleur and i vomiting inside my mouth it like we complete each other jacques what do you want fleur aside from wanting you to stop being a boy bitch i want you to help me jacques hold on batgirl i have to send alfred to bring around the bat mobile dontput on your cape while i not looking fleur i hate you you re not listening to me jacques fine what fleur what i really wanted you to hear was my desperate cries for help help i am desperate jacques just put that on a billboard all your boyfriend troubles

chocolate and never gets fat and models naughty lingerie in stockholm dangerous i wanna be dangerous jacques dangerous i want the d in delacour to stand for dangerous jacques fleur there is no f in dangerous there is an r in dangerous for ren e there is a g in dangerous for gabrielle but there is no f in dangerous fleur what what are you saying are you saying that i safe jacques there is an f in

fleur no stop no i didntmean to insinuate that you re safe you re not safe you re dangerous at least to me by this point i wasnthearing him anymore i was headed for the door to find a lingerie shop i grabbed my coat wow getting a coat to go take your clothes off and opened the door and who did i see standing there but my perpetual savior okay fine put on your cape we re going shopping jacques smiled you re my superhero i beamed throwing my arms around him i know a n for the sake of the sweepstakes true names of the wealthy witch book names mentioned in this chappie for reviewer points 2 reviewer points per correct answer if you win you pick your prize but i sorry i cantsend you a neatly packaged orlando bloom that would constitute kidnapping send me a pm for example wealthy witch is the scope of everything i desire encompasses everything there is is really anyway much love please review july crimes of passion a k a how fleur delacour got her towel back day one fifty six of free independence wednesday july 1st 2005 identifying various shades of i embarrassed red 3 44 pm 3 44 p m i am beginning to wonder what it means that i always end up underwear shopping with jacques perhaps is some sort of sign that underwear is my friend underwear however is not jacques friend seeing as he has turned shall we call it red or crimson i dontthink jacques is comfortable with bra and underwear sets for example i have just picked one up and he is already turning shall we call it scarlet sexy i ask it a very simply yes or no question however jacques seems shall we say completely unable to answer it um um fleur he says in a baffled tone of voice fiddling with his collar fanning himself taking a look at his watch i dontthink jacques is as committed to making me dangerous as he should be considering that it is his job to be my superhero and superheroes help other people after all if he were truly committed to the problem of my lack of dangerousness he would not be frantically searching for exits and shifting uncomfortably right now sexy i ask holding up the red set as opposed to the black set or not sexy really sexy or kind of sexy in cred ibly sexy and then jacques stops making all sense at all and gives himself over to a series of stutters and stammers and blushes fleur ooh too sexy then putting it back is it just me or is jacques incredibly relieved to hear this he takes a deep breath and leans casually as in i am trying desperately to act casual when i really am the most nervous person in the room casual with a fraction of his weight on the side of the dressing room door dressing rooms brilliant you know what jacques maybe i should be trying these on thump jacques are you okay i fine i fine he says picking himself off the floor and dusting himself off and here i never thought of jacques as being the fainting type just a little woozy that all okay perhaps underwear shopping is a tiny bit easier when we re shopping for his underwear 5 47 p m back from a thoroughly exhausting afternoon of lingerie shopping with jacques bought some seventeen outfits which means jacques is on oxygen right now and will not be able to speak for another two hours for sheer embarrassment poor jacques he is currently passed out on my couch jacques i made some tea would you like to come get it i ask feeling very nurse june cleaver like having used a blue and white china pattern that looks very dainty and english i can definitely imagine sipping tea with the queen of england with this china or perhaps with princess diana in heaven which i would imagine would be infinitely more fun fleur i told you i cant stand men are so weird however thanks to underwear shopping etc and dangerous plans my boyfriend will have to stay in love with me supposing he ever was in love with me or will ever fall in love with me and i can stop freaking out sort of you know something like it 6 00 p m have just had absolutely riveting conversation with jacques who is still practically passed out on my couch refusing to drink the tea i am continuously waving underneath his nose can you stand yet no can you stand yet no can you stand yet no jacques i think you need to calm down i said in my wisest voice nodding in a way i imagine nurse june cleaver would to assure the most insane of patients no kidding jacques said plopping his face back into the pillow no offense fleur but i think what would really help me calm down is if you sort of went away after which i tried not to look hurt my version of trying not to look hurt sometimes includes a mild pout and a brief whimper followed by a dejected slackening of posture jacques response to my version of trying not to look hurt is often met with a look of general i must fix this upset ness i mean i not feeling very er calm and you er arentreally helping jacques explained wide eyed his assuring nature always always wins in the end okay i said sighing exasperatedly heading for the door if jacques needs me to go away right now i suppose i shall have to run away into town and have a drink for a while until he properly recovers even if this is not what nurse june cleaver would do as my hand reached the doorknob i was struck by the most brilliant of dangerous ideas jacques how do you feel about nudity calm fleur i am trying to be calm well someone all hot and bothered 7 00 p m am not entirely sure whether or not lingerie shopping venture was a success as the entire thing ended up being rather confusing especially with my own personal in store fashion show while jacques was outside feeling woozy i was in the dressing room changing into a very moulin rouge esque set i have decided the point is not whether or not michael ever actually sees any of my seventeen new underwear choices but the point is that i know i wearing them so i can feel properly dangerous and dangerous minds leads to dangerous actions which leads to well my being dangerous right exactly which equals michael not dumping me and perhaps a vacation in hawaii where he will preferably look only at me jacques i whispered poking my head out of the dressing room door after i d finished changing come in here are you insane jacques exclaimed turning vermillion i not coming in there you re wearing you re wearing well you re not really wearing anything this suggestion seemed to offend jacques sensibilities but i could have sworn a few decidedly male heads swiveled in our direction oh come on jacques it okay it just us besides i ve seen your underwear it totally even you show me yours i show you mine who complaining fleur which is jacques pleading endearing response to everything he doesntwant to do fleur please dontmake me do this i am far too gorgeous to bend to your will which is true please which is my response to jacques pleading because i know that no matter what a well placed please will get jacques every time he lived in england from age four to eight which means his greatest weakness is naturally his politeness i wonder why the same affliction hasntpossessed draco malfoy fleur and he thought he could beat my please with more pleading never please pretty please jacques jacques i looooooove you oh fine he said dashing into the dressing room and locking the door behind him victory why dontthese things have roofs he asked looking upwards and rechecking to make sure the door was locked because the security cameras like to get a view i replied jacques blanched i kidding there are no security cameras relax jacques proceeded to be completely unable to relax are you sure someone could be spying on you right now while you re wearing that that jacques breathe in breathe out and repeat after me lingerie l lingerie i said using the same soothing voice pilates instructor kathy uses after she lies to me about how many repetitions we re going to do linger jacques the word is lingerie and it doesntmatter because you donthave to say it you only have to look at it fleur i really dontthink the combination of me you and lingerie is a very good idea jacques said in a final last ditch attempt to get out of the apparently incredibly unpleasant duty of judging my underwear yay you said it said what lingerie oh god dontpass out just yet i warned now this outfit is it voulez vous coucher avec moi you know how in cartoons sometimes characters eyes become slot machines with dollar signs rolling in them i could have sworn jacques eyes became slot machines with wtf emblazoned on them you you fleur you just asked me to sleep with you and finally at this moment jacques furious blushing seized control of his entire face and he was forced to avert his eyes and try to blush and grin discreetly poor guy that impossible oh god jacques it like you were raised in a barn on a farm and on that farm there was no lady marmalade oh right jacques said in that overexcited high pitched voice he goes into when he nervous thank god why i said apprehensively what wrong with me after which i began frantically doing a slow turn in the mirror trying to figure out what was so horribly disfigured about me do i just disgust you so much that the very idea of my naked body pressed up against yours in a moment of passion oh god fleur stop makes you throw up a little in your mouth the very thought of a feverish lovemaking session avec moi makes you sick to your stomach no i serious fleur stop doing this to me i mean seriously just tell me now why you think i so completely nasty i dontwant to go through my entire life not knowing why i so repulsive no there nothing wrong with you you re fantastic i mean you re you re pauvre jacques at this point i realized jacques was going to die saying sorry if i didntnot halt him immediately it okay i forgive you it doesntmatter you dont have to sleep with me i acquiesced knowing jacques was about to go into one of his stuttering rambling flustered attempts at apologizing which are just so adorable to watch but i sure incredibly mortifying for him i don t jacques do you have property of fleur delacour tattooed to your ass no well there you go i replied i commenced another slow turn this time for the sake of fashion now good or not good good jacques said resolutely how good crashing cars all over london good really now making victor krum fall off his broom good seriously now it that good jacques smiled this is why i love you i exclaimed throwing my arms around a suddenly seriously nervous jacques well well i love you too fleur he said softly oh my god thongs i screamed becoming momentarily distracted by the presence of the 20 point danger increaser and the thought of finding a place where they can print words on underwear and wondering whether or not dangerous or hazardous was an appropriate word choice fleur i told you never to use that word again jacques said sternly like a school teacher admonishing his student for uttering swears jacques today word was lingerie tomorrow word is thongs say it with me now thong have you never heard the thong song i then began singing the thong song while jacques plugged his ears and tried to pretend he wasntstanding in an underwear palace i then proceeded to throw on my clothes and chase him all around the store while he continued to insist upon erasing the word from the dictionary after which i paid for my delicates as jacques tries to call them without blushing and we went home and now he cantstand i wonder if it anything to do with the underwear 8 00 p m i back are you still feeling off i still feeling on actually jacques mutters as if he thinks by simply talking downwards i wontbe able to hear what he says what was that nothing i didntsay anything jacques says do you mind if i spend the night here what a dumb question of course you can ooh i have an even better idea why dontyou move in it could be totally fantastic and then you could help me be dangerous at any hour of the day and at some point i could actually get you to drink the tea i make wouldntthat be lovely and then it would be like old times old times i nostalgic now shut up while i reminisce and i wouldnthave to floo you every five seconds about every little thing and you can make sure i dontsneak out of the apartment to do things i shouldntdo and keep the liquor cabinet locked and good god fleur what sorts of things do you get up to when i not around asked jacques i sure imagining scenarios involving wild swinger parties and an open bar exactly now you ll get to prevent me from doing all those things you dontlike for me to do actually allowing jacques to do this might impede the process of dangerizing myself but as if that what really at stake here isntfriendship totally more important i mean dangerousness is a very close second but and we can play the drinking game of course if you dontlock the liquor cabinet and that will spare us from the sheer sadness of playing the drinking game alone which is just trying to get wasted only much much more depressing and we can watch crappy sappy movies together and eat ice cream in our bunny slippers and we can paint each others nails and fleur i think you have me confused with someone i dontknow female jacques says to me over a the daily prophet with raised eyebrows and a habitually snarky attitude it my nostalgia stop ruining it if it were nostalgia wouldntyou be reminiscing about the past jacques adds once again completely emptying his watering can of depression over my parade stop ruining my definition of nostalgia jacques allowed himself a smile okay sure i ll move in with you you know on one condition what today word is dictionary day one sixty of free independence sunday july 5th 2005 discussing various stances on total lack of clothing 7 41 am 7 41 a m jacques has just finished talking about how janine is so upset with him for ditching her in france while he returns to england i have just finished pretending to feel sorry for her and now that that subject has been finished it leaves open a space for us to talk about my next phase in dangerousness or danger whatever maybe i should start using that dictionary jacques bought me hey jacques i thinking of becoming a nudist ah and jacques spits his coffee out all over his pants what you know you ve totally ruined those pants there i briefly thought of the pain of wearing hot wet clothing you can take them off if you want i dontcare i a nudist you have to wear clothes but i dangerous now do dangerous people wear clothes as far as i concerned ren e spends as little time wearing clothes as possible dangerous people wear clothes fleur crazy people are nudists i am going to leave and compile a list of reasons you should keep your clothes on forever and you are going to sit here and when i come back you re going to have all your clothes on or or else damn it fleur why do you have to have these ideas because that is just the miracle that is me i beamed and also because i plan to gain an olympic medal in mortifying jacques jacques bent down and gave me a kiss on the forehead before grabbing his coat and heading towards the door i not guaranteeing that i ll be fully clothed when you get back jacques i warned him knowing that he was going to go five feet then go insane if you re not i going to carve my eyes out or take a picture no fleur why do you do this to me slam i dontknow why do i do this to him 9 07 p m jacques has returned with just as he promised a scroll of the things that are wrong with nudity however right now he is not reading it he is breathing a sigh of relief oh thank god clothes i can only grin i not wear ing un der wear and naturally he turned around and headed for the door and i responded the way i always do by chasing after him i just happen to get a kick out of being extremely annoying who not wearing panties fleur not wearing panties why because i dangerous fleur put on some underwear jacques orders back to me just outside the apartment and sounding like a concerned parent talking to his daughter about decency and modesty i not wearing underwear crap and it just my luck why do harry and hermione have to take morning strolls why cantthey just grow fat and lazy indoors like everybody else instead of staring at me in shock like so i thought i taught harry about this according to asp you re supposed to keep your mind closed to the people around you however i can clearly see like he has a neon sign above his head that harry is singing along with me fleur not wearing underwear wait a minute fleur not wearing underwear fleur not wearing underwear i can also tell that jacques is five seconds from laughing his head off shut up i tell him as we both dash back into the apartment 12 noon okay fine i should always wear underwear i ve got it nudity is a bad idea will you stop laughing now ah but now jacques is doubled over in laughter and cannot stop as a matter of fact he is so overcome with laughter that he has fallen down and cannot get up well for your information i am not about to help him i am simply going to go over to michael and be appreciated 6 45 p m fleur you ve recovered from your stomach virus what stomach oh right yes i have made a successful recovery as a matter of fact i am feeling great really really great if i hadntstopped talking michael probably wouldnthave heard harry waltzing down the hall singing fleur not wearing underwear but as it was he well did harry actually has a very nice singing voice i think and maybe if he hadntbeen singing about what is or isntunder my skirt i would have appreciated it more however as it was i think it would have been better to keep my underwear between us oh merde that didntcome out right what that about your underwear michael asked looking at me intensely oh dear i feel a fight coming on nothing it is really starting to bother me that whenever i lie things become questions that were never questions in the first place why was harry potter just singing about your underwear asks michael all suspicious and glaring and very upset so i bounce from one underwear scandal to the next and i didnteven do anything with anyone underwear except mine which included taking it off but that not the point harry wasntsinging about my underwear he was singing about a thunder scare oh god fleur it lovely when your boyfriend looks disdainful at your pathetic attempts at lying he looked almost ready to sit me down and hand me a copy of lying for dummies he looked so mortified okay look i sorry michael he was singing about my underwear are you happy now i not sure i want harry potter knowing about what is or isntunder your skirt fleur well he does can we just get over it i blurted and then i realized how utterly and completely awful it sounded and clapped my hand over my mouth just a little too late i sorry i didntmean to say that i meant that i mean that it not like it sounds it not there was a brief and nerve wracking silence at this time in the soap opera the camera would have zoomed in on michael betrayed american face then again isntamerica used to being betrayed by the french by now doesntmichael have to tell his family i his freedom girlfriend god fleur it like i cantleave you alone for a second i mean i turn around and suddenly i dontknow i going to go out and when i get back we re going to have to talk i couldnthelp myself what makes you think i going to be here when you get back i responded the words just flying out of my mouth in some sort of volcanic eruption of insecurity and a dire desire to be dangerous do you ever have something in your head that you know you shouldntsay that you conscientiously decide not to say because you can imagine exactly how it would turn out which happens to be exactly the opposite of the way you want it to turn out but then you say it anyway just to make sure you were right oh fleur it doesntmatter just be here okay i cantbelieve it i ve been killing myself trying to be dangerous for you and to make myself interesting for you and to keep you around since february i ve been killing myself over you i ve been on three diets because of you and you act like i disposable at least i had the satisfaction of knowing i was right because this was exactly how i had imagined it would turn out i dontthink you re disposable i dontthink you re disposable at all i just think well that doesntmatter i feel like i disposable i feel like you could chuck me any time that i not worth your time that at any second any time walking down the street you would open your eyes and realize that i not good enough for you and then you d fleur stop it god american boys dontthey know not to try to stop a french girl on a roll c est impossible no i ve been driving myself crazy i ve been trying to make you feel like i feel all the time but it just doesntwork and i so sick of feeling worthless and completely boring all the time now i was about to go throw myself on his couch stick my head under a pillow and wait for this feeling to pass unfortunately michael was standing right in front of the couch looking helpless and confused boyfriends always do in front of close to tears me i fear the only time i even vaguely intimidating is when i could explode with sadness all over someone i sorry he said rocking as if he were unsure whether to try and come near me and comfort me or give me my space god the answer is comfort me always i mean i suppose it isntyour fault and yes i ve been stupid but i cantbe with you without feeling horrible i muttered darting past him and sitting down on the couch as michael stood now in front me probably still just as confused i have this habit of incoherent speech something to do with being french and having picked up the word like i m i really really sorry michael said i mean really what else was he supposed to say what would i have said well i would have been just as confused if i werentme of course and understanding everything i was saying no never mind it doesntmatter i said now it was just weird and uncomfortable and i hadntgotten angry only upset and overemotional and that left us nowhere whereas a fight would have at least left us in a definite location fleur what do you want michael asked looking at me sincerely heartbreakingly he should become an actor on some horrid weepy to the point of sogginess soap opera he d be a star on as the crystal ball turns he already got the stares down that and asking questions we human beings have no idea to answer that a staple of daytime television how am i supposed to know what i want i can barely get dressed in the morning i dontknow i replied quickly i mean i do know i i just want to be alone yes i want to be alone for awhile it sounded sophisticated enough to me final without being too harsh and it left the right amount of uncertainty as good movies and sequels always do with doors still open to continue later perhaps tomorrow over coffee in hawaii to theme music i ll move out however michael didntseem to get the possible sequel allusion i mean good god these american boys maybe i should have stayed european see if michael were a french boy he would deem me too emotional leave slamming the door naturally and come back later saying something like listen mon petit chou i understand you are upset let me take you out to dinner and make it up to you and then i would sniffle grab a kleenex then grab my coat and go out to dinner where after a five course meal because we europeans know how to dine i would forget all my worries and everything would go back to normal no one would be moving out at all ever i never said i wanted you to move out i exclaimed shocked you know maybe it good for us you i dontwant you to be upset anymore i mean c mon fleur i ll pack my stuff tonight dear god overdramatic much you are not listening to me oh i see what this is you re dumping me i am not dumping you you re dumping me michael retorted throwing his hands up in the air i think i should add exasperating boyfriends to my r sum and admittedly i do like this turnaround better i dontthink i would appreciate being dumped by this boy again okay what do you mean okay michael shouted turning a ridiculous shade of red and burying his head in his hands what i thought you wanted to be dumped werentyou all i ll pack my stuff tonight werentyou all i ll move out what do i mean what do you mean what do i mean okay what is wrong with you you are the most confusing human being on the face of the planet i the most confusing human being on the face of the planet you dontturn this around on me get packing wow i totally see how that whole crime of passion thing works you do and say stupid things in the middle of an argument i have a feeling that this is how divorces start fine michael replied clearly livid fine have a nice life i said blowing michael turner one final kiss goodbye as i headed out the door day one sixty one of free independence thursday july 9th 2005 laundry day waking up with a breakup hangover from 4 days ago 8 12 am 8 12 a m i think you can tell a lot about a person by their words first thing in the morning jacques first words are something along the lines of mrrr murrrrr murrmurmur and mine are oh god jacques i have a break up hangover black coffee a cold shower and some prescription drugs jacques recommends trying uselessly to roll over and falling off of the couch i hate coffee and i think ren e stole all my prescription drugs i sigh life seems sort of pointless now because i dontknow what i doing it sort of sucks when you spend forever striving towards one thing and then in less than twenty four hours you flush your purpose down the drain though admittedly pleasing one boyfriend is an incredibly stupid and not to mention anti feminist and submissive purpose but still it was still a purpose or at least a mini purpose but i guess i can take a shower we can talk after you do okay jacques says his upset fleur radar going off he smiled you can make tea and i promise i ll drink it okay hey fleur you re going to want to take this with you jacques warned throwing a towel in my direction i definitely have a towel in my own bathroom thank you very much nope you don t someone has mysteriously gone on a towel purloining scheme and all of the towels in the building are gone fortunately for us i have great timing when it comes to laundry he grinned as a matter of fact i taking all our stuff to the laundry in a little while so you re going to want to find something to wear before i do you are such a hygiene dork yes well that my mother fault ah mothers ruin the best of us 6 00 p m all right so i went and had a shower all the while trying to shampoo and exfoliate away all bad horrid memories of sunday fight breakup and the disconcerting fact that i am single once more and after my shower i wrapped myself in my towel and made a dash back up to my flat hoping that draco wouldntbe prowling the hall waiting for me to make my towel less appearance and after i reached my apartment i found it was empty as jacques has as he detailed on his post it note gone into town to buy janine an i so sorry i ditched you i a jerk present so as the apartment was empty i decided it would be perfectly lovely not to mention completely appropriate to sit on the couch in my towel and drink tea because this is my apartment and i can do whatever i want right right exactly whatever i calm so i was sitting on the couch with my tea and my towel when suddenly there was a knock knock knock on the door who is it it harry in the space of between four and ten seconds i stopped breathing then revived myself then passed out then revived myself oh oh okay um come in and then wait no i not decent fleur you really need to let me in he called from the doorway a sort of tremor of panic in his voice which was all vulnerable and sexy what is wrong with me why i responded because i should have the right to resist being seduced at any time i want harry may wish to seduce me but i may this is hypothetical not want to be seduced by him his seduction may be incredibly inconvenient for me maybe i dontfeel like being the slut whore other woman today he needs to respect that so i definitely have the right to ask why the boy wants to come into my apartment when i have clearly stated that i am not yet decent for viewing even if non hypothetically i would very much like to be seduced by harry and anytime between 7 a m and midnight is fine with me because fleur i need to borrow a towel draco towel purloining scheme goes horribly horribly wrong contemplating what harry had just said i came to a definite conclusion there was a naked harry potter at my door all right come in i closing my eyes i clapped my one hand over my eyes and clutched my towel with the other briefly imagining what an incident of well timed towel dropping could lead to in my head it always seemed to lead to hermione granger furiously scratching my eyes out therefore i clutched i heard a brief scuttling of footsteps the nervous slam of my front and only door and then unmistakably harry voice fleur he said i think you re wearing the towel i need to borrow no wonder harry passed his aspire with flying colors because everything he says is seductive as a matter of fact i could have sworn that he was inviting me to take my towel off however harry has too much decency and integrity to do such a thing because he was voted most decent teen of the new millennium by witch weekly and magazines like that never lie except about me of course my mind momentarily though this sort of thing does happen all the time stopped functioning okay okay um harry close your eyes i said coming up with a plan what okay you re going to close your eyes and i going to hand you my towel at which point you are not going to open your eyes and then i going to go put on some clothes and then and then you can go back to your apartment with a free towel see i can come up with ideas that arentstupid harry okay that sounds good if you open your eyes i going to kill you harry potter and it wontbe with a cardboard box either i said trying to bring that potions mistress edge to my voice which sadly never existed in the first place as a matter of fact i could have sworn i heard laughter despite this i took a deep breath tossed my towel in what i assumed was harry general direction and made a blind run for my room which is a mess which is why i couldntfind my clothes damn it what was that nothing i called okay so here my theory god hates me because god hates me he has sent mick jagger on a divine mission to break into my apartment and steal all my clothes because as everybody knows rock stars will do anything once i searched for my clothes for the better part of forever before finding something that wasntstolen by mick jagger taken to the laundry by jacques my newfound maid a certain oxford shirt see now wouldntyou think a girl was a total whore if she tossed her towel at you and then came back into the room wearing nothing but an oxford shirt of course see harry will think i am a total whore and lose respect for me and then then then i ll be a cheap whore i dont want to be a whore that means people have a right to attack me anyway i reluctantly poked my head beyond the doorframe to see harry clad in my monogrammed lavender towel whistling england national anthemin my living room and dear god i will never look at the queen the same way again and then the worst part he was grinning what re you smiling at i asked careful to remain almost completely hidden harry turned his head and revealed that horrible fantastic terrible mischievous schoolboy look of his what i persisted feeling an increasing anxiety suddenly he blushed and became the shy student in the back of the class who everyone secretly wants to shag harry why are you smiling because i opened my eyes he smiled harry i am going to kill you i shrieked forgetting all reason and dashing out from behind the doorframe in harry direction strangely it was not hermione scratching my eyes out but me trying desperately to scratch harry eyes out an endeavor which can be extremely unsuccessful when you re trying to attack a quidditch player with the agility of some exotic jungle cat and you re a croissant loving french girl who hasntgotten off of her ass in about a month so i was uselessly clawing at air while harry was laughing his non existent socks off while there were voices at the door that i was ignoring in favor of trying to punish harry for his peeping tom ways and harry was trying to get me to sit down and calm down and stop shouting at me amidst his horrid gentle laughter and i was trying to kick him and missing because i have never played a sport in my life and two someones outside were talking about hogwarts a history and then harry finally succeeded in getting me to sit down which led to me pulling him down with me which led to lavender towel slippage which led to a very awkward silence when jacques opened the door and hermione lost all interest in discussing chapter seven of hogwarts a history a n i think you know what i going to say but i going to say it anyway i suck i suck so much that i should have my own sucky reality television show i am sorry that i suck but i am bad bad bad at updating there have been lots of tests there has been lots of time away from my computer which has been completely not my fault i swear and then ugh exams and i sorry so sorry so unbelievably sorry sooooooooo sorry i love you guys and i suck at updating love but i suck but i trying okay please review and please donthate ridiculous amount of love for putting up with this femme teriyaki breaks breakdowns birthdays and dark alleys day one sixty two of free independence friday july 10th 2005 in a state of socio emotional chaos 9 00 am 9 00 a m i am not all right bad things bad bad things have happened yesterday after that door was so carelessly thrown open you can only imagine there was hermione standing in the doorway beside jacques with her mouth hanging open and jacques with a humongous laundry bag because he a laundry fiend and janine i so sorry i ditched you i a jerk present shaking in his hands as soon as the door flew open i freaked out and tried to hide behind my towel which led to harry screaming fleur and seizing the towel back because i now see clearly he needed it more than i did hermione was the first to speak unfortunately you re wearing her towel she said her eyes burning holes into my skin and then turning her attention back to harry hermione i swear this is not what it looks like see that line never works even in soap operas saying that never works saying that only leads to what the hell do you mean this is not what it looks like see if i werentso afraid of her i d feel empathy for her because when she said it she seemed so yes furious but also a little heartbroken and sad she looked like like something crumbling when you re watching a building being demolished that was what it was like watching her watch us i suddenly interjected he needed to borrow a towel everything i say has exclamation marks in situations like these yes said harry exactly i concurred with myself because there are no other towels in the building hermione said sarcastically yes said harry exactly she was still staring silently at the both of us and i urgently wished that i had well pants jacques tell her about draco towel purloining scheme but jacques was still just staring and then looking away and staring and looking away again and he wouldntlook at me or focus on anything at all jacques see then he was starting to worry me but there were so many other things going on that how could i how could i do anything i dragged my eyes from jacques to hermione listen jacques took all my clothes to the laundry and this is all i had to wear and draco gone and taken all the towels you can look if you want but jacques sent ours out to the laundry yesterday so i still had a towel and harry didntand so i came over here looking for a towel so harry just seemed to me to be in a way that i had never seen him all dejected and ashamed and feeling horrid at being honest because he knew a lie would have seemed so much better but knowing that with all his cursed integrity he should tell the truth hermione i so sorry this is this is all wrong i didntmean she just whirled on him and left and he turned to me with an i sorry about all of this and then followed after her leaving me with jacques who didntseem to be completely present and a horrid evil feeling in the pit of my stomach jacques i was sort of afraid of talking too loudly jacques maybe you should put down that present you re going to break it jacques sighed and sat down and it made everything seem very heavy and serious when mere moments ago it hadntfelt very serious at all so then he put the present it had already been wrapped up in glittering wrapping paper and everything down on the table and just stared at me for a while i didn t i began to speak but then i found that i had no words and i couldntfinish what i wanted to say i going to go mail this jacques said finally and he picked up the present from the table and walked out the door 10 00 a m good god i am a screw up i have decided that ren e was entirely right in regards to me screw up definitely i should fall off the face of the earth immediately before i take over fema or something and thereby ruin the entire world one country at a time i am just sitting here staring at my wonderfully clean laundry wondering when jacques will come back how lonely the world is when you re a total screw up i mean yes there are the other screw ups but they re afraid to get near to you for fear that you will contaminate them with further total idiocy and i a very public screw up besides what with my underwear scandals and oh god this had better not be on the front page tomorrow hmmm just in case there are paparazzi at my window i getting dressed 12 noon he back he back all right he says very decisively throwing his coat off onto the coffee table setting his present for janine down in a way that makes me hope it not fragile because then it totally broken and finally finally looking me in the eye i giving you forty seven seconds to explain to me what the hell i just saw why forty seven i ask squinting unattractively as only i can do properly forty five okay okay did i mention that jacques is very precise when he pissed and all other hours of the day harry came over here he needed a towel you had my clothes i had one towel so i put on the only article of clothing i had and gave harry the towel and at which point did this require behaving like barn animals barn animals he said something and i aiming to win the nobel prize for ambiguity what something twenty eight seconds jacques maybe my incessant pleading will make him stop checking the second hand on his watch and make him pay attention to the fact that he canthate me as we live together instead he must forgive me immediately dump janine and poison hermione granger food twenty seven okay fine i told him not to look but he looked and i was mad and that was me trying to scratch his eyes out and it not my fault that towel slippage is incredibly common in situations like these and no you cantcall time i not done sucking up to you yet i sorry i sorry i sorry you re my best friend and i am seriously going to try to be a responsible time jacques says sitting down next to me on the couch and stopping his watch adult i screech i so breathless and sweaty that i sure this counts as some form of exercise so i not going to do pilates today because that forty seven seconds must have burned like 400 calories i turn to look at him seriously do you forgive me if i make an endeavor to be a responsible adult who who thinks about her actions before acting like a barn animal he laughs i already forgave you i ve spent the past three hours at the movies i hate you i shouted seizing a cushion and beating him frankly with it thankfully he was wearing more than just a towel so no one could have walked in at that moment and decided to hate me more than they did yesterday except maybe janine because of my secret happiness that her present is probably broken you re getting yourself in so much trouble jacques says which is very true i dontknow how you do it but you have impossibly bad timing how is it possible to live so awkwardly i prefer dangerously but thanks thanks a lot i said offended i live awkwardly what sort of sentence is that i mean it not like i a contortionist or quelque chose comme a i live like a normal human being except for the fact that i constantly getting caught in lies and damn it awkward situations okay maybe i do live awkwardly but i swear that by the end of this year i will live dangerously it not my fault that i like many people in this world such as those who have racked up gambling debts or spend their days in turkish prisons have extraordinarily bad luck some people do far worse things than i do and for example marry billionaire aerobics instructors and have affairs with hot caterers while never getting caught but whenever i so much as take a shower it turns into something horrible and bad that is not my fault you could have kept your towel on jacques mutters in a very indiscreet sort of way what exactly was i supposed to do just say oh sorry harry i mean yes i know that you re shivering outside my door stark naked and that there are no other towels in this building but i feel like being evil today and have decided to let you stand there until the wind blows you dry you could have told him to go back to his own apartment and put on some clothes since he four doors down jacques pointed out oh dear that does make sense i wonder why he was standing outside this apartment knocking when he could have just gone to his own maybe he very partial to towels i said quietly no jacques said thoughtfully quieting down as well i think he just partial to you i gave jacques a quick look just as he was giving me one and the silence just sat in the air until it was broken by a vicious fit of sneezing on my part like jacques says i have impossibly bad timing but that cantbe helped now can it day one sixty eight of free independence thursday july 16th 2005 waking up to find a most interesting surprise in my bed 5 00 am 5 00 a m i dontknow about you or what goes on in your personal life but i really dontthink it an every day occurrence to wake up and find harry potter sitting on your bed i really don t seriously just perched there reading a magazine as if it were the most ordinary thing in the world as if perhaps he might kick back and watch tv there on my baby blue comforter maybe open a bag of chips and drink a soda like he wasntjust sitting on my bed at five o clock in the morning oh i sorry i woke you he says i sorry i woke you what the hell then what in god name are you sitting on my bed for trying not to wake me dontsay anything i mean whisper is jacques here i dontknow you tell me mr i sorry i woke you i only sitting on your bed i snapped well sorry but it very important he said flipping the page in the magazine over turning back dog earing the page and tossing it in the corner very carelessly nonchalantly because so what it not like he breaking and entering or anything i need your help no you re you re sitting on my bed you re trying to get me into trouble again and harry potter i ve gotten into enough trouble because of you scores of people across england have lingering hate for me because of you hermione will kill me the next time she sees me because of you my boyfriend broke up with me because of you i mean not just because of you but you and michael broke up grins harry too perkily for five a m maybe he made frigging coffee in my frigging kitchen and he drank some before he came to sit on my frigging bed i mean he could have been what watching me sleep i not attractive when i sleeping who is i mean i am not prepared for this it not like i have lip gloss on or anything or any makeup or that my hair even brushed or anything i in a nightgown for god sake i not ready to be receiving visitors least of all an international crime fighting celebrity like a certain harry james potter no this is not acceptable yes now get off my bed wow who would have thought that six months after getting a job teaching him i would be telling harry potter to get off my bed then again six months ago if i knew i was telling harry potter to get off my bed i would have kicked myself i need your help i know get the hell off my bed fine harry said springing off my bed like it was on fire and probably because i kicked him you re not all daisies and sunshine when you wake up are you fleur no not exactly then i realized that i should immediately put on more clothes while in the presence of harry potter so that when forces beyond my control leave me half naked with him which they always do it will take a lot longer than usual what do you want harry well he said leaping to the door to keep me from turning the handle in short i need you to help me defeat lord voldemort 8 00 a m i dontknow why i let him convince me to leave my apartment it too early in the morning for this i ve had to cast a spell on my quill to even keep writing good god it early it too early but when harry just delicately places the fate of the world in your hands you re supposed to do something about it right crap i hate this whatever i ve come to terms with the fact that this voldie thing is never going to be over last year he shrunk back into laying low and we were all comfortable with that i ve been comfortable with that for the past forever but harry noooo harry has to go save the world now doesnthe and saving the world starts with sitting on my bed actually my comforter is all nice and rumpled from where he was sitting i think it looks darling in the lamplight but ahem that not the issue at stake here of course what exactly do you propose we do i ask we re darting down the streets of london now under the cover of well daylight and all harry told me is that it absolutely essential that i go along with him and why me because you re a professional harry says darting into a corner and further down into an alleyway dragging me along with him he is killing me because dark corners make me think we re going to commit some sort of felony which is going to make me inevitably sweaty and disgusting and my own disgustingness in the presence of harry the one and only amazing harry is going to make me suicidal a professional at what i ask sure that i have no skills besides being awkward and losing towels which i am very good at and should be on my r sum asp he smiles it seems like that moment in my fair lady where eliza announces that she ll become a teacher and teach phonetics a very full circle type thing that asp might actually be useful except that i dontfeel very much like a henry higgins type professor or a professor at all really i still feel like for all that time i was just a bumbling assistant what harry are you just going to make out with the dark lord until he dies of course not harry replies looking at me incredulously as the dark alleyway seems to become even darker and his eyes seem to become just a shade greener he takes my hand and pulls me a tiny bit closer fleur if i dontsee you after this i mean if something goes wrong 9 00 a m i couldnthelp it with him speaking of such things of that amount of finality how could i not have kissed him of course i proceeded to ruin the moment and make things as jacques would say awkward afterwards by adding oh crap i never going to survive seeing hermione again oh we re on a break harry replied nonchalantly god the poor boy doesntknow anything oh harry being on a break does not mean that you re on a break ross thought he and rachel were on a break they were not on a break i explained everything that happens when you re on a break still counts when you re not on a break and maybe a little bit more who are ross and rachel harry asked it was only then that i realized that in order to watch friends one must be a in america and b a muggle i dontthink my de americanization de mugglefication has worked out very well i actually think i doing very poorly it doesntmatter i said because you re not on a break you re still living with her for god sake at least when ross and rachel were on a break i pretty sure they werent living together if one doesnteven have the decency to move out it definitely not a break it a spat it a cutesy little lover spat the kind they report on in the snitch report knowing that the couple will be back together in five seconds and will be taking day trips to the hamptons again i mean god could anyone tell they re on a break no i not actually she staying with ron for a few days i mean until we work the whole thing out he said until we work the whole thing out well if he expecting to get back together with her then he should keep his saucy expert of a tongue to himself i made a disgruntled noise what he asked being the sort of boy who picks up on disgruntled noises which is a helpful trait when you re constantly breaking women hearts as teen heart throbs tend to do does the word heart throb remind you of nineties references to julio iglesias or is that only me well i said in a disgruntled fashion if you re all planning on working the whole thing out i looked down briefly well then what is all of this all of what all of this i abruptly pushed him away i mean i cantturn around without you there at the bookstore or walking down the hall or in my apartment with no towel on or in a bloody alleyway and you think that okay i tried to tell you this morning you always get me into trouble harry i i wontbe strung along i felt very feminist at saying that it what agatha firebrick would do and afterwards she would slap the deliciously sexy cad in the face turn around and strut sexily back to her apartment cut her hair buy new clothes spritz on madame matilda magical mesmerizing love perfume and go out on the town as an independent woman however i have to save the world with this deliciously sexy cad so i ll have to slap him afterwards further however by the time we ve save the world i ll be on a high of oh how wonderfully hot superheroes are and he ll have a shot at seducing me all over again mon dieu sex appeal is a weapon i not trying to string you along fleur he said then you re stringing one of us along harry i mean it hermione hermione or me that what i trying to say hermione or me why how meredith grey of me fleur we have to get going i haventeven fully explained the plan to you and time is running out our window could slip away and then when the next time we ll have to rid the world of lord voldemort we ll have to hermione or me harry it a one word answer one syllable if you re smart you now can we get going i stopping over at diagon alley to pick up something and after that we re going to have to make a mad dash to well i canttell you here but after that you said me i whispered well yes i know i beamed you said me harry blushed and took a quick glance at his watch i absolutely positive he thought i was insane yes yes of course he smiled now really we have to go i nodded wordlessly as i let him lead the way to diagon alley very happily deciding that i wanted a rose bouquet for our wedding day one seventy five of free independence thursday july 23rd 2005 sworn to secrecy 7 00 am 7 00 a m all right well i really not allowed to say much because harry doesntwant you know my possessions to get stolen by the press and then the have everyone freaking out over the full scale rundown of last week events but i pretty sure that i can give you the details on the part of what happened that had nothing to do with lord voldemort and everything to do with me and harry okay so after the incident in the alleyway we made our way to diagon alley where harry picked up what can only be referred to as item xxx and his broomstick which he was having stored there immediately after the whole surprise towel scene fight with hermione because he was absolutely sure she was going to smash it over his head or something i was not paying attention to anything but rather wondering what my wedding dress would look like harry kept telling me to focus which of course led to me focusing on how hot harry is and you know the fact that he picked me i beaming but anyway after picking up his firebolt and item xxx harry and i magically squeezed onto his broomstick and flew for several hours until we reached a location that can only be referred to as location xyz by which time my hands were numb and i couldnteven extract pleasure from the reality of holding onto harry for several hours during this broom ride harry explained to me the details many of which will have to be blotted out for the sake of national security okay fleur we re headed to location xyz where we will rendezvous with person a person a has waiting for me item yyy and a slip of paper that has written on it deletion for you which should be self explanatory but there are directions on the back i mean i trust you fleur at location xyz the asp comes into play i will be underneath my invisibility cloak and i will need you to asp your way past the guards at this point you must deletion in order to deletion by deletion you will have enabled us to deletion which allows us to perform deletion on lord voldemort which results in deletion then all we have to do is follow the instructions on person a slip of paper in conjunction with the detonation of item yyy and the destruction of item xxx and well we ve saved the world after which we have to evacuate the premises immediately apparently harry has been working on this plan for a very very long time we spent the rest of the broom ride reviewing the above information without the deletions of course and shivering upon reaching location xyz rendezvousing with person a picking up item yyy safely concealing item xxx and reading the given information it was time for my role in the operation because i am forbidden to use names and probably will forget them all in two days time i will refer to everyone by their assigned serial numbers with a swift alohomora i gained entry to the premises xyz made my way through how to be vague about this several rooms i waited on the seating apparatus in one of these rooms and applied a little magically enhanced lipstick and perfume wink wink at which point several er morally disinclined wizards filed by did a double take and then all entered the room the general consensus in the room was who the hell are you and what the hell are you doing here that was de06583 but then he always been suspicious ever since he had his foot blown off in a freak squirrel accident i sighed inwardly at the thought and then said what i needed to say in my sluttiest voice with my heaviest accent i said someone called for some female entertainment ah remarked a certain de19403 who cannot be named but let just say i taught his dimwit child potions for like two months funny thing is after i said this nobody even asked me who had called nobody asked me anything as a matter of fact except if i could put my legs behind my head oddly so i smiled and said could somebody lead the way to the dungeon in the dungeon followed by a small staff of guards i requested that i reapply my perfume to which they agreed wholeheartedly well until they stopped nodding and passed out harry was just about to whip off his invisibility cloak and let me out of the dungeon when who waltzed in but am i allowed to break name protocol because this is just too juicy lucius malfoy harry quickly crouched in the corner and i tried not to wince as the illustrious mr malfoy joined me in the dark dank dungeon i heard there was a little female entertainment present oh is that what you said in your porno like father like son i nodded and prayed that harry was ready to club him over the head or at least break his nose however i had to wait until lucius malfoy had his tongue in my mouth for harry to do a thing while mr malfoy was kissing my neck i was viciously mouthing in what i hoped was harry direction what are you doing get me out of here for those agonizing minutes i remembered what my mother had once told me just close your eyes and think of england and how much france is better so i did and after seven minutes of hell lucius malfoy was surprised by a the knee that he got in the groin b the swift kick he got in the shins and c the head butt he got in the stomach la a certain french soccer captain oh yeah because french girls do it better mais oui i reapplied my killer lipstick and gave him a final kiss on the lips that sent him into unconsciousness now let me out of here i had to tap my foot impatiently for over a minute before the door swung open and harry appeared sorry he said i was taking care of the rest of the guards and retrieving other information what sort of shh he whispered then he took me by the hand led me away and the rest well i d tell you but then i d have to kill you 9 05 a m jacques is in a state of shock and awe at my sheer wonderfulness what i still dontunderstand he says making breakfast is how you managed to sneak out of the house at five a m without me noticing right jacques because that really the impressive part of this story actually i think the really impressive part of the story is that jacques knows how to make eggs benedict that is marvelous but wait a minute why is he a better cook than i am jacques always makes me question my adequacy i think he just generally bad for my self esteem you know with his brilliant wonderfulness dontbe too hard on yourself even the best of guards have to sleep sometime there only one of you i point out true he says flipping the ridiculous delicious concoction he has in the frying pan over i should have known you d get back in the papers dangerous enough for you he asks throwing me a glance over his shoulder why yes actually i haventthought about this on a level of dangerousness before how lovely i ve actually done something dangerous yay we should go out and celebrate we can go to dinner someplace fancy and famous or maybe someplace out of the way so we wontbe plagued by paparazzi oh who cares i dangerous i ve done something dangerous jacques laughs to himself and flips the eggs benedict out of the frying pan and onto a plate i wonder if he ever wonders what a sensible person like him is doing living with a nonsensical world saving person like me yeah sure he says let go out to dinner ooh i have an even better idea how impressive of me let have a party 12 noon parties are very complicated affairs but not as complicated as affairs affairs are really complicated affairs but i not having an affair so that s none of my affair anyway i have no idea how to plan a party at beauxbatons we were never allowed to have parties we had formals instead and then afterwards simply the really devoted bad asses would throw parties i d attend them but never throw them ren e was always the party thrower in the family of course ren e was always also the tantrum thrower and the knife thrower too anyway how does one have a party there should be a book on it i would go to flourish blotts to scan the reference section for it but then harry might show up there again and oh my i have just realized there is nothing to worry about i can meet harry at the bookstore if i want i am a single girl he is a single boy and he picked me i think i shall step out and buy a book on parties and then promptly invite him both to the now hypothetical party and to some reference section snogging jacques is now inquiring as to why i look so happy well no never mind i say v mysteriously which must be tr s p nible pour pauvre jacques who is constantly asking me questions that i refuse to answer without a lawyer present actually i draw breath very sharply and dramatically no no a no no never mind every time you do that jacques says you know i want to kill you you know i do so why do you do it tell me what you did i haventdone anything i say gracefully putting on my halo i haventdone a single thing all day except read the papers and drink tea i innocent and i plead the fifth the american constitution applies only in america says jacques in a way that proves he was a tutor and anyway i know you ve done something so donttry to hide it i ll figure it out it harry isntit you ve done something with harry again but you dontwant me to know he says jacques is ever so intuitive when he making me a sandwich in that trembling way of his sort of hesitant as if i am not really sure i want to put this provolone cheese on top of this roast beef i haventdone anything i say resolutely i am an angel harry harry and and your whole saving the world thing something happened after you mysteriously snuck out of here at five a m magically without me noticing and dragging you back through the door didntit dontdeny it because i know it true when he sounds so self assured with the wheat bread and white bread in hand like the scales of justice it very hard to lie he picked me i screech well no i squeal for what me i mean i was so shocked what do you mean for what for for love i think jacques inquiry of for what is making me happier because i never asked myself for what and the answer is lovely i start giggling and jacques is looking at me in disgust oh stop he says i can only continue giggling love i repeat stupidly oh god fleur please stop he repeats passing me a sandwich and a knife so that i can cut the crusts off because inside i am four years old he looks at me and sandwich skeptically before saying god help me fleur if you cut that effing thing into an effing heart i going to effing kill you then you better effing leave i giggle if i left you you d probably go stare at his comforter rumple and not eat all day i dontwant to be responsible for your starvation jacques says still seeming rather disgusted by my behavior how do you know about my rumple i ask i saw you kissing it this morning well oh 2 00 p m jacques i tore through the apartment in a rage feeling very hell bent very regina george in mean girls ripping through her house after cady party jacques finally he was found sitting reading the prophet as if he hadntdone anything at all as if he hadntruined an entire week of sleeping on the floor on some blankets jacques yes you straightened my rumple 5 00 p m you cantstill not be speaking to me it a little wrinkle how can you be mad at me over a wrinkle we can survive the time you burned off my eyebrows but we cantsurvive something that ironing usually deals with it not a wrinkle i said crossing my arms defensively it was a rumple and it was mine and harry s and it was beautiful you re acting like you had a baby and i straightened it said jacques speaking to my back since i was refusing to look at his rumple straightening face if a baby is a simply a product of love then yes harry and i had a baby and you straightened it i declared whirling around for a split second before returning to my comfortable state of staring out the picture window angrily while jacques made desperate attempts to soothe my temper and tell me what was giving birth like jacques asked it was and then i realized that i d turned around and started to speak before i d thought about his question and that he d caught me standing there actually looking at him about to answer a ridiculous query you re horrible and i hate you but do you love me he asked raising an endearing once burned off eyebrow and rumpling his brow yes of course i said now let go have tea lovely jacques said kissing my nose we can make loads of rumples later i giggled jacques smiled oh not that again 7 00 p m jacques and i were sitting on the bed drinking tea when i said oh i know i ll have the party on harry birthday he ll be delighted i sure he never really had a proper birthday and we can celebrate our victory at the same time too jacques slipped a little off the bed creating his own rumple will you though he asked clutching his teacup yes i exclaimed if only i knew how to plan a party or who to invite at all nobody who should be there likes me at all hermione ron oh i dontknow all of harry friends the idea sank from my mind i cantthrow him a party i wouldntknow what to do then talk to someone who does know what to do jacques suggested kneeling at the side of the bed over his rumple but i don t then it struck me that i did know someone who knew what to do but not hermione jacques i couldn t jacques shook his head shaking his tea and coming dangerously close to spilling green tea on my bedspread oh oh ron but the most you have to fear from ron is that he might faint on you asserted jacques besides he ll tell you anything you want to know and things you don t i hate your ideas i said sipping my chamomile they re always so correct and unpleasant why cantyou ever have frivolous ideas that are nice to think about well that would just be like living with yourself now wouldntit jacques said 9 00 p m affol d affaires courant name fleur delacour height 5 foot 8 weight 120 because life saving and world saving means that the pounds melt off instantly hair blonde eyes blue lust situation i am in bliss because no more unrequited lust for me no i ve got a baby i mean rumple and a pseudo boyfriend who is

and reconciliations and rumples and pseudo boyfriends day one seventy seven of free independence saturday july 25th 2005 on the way to an interview 8 00 am 8 00 a m quite ridiculously received word by owl yesterday that the daily prophet would like to interview me on my part in defeating lord voldemort harry has just stopped over to remind me not to really answer any questions i am supposed to be like a politician and leave the interviewer feeling like they just conducted an interview but not having left with any information at all and then he invited me to have lunch with him and other things but unfortunately i had to decline because how am i supposed to plan harry birthday party will have to find a way to rendezvous with ron without running into hermione that girl still scares the hell out of me i really do wish i could go over though not even for the lunch just for the other things 9 00 a m sitting in daily prophet office waiting for my interviewer picking the dirt out from under my nails and humming 9 15 a m i am beginning to think that at any moment ashton kutcher is going to pop out from behind that desk and say you ve just been punk d 9 30 oh dear someone coming i probably ought to try and be respectable now if only i could remember how to do that damn my lazy summer tendencies 4 10 p m interview was bloody horrible i think i would have rather been the victim of a cruel prank on a horrible overrated reality television show than do that interview was horrid was humming in an annoying and nervous fashion waiting for the interviewer to finally walk through the door anticipating etc heard horrid clacking of shoes on the floor was beginning to bite furiously on nails when in waltzed none other than rita skeeter let recount what i have against rita skeeter shall we well there only every time she ever insinuated that i was obsessed with harry sleeping with harry or simply a bumbling idiot who has no idea what she doing but other than that you could call us best friends why hello she said all poisonously and acting as if she hadntslandered my name and that we were bridge partners or something well let get started she was very chipper but i think she was disappointed that she couldntget harry to come down so fleur delacour what exactly was your role in defeating he who must not be named ridiculously long name for someone we re not talking about i thought about her question for a while and probably in a way that made her think i was incredibly dull well i wasntin the plan from the beginning i mean i wasntreally aware that anything was going to be happening until very very recently but i suppose that was part of the plan and that it was better that way since secrecy is key i said i was proud of myself for not giving much away really right said rita skeeter nodding her irrepressibly annoying head filled with lies so no one really knows much about what happened that night a little more than a week ago can you shed some light on what really occurred i did my best to smile graciously when filled with spite i afraid that it would be against the wizarding world best interests for me to talk about it now but i will say that the plan went very successfully and that everyone should be feeling a little safer rita made a discontented sound this has been quite a year for you she said as a matter of fact i think it would be safe to say that you ve been rocketed to fame though of course sometimes not in the most reputable of ways what do you have to say about your experiences in the public eye this year i blanched i don t i dontknow what you mean well she said since early may several reports have linked you with one of the most famous and important young wizards of our time harry potter you were originally why his schoolteacher and actually i was just an assistant i interjected well yes you were just an assistant but nevertheless some incredibly revealing shots of you surfaced wearing those werenthis boxers they were just very similar the pattern the pattern gotten so popular i said my hands sweating profusely and anyway arenti supposed to be talking to you about what happened recently in regards to lord voldemort defeat isntthat what we re supposed to be talking about i think you ve already made it very clear that we will not be dragging any more information out of you on that subject she said smiling at her horrible quick quotes quill i simply trying to give a little background information i finally realized that this wasntan interview about lord voldemort this was just a chance to have the shamrocks scandal interview they d never had you were the beauxbatons champion for the triwizard tournament how did it feel being the only female contestant and sadly coming in last place oh well were there any sparks between you and the other three male contestants she asked raising an eyebrow and not endearingly in the least what are you insinuating i exclaimed ready to grab my purse and bolt out the door was this first where the romance between you and harry potter started she asked before you say anything bear in mind all the evidence that has come to light in the past few months concerning the relationship between yourself and harry potter the photos of you wearing undergarments that looked alarmingly similar to the undergarments of mr potter that went missing mysteriously a month before you were mr potter date to a prestigious ceremony where he was awarded a lifetime achievement award something he would share only with those he was very close to you re living in the same apartment complex arentyou ms delacour well yes but and now harry potter has at last defeated lord voldemort but not with his girlfriend hermione granger at his side but you ms delacour how do you explain that i gulped they re on a break i muttered meekly sinking into my chair i wasntready for this yet and i wasntsupposed to give anything away harry and hermione are on a break and nothing going on i repeated a break you say she said somehow telepathically willing that demonic quill to write even faster she smiled an acid smile as a small brown haired assistant scurried into the room handing rita a small file if you would take a look at this rita said handing the file to me i was having the strongest sense of d j vu i winced and reluctantly opened the file to find oh god the paparazzi are like insects everywhere including in dark alleyways where one is kissing the boy who lived i looked up i didntknow what to say i have to go really how unfortunate do grab a gift bag on the way out 5 55 p m jacques is trying to be comforting i sure you didntsay anything too incriminating give yourself a break dontsay the word break i shouted burying my head under a pillow and wondering how much retail therapy it would take to cure me of my current state of horror i mean i was supposed to talk about the victory i mean i wasnteven really supposed to talk about that i was supposed to talk vaguely about it in an unhelpful fashion for an hour but then i let her drag me into talking about about things like like the shamrocks again and she had these horrible pictures what pictures pictures of me and harry kissing jesus fleur jacques said dropping down onto the couch beside me at what point in time during the whole saving the world thing did you and harry potter have a chance to make out hey i thought he was going to die i mean it the whole last moments on earth thing i mean wouldntyou if you were if yes exactly i took an ice cube from the bowl immediately to my left and popped it into my mouth i mean i began my words slightly muffled where do they get these pictures anyway do they just crawl out of the trashcans with their cameras with their harry radar looking for some scandal i mean i didntsee anything at the time might that be because your eyes were closed asked jacques oh shut up i said crunching on the ice cube in despair jacques correctness can be incredibly upsetting it absolutely obscene that i cantdo anything or even be around harry without a photograph being taken and as if harry and i are really the important part of all this i mean why cantanyone hey why wouldntyou want anyone to know about you and harry harry and hermione are on a break and it not as if you and harry have been having a torrid affair or something silence right right right no we werenthaving an affair per se per se dear god you were having a torrid affair you were you think you know somebody exclaimed jacques staggering around the apartment like someone had shot him in the stomach per se does not equal yes we made passionate love over by the dictionaries in the reference section i replied because where i take things too literally jacques is a voracious in between the lines reader and he sometimes reads things in between the lines that arentthere why the dictionaries dear god you ran into him at flourish blotts didntyou you have to tell me these things so you can shoot yourself and bleed on my carpet no so i can chastise you and then fully understand what going on when you are dragged in for a magazine interview and come back with a severe need for a cold compress by the way i am not getting you a cold compress until you give full disclosure jacques insisted and i really needed that cold compress but jacques i said preparing for full suck up mode donttell me you love me tell me the truth bah humbug you re all so serious blah i said retreating backwards on the couch fine where shall i begin the sordid details all the way back at asp or shall i begin with the cardboard box massacre and work forward from there jacques nodded at the asp option so i sighed and began okay this is the fast version and if you dontunderstand a word i saying that is not my fault i have intense party planning to do and i need to get this over with so i can recover with a cold compress and get to it okay asp equals crackling sexual tension mostly on my part michael jets away to deal with house elves in egypt i am caught wearing lucky lucky shamrocks not so lucky for me as you know so then all alone in asp i am forced to explain myself this leads to some inexplicable kissing which led to some oh dear what about your girlfriend asking which led to some awkward staring so i offered to help him out on the hermione front which inexplicably and unforeseeably led to some serious kissing and then the got invited to the award ceremony thingy and needed someone to go with him and he and hermione were sort of on the skids so he asked me and we went and we were seated next to the chocolate fountain and the lighting was so nice seductive lighting my god it was it was there was very nice lighting so one thing led to another behind the chocolate fountain dontlook appalled it was only kissing then michael asked me to move in with him and i didntknow what to say i mean i couldntbe mean to him and say no after i d just cheated on him with his student so i said yes and then i came out here and there was harry here for no apparent reason it was nerve wracking you can only imagine the turmoil i went through trying to find a sensible solution to this situation jacques and i was so methodical i made lists and everything you would have been so proud but then i was trying to really immerse myself in my relationship with michael and i was trying to look seductive over breakfast in my oxford shirt and everything and then michael was asking all these questions about asp while he was gone and i got flustered and said i d go ask harry about it but i wasntwearing pants for god sake and i was standing in harry flat wearing nothing but a shirt feeling like a slut you re not a slut jacques says reassuringly you just have incredibly bad judgement and then hermione was telepathically stabbing me in the eye with a fork and i was feeling rather bad about the whole thing especially when harry saved me from a draco attack and we were having tea and the great hermione walked in and looked scandalized so then i went out to dinner with michael and he called me safe for crying out loud i was hurt so i called you and you came over and then i was looking for books on how to be dangerous in flourish blotts and harry was there and i had the hiccups and we ended up in his apartment and oh you know what i going to say there was some serious kissing jacques said deadpan exactly and every single time it was like kiss kiss kiss oh no this is a bad idea which is dumb as hell because we never got anywhere emotionally spiritually sexually grammatically in any way at all but at the same time we were both in other relationships and we shouldnthave done anything because that wouldnthave been fair and then there was that incident of my not wearing underwear and then michael and i broke up and then harry needed a towel because of the purloining scheme and then okay whatever about the towels i am almost sort of over the towels skip to the part where for some incomprehensible reason dark alleyways are the new dinner and a movie jacques said leaning forward slightly before getting up and perching on the arm of the couch i think jacques may be the only guy i know that actually perches i seriously thought he was going to die so i kissed him and then i remembered hermione and he told me it was okay because they were on a break but the truth is that being on a break does not mean you are on the sort of break you think you are and i told him that i would not be strung along and that he needed to choose between me and hermione and he chose me hence the photo of the kissing in the alley gotcha pause i was just wondering though would you mind selling your life story to a publisher we could get millions for this sort of drama shut up i have a party to plan i said leaping off the couch falling back down and begging for a cold compress 7 30 p m knocking frantically on what i have figured out is ron door waiting for him to answer it so he can help me out with the party planning guest list and such however am feeling more towel less outside apartment door than experienced party planner 7 45 p m ron seemed simultaneously excited and upset to see me but maybe that was because hermione was due to return home from wherever the hell it is she goes any second it was all very strange blushing he asked me what do you want before blushing again well i was wondering if you would help me i trying to throw a party for harry birthday and also kind of to celebrate the whole dark lord victory thing i said feeling like a novice salesgirl as ron wouldnteven let me into his apartment i just figured since you and harry are such good friends and everything and it supposed to be a surprise that come in ron said his voice becoming suddenly squeaky before he cleared his throat and opened the door wide enough for me to step through um who do you want to invite i dontknow that why i need help i was thinking we d just have it in his apartment because it d be pretty easy to get him there without his being suspicious and we can always just temporarily enlarge the apartment i know a spell for that i suggested okay well you ll want to start with er hermione i know i should invite hermione ron right well then ron said nervously and then fred and george and ginny and bill and charlie and i guess percy and probably my parents because they ll want to be there and dumbledore and mcgonagall and seamus and neville he started as i scribbled the names down on a napkin oh really just all the hogwarts staff they ve been like family to harry except snape not snape and lupin oh shoot what ron asked looking up nothing he just thinks i insanely sexually attracted to him that all go on everyone in the order of the phoenix everyone at hogwarts really except the slytherins and all the house ghosts he shuddered briefly except the bloody baron or on second thought invite him so he doesntmurder us all and you may need a bigger venue actually umm i ll see if i can get the hall they used for the lifetime achievement ceremony 137 warwick place because that a huge space and i pretty sure they still have the chocolate fountain we could start that up again i stopped suddenly you dontthink this will be too big a party for harry do you i mean do you think he ll be uncomfortable i think as long as you dontabandon him in a sea of people he doesntknow he ll be fine ron replied looking at me for a fraction of a second before turning red and returning to his sheet of paper he shoved a list in my direction erm now fleur i am going to have to ask you to er leave i offered yes he said staring at his shoes in an embarrassed sort of way with the kind of intent that people usually reserve for staring contests thanks so much i said as i sailed out the door guest list in hand day one eighty three of free independence friday july 31st 2005 harry birthday being excited 9 00 am 9 00 a m ha am brilliant have done everything je suis fantastique i can plan parties i can i haventfelt so proud of myself since well probably the whole defeat of lord v and all sorts of other classified information etc but anyway what i ve been doing the past six days fleur party planning activities as of late 1 called warwick place hall got it reserved from 8 o clock in the evening to 1 o clock in the morning and they dontseem to remember me as that underwear scandal girl thank god 2 arranged for a company to cater the party will be bertie bott every flavor beans everywhere and a chocolate fountain and a buffet for those who dontget a chance to eat dinner before coming there will be wait staff and bartenders and alcohol so of course this will be a crazy party 3 aaahh you wontbelieve me i managed to get the weird sisters and celestina warbeck to come and perform for the party it amazing what happens when you re throwing a party for a guy who saves the world repeatedly because you can get whatever you want especially when all of these people obviously have a crush on him 4 sent out around 400 invitations which were all done completely magically because i lazy but look as if they were done expertly by hand 5 invited harry out to dinner tonight saying that i had something urgent to speak to him about or something or other but will really blindfold him and apparate to warwick place 12 noon ooh jacques this is going to be fantastic everyone is going to be at this party top ministry officials pop stars headmasters fellow english tutors we re all going to have so much fun i shout happily you re on a party planning high so i will forgive the shouting jacques replied yippeeee 4 27 p m i canteat i too excited all i want to do is party frankly with celestina warbeck and the weird sisters and all sorts of fantastic people including the boy who lived to pick me 5 00 p m calm down it just a party jacques is saying but we both know that this is a horrendous lie and that this is not just a party it is the party of the century and i actually going to it and better off i actually throwing it life is good but michael is going to be so pissed at himself that he not coming to this party 7 00 p m will have to show up a little early to make sure everything going off without a hitch and then will have to double back to meet harry for dinner at 7 45 ooh i so excited i dying of excitement will probably be too busy partying madly to write anything but will fill in the blanks of the party scene as soon as possible which will probably be at two o clock in the morning or something ridiculous like that wish me luck 2 00 a m never has there been such an eventful party of course the press were at the windows and the doors trying to get in taking fuzzy pictures through the frosted glass it was amazing the lights the music and since all girls on diets do is think about not being on a diet the food i positive everyone and their two closest friends must have showed up because there must have been 600 wizards and witches no kidding i shook hands with ministry officials and talked to the actor who plays halcius pottotius on the stage plus i met the author of witches are from mars men are just stupid i mean seriously amazing i met harry outside his apartment at seven forty five precisely which should have made him suspicious right away because i am never punctual but he didntsay a thing we chatted and laughed and looked couple y all the way to some random restaurant where i was like close your eyes why he asked just as he was closing his eyes anyway and in a matter of seconds we were at 137 warwick place the yell of surprise was nearly deafening firstly because of the number of people and secondly because celestina warbeck yelled it into her microphone harry had a holy crap expression on his face you did all this i nodded yep happy birthday harry i said giving him a kiss on the cheek you arentmad are you are you kidding me i ve never had a birthday like this before this is amazing yeah he replied looking around are those the weird sisters yes i said beaming it felt like the world was silent because everyone was waiting for the person the night was about to do something indicating that the wild partying could start i motioned to the lead singer to toss me her microphone she unlike celestina warbeck understands the art of turning the mike off first i smiled at harry before saying to a room of expectant guests let get this party started in the manner of pink and the black eyed peas it was tr s magnifique though i admit i did get un peu drunk how could you not there was loud music and champagne everyone was running around frantically and dancing madly even dumbledore was getting down so why not the rest of us fred and george were setting off firecrackers every five seconds and downing ogden old firewhisky while mcgonagall tried not to look amused while drinking gillywater the whole night was insane and the crazier it got the more champagne i drank which was a lot of champagne are you having fun i laughed skipping over to harry and linking his arm in mine when i way past tipsy and not quite drunk i laugh a lot i suppose i ll have to apparate us back harry laughed as i pressed a champagne flute into his hand dontbe so sober i said jokingly in reply watching happily as the weird sisters completed their second set and the loud cheering began in response harry grabbed me and kissed me confirming everyone suspicions once and for all or at least 600 of them i could only grin hysterically but i dontthink that was the champagne i pretty damn sure that was harry nice job mate fred said passing by with a lit firecracker and a potted plant giving harry a wink he thinks i didntsee hey you know what harry asked seeming suddenly inspired what i smiled you know how when you re intoxicated everyone looks slightly hotter it an unfortunate side effect of champagne because i dontthink harry could afford to look any hotter come with me he said the weird sisters were taking a break and trotting down the stairs just as harry and i were racing up them what are you doing i whispered at him but he didntreply only continued upwards onto the stage ladies and gentleman he began clutching my hand fleur he said turning and addressing me i would just like to say thank you so much for coming and that i my heart fell as i heard the front door shut and a very smart bushy haired girl say in a voice that was almost meek happy birthday harry a n this is a crazy long chapter hope you enjoyed kindly review and i love all of you dearly oh my goodness 200 reviews that is so crazy i appreciate it beyond belief will try and update soon much love femme teriyaki ps harry v jacques what this i hear august draco malfoy needs a nanny day one eighty four of free independence saturday august 1st 2005 lying in a state of sadness and despair 6 45 am 6 45 a m despite the wonder of getting things for free because the birthday boy is hot and famous parties still cost a lot of money it a wonder i didntnotice that before because i have just received oh what did jacques call it a bank statement and the statement is to the effect that i have no money and i ought to get some money soon or i shall be evicted and humiliated oh damn it nothing goes off well and to think nothing of my finances what was he going to say i mean last night he was going to say something make an important announcement and he did that thing where he looked back at me all warmly as if to say darling i ve been waiting a bit to say this but i ought to say it now so here goes and then that stupid twit walked in why why why am i asking why when i know the reason why all too well it because it could never be right for me not even just the once at the cool party i was throwing instead of continuing to make toffee eyes at me as he should have been doing he dragged his gorgeous green eyes away to look at hermione standing in her angelic white dress in the doorway how like her to be so clever not only does she draw the eyes of everyone on to her due to her late entrance brilliant i never made such a show stopping entrance but she wearing the dress ren e would have wanted me to wear to the lifetime achievement ceremony the dress that says i am an innocent virgin pure and clean of any wrongdoing but i am also a beautiful angel who you want to take home to your mothers and marry and respect forever all eyes zone in on her linger because she looking ever so beautiful like a maiden marilyn monroe and then revert back to me and i in stark contrast am wearing a slinky backless black dress that instead of saying marry me and respect me forever says screw me i easy it is a dichotomy of good and evil and now everyone sees it and thinks how sweetly she said happy birthday while that tramp on stage drapes herself around the boy who lived and seduces him with champagne so forgiving hermione is but you can tell she was hurt that fleur delacour i never would have trusted her harry looks at me then looks at her then looks at me and we re the devil and angel on his shoulders happy birthday harry i hermione the true love of your life your best friend i ve never done you wrong or gotten you into trouble or embarrassed you all i ve ever done is love you harry i just asking you to love me back versus umm and harry does what any sane person would do he says excuse me and then excuses himself out onto the balcony only the problem with that is when someone torn by the daggers and switchblades of love flees out into the night sky someone is supposed to follow them to make sure they dontcommit suicide or do something stupid and which one of us is supposed to do that i look at hermione and hermione looks at me and the other six hundred people in the room are looking at us so i get off the stage and head for the bathroom 8 15 a m obviously i wasntthe person who was supposed to go after him i said i mean hermione went there to talk to him and it would have only been appropriate for her to go after him and say something to the effect of harry i came here tonight for one reason etc and explain her reasons logically and morally in the way that she does i mean if i d gone after him what would i have said as i am talking to a tea saucer there is no reply jacques is out for some reason i think probably visiting janine and they are probably shagging happily and smoking in bed and thinking life is so beautiful why do we need other people let abandon fleur and have chain sex all year long damn damn damn damn i dontreally know what happened after i went to the bathroom or at least what was going on during i handed the mike back to celestina warbeck as i was getting off the stage so i can only assume she sang and brought the crowd back to party mode that would be the only consolation in this misery pie that the party went off well in the bathroom i scrutinized my dress which i found had a champagne stain at the hem and also that part of the back had been singed by a firecracker which really pissed me off because i paid a lot for the dress and a lot for the party and i wasnthaving a good time and even after harry picking of me it still felt like i had lost and hermione had won why is it that whenever the french and the british do battle the french lose i hate history so after downing the contents of a champagne flute like it was a jell o shot i marched back out into the party resolutely like a general marching back onto the battlefield and was pleased to see everyone chatting amiably i grabbed a waiter by the arm excuse me but could you point me in the direction of the rum s il vous pla t he pointed and i dashed happily over to the open bar excuse me i said sweetly as the bartender turned around but you could give me something in starbucks venti size filled with rum star what do you happen to have a gallon of alcohol umm yes okay well then i ll have half a gallon now and half a gallon later thank you i said however instead of getting me a gallon of alcohol he handed me a martini glass filled with club soda patted me on the shoulder and said you ll be all right sweetheart it sickens me that bartenders feel sorry for me i dragged myself away from the bar and sat on the edge of the chocolate fountain and sat there swinging my foot in the air until harry reemerged from the darkness looking distraught and confused and well impossibly sexy i got up and went over to him and he took my hand and said let me take you home in a very serious way that was not at all comforting and so he took me home dropped me off at the door at 2 a m and didntgive me a kiss not even on the cheek as i was turning the key and instead just walked down to room 16 and shut the door 10 00 a m would floo jacques really would only i dontwant to see any remnants of chain sex at all 10 10 a m but maybe my aversion to bf shag tv is less important than my aversion to being very unhappy for the rest of my adult life 10 20 a m why am i incapable of fixing my own problems why am i so completely incompetent at everything 10 30 a m then again at least harry didntgo home with hermione 12 noon but what if he spent all night thinking about her isntthat so much worse beautiful harry potter climbs in between the sheets and will not think dirty thoughts as i was saying beautiful harry potter climbs in between the sheets and finds he cantstop thinking of his ex girlfriend no not even his ex girlfriend his girlfriend he is taking a mini freaking break from who he could easily run back to as she clearly wants him back he thinks maybe things would be simpler if i were with hermione in his confusion he must make a pro con list pro con list equals that i lose woefully harry potter drags himself out of bed at two in the afternoon the next day with bed head and a newfound clarity to knock on his meaningless fling door to say i so sorry but i ve decided 1 00 p m whimpering pathetically in bed with another club soda martini having realized that drinking is not the answer but rather lying in denial on a soft comforter is misssserable why is screwing annoying ex best friends of one current best friend more important that comforting said current best friend why isntjacques here perhaps will floo no am being an independent creature not a creature of groveling codependency and lack of spine vertebrae entire skeletal structure etc 1 30 p m have no money will get kicked out of apartment will have no bed to lie in and no fridge to cool club soda martinis will have no fireplace to floo from more so will be homeless and will have no life 2 00 p m frantically reading papers will get job thus making myself glamorously busy so when people knock on my door i will not be there and they will have to appreciate me all the more because of my lack of presence however job must be new and amazing as i cannot go back to hogwarts and work in such close proximity to snape and michael further however have basically no job experience so cannot leap into high powered ministry job right away and alternatively must work my way up the scummy job ladder and the scummy job ladder for the under experienced starts on ground level which means i must be paying a visit to the agency for the advancement of veela in the workplace hmm i am a quarter veela so it counts though i have not yet expressed the ability to seduce men at the drop of a hat that renee gift 4 15 p m have actually ventured out of bed to take a shower and paint my nails etc to maintain the appearance of being somewhat physically attractive imagine if i wandered into the agency only to have them look me up and down and say out in the manner of nazi headmistresses would die of shame and crawl underneath a rock to live and not pay taxes 6 30 p m was quite an impressive atmosphere busy beautiful people busy being beautiful everywhere lots of chatter but not petty gossiping chatter which i create everywhere i go but rather productive chatter the like of which you would hear in offices with cubicles and swivel chairs no sooner had i looked around in stunned wonder than a tall impossibly thin model goddess appeared before me you must be new to the agency she said expertly handing me a stack of forms if you would kindly sit in the waiting area she gestured and fill out these forms we would all be much obliged i nodded moderately dumbfounded and went into the beautiful white waiting room which was a cross between a hotel bathroom an insane asylum and heaven to sit down name fleur delacour age 20 eye color blue hair color blonde height 5 8 weight decided it wouldntbe completely horrid to dock a few pounds off my weight because i can always just work it off later and then it wouldntbe a lie it would be an accurate prediction 100 no 120 pounds prior job experience worked at hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry as a teacher assistant and teacher approx five months decided was okay to exaggerate worked as party planner main events planned include harry potter birthday party victory celebration see daily prophet 08 01 05 page four preferred jobs high powered ministry jobs social event planning journalist spy ambassador talents can easily foresee problems that may or may not occur can make a fantastic cup of tea can model lingerie can command class of useless nitwits i e am disciplinarian am fully schooled in the art of alternative self protection i e the trade of temptresses and french schoolgirls down on their luck can easily extinguish fires that was easy right so then i sat down and waited for job application barbie to descend from heaven unclip her wings and give me a job which she did but in several steps it seemed i had barely finished before she reappeared and dragged me into a wide spacious hall filled with seated downtrodden veela looking with rapt under eye circled attention at a podium my tour guide turned to me job auction here you go she said how very clipped how very business like she handed me one of those paper ping pong paddles with my somewhat modified job qualifications on it 20 year old ex hogwarts assistant party planner desperate for work unrealistic expectations low qualifications it was all very flattering dontyou think but there was no use complaining it was simply the paddle life had handed me and smacked me with first job the auctioneer said i was so right she sounded exactly like a nazi headmistress itching to say out assistant to mr percy weasley at the ministry of magic pays five galleons an hour offers pension plan and worker comp i was going to raise my hand but then job application barbie swatted it down pointing at low qualifications wanted so very much to hurl something blunt and metallic at her head but refrained because am trying this stupid thing where one is a good person second job it went on and on with horrid job application barbie swatting down every time up to job 126 barmaid at the leaky cauldron this time j a barbie was forcibly raising my hand into the air and the job goes to fleur delacour the auctioneer said in the manner of a put off telephone operator imagined self in ridiculous eighteenth century barmaid costume a revised edition of the milkmaid costume patented in sweden saying what can i do you for governor la eliza doolittle in my fair lady however i have resolved that that shall not happen rather i will be completely competent and professional and pretend i am not working in a bar but rather in an office plus alcohol and finally the severe auctioneer said glaring individually at everyone in the room as if she had a personal and very specific reason for hating them a job that i advise no self respecting veela take once again this week she took out the sheet that had been sent to the agency see am learning very quickly to capitalize agency in manner of secret spy corporation which proves as i am part of this posh and beautiful unemployed club and read aloud draco malfoy needs a nanny preferably five eight and taller blonde blue eyed gorgeous and with no aversions to dungeons or felony crimes costume provided despite the disturbing nature of this ad i can somewhat understand it dontyou always need a nanny if you never grow up day one ninety three of free independence monday august 10th 2005 preparing for first day of work 7 16 am 7 16 a m all right have clothes strewn all over the floor what do you wear when you are a barmaid and when they donteven say barmaid anymore except in the agency apparently i mean quite obviously i couldntjust show up there in a floor length gown or a business suit but it is my first day on the job and i shouldntlook like a slob or that i dontcare about the position perhaps i should try jeans and a more formal top what does that mean in theory all of that makes sense i suppose but what is a more formal top what the hell should i be looking for i hate men they dress in khakis and drink beer and donthave to think before they leave the house in the morning i mean they probably should but they don t and no one faults them for it no one faults them for wearing khakis but can i wear khakis on my first day of work no why because well actually because i hate khakis 8 00 a m merde en un seau je suis en retard non 12 noon on lunch break miserably eating a sandwich after being reprimanded by new boss large overbearing woman who quite obviously isntmy greatest fan as of this minute am barmaid waitress type wandering around aimlessly asking things like are you being served sigh i wish i were lazily lazing about my in apartment drinking tea and reading wealthy witch books imagining i were as skinny as the protagonist i miss the leisurely life where all i had to worry about was whether or not harry was thinking about hermione as opposed to that coupled with whether or not i properly caring for the customers who smell like day old sweat and moth eaten shoes merde break over 5 00 p m was sitting languidly on chair thinking about nothing except for cosmopolitans when large overbearing woman barked at me to attend to my duties and that lunch break did not extend until three o clock hate working life 7 00 p m off work exhausted disgusted sick 7 30 p m so i was just sitting at the bar well not at the bar but rather leaning comfortably against the bar in the manner of a cool casual working girl who has far better things to do but is gracing you with her presence when who should come over but the bane of my existence and the perpetual wearer of disgusting smelling cologne draco malfoy the little engine that shouldn t hello kitty that is a japanese toy brand not my name leave is that any way to treat your costumers draco said snarkily tossing his hair in the way that only boys do when they dontexactly have enough hair to flip but just enough to jerk their heads in one direction like a head twitch and think it sexy when it not draco dontyou have a bedtime dontyou have some building blocks to play with or some monosyllabic words to learn how to spell my boss kept on looking at me as if i were taking up her valuable time and then snapping her head around as if my looking back at her was making her uncomfortable draco waggled his eyebrow in a ridiculous fashion actually the word of the day is legs he said leaning in far too close for comfort or air so why dontwe go back to my place and spread the and then i smashed his nose into the bar counter it was bloody and disgusting and messy and i had to clean it up it was completely nasty oh and then i got fired 8 30 p m all right whatever i fine i just haventseen harry today that all and there nothing wrong with that i cantsee him every five seconds obviously i mean it not my job to stalk the poor boy i mean what kind of loser does that not me certainly because running up to room 16 to knock pathetically on the door and run away is not at all what i have been doing for the past hour at all i serious day one ninety four of free independence tuesday august 14th 2005 back to the agency 8 10 am 8 10 a m they re going to ask me what i doing back and then get pissed and then shoot me this is seriously not how i want to die i ve always wanted to die in a blaze of glory for example that night at location xyz i would have totally been okay dying there perhaps in harry arms with some accompanying trumpet music that would have been fine this however would just be embarrassing 8 35 a m was about to head out the door with whole dejected and apologetic downtrodden veela speech organized when the least dejected and apologetic downtrodden veela popped up in my fireplace shrieking like a chimpanzee on speed or similar yippee i bought a dress it costs loads of money yippee what do you want ren e i asked wondering how she could possibly sound like a chimpanzee on speed and where i could possibly obtain some well as my far less attractive younger sister i found it incredibly important to inform you about the wonderful things happening in my life to console you about the pathetic things happening in yours speaking of how much more pathetic has your life gotten since i last checked she asked blowing on her fingernails to dry them and rolling her eyes up at the ceiling if you really want to know read the tabloids they always seem to know everything i remarked looking towards the door and wondering if i could telekinetically force to come to me so that i could quickly leap through it without ren e noticing listen ren e i said inching slowly towards the door in a semi imperceptible fashion i have some work to do of course you don t you re jobless and broke what more could you have to do besides listening to me and helping me plan my fabulous wedding now dontbe selfish help me pick out a napkin company you do know that no one gives a damn about napkins right i said i was so close to the door you seriously wouldntbelieve my superb sneaking out of the door skills it these skills which occasionally prompt me to wonder why i am not a secret agent then i realize that i am lazy and inefficient after which point i try to head out the door even faster everyone gives a damn about napkins this is my wedding she exclaimed oh right i forgot everyone gives a damn about napkins because ren e ring is swallowing her hand and her place cards will probably cost more than a war on a small flooded asian country and her hair is the sort of aggressive blonde that some call attractive and others call about to smother me and i must care because i the ugly sister who has no life except for looking amazed at ren e announcements about recipes for wedding reception tea oh of course everyone gives a damn about napkins ren e i am not in the mood can i talk to you about this later ren e was about to let out a manipulatively gasping sob along with the line i ve heard too often in conversations with mum but you re supposed to love me i your insert relation here but i had by that time cleverly snuck out the door 9 00 a m you re back again yes i love how when people ask questions they end them with periods and add an incredulous look to solidify the comfort level of the other person sitting on a cushion with pins sticking out whilst they sit on plush couches and drink expensive coffee i mean i know it really soon but there were complications you smashed someone nose into the bar she read slowly as if i didntknow and was completely illiterate you appeared unapologetic and only showed disgust when you were instructed to clean up the blood well yes but you have to understand the circumstances come with me she said severely standing up and in this process seeming to make her bun even tighter and marching militantly to a room filled with file cabinets she led me into a corner and spent several minutes flipping through the cards looking perhaps like one of those fish species with sucked in cheeks who eat their babies for someone she began flipping furiously with so little respect for the wishes of others passing the d section with so unforgiving a nature passing the g section and with a talent for cleaning up blood she glanced at me austerely there can be only one career path i blinked in a confused and innocent manner hoping she wouldnttoss me out on the streets to be a prostitute for the rest of my life she gracefully extracted a card you re going to be a nanny 10 00 a m a nanny not even a babysitter but a nanny i am going to be cleaning up the blood of snotty little children for the rest of my life i am going to be bouncing little draco malfoys on my knee until my debt to society and my landlord is paid i will have to listen to words like booger and cooties and wait as they sink into my own vocabulary 12 noon i have just been mailed my nanny outfit it looks remarkably like a french maid costume i think they were trying to be ironic every article has a post it note attached to it explaining its use in detail as if i were the most facile and idiotic human being on earth the apron to protect the skirt from stains for wear when cooking and to in a bind beat the children with the skirt an invitation for your employer to overpay you the feather duster another instrument with which you may beat the children a prop for those instances in which you are flirting with your employer the button down shirt while zippers are more fun buttons can be lessened and increased in seductiveness at will buttons easily pop off so that you will have the opportunity to save the child using the heimlich maneuver and be revered by said child parents in case maneuver has been forgotten instructions are on the underside of your apron the three inch patent leather heels to crush people with for your employer pleasure the stockings to cover your legs with in the expensive stone mansions you will be working in which have no central heating latex gloves for sanitation purposes when cleaning up blood maid hat for fun 1 30 p m gah poussi re has just flown in with angry looking scarlet letter demanding that i appear at some snooty sounding location in under twenty minutes as parents are going to the convention for the absurdly rich and do not wish to take their frightening six year old with them now i must put on this ridiculous costume god 2 00 p m despite the ridiculousness of the costume and the fact that i am late i was pleased to discover harry interest as i walked by his apartment in my nanny uniform 2 30 p m please shut up pleeeease stop crying this child is six years old six year olds have no right to cry they can speak for god sake why arentthey using their words since when have we raised six year olds to have no linguistic skills apart from aah and noo as i understood it england as a nation has always prided itself on its stiff upper lip and the upper lip of this little twit keeps quivering and then widening into piercing howls tony blair is doing something wrong 3 00 p m can you impeach a prime minister i think i going to stage a coup and probably no one will notice but still i sitting next to this blonde angelic child who continues to eat my shoes and beat me with a broom i really think i am the one being abused in this situation unlike the instructions on the bottoms of my stilettos indicate i should be contacting amnesty international do they deal with abuse by a child 3 30 p m thomas please stop eating my shoes they cost lots and lots of money and i dontthink your parents want to pay for them i am trying to reason with a six year old and for some reason i keep thinking that it will work that all i have to do is pat thomas on the shoulder and say let talk about our feelings it sort of deluded i know 6 00 p m was patting thomas uselessly on the shoulder when the door burst open and a tightly wound redhead stepped through the door who are you he asked tossing his cape in a very official looking matter making me wonder if perhaps black capes were the new fashion in bouncers these days oh i the nanny i hate saying nanny it a horrible word it reminds me of old ladies with warts on their noses who constantly spout off about making tea and knitting only one of which i do consistently um who are you i was desperately afraid he would blow up and say i only the most important person in the world in charge of your pathetic life you nitwit or similar but instead he raised one eyebrow cynically and said rather pompously percy weasley employee of the ministry you still haventfully answered my question what question i was beginning to wonder if he was going to stand there in the doorway and let the wind flutter through his cape while the sun lit up his hair forever when he stepped inside and pulled me to my feet thomas blinked stupidly in the face of such authority and i admit so did i who are you except it was less of a who are you than a tell me now wench as his character would have remarked in the halcius pottotius book series i sat patiently waiting for him to draw his sword hold it to my neck and shout who do you work for with the zeal and clout that only a member of halcius pottotius band of merry knights could fleur delacour i answered wondering vaguely if percy weasley was scaring thomas who was now teething even more anxiously on my shoes what are you doing here do you know the professions of the people you work for ms delacour percy asked the way he spoke called to mind the word persnickety um they work for banks or something they re ridiculously rich if that what you re asking i said thoughtfully finally bending over to forcibly remove thomas from my shoes i still dontunderstand what going on here i going to have to bring you in for questioning he said austerely stroking his chin as i wondered where i could get him a pipe and a deerstalker hat while he waited around for dr watson you may not be aware of this ms delacour but your employers are under suspicion of being involved in an underground muggle artifacts smuggling ring this ring generally consists of wealthy married couples with young children who constantly attend business functions in which these artifacts are packaged shipped and traded it is this sort of perverted hobby that the ministry is doing its best to halt what about thomas what going to happen to his parents i suddenly had this miserable flashing thought of both of thomas parents going to azkaban of course thomas was a horrid little tyke who was eating my shoes but he didntdeserve to be pseudo orphaned oh god orphans harry oh god harry i ll just need you to come with me ms delacour it is of the greatest importance percy weasley seized my arm and i seized thomas even if i was being employed by corrupt smugglers i would be damned if i lost another job because of negligence percy thrusting his chin forwards in conviction apparated the three of us into the ministry of magic 11 15 p m was in the mom for ages upon ages with thomas whining and whimpering on my lap fiddling with my apron and asking me where his parents were i didntknow what to say and beside that point percy was circling around me in an entirely disturbing fashion are you sure you cantrecall the items in the sitting room anything that stuck out as distinctly muggle to you any eckeltricity running through the house any fellytones mr weasley it electricity and telephones so you do know something percy exclaimed suspiciously it is my firmest belief that percy should have been actively involved in the spanish inquisition he would have been spectacular at it and he would have died five hundred years ago no i dontknow anything not about this i lived with a family of muggles for a year and i picked up concepts such as telephones and electricity that all thomas hopped off of my lap and wandered over to percy desk hopefully to upset things and destroy important documents i was not in a forgiving mood this was a horrible first day on the job percy perched on his desk in a puddle of ink thomas had just spilled fleur delacour he said thoughtfully how would you like to work in the ministry of magic day two hundred of free independence monday august 20th 2005 ha triumphant 7 00 am 7 00 a m well you know what this means this means i will never have to wear an apron again this morning i am looking at the full scope of my wardrobe every business like suit i ever bought despite my family chastisements you ll never wear them you donteven have a job well ha look who has a job now 7 25 a m i am showered scrubbed polished powdered scented and wearing pantyhose i am definitely prepared for the cosmopolitan business world out there checklist for the cosmopolitan business girl by fleur delacour 1 cup of over expensive coffee 2 pairs of pantyhose backup pantyhose is essential 3 current issues of hippest fashion magazine 4 breath mints 5 different ways to look smart 6 different ways to look sexy 7 opportunities to walk by harry potter window 7 35 a m i have never looked so business like in my life i am ber tempted to floo jacques just to say ha look at me i have a job it important i going to make more money than you however that would make me dependent on his approval which is exactly what i am not going to be where is jacques anyway is he even in my life anymore no time to worry about this must get to work 9 45 a m was being business like in the misuse of muggle artifacts office identifying things like cell phones and fire alarms but then i got bored and decided to take out the official ministry of magic quill and describe the goings on first of all percy came to welcome me aboard making a long speech about decorum and efficiency and trust while i filed my fingernails and imagined him in halcius pottotius funny thing about percy he tries to act very adult and professional around underlings like me but when other official er than thou middle aged wizards zip around giving him tilted over the eyeglasses looks and calling him weatherby he shrinks away like a little schoolboy it ber amusing but i feel sort of bad for him 11 15 a m i definitely not going to use the ministry fireplace to floo jacques that just plain immoral plus i have razrs to separate from chocolates light bulbs to arrange by wattage cds to put in their respective cases and suspicious persons files to read and when i done with that i ll fantasize about prince amedeo of belgium gorgeous and mine oh god right work 12 noon so usually i eat lunch over there percy says gesturing vaguely towards stuffy men and stuffier couches but you ll want to sit with people you ll relate to like molly from the mailroom studies show that people with similar job importance enjoy talking and socializing together he so sweet when he being condescending not also while i was not working i thought about not i want to bring it back it the perfect way to end everything that sounds even remotely nice well i sure you have tons of fun eating with dances with stick up his ass i mumbled excuse me merde i mean mr twycross i sure you have tons of fun eating mr twycross from now on i will have to remember to keep my native american names for all my coworkers to myself well actually he a very informative man i learn lots of lots of really top secret important ministry things from eating lunch with him he says that i one of the ministry most valuable assets percy said in a strange balance between arrogance and embarrassment as if he was trying desperately to be suave but unlike harry potter had never taken lessons i mean it a real a real privilege to be able to eat lunch with him i honestly felt like asking him if it was also a real privilege to have his lips permanently attached to mr twycross ass as well but he calls you weatherby well percy said with an uncomfortable air to his voice everyone around here calls me weatherby it doesntmean they dont know my name it just that well it like a little nickname no they they know my name definitely right are you sure i mean not that they know your name but that you d rather be eating lunch with everyone over there who about fifty years older than you studies show that people with similar ages also enjoy talking and socializing together you know percy looked indecisive for a few seconds going into a series of facial acrobatics the likes of which i have never seen before um yes yes i sure i hope you have a lovely first day here at the ministry percy said loosening his tie briefly before straightening it and trying in vain to tighten it again walking away into a sea of age and gray haired prosperity 5 30 p m whatever i being paid a lovely amount of money at this job i have no reason to be bored when i being paid so wonderfully not to be i definitely not having fun painting my nails and playing with a recently confiscated cell phone i not jealous that those muggle artifact smugglers have the new pink ipod nano it only that i wish i had that ipod nano and painting my nails and fiddling with electronics is incredibly amusing to me and this job is like watching grass grow you re so dedicated a voice rings out in admiration as i fall out of my chair christ percy dontscare me like that i screech from the floor i honestly think the ministry should invest in carpets these cold black and gray tiles are doing nothing for the atmosphere any interior designer would be appalled oh sorry he says beaming to the top of his red hair it just most people at this job chuck these artifacts into their appropriate bins in disgust but you you re going so in depth look at you dismantling that muggle artifact contriving that pink thing to make noises and flash words across the surface how brilliant i look at percy with bemusement for a few seconds before climbing back into my chair well it good to know you think i doing so well well you are percy smiles and then glances behind him well i better go i needed on some official business of course you are but i see bright things in your future i nod and he turns to go before stopping and turning back to me fleur ms delacour he begins smiling that same old schoolboy looking coming to his face maybe you d like to have lunch with me and mr twycross tomorrow i hoping i didntwince because in my mind i was grimacing percy tr s mignon but i am most definitely not interested in three way with percy and a 70 year old ministry wizard or maybe you could come eat lunch with me i suggest clandestinely switching songs on the ipod i hiding under the desk percy looks unsure all right all right sure he smiles i ll see you tomorrow fleur he says walking off into the distance while spoon gimme fiction happily blasts in my ears day two hundred five of free independence friday august 25th 2005 the official beginning of the official end of my very first week 7 00 am 7 00 a m i not going to lie i ve grown to greatly enjoy putting on skirt suits and prancing out the door picking up expensive coffee in london knowing that my paycheck will cover it at the end of the month it sort of fabulous knowing that you dontowe your parents say 350 silver sickles for a pair of boots you bought on a whim it the true feeling of independence and i love it also pantyhose not as uncomfortable as people make it out to be 8 00 a m aha i not only made for jobs which involve cleaning up blood and having no concept of human emotion i can organize cell phones and ipods spy on people and correct exploding toilets i have no idea why the entire exploding toilet joke never gets old but for some reason it never does 10 00 a m percy is smiling at me from a million miles away in the ministry oh wait no he definitely just started walking very quickly in another direction percy weasley is a very confusing individual perhaps some therapy will help him overcome his indecisiveness and obsessive compulsive disorder 12 noon apparently we re alternating on tuesday percy and i ate lunch together but he looked longingly at the conversations of his superiors which looked as boring as hell on wednesday he excitedly dragged me into the glowingly comfortable recesses of the ministry where the top officials work and participated actively in a conversation about section sixteen of a document i d never heard of on thursday he ate lunch with me once more and this time managed not to mention important documents 101 steps to becoming a model citizen or the history of the ministry of magic instead he managed to talk about his family how he came to be working at the ministry other things he likes to do besides filing and taking notes so today i must venture back towards those insanely fluffy couches and those morbidly boring human beings 3 30 p m are you okay percy asked because my eyes were quite clearly out of my head as i stared in amazement at the wizards and witches who were somehow able to talk about the same thing for an half an hour yes they were definitely extending my lunch break but there was only so far i could extend my tolerance you look a little sick what on earth are they talking about i asked then i realized that i had broken one of the cardinal rules of dealing with percy weasley do not ask him to explain anything he started to say well when i cut him off it just i began sometimes i feel a wee bit left out here why as if anyone could ever feel left out among talks of legislature and business who doesnt read finance for the modern wizard daily people here are always talking about i dontknow finance and business and law making and rules i explained i ve just never been really big on finance and business and law making and rules that all i dontknow very much about it well i could get you a subscription to finance for the modern wizard no thanks i said quickly thanks but no thanks i tried to make up for my quick dismissal of what was clearly his favorite newspaper with a smile with a sigh percy checked his watch oh god must be back to work hope you have a good day fleur he smiled goodness what a nice boy he d be if he werentsuch a workaholic 7 00 p m wandering around the complex at 7 pm noticing how dreadfully alone i am i feel like ever since harry birthday he been gone what the hell did hermione say to him on that balcony should i have been the one to chase after him or is he just ignoring me now and now i at his door looking at the gold 16 wondering what on earth i was thinking doing all of this i think it might all be so much easier if i simply stopped thinking about harry potter a n all right so school a bitch and i ve forgotten what sleeping is like and my dorm room is a disgusting pig sty so i live in squalor and filth however i have a 21 day christmas break so guess what i going to write as much fanfiction as i possibly can over the course of the next 21 days because god knows i cantdo it at school as proven by the 20 year hiatus i love you forgive me kisses femme teriyaki september part i corporate ladder theory day two hundred twelve of free independence friday september 1st 2005 lying awake and confused which should be illegal 4 45 am 4 45 a m why am i awake oh god i awake because i cantsleep i keep thinking about harry door isntthat ridiculous not him but his door maybe i should have knocked no how creepy would that have been i ve been thinking about you so i wandered over to your door to stare at it for an hour or so god god god he forgotten all about me and i ve go to forget all about him 5 30 a m but everything reminds me of him my bed covers my damn bed covers they remind me of rumples i think about him in the shower i think about him in my towel and when i washing the dishes yes i do wash the dishes sometimes especially now that jacques is off in la la land with the bitch queen of misery i think about making out with him on the sink god i a tramp chocolate chocolate reminds me of him it ll be amazing for my diet i suppose looking at chocolate and then immediately bursting into tears however there was yesterday when i saw that piece of chocolate sitting innocently on the counter and then pounced on it but i sure that wontactually happen much more often chocolate isn t that seductive 7 00 a m okay right so there a box of chocolates on the floor of my bedroom right now half empty because half of those chocolates are in my mouth harry freaking left them at my door this morning with a cute little freaking note like i so sorry about the birthday i know you went through a lot and it meant a lot to me thanks harry i suppose he thought it would make me feel better about not having freaking seen him in what seems like a year but it sort of feels like when people pick up hallmark sympathy cards because they dontknow what to actually say or when your boyfriend breaks up with you on a post it note because he doesnthave any idea how to deal with the weeping mess you ll become or doesnt want to doesntcare enough so now here i am on the bed eating the most chocolate i ve ever allowed myself to have in a month was definitely on the track to 120 definitely thinking about how like chocolate harry is one of those things you think you can do without but in actuality have to have all the time to be happy 8 00 a m freaking work hate working love martinis from this point onwards in my life i resolve to drink nothing that doesntcome in a martini glass am definitely going to pick up some chocolate liqueur on the way back from work and play the drinking game with halcius pottotius 9 00 a m what is this thing supposed to do asks jeremy a very small coworker of mine who i swear is twelve years old pointing out a microwave the mafia muggle artifacts for insignificant amounts a corporation we busted a few days ago was peddling it supposed to heat food right now it is permanently setting things on fire just remove the old spell and put a simple heating spell on it i said i ve been extinguishing fires that microwave has been setting for since wednesday but i suppose it given me a chance to brush up on the spells i learned from flitwick all right murmurs jeremy in a disgruntled i hate muggle crap fashion i dontthink he realizes the seriousness of the situation at hand stopping the mafia seizing their artifacts and putting these artifacts into my purse 12 noon lunch talk about something other than gringotts pleasssse 1 30 p m all right so i made percy take me out of that disgusting pool of oldness how can you stand it i just dontunderstand it you grew up with fred and george and all of that how can you possibly enjoy talking about banking i would assume you would find firecrackers and candy that turns your teeth green more interesting than finance and politics i ve really never found that sort of thing amusing percy said earnestly i mean i guess that what you might expect but you know my dad works in the ministry and i so looked up to him growing up i guess i just thought awww you just wanted to please your parents i smiled i sort of have this condition in which i inadvertently treat human beings like puppies and kittens and thereby coo at everything they do sorry i said quickly realizing that i was embarrassing myself it just i definitely know what you mean i ve been through my fair share of trying to please my parents too well i sure they re proud of you percy remarked briefly putting down his copy of the daily prophet which was a humongous feat for him i sure he was just getting to what brightens his each and every day his favorite part prophet politics oh no i reassured him thinking of the christmas lights i had to disenchant when i got off my lunch break and how entirely delighted my parents would be thinking of their daughter wearing stockings in a cold office untangling sequences of wires what are you talking about you were in the triwizard tournament i know that didntquite turn out the way anyone really expected it to go but still and just in july you helped defeat he who must not be named that quite an accomplishment for someone who barely twenty i guess i sighed having one of those annoying flashbacks that always lead to revelations in soap operas but just seem to be annoying in real life the triwizard tournament that where i first met harry no we re not thinking about harry not thinking about harry at all i going to get back to my desk i said abruptly grabbing my coat see you soon percy 4 45 p m off work painting nails in apartment i am definitely going to start taking charge of my life i taking charge of my life with glittery nail polish i donthave to miserable just because i not entirely sure of what going on with me or anyone just because harry been distant doesntmean the end of the world he wouldntbe distant if he didnthave a perfectly legitimate reason for being so i sure of nothing but still 6 00 p m good god mail from harry most fear inducing words in the english language in red ink staring straight up at me we need to talk love harry love no stop that we need to talk we should have talked weeks ago after he dumped me at the door like a package he was dropping off or the way you would drop off a little kid at daycare but with far less affection i should have done something about that when the time was right instead of being a coward about the entire situation but i just sat there waiting for him to floo me or send me an owl or something and now he leaving pity chocolates at my door and sending me we need to talk notes but we haventtalked in so long that it doesnteven matter what could he possibly have to talk to me about now 7 00 p m desperate for advice and realizing that i cannot be an island flooing jacques immediately here goes jacques fleur fleur you sound surprised must be because i haventseen you in month could that be it jacques you sound upset you re upset arentyou fleur you see usually your radar goes off when i sad or in a state of extreme emotional distress but since oh say july 31st i ve been in plenty of distress and your radar hasntbeen going off now would that be because you ve been busy or because you just dontcare anymore jacques fleur i would never stop caring about you fleur then where the hell have you been jacques i ve been really busy there ve been a ton of tutoring jobs for me to do and janine fleur okay so janine who you ve been dating for about two and a half seconds has suddenly become your wife and i ve become your dirty mistress who you talk to when she out buying groceries no more and no less jacques fleur that a horrible metaphor fleur well if you d been around correcting my english these past few weeks then my metaphor would have been amazing now wouldntit jacques i sorry i ve been gone but janine sent me an owl and i decided to go over and things have just been so hectic that i haventreally been able to fleur please just talk to me next time okay i have withdrawals i was beginning to get hives jacques you were not fleur okay so i wasn t but my foot did itch during my lunch break today jacques lunch break fleur you ve missed so much i have a job now i work at the ministry of magic in the misuse of muggle artifacts office i getting paid to disenchant cell phones and listen to ipods isntthat fantastic jacques if ever there were a job for you that would definitely be it i not exactly sure how you landed it but fleur well percy weasley busted my previous employers on charges of muggle artifact peddling so he just hired me after he took me in for questioning jacques so you ve had more than one job miraculous fleur why is that so hard to believe i ve saved the world before and i cantget a decent job jacques no honey no you can t fleur shut up actually yes i was working as a nanny jacques you re kidding fleur stop laughing at me oh god that reminds me i have to return the uniform jacques uniform fleur oh god it was some trashy french maid number it super disgusting thank god you never saw it jacques you re right i have missed a lot i could have made fun of you for weeks about that fleur i hate you but on that note would you please come home jacques janine fleur i swear to god if you say her name one more time jacques oh as if you donttalk about harry 24 7 fleur actually i have resolved to stop thinking about harry after the party he callously dropped me like a last season handbag and hasntspoken to me since jacques curiously really because as i recall you two have a little baby rumple to take care of who gets custody fleur no one because as i recall you murdered my baby rumple with your ocd straightening powers jacques please dontremind me i ve been trying to repent for my sins he dropped you like a last season handbag you say fleur yes it was horrible and then this morning he dropped off a pity present it was miserable these super delicious chocolates they were just sitting there wrapped in this adorable little bow outside my door with some stupid little thank you note about the party and a stupid little i sorry when the whole damn thing went off about a month ago like he could just fix it just like that and then i got home from work today that not funny i have a job jacques clearly suppressing laughter sorry continue fleur well i got home from work today to see poussi re there with a note from him jacques how dramatic these plot twists become more and more fascinating every single day fleur i know my life is amusing to you but do try to save your sarcasm for the end so i got home and there this stupid little note that says we need to talk what the hell about what how he been ignoring me jacques i sure he hasntbeen ignoring you he probably just didntknow what to say to you or maybe he been dealing with some really serious personal issues i mean he a superhero generally they have pretty serious personal issues fleur you re right peter parker and mary jane took forever to get together because of his personal issues jacques exactly fleur but i know he a superhero so what the big deal jacques well you ll have to talk to him to find out fleur i canttalk to him i starting over it going to be like one of those things like you know how in movies when people clean their apartments and then suddenly their minds clear and they march out into the world and take charge of their lives well it going to be like that only this isnta movie jacques chuckling right fleur dontchuckle at me i serious i ve had an epiphany and i going to start over and focus on my career and i can call what i do a career because i wear pantyhose now jacques smirking i just glad you ve embraced underwear again fleur the eyes that mock why have i extended you an invitation back into my life jacques because you cantlive without me and you need someone to hold your shopping bags fleur right right so anyway there will be no talking with harry no more pity chocolates jacques darling that because you ate them all fleur i did n okay so i did but still i had to eat them i starting over it a clean slate an empty chocolate box in my mind i ve given him up completely and soon i will be able to bravely walk by him and not smile at him or have eye sex or jacques did you just say eye sex fleur yes jacques it like regular sex only the worst thing you can get from it is a small eye twitch jacques lovely make sure to carry eye drops fleur what that supposed to mean jacques nothing fleur sure so i starting a new life and that life should have you in it come home please jacques fleur can i tell you something fleur secrets yay jacques fleur that not comforting at all fleur whatever what did you want to tell me jacques just between you and me fleur yes jacques i already packed fleur i love you see in the a m jacques you re a ridiculous human being fleur i know it one of my best character traits night jacques good night 9 00 p m super blissful ultra wondrous am taking an early night so i can wake up early and start my flat cleaning head clearing venture day two hundred thirteen of free independence saturday september 2nd 2005 cleaning 5 50 am 5 50 a m i utterly amazed at how getting up too early for your own good can be so amazingly good for you so far i haventdone any cleaning but just thinking about it has made my mind miraculously clear itself i am definitely ready to start marching out into the world except my apartment is really really disgustingly messy so i probably should clean it first 8 00 a m taking a brief cleaning break sitting on the couch lots of light streaming in as is beautiful sunny september day and feeling clear and marvelous like vodka except unlike vodka i not tasteless as a matter of fact i think what i ve done with the flat so far wouldnt make the only interior designer i know ren e fianc e vomit i almost feel like painting the walls but i dontthink i allowed to that and the smell of house paint makes me faint 11 00 a m okay so have straightened my bookshelves and hidden all the trash e g wealthy witch books and temptation nyc book series under my bed in a shoebox have displayed pilates books so that a it looks like i work out and b i might actually consider working out i even in a strange spasm disinfected the air with a clever spell i looked up in charming your apartment interior decorating for the wise witch then i displayed said book on the coffee table along with today paper and a bowl of potpourri i found underneath my bed i made my bed and straightened the picture frames and charmed all the dirt out of the carpet i sent all my dirty clothes out to the laundry except this time i remembered to save some clothes to wear for after i get out of the shower now i going to go attack my closet 2 30 p m i swear to god fleur jacques is saying looking at me disapprovingly i leave you alone for a month dontsay five seconds in that trademark way you do because this time it was longer than five seconds it was an entire month an entire agonizing 30 days jacques i remind him lounging languidly on my couch why are you wearing that dress he asks okay so i was attacking my closet and i was looking through it all seeing what was unnecessary i know right how can one seriously go through one closet with the intent of throwing clothes away isntthat some sort of blasphemy against everything even remotely sensible or fashionable so anyway i was going through my closet and i found the dress that i wore to the lifetime achievement ceremony and it brought back such memories of how simple okay not simple but you know what i mean things were back then so i tried it on again and have been lounging on the couch reading the snitch report ever since well i was tidying up my closet stop right there jacques said looking beyond confused you were doing what i clean i ve changed since you ve been gone jacques demontmorency i clean i gave him an intensely meaningful look as if to say this is what happens when you leave mister so i was cleaning out my closet and then i saw the dress and i couldnthelp but start thinking you were doing what and so i put it on and it was like it like that night in may again like sitting at those tables with place cards in such gorgeous fonts and wearing such amazing shoes and being with harry and not worrying about anything fleur you havent not worried about anything since you were eight years old jacques asserted sitting on the couch with me and forcing me to move my feet disrupting my carefully structured lounging position i know that jacques it just that you know what no more i getting changed there no use in lying around mooning over some guy who probably doesntthink about me anymore he going his own way and i going my own way and maybe sometimes our paths will cross but ultimately i my own person and that person does not need the pain that comes with unrequited love i said i think i read that spiel in an athena o hereagall book but it thoroughly convinced jacques darling is that from halcius pottotius and his fair lady i think jacques is too aware of everything some time in the future he needs to shut his eyes and be oblivious he should take it from me that it immensely fun yes but it really describes how i feel i grinned help me up we re going to go clean and catch me if i start to fall back into despair preparing to catch jacques replied i missed you i know 7 00 p m am now contentedly having dinner with jacques in a blissfully clean apartment i should have known having jacques around would instantly raise the sanitation grade of my apartment after a bit he proclaimed that i needed to sit on a nearby couch and see how things should be done within the course of an hour and a half i swear he completely transformed this place i barely recognize this beautiful sparkling palace of cosmopolitan perfection it the epitome of a posh london apartment god i didntknow what living was up till now definitely not day two hundred sixteen of free independence tuesday september 5th 2005 marching resolutely back into the world 6 40 am 6 40 a m oh my god my head is so clear i donteven understand it yesterday at work yes that was clear but as time goes on i feel like it all just gets clearer and clearer maybe happiness and clarity is a function of cleanliness because as i getting clearer and clearer my flat continues to get cleaner and cleaner and since it easy to conclude that cleanliness is a function of jacques it must be all his glorious doing that i so amazingly happy i am going to have to get him an amazing christmas present 7 30 a m all right jacques i off for work i definitely love shouting that it so self encouraging maybe a job was what i really needed not just some degrading job being ogled by a perverted potions professor but rather a job that really makes me feel like i should be gracing the covers of vogue in pant suits and heels i feel like treating myself now i going to go out and buy a puppy all right have a nice day dontdo anything i wouldntdo jacques calls from coffee table turning the pages of what the hell finance for the modern wizard he looks up briefly and dontbuy a puppy fleur that not treating yourself it hurting an innocent animal party pooper i sigh if i were a little kid standing by a merry go round with a balloon jacques would sneak up behind me and pop it i swear arentyou going to be late for work it doesntend nag nag nag like my mother would be if she were thirty years younger and read the daily prophet have you sorted your socks into matching pairs yet agh stop it 7 30 do you know where your priorities are fine i leaving 12 noon on my usual lunch break you certainly look happier percy remarks stirring his coffee even his coffee is direly serious he takes it black isntthat like punishing yourself why was i not happy before i ve known percy for all of one month exactly and already he noticing the cracks usually people start catching on to my neuroses much later on in the relationship or you know i may be deceiving myself not that you weren t happy before percy fumbles he sincerely is one of the most awkward human beings i have ever met i beginning to think that this is a weasley thing it just you seem lighter today you i dontknow glow i am appalled by this statement pregnant women glow excuse me it altogether pissier sounding than i wanted it to be oh god that s that not what i meant to say um see you could stamp awkward on his forehead in his brain this very second he reviewing the connotations of the word glow and wondering where he went wrong sorry it just that in my warped world glowing equals pregnancy i smiled because everything okay as long as you smile percy looks absolutely mortified oh or not remind me to try and ease you slowly into my neuroses instead of heaping it on full force like this i said half to percy half to myself but anyway so i seem happier but i wasntunhappy well yes you just seem clearer yes i shout in excitement having my own meg ryan in when harry met sally moment right that second as everyone in the room turned to look at me with a slightly paranoid look in their eyes sorry again it just that that exactly the word i was thinking when i was thinking with my super clear mind this morning so much for easing you slowly into my neuroses no i think i fully prepared stammered percy with a smile there altogether too much sanity in the ministry of magic anyway this from stuffy mcstufferson i think i bringing about a much needed change in percy i think i should be getting a nobel prize 5 00 p m how was your day darling marvelous darling i say skipping over to the couch flinging my coat in the corner and scooting next to jacques what have we been doing all day we ve been grading japanese exams i swear the difference between hiragana and katakana completely escapes some people he sighs in frustration wielding his red pen like the weapon it is while there are days when i think jacques would be best suited as a stuffy businessman or an underwear model the truth is he such a tutor he could never be anything else so what did you do at work today one day you re going to stop finding the fact that i have a job funny i told him my entering the working world is completely plausible like i ve never had a job before i ve had several and that will be a sad sad day in this household he replied ooh do we constitute a household now i think we do he tossed one exam off to the side whoever jeffrey is he ll be incredibly upset and picked up another one darling do you just keep all this insanity bottled up when i not around or does it erupt everywhere like a volcano or have you miraculously replaced me well there a very nice boy at work for a second jacques looks absolutely terrified but dontworry jacques he could definitely never replace you i not beyonc i canthave another you in a minute your de mugglefication is going so very well jacques smiled what a new hexed ipod came in today it had irreplaceable what was i supposed to do so this boy at work jacques interrupted concerned he not the new me i shook my head no is he the new harry jacques asked sounding if possible more concerned than he had been before oh of course not we re friends right jacques replied giving me the eyebrow raise right day two hundred eighteen of free independence thursday september 7th 2005 off to work 7 40 am 7 40 a m darling i leaving okay that not your line jacques gets up from the coffee table and comes over to the door leaving he asks distraught punishing me for my misdeeds are we oh god fleur i promise i ll never leave you again fine but next time on cue okay i love you too fleur jacques smiles yeah yeah yeah 12 noon thankfully percy and i have stopped alternating no more mailroom molly and no more dances with stick up his ass twycross instead we re une petite le in the lunch scene and we haventtalked about politics in entire days c est tr s miraculeux je dois c l brer quand j arrive mon petit appartement 6 30 p m home it been days and guess what it still clean isntthat wondrous fleur yes sweetheart sit down i entirely frightened by the words sit down they usually proceed there something i have to tell you and we need to talk which are words no girl wants to hear ever fleur jacques begins i think i might have to introduce ladder theory into this situation ladder theory yes i afraid it entirely necessary jacques sits down gravely so this boy from work you re friends you say yes i reply thinking delightedly of my success remember when you made me watch when harry met sally i nod even though i didntreally make jacques watch when harry met sally he passive aggressively insisted upon it i hate to say it fleur but men and women cantbe friends because the sex part always gets in the way jacques we re friends i remind him i not done jacques says pacing like a businessman just about ready to pull out a pie chart and a pointer there are three exceptions men and women cantbe friends unless the man doesntfind the woman attractive the man is in a relationship or the man is gay jacques that horrible i exclaim it makes it sound like friendship between men and women depends entirely upon men and that offends my feminist sensibilities i tempted to chuck backlash at him but i have a feeling that he wouldntappreciate it and also that the pages would crumple and then i wouldnthave a legitimate chance to actually read it i didntwant to introduce ladder theory but it introduced itself jacques replies attempting to curtail my offended shrieks of injustice if he wasntjacques he would have lost his hearing by now i know ladder theory is horrible and sexist and a little too snarky for pop psychology but in it own sick little way it has a point wait a minute i sigh thinking the theory over for a second so we can be friends because you re with janine at this point i paused to throw up a little in my mouth but percy and i cantbe friends because but what if he doesntfind me attractive impossible he could be in a secret relationship i dontknow about high improbable jacques insisted shaking his head he could be gay percy gay noooo couldntbe day two hundred twenty four of free independence wednesday september 13th 2005 at the office 9 15 am 9 15 a m okay so i not going to lie what jacques has said about ladder theory has definitely stayed in my head since last thursday and even secretly listening to julian casablancas singing automatic stop hasntcleared my head this is a huge issue now that my head been clear i definitely dontwant to go back to my old state of confusion so i guess i have to settle this whole thing about whether or not percy has une petite crush on me 1 30 p m so i was having lunch with percy today when he stopped innocently eating his pb and j to say as nervously as possible um fleur mm hm well i was just thinking i mean that i just wanted to cordially invite you to i mean to accompany me to a family function this weekend the the the 15th i mean just maybe he stammered looking down on his sandwich i frowned a little you mean like a date oh no percy exclaimed i mean not no it just that i dontthink of you that way oh i quipped relieved dontfeel bad to be honest i a wee bit relieved about the entire thing romance makes everything so complicated i paused for a second that damned ladder theory popping into my head may i ask why what i mean not to make things more awkward than they already are i began as a preface to making things more awkward than they already were but you see one of my friends mentioned how i dontknow men and women cantbe friends because the sex part always gets in the way and i was wondering why arentyou interested in me umm at which point percy started looking for exits for which i simply cannot blame him i mean dontworry about it i repeated it only that i curious for reference purposes well as as long as we re b being honest fleur do you have a girlfriend is that it you have a girlfriend right and she really pretty and that why you re not interested because you ve already succeeded in having a wonderful relationship that why right i asked while percy sat speechless actually you dontthink i pretty right i said suddenly grasping at straws filled with insatiable curiosity go ahead i can take it my sister been telling me i not pretty for years no percy said flustered you you re very pretty it just that i mean i i couldnt think of you that way it just that i m i m oh my god you re gay is it that obvious he burst out bright red oh my god oh my god percy promptly began to hyperventilate and horrified i scooted my chair over to him and insisted he calm down it not that obvious percy i assured him patting him on the back i so effing lucky it was a noisy day in the ministry today across the hall they d hauled in a wizard who d tried to transfigure into a grizzly bear and was only half successful it just that i have super excellent gaydar there are sensors for this percy shrieked nearly falling out of his chair i rushed to catch him and put him in his rightful position before anyone noticed and asked why weatherby was looking even more freakishly pale than usual no gaydar is just something you develop from living in france for a very long time i said please just forget about it i totally cool with it and i d love to come that er family function on friday okay percy said with a comforted smile wiping a stray bead of sweat from his forehead sorry about that well just pack a suitcase it s sort of a weekend thing until the 19th i ll pick you up around five i think i have your address on file someplace sounds lovely i looking forward to it 6 45 p m jacques you can breathe out now i called waltzing through the apartment percy will definitely not be the new harry anytime soon jacques popped up from the kitchen where he had clearly been foiling my plans to cook dinner tonight as we say in france il est un homosexuel i smiled extending the elle in only my fave french way i love french everything sounds so much better it sounds like you re ordering dinner speaking of get out of the kitchen i cooking tonight i insisted throwing my bag in the corner and dashing towards the entranceway over my dead body jacques lives in mortal fear of my cooking because of the tiny little fact that i only recently learned how to boil water however he shouldntworry because i have always all right not always but most of the time been able to read instructions if necessary jacques remember how you ve done me wrong how you ve left me alone and cold i quite enjoy the guilt trip it like a vacation that you donthave to pack for fleur you were definitely never cold it summer jacques pointed out with heinous disregard for my emotions damn it jacques you men have spent hundreds of years trying to get women to stay in the kitchen and cook and now that one wants to do it for you you re telling her no okay point taken cook away jacques responded jumping out of the way he also lives in mortal fear of my tirades on misogyny and chauvinism thank you day two hundred twenty six of free independence friday september 15th 2005 post work 1 13 pm 1 13 p m frantically dashing through flat as i have characteristically neglected to pack until the day i leaving jacques is staring at me in that way that says how did i know you would forget to pack until now and i returning his stare in a way that says how did i know you wouldnt remind me jacques and i donthave eye sex we have eye conversations and the worst thing you can get from that is pissed 2 00 p m why is packing so hard you would really think that it just throwing things into a suitcase but actually it an intricate process jacques has interrupted to say that packing is only hard if you have an odd obsession with packing every outfit you own and have no concept of time excuse me while i attack him 3 00 p m wasted an hour attacking and making up with jacques he such a distraction which begs the question why is it that i got even less done when he wasntaround i ve got two hours until percy comes to pick me up so i ve created a tentative packing list oh god must now pack an array of modest comfortable and sexy clothes i will need modest clothes when surrounded by weasley parents who will need to see me as not a slut comfy clothes as a break from the sexy clothes and sexy clothes because well because i actually am a slut at least mentally what i will definitely definitely need this weekend by fleur delacour with brief commentary by jacques demontmorency 1 toothbrush toothpaste hairbrush makeup razors shaving cream soap towel bathrobe perfume shampoo conditioner exfoliant astringent toner it suddenly very clear why you take forever in the shower fleur 2 two pairs of jeans regular and skinny two skirts three sweaters one blouse three shirts one oxford one dress one blazer one hat two scarves three sets of pajamas 2 naughty 1 nice eight pairs of socks two pairs of stockings let me just remind you that you re going away for 5 days not months 3 an umbrella insect repellent two pairs of sunglasses 4 jacques has forbidden me from listing the 18 pairs of shoes i am taking with me because he thinks it disgraceful and wants to save all the trees that would be wasted by making this list 5 a copy of the asp handbook because you never know fleur why 4 45 p m percy going to be here any minute oh god i must start immediately tearing through and looking for all the crap i ve surely forgotten jacques please help me out here fleur i dontknow what astringent is 7 00 p m so percy met me at the door and chatted me up about how lovely the burrow where they live i suppose is in september he told me the fascinating back story ottery st catchpole where the burrow is located he gave me a warning worthy of the surgeon general about fred and george including presents to accept and food to refuse from them he explained briefly how he and his family have been on with percy what else awkward terms as of late and advised me to tread lightly when talking about the ministry lastly he informed me that his father arthur weasley was incredibly fascinated by all things muggle and that he would no doubt ask me why he hadntseen me around the office lately and beg me to regale him with stories of spark plugs i was to at this point politely state that i couldntremember the majority of my muggle experiences in america because i was heavily sedated the entire time however percy weasley a master of precision and effectiveness who is no doubt one of the ministry most valuable employees neglected to mention just one tiny detail this was no small weasley family function no not just that at all it was hermione granger birthday party a n all right so i was supposed to wait until tomorrow to update but i couldnthelp myself it was so hard my best friend and beta has me on a schedule now and it shredding my nerves eating my soul so hope you enjoyed review please loves femme teriyaki ps percy fleur what nooooooo september part ii weekends weatherby and the weasleys day two hundred twenty seven of free independence saturday september 16th 2005 day 2 of the worst weekend ever 4 30 am 4 30 a m happy birthday hermione that what it said on the humongous glittery banner in front of my face as i walked in the door waving gloriously as if to say hello have we met i hermione birthday banner i blinked vapidly for a few seconds reading the words over and over again in aghast disbelief and then i dashed towards the door just as i was about to make my expert getaway percy caught me he a lot stronger than he looks what are you doing he asked a bemused and panic stricken expression on his face of course the look on his face was nothing compared to the look on mine well i not going to stay i hissed quickly looking around for signs of a bushy haired girl with an axe what were you thinking dragging me to hermione birthday party a writhing pit of snakes sure front row seats to fear factor vomit edition fantastic a double date with mick jagger and steven tyler great sure whatever but this i would rather be roasted alive than be here right now i dontunderstand hermione one of your old students percy said furrowing his brow what wrong with attending one of your students birthday parties well the fact that she hates me might be one thing i said there was a faint hum of noise coming from beyond the hallway but no one had seemed to notice that percy and i had arrived i grabbed percy hand and was about to drag him off to discuss his idiocy when a redheaded woman mrs weasley i assumed from percy mortified gasp of mum festively entered the room effectively interrupting the dragging process percy it so nice to see you she said smothering him in a hug while i stepped aside and counted off ways i was going to punish her son forever you ve grown so tall and so so thin she cooed worriedly have you been eating you look so pale mum percy exclaimed suddenly embarrassedly shooting me a look of uncomfortable desperation at me the only person who could have possibly been feeling more uncomfortable and desperate than him mrs weasley followed her son gaze looking at me with a critical stare which terrified me more than steven tyler eating cockroaches in a vat of snakes ever could i see you ve brought a friend she said i immediately straightened my posture fleur delacour i introduced myself extending my hand mrs weasley looked furious pleased alarmed surprised and as if she had known it all along in the space of a second well she said smiling at percy and watching me suspiciously it always nice to meet one of percy girlfriends my eyes widened girl lovely to see you too mum percy interrupted grabbing my hand and nearly twisting my fingers off i have to talk to fleur for just one tiny little second he smiled as mrs molly weasley exited the room throwing me a chilling look over her shoulder as she left to sound the alarm and no doubt smother more offspring as soon as she disappeared percy shoved me into the nearest linen closet i going to kill you percy i told him as he shut the door i going to kill you and then i going i going i going to disorganize your tie collection fleur what is the big deal he asked what the big deal what the big deal have you read page four lately can you read at all i shouted before realizing that i was in a house where the walls had both ears and red hair no seriously i whispered as angrily as possible how could it just slip your mind that hermione wants me dead for her birthday i donteven know what you re talking about percy insisted poking his head out of the door apprehensively and then slamming the door back shut i dontread page four i throw that part of the prophet away what going on with you and hermione i turned red never mind i just i just really cantbe here right now before i could come up with a rare mutation of the plague and disappear into the mid afternoon percy let out a strangled cry like a dying cat or a muggle realizing they were seated on yet another exploding toilet you cant leave me here percy said urgently i looked at him surprised i haventspoken to my family in god knows how long i wouldntbe here if i didntthink there d be someone here on my side i thought that was you percy i on your side but for four days percy ploughed on just four days could you stick around please and try not to upset my mother percy sighed and made a movement as if he was about to start pacing before realizing that there was no room to pace oh god and please donttell her about my my being gay i offered shhh percy exclaimed once again sticking his head of the door suspiciously and slamming it shut i mean mum already thinks you re my he paused to blush girlfriend so why dontwe just play along percy was looking at me with such imploring eyes that i already felt guilty fine i said but i hope you know that the door jerked open to reveal a confusingly expressioned mrs weasley she was smiling warmly at percy as if to say how lovely that you ve finally gotten yourself a girl and looking at me as if those words were followed by it just too bad you had to pick this one instead of saying either of these things she called behind her i ve found them she dragged us out of the closet and then turned around completely glowing as if it were simply the sweetest thing in the world percy and his new girlfriend were in the closet you know how lovebirds are she said to her husband a wholesome looking gentleman with an unfortunate burgundy sweater he looked a wee bit apologetic while percy stood mortified molly was beaming i felt captured and harry potter looked appalled 4 50 a m so now i lying in bed next to percy waiting for the rest of the house to awaken mrs weasley assumed considering the state of our relationship that we d be sharing a room so i suppose for the next few days i will be sleeping as clothed as possible next to one of my coworkers what the hell is wrong with my life dear god too much must have immediate bubble bath and wash all of my problems away 7 00 a m ah the horror was in the bathtub being bubbly singing to myself shaving my legs when who should walk in but harry potter awake with no excuse at five a m who didntimmediately shut the door and run away to forget the incident but rather stood there as i aimlessly continued shaving waiting for me to make him get out and when i noticed he was there i sat there paralyzed looking at him looking at me and then i told him to get out fleur get out no fleur wait please get out i ve been trying to talk to you and you keep ignoring me get out of the bathroom i mean really he was being ridiculous standing there looking at me all sexily and making it sound like i was the villainous one by robbing him of his chance to re seduce me he was being totally ridiculous instead he walked in and sat on the edge of the bathtub fleur what i ve been trying to tell you you know those pity chocolates you sent me were pretty good almost as good as oh i dontknow actually talking to me i mean whatever actual conversation is completely over rated i agree fleur you arenthearing a word i saying harry insisted the longer he stayed there the more distracted i became and it was getting harder and harder to ignore harry asp trained hotness plus i very protective of my right to shave my legs in peace quiet and privacy i decided to throw the soap dish at him but he whipped out his wand and deflected it i was secretly relieved i d already been a tabloid whore i wasntready to be the girl who wrecked harry potter gorgeous face fine he said but will you at least tell me one thing please i made no response will you at least tell me why you re dating percy dating percy what oh right because he wouldntblow me off for some other girl at the party i threw for him it sort of flew out of my mouth sounding a lot bitchier than i d thought it would harry had this super hurt look on his face all pale and shocked and with no further comment he dashed out of the room as if he were going to be sick and i felt the sort of horrible bubble baths simply cannot fix so i just ducked my head under the water and pretended i wasntthere 7 45 a m oh godddd went back to the room to find percy there trying to decide whether or not he should wear a tie around his parents it seems like to percy this visit is like a job interview because he wearing his favorite tie and the stuffiest suit he owns which i must admit puts him in a category of dress far above his work station and sixty years older than his age and he was all hello sweetheart ew dontcall me that i said wondering where i was going to change now that percy was living in my room and the bathroom was clearly a haven for disturbances and discomfort but cupcake we ve been seeing each other for a while now i dontsee why i cantcall you sweetheart in front of my parents percy said as if he were trying to make himself into a megaphone through sheer willpower do you think they heard me he asked in a whisper yes i think everyone heard you i said fantastic percy exclaimed now er fleur are you going to go down for breakfast soon he asked i dontwant to go down too early and then be standing there when everyone rushes downstairs or worse be dreadfully late for breakfast i suppose i could go down now but fred and george are probably waiting in the corridors to ambush me oh that reminds me if fred and george offer me anything i should run in the other direction i know the last i d seen of fred and george weasley they were knocking back firewhiskey and making devious plans but so was i in actuality i think we might be kindred spirits all of us get into inordinate amounts of trouble on a daily basis shall i escort you down escort me well yes dontboyfriends generally escort girlfriends down for breakfast these days i shrugged and took his arm i suppose the entire idea behind fake dating percy weasley is just to humor him because nothing else seems to work 9 00 a m breakfast was a delicious treat it turns out molly weasley simply had a twitch in her eye last night and she doesnt hate me actually she adores me and would adopt me if i werent dating her son bill thinks i soooo smart and eating breakfast with harry was soooo not awkward it was fan frigging tastic nooooooooot told you i d bring not back i arrived downstairs awkwardly attached to percy arm to find harry there sipping his tea in a way that sharply called to mind the day i accepted his offer of tea after he saved me from draco lewd advances while harry sipped tea and refused to look at me molly weasley wouldnttake her hawk like eyes off of the pair of us and harry darting this way and that like a suspicious cat finally percy made the effort to say a good morning that came out as more of a gmhh murfnunng which i had to translate mrs weasley response was naturally well look who arrived for breakfast percy i ve already told you you look too thin fleur i sure you ve already eaten no actually i said usually houses have curtains and dark corridors in which to hide but it seemed all of my exits were blocked i haven t mrs weasley mustered an oh and set another place at the table as if i were some sort of surprise guest hermione put her newspaper down to coldly stare at me for the most fleeting of seconds before deciding that i was certainly not worth her time putting up the newspaper screen again the first truly civilized words were out of arthur weasley mouth percy told me last night that you work in the misuse of muggle artifacts office why that fascinating i dontknow why i haventseen you there and and what better he said turning around to look at the entire breakfast table as if he were waiting for their extremely pleased expressions ones that didntexist she lived with muggles hermione immediately turned to harry so i was talking to my parents the other day she began completely randomly and they were discussing telephones i d almost forgotten about all that now isntthat strange oh telephones i bet you had a telephone didntyou i mean when you lived with the muggles much to hermione disappointment arthur was directing this query in my direction as i timidly buttered my toast in the chair next to percy who was absent mindedly straightening his carefully picked tie oh one of those cell phones right um yes i said not wanting to draw any attention to myself rather in the way that targets dontpaint themselves red i mean i guess sort of fascinating you know lately in the office the main concern has been with enchanting those new small radio type things the ibean arthur said nodding his head with confident authority arthur let not bother percy friend with ministry talk molly said why fleur said percy far too jauntily to be natural didntyou bring your little pink ibean along with you the look on mr weasley face was that of a child in a toy store on christmas day i nodded looking around for absent approval i could i could show how it works you know if you want there definitely one clear way to win over this weasley arthur leapt up like jane fonda in an eighties work out video arthur mrs weasley barked arthur she said more softly this time dontforget about eating breakfast she turned to me now fleur would you kindly pass that knife subtle meanwhile harry was staring at me intently mouthing something that i couldntmake out i sunk down in my chair thinking that maybe butter was the answer to my problems stuffing a piece of toast into my mouth bill weasley took the opportunity to introduce himself um hello fleur he said giving a tiny wave that i tentatively reciprocated my name bill i a crisp maker oh well that lovely i said loving food being my main occupation and being desperate to please anyone what it like to make crisps the entire table stared me all wrinkle nosed and eye rolling ly disdainfully faced well i ve never made crisps actually bill said in my experiences unlocking the secrets to various spells none of them have ever really involved crisps merde he said curse breaker now didnthe i am buying myself a hearing aid as soon as possible right right i said smiling nervously stuffing more bread into my mouth to prevent myself from saying anything else stupid meanwhile harry and hermione were having a simply jolly conversation at the other end of the table while she tried not very hard to unglue her hand from his arm if i were a fruit i think i d be a strawberry she was saying for absolutely no reason whatsoever what fruit would you be harry oh harry my hand is stuck your arm and our knees seemed to be glued together whatever shall we do um oh i dontknow a watermelon it was sort of exactly like when i made jacques take that what flavor of lip gloss are you quiz in witch weekly and he read through it eyes wide protesting that he preferred neither stilettos nor flats hermione was in full scale laugh track now oh giggle giggle harry you re far too handsome to be a watermelon she said falling all over harry but looking at me with eyes that greek myth tells you not to look into no what about fleur harry called out desperately so intimately perhaps that i may or may not have upset my plate and spilled it all over myself as mrs weasley looked on judiciously fleur he said calmly now what sort of fruit do you think you are i thought about it i dontknow why on earth i thought about it but i did watermelon was already tainted with weakness apples were too generic i looked in despair at the bowl of fruit before me an orange i said round and bitter hermione said instantly dontyou agree charlie that oranges are round and bitter and in this she wasnteven talking to me she was simply making an offhand assessment about the nature of citrus fruit and no that wasnta shot at me at all no i wouldntsay bitter charlie said assessing the statement i hadntbeen formally introduced to him but i d read somewhere or perhaps percy had told me that he worked with dragons in romania and handled the dragons involved in that miserable first task of the triwizard tournament not bitter acrid he cocked his head as if the true adjective to describe oranges was an elusive mystery of life that needed to be solved by the sleuths of the weasley family right now i dontknow what do you say bill no not acrid he shifted in his seat and briefly stroked his chin bill would definitely be on my hot list if he didntthink i was an idiot and if i didntrefer to his occupation as a crisp maker it rather too bad because he has amazing taste in dragon hide boots i would say more sour no not sour tart said mrs weasley you know percy offered i ve always thought of you as more of a mango hermione looked at him with a crumpled eyebrow that said he d missed the point completely while i was thankful that percy was either too kind or too oblivious to compete in this bash fest on me i mean oranges like that perfume of yours harry started to say before he thought not to mention it and i looked up to see him say it and it was a horrible moment which caused more eye darting from molly weasley who i sure is an avid reader of witch weekly and the snitch report and hates mango scented perfumes harry cleared his throat and took the toast stuffing approach to life which i am a definite advocate for oh harry i dontknow if we ve introduced i mean i sure you know each other from triwizard world saving fleur delacour arthur chattered excitedly shuffling around the breakfast table pouring out cups of tea in a fatherly host sort of way um yes we ve you ve met haventyou mrs weasley smiled you must have known each other before working together to defeat lord voldemort and everything i read all about it in the prophet interview you gave not much detail but still i gather you two do know each other well dontyou oh do you percy exclaimed happily i beginning to think that whenever he doesntknow what to do with his emotions around his family he decides on becoming excitedly delighted about everything even if it something as mundane as fruit and newspapers that lovely why didntyou tell me about that hermione snorted before switching gears harry do you remember that time first year when we descended into that trap door and saved the sorcerer stone she said in a horrid fawning tone how did you and harry meet fleur oh oh did you erm make a telephone call inquired a fascinated mr weasley coming around to me to pour me a cup of tea what an adorable character actually no i mean we met i suppose at the triwizard tournament but that was ages ago and i didntsee him again until i came to hogwarts to be a teaching assistant eventually i was promoted to being the potions mistress so i suppose that how we met i said looking alternately at my feet hands and the enrapturing pattern of the tablecloth well yes and asp harry mentions before his eyes start to take over his entire head and he frantically begins stuffing bread into his mouth for fear he d run out i withdrew my wand and sent him three more slices of toast asp molly asked curiously asp percy squealed in ecstasy yes harry asp hermione asked then her eyes turned red and she promptly devoured the entire weasley family with her razor sharp teeth i didntsay anything harry said starting on his fourth piece of toast fleur did i say anything you know what i didnthear anything actually i nodded and then when the table started to peer inquisitively at me i started frantically drinking the entire contents of my teacup oh harry is that what all those late night meetings were about ron piped up oh god being his roommate of course he knew i heard a dull thud underneath the table as the youngest mister weasley convulsed in pain what late night meetings hermione demanded i didntsay anything ron said weakly pass the toast harry and i didnthear anything chimed harry who was beginning to look a little sick like mine his stomach was going to revolt if he didntleave the room soon lucky ron was only just starting on his mouth stuffing endeavor harry obligingly passed ron the toast tray wasntthat on your job application fleur lovey cupcake something about alternative self protection training were you training harry for something my boyfriend asked nts give percy a thorough talk about the use of pet names like cupcake and lovey percy i shrieked turning to him he gave me a little what did i do expression and i decided to make my exit rising from the breakfast table breakfast was divine i said to mrs weasley but if you ll excuse me i have to harry was mouthing something at me again and intensely confusing me in the midst of my getaway speech harry harry hermione asked by now she should be used to random girls randomly saying harry name hairy my legs are hairy i have to go shave i shouted manically waving my hands in the air possibly in a subconscious attempt to smack myself into sensibility harry laughed fleur you just finished shaving your legs in the i mean go ahead exactly i said frantically sprinting from the room never eating breakfast again will be wonderful no chocolate and no breakfast i ll sit in my room sipping weak tea while percy calls everything magnificent and refers to me as lovey for the rest of our stay here 12 noon perhaps is safe to sneak back downstairs steal something from the pantry and then retreat back into my percy room and then i can stay there until around six when i will sneak down to grab a very small portable dinner new diet am only eating what i can carry from the pantry in a span of five minutes brilliant 1 00 p m definitely rating my idea to go back downstairs as a negative two which by the way is the size i will be by the end of this visit as i could not get lunch i was sneaking down the stairs peeking through the banister occasionally falling to the floor to listen for the sounds of footsteps then crawling back up to find the most secure method of getting into the pantry the weasleys harry and hermione were already having lunch hermione was being perfectly lovely in every way she spoke and laughter rippled around her like she was the fountain of wit and i wondered if i d ever been the fountain of wit at any function weasley or otherwise i was about to make my daring foray into the unknown when mrs weasley voice rang out like a beacon or vicious ostrich call so percy how long have you and fleur been dating damn what i should have done was to send percy downstairs to get food for me now that would have been brilliant oh about a month i should say percy said i could tell from the sound of his voice that he was wondering why toast wasntserved at lunch why oh percy dontyou find she a bit of a scarlet woman said mrs weasley giving out a frustrated sigh dontyou think that phrase has been out of use for about seven hundred years i mean just look at what the papers say about her the things she done honestly percy mrs weasley harry said the papers have been wrong about a lot of things in the last few years this statement called to mind when harry was a fame hungry lunatic and when voldemort simply wasnta problem anymore it also and very effectively silenced mrs molly weasley up until the point that it didn t what exactly did it say in the papers percy asked and i urgently wanted to throw my shoe at him oh percy mrs weasley began the way she seemed to begin everything directed towards percy well of course she didnttell you what is there to tell percy asked all innocently i was feeling this urge to dive across the table and clamp mrs weasley mouth shut it appeared that percy thought bubble about me was about to be popped mum she s i could tell she was looking at harry and that harry was doing his best to stare absently at the wall well she been involved in a number of embarrassing incidents which have disgraced everyone involved undermining various relationships which mean so much to this family here i could tell she was looking at harry and hermione sitting together very photogenic very couple of the year it fine if you speak with her at work dear but i certainly do not approve of you dating her and more importantly she does not belong in this house mother percy shouted in a shocked response the way he would react if we were really going out well it doesntmatter if you approve our going out or not because we are he said resolutely and i could tell he was mustering all of his courage to even speak the wrath of mothers is naturally one of the most frightening phenomena on earth she nice mum she a really nice girl after what she nearly did to harry and hermione i surprised you can forgive her mrs weasley said stuffily with a little sniff i wish i could hear napkins being thrown down on the table at the injustice of the world because i would love to confirm that mrs weasley had done just that what what did she do to harry and hermione mother percy asked once again my hand was reflexively reaching for my shoe and i was preparing to skid over the plates and silverware before mrs weasley said anything i heard harry voice mrs weasley you re not being fair harry donttry to take the blame for her there nothing to blame her for he shouted i admit i quaked a little behind the banister that was either the shouting or harry defending my honor and i not quite sure if i was quaking from fear or from wanting to jump mister potter there and then how very halcius pottotius of him i beg to differ hermione smart little voice sounded hermione we differ about a lot of things lately harry said there was some shuffling of silverware and then footsteps oh really and how long exactly had they been differing on things because that aspect of their relationship certainly hadntappeared in the tabloids as often as my harry s underwear shots had it was fred voice or george s now mum harry right you haventeven given her a chance i poked my head beyond the banister out of curiosity it was george why are you defending her hermione snapped because she sounds like fun george replied because she hot fred added i was just laughing to myself when i heard a little gasp fleur harry was standing at the foot of the staircase as i crouched uncomfortably i turned and in my infinite poise and grace started to tumble down the steps i am starting to wish that harry hadntcaught me because god there are things one just cantafford umm harry i was definitely going to say more than umm harry but then i realized i didntknow what so say i enjoyed the show he started to put me down but i latched my arms around his neck in a brief hermione esque gesture then i realized what i was doing mumbled thank you and rushed up the stairs 2 00 p m merde merde merde merde he knocking on my door he knocking on my door should i answer or should i just merde 3 45 p m i let him in oh god he was just banging on my door and i was sitting on the bed watching the door and wondering why he didntjust alohomora it open and finally i got up and opened the door stopping harry mid knock can i come in he asked hesitantly harry you re already halfway in the room i said he looked at his feet yes you can come in i said the manners of the british are infuriating absolutely so i so sorry he began sitting on the bed and then jumping up as if it were on fire you shouldnthave i never meant for you to hear all of that you never should have and mrs weasley never should have said all those things about you i m i so harry it okay i said fleur it not okay harry said he looked so absolutely ashamed of himself and the situation that i wanted to get up and give him a hug but throwing my arms around him seemed like a super horrid idea especially in the bedroom percy and i were sharing however uncomfortably i ve oh god i ve been trying to talk to you and i understand that you re mad at me but please i ve sent you letters every day since the party what letters lettres letras letteras buchstabes i understand if harry i never got any letters nope not one not a singular epistolary message i put them outside your door harry elaborated but i was simply envisioning my completely empty door floor and then suddenly what appeared in my mind was the fact that i hadntgotten my witch weekly in several weeks usually poussi re drops it off at the apartment door first thing and then hoots until i come to get her admittedly i rather slow to get her but still someone been tampering with my mail i said having a eureka moment i wonder who oh god harry muttered listen fleur harry was suddenly very close to me i realized as he opened his mouth to say something i started to say something about mail again but he interrupted me our noses were close to touching he had one arm around my waist i just need you to know that i not with hermione despite what you might think that what i ve been trying to tell you this whole time oh i always know just the right thing to say you re right harry said now that you re with percy that probably doesntmatter i felt my stomach rise into my throat i hated percy hated percy harry sighed and then let me go which he should for the record never ever do again and started towards the door part of me no all of me wanted to scream out that percy and i were absolutely nothing but then i d have to explain why i was pretending to be dating him and then percy naturally would never forgive me worst weekend ever day two hundred twenty eight of free independence sunday september 17th 2005 day 3 of the worst weekend ever 5 10 am 5 10 a m uggghhhhhhhhh there i was in harry arms and he was definitely leaning it wasntjust me he was definitely leaning and then percy excuse me while i turn over and look at the face that launched a thousand regrets 5 20 a m agh hating percy and am close to desperately heading for the shower in hopes harry will walk in though all sort of x rated things would probably happen if he did which i would normally be all for except for the fact that it would be in the weasleys bathtub which is gross and he d think we were conducting an affair underneath percy nose and his goddamn integrity wouldntlet him do that i think the whole world could do with a little less integrity sometimes 6 00 a m just took a bath that harry did not participate in what a waste of water 6 30 a m breakfast i am charting the progress of harry seat position in my head the first night he sat one person away from me the person getting in between us was percy naturally the second day he made a point of always being three seats away from me percy molly hermione and today he is as far away from me as he can possibly be without getting closer to me again which means today he is five people away from me today percy molly arthur bill hermione merde i ve been reduced to counting the number of chairs separating us 7 45 a m percy we need to have a conversation i said standing in the doorway in the foreboding manner that all girlfriends should when in the presence of their boyfriends conversation is key to thriving relationships percy said loudly to the wall do you think they h yes perce they definitely heard that i reviewed everything in my head what i was going to say how i was going to say it how i was definitely not going to start shouting that i needed to get stuck with harry in a dark room as soon as possible before i exploded percy we need to talk about harry oh yes he was staring at you over breakfast i was going to ask you about that he was oh god i would have definitely been looking around attentively if i d know he was looking at me instead of stupidly thinking about furniture placement yes percy said resolutely but now i need to go take a i yanked away from the door by the neck of his collar and stared at him meaningfully percy one of those predictable people it seems i constantly surprising him perhaps my look was a bit too meaningful we need to talk about harry as in we need to talk about harry i said i mean what your mother said about me in the papers you know that wasnttrue but parts of it you need to know about you need to know about me and harry i think being around percy has made me inclined to stutter and be awkward all right percy said shrugging and reaching behind him to readjust his collar but wait a minute yes i heard all of those things your mother said about me i dontcare i said which was not exactly true but true enough for the purposes of the conversation as couples should learn very quickly to lie to each other the thing is what she was talking about was that a few months ago some pictures appeared of me in the paper er wearing his underwear percy eyes are going to be rolling on the floor if he continues to make that wide eyed face at me i will have to warn him of that in the future but it wasntlike that it was only that my psycho sister stole them because she wanted to sell them at auction but then she returned them and oh it doesntmatter the point is there was nothing going on like that but now i well i sort of want there to be something going on like that percy eyes widened and then shrunk with understanding i see he said gravely as if suddenly the stock market had skidded to a halt and there sort of is i mean that hermione has a reason to hate me i mean she seen us kissing the whole wizarding world has seen us kissing well except you but the thing is harry wontpursue me if if there you oh percy said picking up the daily prophet and putting on his socks a gesture that was both ridiculously neat and weirdly comforting well i suppose we might be running into some romantic troubles in about a week or so i rushed up to him as he was pulling his sock over his left foot and knocked him over with a gigantic hug percy you are without a doubt my favorite weasley percy grinned cantsay i ve heard that before 10 00 a m because hermione granger goddamn birthday is tomorrow the entire weasley family is bustling around trying to get ready arthur is apparently doing nothing but doing nothing very excitedly percy is picking out matching suit and tie sets for tomorrow making me think gay gay gay constantly inside my head hermione is pretending not to know what going on and doing so complacently fred and george are snooping with extendable ears and harry wontlook at me the thing is he just like halcius pottotius always adhering to that goddamn code of chivalry stupid rules like dontrandomly kill people and lust after your best friend brother girlfriends as if the world wouldntbe better without those rules well i mean not the one about randomly killing people because that one is pretty necessary my point is because harry is a hero e g peter parker or clark kent he wontdo immoral things like say mary jane or lois lane might so while i would cheat my boyfriend in a heart beat to rip off his clothes and have sex now he wontlet me because i belong to someone else and now it hermione granger goddamn birthday and i the unwanted guest and no one will let touch anything 12 noon are you sure there no way i could help out i could put up streamers i offered weakly hating the feeling of being the lazy girl who dropped in mrs weasley simply stared coldly at me as one would stare at a parasite asking to live on your skin i could i could bake something somewhere in the room someone snorted well she began i going out for wrapping paper and bill and charlie are going out to buy hermione a present ron taking hermione out to lunch and arthur been called away on emergency ministry business so she looked at me and once again sniffed indifferently i suppose i could leave you and percy to make the cake i sure harry will want to go out to lunch with her i already ate harry chimed miraculously eating a piece of toast in the afternoon i beginning to think that lifeguards should begin throwing toast into the water instead of life preservers when trying to save someone toast is a million times more effective i okay with staying here to bake the cake mrs weasley looked extremely perturbed and for what seemed like entire minutes she didntblink all right she said suspiciously glaring at percy in a totally obvious way that says dontleave them alone dontleave them alone which is sound but unfortunate advice 6 30 p m he left us alone wow percy how brilliant was it to go upstairs to read a magazine for four hours um actually pretty brilliant now that i think about it at first there was some awkward standing around in which i said um around fifteen times occasionally extending it to ummmm when i was feeling particularly articulate before harry got up and wandered around to me in the enormously empty weasley living room to say so do you want to bake this cake now and i breathless from breathing said yes and followed him into the kitchen as percy skittered upstairs to do something that sounded like gmhh murfnunng ties murfnunng so in this kitchen this messy kitchen with the huge countertop and large open spaces we stood staring at a mixing bowl so are we making this cake from scratch harry said he was wearing this adorable button down that whispered rip me open please during the entire conversation mrs weasley thought hermione would appreciate it more if we baked the cake the muggle way like the grangers might harry said leaning on the countertop while i resisted the urge to repeat the sink incident oh okay i said nervously examining what i was wearing because i am an idiot i was wearing jeans that make me look like a pregnant cow and a shirt that looks like i am trying unsuccessfully to hide it so favorite word of the month i suppose i ve never really cooked before actually i mean i made dinner a few nights ago but i burned it and we ordered in chinese i murmured doing my best not to look harry in his deliciously sexy green eyes deliciously is everything in my world about food harry laughed well mrs weasley left instructions so it should be pretty simple he said and i wondered if i could work a fast enough memory spell to make him forget about it if i spontaneously leapt on him okay i said tentatively instead reaching for the sheet of paper lying on the counter since quite obviously cooking is what i was put on this earth to do it was no big deal comprehending molly weasley instructions what on earth does this say i asked harry he laughed again and took the sheet pacing around the kitchen in his adorable white button down which one day god willing will stop trying to seduce me he was saying an array of things none of which i heard and i blinked dumbly as an egg flew by my head into harry hands careful he warned at this point i really wanted to sleep with him so as i was thinking about sleeping with him he was breaking eggs and asking me to hand him items which i handed to him without knowing what said items were there were teaspoons and tablespoons and granulated sugar and cups of milk flying by my head at all times as harry followed the directions and i shifted my weight wondering if i could find some way to escape mostly mostly i was thinking about sex you know because i ve never had it and i was thinking about well exactly what would happen if i suddenly told harry what was going on with percy and what his reaction would be and if perhaps this reaction might occur on the weasley kitchen table or if there was a hotel within a six mile radius of ottery st catchpole okay let do it what i gracefully fell over put it in the oven let put the cake in the oven harry clarified i was covered in flour but i was absolutely sure it was contraband cocaine positive it was cocaine right 7 00 p m and then we took one of those horrid wait for the cake to bake breaks which are awkward and uncomfortable and wrong on so many levels and we were alone as percy was no doubt upstairs laughing at political cartoons and doing his daily financial crossword or something like that so we sat down at the empty breakfast table with no toast to build a carbohydrate wall between us and we stared meaningfully ergo awkwardly at each other i mean yes harry awkward stares are loads more attractive than say remus lupin awkward stares but they re still awkward listen harry that always happens when you start to break the awkward silence but you re just so skilled that you try to do it at the same time as the other person thereby creating a surplus of awkwardness so harry and i took some time to wallow in the awkward surplus before trying again fleur i know that this weekend has been more than odd for you and i really sorry about that but i think there s been a huge misunderstanding between us harry that just what i wanted to talk to you about i spoke up maybe percy and i would run into romantic troubles a week earlier than planned this entire business about percy and i me and percy percy and me i was trying to say something meaningful and the only words that would come out of my mouth were being garbled by foggy memories of jacques grammar lessons all right us but remember that i dontreally mean us that the exact opposite of what i mean which is that we re not an us harry leaned across the table and started kissing me and i didntknow what to do in all my surprise so i started kissing him back which was fantastical so i kept on doing it even though i was covered in flour and wearing too tight jeans and should have been watching the cake and so we were kissing at the breakfast table and then suddenly we were really kissing at the breakfast table at which point harry decided that i was far too far away and pulled me into his lap which is pretty much when we moved on to really really kissing at the breakfast table and just when i thought that really really kissing at the breakfast table was going to be the extent of our kissing suddenly we were kissing on the breakfast table which is another matter entirely fleur this article in the dp really is too funny you must read it dear percy announced while waltzing down the stairs in his silk smoking jacket which is useless as he does not smoke he stopped abruptly when he realized that i was on the breakfast table it about horizontal mergers percy said clearly trying to suppress a laugh harry must have thought percy face was turning red from anger as he leapt off of me and put his hands up in the air rather the way criminals do on reruns of cops i i fleur you have a little flour right here percy remarked patting his nose i stood in silence contemplating my nose oh fleur he laughed whipping a handkerchief handkerchief out of the breast pocket of his silk smoking jacket and dabbing my nose with it what am i going to do with you harry looked on in horror oh i dontknow buy me a monogrammed handkerchief of my own perhaps i smiled as harry looked on in horror shock and disbelief percy grinned well chicken i ll certainly have to think about that one he said kissing my forehead carry on harry stared blankly as percy walked back up the stairs he calls you chicken harry asked percy and i have a very interesting relationship to say the least i smiled in return wiping my nose self consciously in rather the way that girls with colds and crack whores do harry was having a relatively mild nervous breakdown and he didntnotice that oh my god i so sorry fleur i dontknow what came over me i dontcare what came over you but please do it again i replied frankly noticing how harry rip me please shirt had become a just one more button shirt despite the fact that harry had stopped seducing me his shirt had kept on going harry sighed with decency blowing out of both nostrils while i sure crushed cocaine flour blew out of mine i mean this is he my best friend brother and fleur you re percy girlfriend and and this is where all the best friend brother girlfriend crap starts with all that honesty and morality that screws up everything harry haventyou ever wanted to walk on the wild side i asked day two hundred thirty one of free independence wednesday september 20th 2005 a few mornings after 6 15 am 6 15 a m luckily at just that moment the weasley oven began to make an irritating beeping noise that signified that the cake celebrating the birth of my most hated enemy had finished baking after which percy descended this time in a differently patterned smoking jacket to ice the cake to perfection while i fled to our room to read the paper i dontknow why i decided on reading the paper as my urgent activity but it always seems to work for percy so i left harry contemplating a little walk on the wild side while i read about cornelius fudge walk on the wild side of gringotts wizarding bank bankruptcy anyone hermione birthday dinner was horrible there were presents all around and praises of her amazing qualities and i was vomiting silently at the other end of the table however i did get to play suggestive footsie with harry the whole time when mrs weasley glares didntcause him to jerk violently and kick my inner thigh so that more than made up for it though i will have some interesting bruises to explain now all i have to do is break up with my non boyfriend and all will be fine 12 noon lunch with percy gratuitous thanks over well behaved snort weekend meanwhile i wondering how i going to fake break up with him i think it might involve finding him in bed with his secretary his secretary name is james but that is beside or perhaps is the point 1 24 p m arthur weasley is waving frantically at me across ministry am standing paralyzed unable to move any of my limbs as i keep thinking about all the things i did on his breakfast table weakly raising arm 4 12 p m jacques jacques wontdemand things of me such as fleur so what did you do on the weasley breakfast table this weekend instead jacques walks up to me dips me kisses my flour whore nose and says how was your weekend dear it was hermione birthday i say emphatically jacques expression is at once both crestfallen and intrigued which is why i live with him because his facial expressions are exactly what i need them to be it was horrid and mrs weasley thought percy and i were together so i had to go along with it and harry been writing me effing letters and i didntknow about them and he thinks i with percy so he wonteffing shag me and hermione was a smug little witch the entire weekend and i proceeded to collapse into jacques arms where he comforted me for perhaps several hours it all right fleur he said softly i just bought chocolate why didntyou say so i exclaimed leaping out of his arms and toward the kitchen jacques always knows just how to cheer me up day two hundred thirty seven of free independence tuesday september 26th 2005 leaving out the door

still eating chocolate at 7 50 but i going to turn over a new leaf and start to be more responsible as percy had to yell at me today when i ran in late since he was in front of all those stuffy balding snots he works with but i heard one of them call him percy weasley for a change so i took the whole thing rather lightly well i working with pink cell phones today that fascinating 12 30 p m so we have yet to discuss the table incident percy said spontaneously at lunch today his spontaneity is obviously a sign that i am changing him for the better and they always say you cant change your man pish posh table incident what table incident i remarked innocently blinking demurely at my salad i dontknow why i ever get the salad because i never eat it since i hate salad and then i super hungry after work and end up eating cinnamon coffee cake at the over expensive caf au coin and then i get even fatter resisting compulsive urge to weigh myself the one that occurred on the breakfast table percy loudly reminded me as i choked on a tomato and the stuffier than pillows and greenhouses mr twycross looked over at percy disapprovingly meanwhile percy disapproving look was directed at me oh that incident well harry was looking for a napkin in your mouth percy said in a rather alarmed fashion percy i keep lots of things in my mouth dontpretend to know everything about me i smiled as i attempted to eat yet another hazardous tomato well in that case could i have a napkin percy asked what a little twit he my favorite you re making me want to break up with you i replied eight days

the german language it not even a sentence it a phrase who canthandle a phrase so i guess i making dinner tonight i asked just to see if jacques was going to start screaming oh no god no like he did

didnthave such abnormally high standards that only include ridiculously sexy movie stars harry potter and american web surfers then i d probably be obsessed with him too which would suck because i d spend 14 hours a week telepathically yelling at him to take his shirt off which i don t because i have abnormally high standards which only include ridiculously sexy movie stars harry potter and american web surfers not that gabrielle has low standards and she not dumb looking either my sister is the craziest bird i have no frickafracking clue where on earth she got the impression that

harry no duh did you think i wouldnt put his name here at number one well if you did you re dumber than the slow children at play sign i saw on the way to king cross have the london officials never read eats shoots and leaves do they not know the importance of commas do they not see how some children wouldnt like being called slow i shall write them a very long and impassioned letter about anyhoo back to the list 2 michael i sure in some cases there will be a squicky michael who disgusts one but overall it a very hot name michael michael as in michael vartan who plays michael vaughn on alias and is so hot that all his clothes are in severe danger of melting off at any time which i have no problem with whatsoever michael as in michael qui n a pas de last name yah whatever the hotness lives on 3 dean i know you think i talking about that random dean blah blah who actually exists in the realm of hogwarts but i not really i dontthink he impossibly hot or something really i can feel you not believing me and it hurts actually you sick nonbelievers i was referring to that impossible hotness that is dean from gilmore girls he knows he hot he tempts me with his hotness he knows i

how you get harry from henry but henry is such a good name you know there are names that are good names and there are names that are bad names i mean think about it this way for a name to be a hot

near you february slut for authority loveyamuch ft october coming out of the closet day two hundred forty two of free independence monday october 2 nd 2005 hideously surprised 8 44 am 8 44 a m i sit here irresponsibly at the ministry wracked by a problem which has nothing to do with the batch of fire breathing vacuum cleaners we received from berwickshire this morning this morning as i was walking into the bathroom in my usual morning haze yesterday sock plastered to my forehead in the usual i look more hung over than i am way wondering why anyone lets me drink on sundays i found not two aspirins and a martini glass filled with water but jacques jacques saying the most hideous things my ears have ever heard he was standing there very risky business in his rumpled oxford and dorky white socks but practicing saying very jerry maguire you complete me things to the mirror i dontknow how to say this he was saying nervously holding a cup of coffee over the bathroom sink but i in love with you i always have been ever since high school god i ve been in love with you practically all of my life at this point i abruptly turned around and fled since i now needed to find another bathroom to throw up in jacques is going to tell janine he loves her and i am going to die 9 20 a m he does not love her he thinks her loves her he loves to do her perhaps but he does not love her right right i so right 10 00 a m jesus he loves her why did i never notice this why did i see their relationship as just chain sex and broken presents when day by day while i was off being a whore at hogwarts and a slut in ottery st catchpole they were falling madly and deeply in love with each other why was i so inexplicably blind no wonder jacques had to escape my presence for a month he simply couldnthandle my disparaging comments and tactless gagging at the mention of his true love name i ve been such a huge bitch whose best friend wants to basically marry her other not much of a friend merde merde on toast 12 noon fleur you seem a little distracted percy remarks casually checking out the new intern brian i however was too disconcerted to even look at brian which i suspect prompted this remark are you okay i fine i said looking downwards and picking forlornly at a wilted cabbage leaf i just thinking about something you look like you ve lost your best friend percy said watching as brian dropped a large stack of papers and bent over to pick them up at just that moment a great and terrible sun abruptly dawned on me right in the middle of the ministry of magic right in front of intern brian taut little ass that after jacques tells janine he loves her i probably will 4 23 p m dontbe melodramatic jacques said crossing his arms and giving me a tutor glare that i sure sends shivers down the spines of even his most apt latin students i not being melodramatic i whined melodramatically fainting backwards into a couch i just think it would be nice if i cooked dinner tonight i mean dont best friends cook each other dinner this whole dinner thing is my incredibly subtle plan to remind jacques that we will always be best friends so far i dontthink he caught on tomorrow night operation cordon bleu i suppose so but if we both want to live past thirty then maybe i should be in charge of cooking dinner despite the fact that we are indeed best friends it really annoys me that jacques seems to think that he is julia child just because he can make macaroni and cheese once a week however if he decides he does not love janine after all i would gladly reconsider these annoyances i handed him the cookbook with a smile because i am working on my expressions and have perfected a new one that says i am the perfect best friend so when a force of pure evil tries to snatch you away from me you wontsuccumb to the wiles of the devil of course this expression also looks something like feed me i insane fine you can have it your way i said a reflex of being disparaging and obnoxious which i now see is a horrendous problem obviously i am simply driving him into the arms of satan 6 00 p m i have to go out for a little bit jacques says cryptically looking at me in an indecipherable fashion as if he is trying to figure out how much i know about this situation involving those three little words i am giving nothing away of course by wearing a poker face which expresses only interest in eating chocolate all of dinner he kept looking up from the predictably excellent feast he prepared and gazing at me in this appraising fashion and asking me questions like do you remember the day we met and other nonsense i know he simply trying to skirt around the issue at hand that he in love with janine and for inexplicable reasons he feels he canttell me but he can use my bathroom mirror to practice this blasphemy why i ask nonchalantly trying my best to sound completely uninterested in his actions and future whereabouts because in my role as a best friend i also have to spend some time playing hard to get i have decided that the only way to deal with men is to use the rubber band theory on them constantly because i have realized that my relationships come in cycles of elasticity i had to give harry time to pull away before he came snapping back on top of me at the breakfast table which i am not talking about because my behavior was indecent and morally upsetting though delightful sigh concentrate i will clearly have to use the same logic on jacques giving him time to pull away maybe his love for janine is a manifestation of his need to pull away from me before he comes back and hopefully recovers from this madness day two hundred forty five of free independence thursday october 5 th 2005 the fourth day of madness 10 10 am 10 10 a m i woke up to find jacques cryptically flooing someone and not wanting to seem jealous or possessive or anything i waited like a secret agent outside my door eavesdropping unsuccessfully on the conversation lately all jacques seems to do is disappear and cryptically floo people and give me strange looks yesterday night at dinner he kept starting sentences and then abruptly ending them and smiling at me without any explanation all our conversations were stilted and awkward and i can just tell that he too has figured out how profoundly his loving janine is going to affect our relationship how can he love her when i donteven like her and what is love anyway what has love got to do with it if tina turner can figure it out why cantjacques see it too merde percy is glaring at me i suppose it rather obvious that i not exactly doing official ministry business it back to dismantling the latest batch of pagers seriously who even uses pagers anymore 1 45 p m today at lunch with percy and his adorable cashmere sweater he seemed more concerned than ever fleur he said in the manner of a troubled parent or a guidance counselor i worried about you you donteat you look like you haventgotten any sleep lately you barely talk to me anymore is everything okay is everything okay at home home at these words i wanted to fling my arms into my sandwich hysterically and pour my tears into my tea home where jacques is where i am losing jacques day by day to this all consuming passionate love he harbors for dear god it the most horrid thing to think about two days ago i heard jacques talking to janine through the fireplace he was very much we have to talk and i have something very important to say i was very much passed out on the floor percy suddenly bringing my haggardness up in the middle of the workday was the final straw the caring words that culminated in disaster i immediately began crying into my jell o cup percy i dontknow what to do i shrieked i was unable to see percy expression but i sure it was rather the expression of someone watching a bomb explode in slow motion all over their impeccably selected outfit he threw a monogrammed handkerchief at me i walked in on jacques practicing telling his girlfriend he loves her loves her percy loves her she no longer a bfilf a fantasy a girlfriend a lover she now marriage kids picket fence potential and what wrong with that percy asked obliviously what a bfilf forget it i sniffled ruining his hanky all i know is she was my best friend for years and then she started getting all mushy around jacques and making things all weird and then she stopped being friends with me for some stupid petty reason and now we re on non speaks but she and jacques arenton non speaks and soon she ll be coming over for dinner all the time and they ll be effing frenching over the fantastic roast duck he cooks on fridays and having sex on the couch all the time and forgetting i there i think you re overreacting percy said calmly overreacting i screeched percy love supersedes friendship and i saw him percy i saw him when he was practicing what he was going to say and he in love and sometimes when we re talking he gets this far away look in his eyes and i can tell he thinking about her and everything suddenly coalesced to a colossal breakdown a shoulder shaking head in hands breakdown percy swung his chair over to my side of the table and slung his arm around my quaking shoulders you dontneed to worry about a thing he said softly even if jacques is in love with janine that doesntmean that your relationship has to change besides arentyou happy for him my answer was a resounding nooo complete with sobs what wrong with me pw i asked hoping that if i was weeping uncontrollably he would let me get away with calling him pw why canti handle this why canti handle the fact that i no longer the only significant other in jacques life percy only reply was a thoughtful hmm and a kiss on the cheek i could tell he was thinking something he didnthave the words to express it ll be okay sweetheart he said i had immense trouble believing him and instantly made plans to go swimming in a chocolate pool 4 20 p m dying gasping for air looking at old pictures of jacques and me grammar oh my god what will i do without his grammar lessons weeping softly clutching tissues and a soft pillow have been eating ice cream all day under the pretense of a sore throat not that jacques noticed he out as usual saying i have a few things to attend to what buying the ring oh god vomit no waste of ice cream do you think jacques would forsake all others and pay attention only to me if i had a near overdose on haagen dazs 6 00 p m and my misery fest has moved to the floor with beauxbatons yearbooks we re right next to each other delacour and demontmorency look how cute we are well i look sort of fat and obnoxious especially in that asphyxiating necktie they insisted upon us wearing but jacques looks he home merde 7 30 p m it went like this i was sprawled on the couch lying on top of a pile of yearbooks and martini glasses filled with chocolate chip cookie dough smiling like a teenage boy who had just gotten into his parents stash of cuban cigars and was trying to grin the guilt away jacques looked at me suspiciously and asked what have you been doing all day i replied quickly with nothing and picked up a copy of the daily prophet which i was lucky enough to find under the couch i told him i had to get caught up on current events and he darted into his own room to i dontknow think about janine day two hundred forty seven of free independence saturday october 7 th 2005 the sixth day of madness 9 02 am 9 02 a m as i was walking through the living room i happened to intercept a suspicious floo from janine i was simply tidying up my surroundings because i do that now and poof her obnoxious pretty face popped up in the fireplace jacques at which point she realized that it was not her gorgeous lover jacques it was me the person she hates for completely irrational reasons and who wholeheartedly hates her back oh she said not trying in the least to conceal her disappointment it you there was a short and uncomfortable silence do you know where jacques is no i said curtly with an acidic smile admittedly i have nothing to smile about since i dontknow where jacques goes anymore but as long as janine doesntknow either it cool with me actually i dont know where jacques is but i can take a message oh no that okay she said and afterwards she paused to give me a suspicious look even though i was the one with the right to be suspicious could you just tell him i floo d i nodded compliantly of course there is no way in hell i am telling him she floo d 12 noon an owl clearly sent from the upper echelons of heaven to save me from my doubt filled misery perhaps from jacques revealing whereabouts and at last confessing to me his intentions with janine or perchance lack thereof no alas is from harry alas what the hell is wrong with me dear god opening letter and attempting to talk a little sanity into myself fleur maybe you could come over for tea and dessert and we could discuss what happened between us at the weasley s love harry which is funny because pretty much every saturday since what happened between us at the weasley s i have been over at harry discussing it discussing what happened at the burrow generally includes sipping tea making eyes at each other trying to talk about nonsexual things like the newspaper and the weather and harry prying into my relationship with percy it a particularly torturous event that only a total masochist would arrange mainly we drink our earl grey me slowly harry sensually and try with all our might to mentally bulldoze the table between us last weekend our weekly discussion consisted of talking about a particularly fascinating daily prophet article looking out the window at the clouds and thinly veiled questions from harry such as how percy and soooo how are you and percy doing occasionally during these discussions we do extremely taboo things like stand closer than a foot apart shake hands and oh sweet jesus last week i dropped a fork and we both reached for it at the same time and our bare fingers touched i nearly fainted effing shag me 4 00 p m back from harry s started off in the usual manner with harry opening the door bashfully today he was wearing a demure blue oxford that politely asked to be ripped off instead of passive aggressively demanding it hello he said very hugh grant in notting hill nervous um so last week we never really got around to actually discussing what harry we never really do i laughed walking through the open door by deviating from the script i had clearly flustered him and he forgot his next lines while he fumbled for something intelligent to say i contemplated shagging him on his kitchen counter um the weather the sky the harry paused thoughtfully before coming up with an inspired ad lib how work at the ministry going everything going great i said as harry poured out a cup of tea how harry can even stand to look at himself in the mirror every morning is beyond me how on earth does he manage not to pass out at his own attractiveness why wonthe shag me why is jacques in love with janine why she not even that pretty she not that nice fleur are you okay harry asked with tea in hand stepping towards me in concern before checking himself and taking two steps backwards for fear that he might accidentally touch me i fine i replied sitting down everyone keeps asking me that i fine everyone except jacques that is because he doesntseem to mind that he is single handedly destroying my emotional state how dare he if he going to take this humongous step he should at least tell me and if he not going to tell me he should at least care enough to figure out if i dying perhaps i sniffed indignantly at my tea and stared angrily at the crumpets fleur you dont seem fine harry said sitting down next to me his hand grazing my knee in a way that made me want to throw myself at him actually the past week has been spent in this fashion in a mental tug of war beteen screw jacques and no seriously screw harry is it something with percy mon dieu sacrebleu non ne posez pas cette question no harry it is not something with percy this has nothing to do with percy whatsoever i stated dramatically hysterically this has to do with the fact that some people just wonttell other people how they re really feeling and instead insist on hiding their emotions through a complex network of secrets and lies i then proceeded to stare wistfully out the window on which all of our meteorological conversations were based harry took hold of my hand and forced me to look at him which caused all sorts of dizziness and vertigo at his devastating good looks fleur i know i ve been unfair to you and i suppose now is the time to make things absolutely clear if i had my way oh god if i had my way fleur we d be together right now but i can t we can t you re still with percy and we cantdo this as much as i want to i opened my mouth to correct him but before i could say anything harry was giving me the last kiss of a lifetime the sort of kiss that makes fireworks seem ordinary and instead sets off neon do me now signs in your head and just as i was saying yes harry was already pulling away to say depressing things as much as i wish i could do this all the time i can t i started to feel a little suicidal and worse than that a sign of my insanity that the instant harry stopped kissing me i started thinking about jacques 10 30 p m ugh so harry refusing to touch me and therefore refusing to repeat today discussion which i fear will be our last jacques is always writing letters flooing janine and gazing off philosophically ren e wontstop sending me different styles of wedding invitations and asking me which one i like best i cantsleep i figured that i should go to sleep early tonight because i stressed and i have too much on my plate but as it is all i can do is toss and turn and listen to how annoyingly audible my breathing is 11 45 p m i need to know that everything will be all right that if jacques decides that janine is the ren e zellweger to his tom cruise things wontchange what if he moves out and doesntwrite or speak to me anymore oh dear god i have to go make sure i dontlose him day two hundred forty eight of free independence sunday october 8 th 2005 morning sickness 2 06 am 2 06 a m just got back from jacques room he was lying there so peacefully that i almost didntwant to wake him up but then i realized that jacques well being is the not the important part of this situation i tiptoed over and poked his shoulder jacques jacques wake up he turned over and kicked at his sheets clearly not awake jacques i hissed fleur he murmured turning around again i briefly pondered the location of my megaphone and whether or not it would be worth it to retrieve it from the recesses of my closet i voted and reached the conclusion that my voice was megaphone enough jacques he jerked awake looking around in a singularly bewildered manner fleur he exclaimed as his eyes widened with good reason since this was past midnight and i was already invading his personal space jesus am i wearing pants doesntmatter scoot over so i hopped into bed with him and he was probably mentally cursing the fact that i had ruined his hospital corners or something look except for jacques looked kind of dazed and far away even though he was right next to me and he wasntexactly being a stickler for eye contact no seriously look at me yeah he said taking a deep breath since conversations with me actually any conversations that arentwith his one true love are probably incredibly painful for him to participate in requiring vast reserves of strength amassed from hours in the gym and total immunity to my insanity i looking at you and so he was however dazedly considering the fact that it was about one a m where have you been lately i asked tentatively wishing i had a cup of ice to nervously crunch on or as i would have done otherwise jacques hand to clench considering the fact that i had invaded his personal space in the wee hours of the morning i decided it would have seemed clingy and frightening to grab on to his arm for dear life he did the shifty eye thing again um around i ve been you know tutoring stuff oh my god seriously these are the kinds of things you tell your parents when you ve been doing lines off of your significant other chest at three o clock in the morning and they ask you how your weekend was sure i asked hoping that by intensely staring at jacques i would somehow compel the truth to burst spontaneously out of him unfortunately the truth was still at bay so i opted for further prompting because because it feels like you re using any excuse you can to get away from me no no you don t this was awkward i suddenly realized why was this so awkward i dontwant to be away from you fleur it not that god i want no it not that i want to be away from you well i wasntsure i wanted to hear him say it then again maybe i need to hear him say it so he can finally start being honest with me and then i can go through a couple of days months of killing myself in that same blasphemous bathroom janine can cheat on him with an accountant or something and then we can all go back to normal none of this can happen if he insists on keeping the way he feels about that lying whore a secret from me doesnthe get that i thought he might so i gave him a second chance is there something else fleur he paused it looked as if he were literally biting his tongue no no and jacques blinked rapidly and ran his hand through his really ridiculously messy hair and listened as the second chance whizzed by look third chances people you donthave to tell me what going on or anything i understand but just dontgo i need you here this was very lifetime movie of me i know and even though i knew he was keeping things from me and even though i was angry at him for being so stupid and having such terrible taste in sluts excuse me girls i closed my eyes and pretended it wasntall happening and jacques put his arms around me the way you d put your arms around a time bomb and i let him hold me until i fell asleep day two hundred forty five of free independence saturday october 8 th 2005 d j vu 8 20 am 8 20 a m he was doing it again i was walking past his room with no ulterior motives whatsoever when i heard him talking to himself i love you i love you i love you he was saying i made a few quiet gagging noises and then walked by his door again tell her no you shouldnttell her if you tell her what if she doesntlove you back what if she loves someone else that bitch why would she love someone else but if she does if she did you would have noticed by now or she would have said something dropped some sort of hint oh but what if she too scared i fled the scene furious at that janine that whoreface slutty mcsluttenheimer what does she have to be scared of 12 noon floo from ren e urgently wanted to hide by stuffing self into laundry machine but jacques is being helpful and wonderful and doing the laundry for me so i wontbe tempted by my self destructive tendencies god that stupid i running out of bad names to call janine damn it butthead anyway ren e floo d to make my life hell oh gross she said when she saw me even though i actually got dressed today okay so it was the only thing i could rescue from the laundry basket this crumpled grey pantsuit from the eighties that mum sent me in the mail once she found out i had a job sweetie whatever happened to that diet of yours all the bridesmaids dresses we bought are size two ren e i really do not have time for this i said frankly tugging at the gross grey tweed of my mum closet purge i have to um there some leftover filing no there isn t sniffed ren e lighting up a cigarette and signing a wedding invitation at the same time i not letting you off the hook that easily so you know how my wedding is next june i nodded and watched sentimentally as jacques carried up a load of fresh laundry how cute okay so aylesford is getting a wee bit suspicious after he found a black silk vest in our suite and i not quite sure our caterer alexei will be as nice now as he was in the elevator last thursday so basically our wedding has been moved to the 18th of december yippee um ren e that two months from now oh i know that why you have sister duties to attend to i going to need a bridal shower and a bachelorette party you have to not look like a cow for the next two months and you must find alexei someone else to do and soon because i getting really sick of the lack of catering going on she rolled her eyes because her life is so hard ren e i know this is hard for you to realize but i have my own life and my own problems to attend to jacques is falling in love with janine that twit of an ex best friend of mine i have no idea where i stand with harry because i faking a relationship with my coworker percy who hasntcome out to his family yet do you not understand that this is nuts my life is a wreck i dontcare what bridesmaids dress you put me in i dontcare what color your napkins are you can screw the caterer the waiter the wedding planner the wedding singer and the best man for all i care i will show up at the wedding on the 18th and give you my best wishes and a blender but i donthave time to give you 150 right now i took a deep breath and spent about three seconds being proud of my speech before i realized that ren e was staring at me in deadly intense silence fleur she began slowly in one of those frightening meryl streep esque hisses i know that this is hard for you to realize but the fact that your life is a pathetic black hole filled with failed romances and homosexual farcical romps really doesntinterest me somehow you are going to get your fat ass out of that hideous pantsuit and drag it to the gym you are going to fit into that dress and even though it lavender and will make you look like an easter egg you re going to like it you are not going to get me a blender you re going to get me a heartfelt and possibly jewel encrusted token of the enduring sisterly love we ve shared since childhood and if i feel like it i will screw the caterer the waiter the wedding planner the wedding singer and the best man because this is my wedding and i will do whatever the hell i want and i when i ask you to distract and possibly bang alexei you will say how hard got me i gulped getting that familiar feeling that my sometimes maniacal neurotic older sister would actually whip out her wand and imperius me into doing her bidding and that if i crossed her she d probably just kill me she d always wanted to be an only child um fine good now i dontknow or care what you wear to work out but i have a feeling that a fashion felony from twenty years ago isntexactly a standard uniform for a four mile run i want to see you five pounds lighter two weeks from now ten by november she had the air of a general explaining complex military strategy to a fourth grader i canthave people judging me based on my pudgy little sister if i dontfeel that you re giving this endeavor the utmost attention and concern i ll leak your little sob story to the snitch report i sure they d love to hear about you playing house with a flaming ministry worker percy was it merde ren e oh save it you bore me just go ren e sighed tossing her infuriatingly blonde hair and sampling a slice of wedding cake you keep up your end of the deal and i ll keep mum about your darling little fruitcake 4 00

harry and i seem to be doing is ridiculous painful and causing lust spikes like no other overall day death 6 00 p m fleur jacques calls the instant i walk in the door i was a little too busy to make dinner tonight do you wanna order in after a productive day of whites brights and colors no wonder jacques didnthave time to cook it dawns on me suddenly that i let jacques be my maid whenever he comes home and i just sit around feeling sorry for myself while he takes care of me all the time i swear if he doesntstop looking at me like that like he wants to just take care of me forever i will move out um sure i flop down on the couch fully aware that jacques is still making worried eyes at me as if he worried i ll stumble upon some vast secret or is waiting for me to suddenly explode with anger and do something crazy in the manner of an abusive partner or similar chinese he offers sitting down next to me oh i canthave rice or noodles or anything with carbs i on a diet cantthat diet start tomorrow he smiled tossing me menu i caught the menu and threw it on the coffee table no i have to lose fifteen pounds pronto i said resolutely thinking of percy how mortified he would be to see his personal life splashed across page four a campy story of how i was once again lying and pretending my way through england with percy as a casualty of war fleur jacques shifts facing forward looking out the window you shouldntbe on a diet he says stubbornly looking at his hands you re beautiful he mumbles i suddenly feel as if i going to cry so i quickly kiss jacques on the cheek so quickly that jacques seems to start and i go to my room and i lock the door day two hundred forty eight of free independence tuesday october 11 th 2005 causing concern 9 15 am 9 15 a m fleur percy begins looming over my desk as he so rarely does green silk tie flapping gallantly in the light breeze of the ministry drafty second floor you re crying into a bag of telephones no i not i sniffed grabbing a tissue and yanking an ancient rotary phone out of the sack not really caring how many muggles lost their hearing after using it i was calm and composed for several seconds i blew my nose and threw the wadded up tissue in the trash can wiped my eyes and blinked expectantly at percy see i fine he stared i started bawling 12 noon percy ended up sitting with me underneath my desk so that officials such as mr twycross wouldntpop over and read us the riot act over our lack of worker productivity while i ruined seven of his embroidered handkerchiefs i was gulping i was gasping i was wailing it was terrible percy i was saying the other night he was trying so hard to be nice to me and he was being so wonderful and i realized that i cant do this percy i cantlet him leave percy dabbed at my eyes and looked pensive then maybe you should tell him how you feel what i replied i should say sorry jacques but the idea of you confessing your love to your girlfriend makes me want to put a fork through my own eye could you like not love her thanks i mean i want him to be happy just not with her i looked at percy and saw that he was giving me a look one of those looks that say maybe this is where a psychiatrist should intervene or perhaps a psychic i know that sounds selfish and i am being selfish because who is going to be with me when he leaves who going to make dinner and who am i going to have witty banter with for god sake who going to entertain my childish notions with a certain amount of humor and disdain who going to gently tell me that i acting like a five year old without actually making me feel like crap what am i going to do i feel like if he left i would be kind of empty i sure he wouldntleave completely percy insisted he your best friend i dontthink he would drop out of your life entirely just because he decided he in love with this janine character maybe he would stay over less often move back in with her i gasped suddenly at the mention of this prospect and percy paused alarmed um well only if they got more serious and it not as if he ll stop thinking about you or anything like that he wont forget about you oh percy of course he ll stop thinking about me he stops thinking about me whenever he with her when he was staying with her all of august he barely even spoke to me it almost like he trying to forget me or she trying to make him forget me i just i fleur you know what i think percy said finally after a long silence i think that you might not want to admit it to yourself but he paused again as i wiped my eyes and looked up at him um actually you need a break i think from all of this stress come with me to the ministry halloween party hmm excuse me the ministry hosts halloween parties oh god they re probably like extreme versions of model un conferences and people think it especially hilarious if you can do a great impression of the secretary general no i promise it will be fun he beamed his adorable freckled face flushing with color everyone dresses up some people coordinate their costumes and we discuss various political he must have noticed my eyes beginning to glaze over and there lots of alcohol and sometimes people make out on cornelius desk yippee i sniffed could we um could we be one of those couples that coordinates their costumes i started to picture percy and i going as one of history great loves like marc antony and cleopatra or romeo and juliet or probably more fittingly liza minnelli and david gest we could go as lindsay lohan and her coke habit is it wrong that i kind of love her and want her to get her life together so that it okay for me to like her again yeah yeah said percy picking himself off the floor and leaning back on my desk we can do whatever you want i just want you to be happy i really owe you you ll think of someway to repay me i joked getting up off the floor let me just say the look on arthur weasley face when he saw my head rising up from the vicinity of percy well pressed khaki pants well that was priceless that being said i wanted to immediately commit suicide um hi mr weasley i said awkwardly oh hi he smiled amiably looking uncomfortable um i ll let you two kids get back to oh no i turned to percy as percy was turning to me and we both spontaneously collapsed into a fit of giggles day two hundred fifty one of free independence friday october 14 th 2005 playing dress up 9 15 am 9 15 a m i dontthink percy quite anticipated the ramifications of agreeing to coordinate our costumes i was doing some brainstorming as well as polling various coworkers of mine and you would be surprised what couples costumes have trotted through this ministry i was expecting the usual marie and pierre curie voltaire and emilie du chatelet napoleon and josephine or maybe victoria and albert if we re going be all english about it apparently people here really push the envelope as percy put it apparently some ministry workers dontleave much to the imagination not to sound like a slut or anything but i have a feeling that i am going to be one of those ministry workers 10 30 a m all right i ve run through the first draft of potential costumes and will pitch it to percy over lunch i thinking we could go as robin hood and maid marion percy could wear tights and prance around and have a bow and arrow boys love bows and arrows and no one would suspect that he swings in the other direction and i could wear one of those elaborate old timey costumes with humongous sleeves it would be lovely and totally campy and great or we could go as peter pan and tinkerbell okay to be quite honest i was always kind of disappointed in the way peter pan treated wendy he blatantly ignored how much wendy totally wanted him for which i dontblame tinkerbell however short that skirt was and however ambiguous her and peter relationship might have been i blame tiger lily i mean that was a stripper name if i ever heard one and what guy can resist short shredded skirts and feathers i mean what else can you expect from a boy who refuses to grow up pros to this costume i get to wear a cute little dress that appropriately sparkly and involves wings and my shoes will have curlicues on them it would be darling also i think there are very appropriate parallels between moi and percy and tinkerbell and peter i the sidekick who always getting into trouble and who doesntactually say intelligible things tink is mute and i blubber incomprehensible words of despair under random desks peter pan is a boy waging war with an obnoxious bearded old man totally mr twycross who really should have his hand swallowed by a crocodile who likes to fly off to never never land and frolic with other boys yeah i going to stop the comparison right there percy would wear okay it totally doesntmatter what percy wears i the one with the infatuated roommate here percy will wear what matches or still we could go as great loves he could go as antony and i could go as cleopatra this sounds even better than it did on tuesday i could wear lots of gold lam bangles and gaudy eye makeup percy could wear a toga or one of those delightful helmets or whatever it is that roman generals wear we could go as brad pitt and jennifer aniston and maybe if janine shows up to complete this triangle she can be a total psycho vampire skank who only pretending to be a good person oh wait i being cruel but she freaking deserves it knowing janine she ll probably show up with jacques blood in a vial around her neck after having banged him in a freaking limo on the way to the party where she ll hop into bed with percy and reveal that he not gay it just impossible for anyone to be sexually attracted to me and then i ll date john mayer anyway must confer with percy about his tights policy 12 noon lunch with percy percy main concern seems to be whether or not our costumes will be taken which if we go the peter pan route they totally wontbe percy other concerns include fleur what if people suspect my gayness i add delving into my salad which i am pretending to enjoy now that ren e is threatening to out my un boyfriend if i dontlose fifteen pounds by her freaking wedding i feel like little j and percy is my non bitch version of asher shhhhhhhh percy hisses as if the fact that he is actually putting one finger to his mouth isntalready tipping everybody off i have also got to tell him to stop talking flamboyantly with his hands dontworry about it perce i assure him pretending to love the taste of vinaigrette i dipping my fork into it and not draping it all over my disgusting ministry half green lettuce of course seriously canti lose three pounds like right now just for how good i being if things get really bad and brian the intern starts giving you the eye i ll just make out with you in a very obnoxious way that says no questioned sexuality here it ll be fine right percy nods picking a stray piece of lint off of his argyle sweater he leans forward and rests his chin on his fist the way they make you do in cutesy bambi themed portraits when you re five i should probably remind him to stop doing that too and what if the bwl sees i very proud that percy has started calling harry the bwl but incredibly alarmed at the nature of this question i stare goggle eyed at percy horrified that he would even bring up the subject of harry as if he completely forgotten my fragile emotional state i backtrack into denial and feigned flippancy why should i care if harry sees he thinks we re in a relationship anyway nothing going to happen i remember wistfully wondering if harry could look for a napkin again and we could be one of those couples who makes out on cornelius desk that interesting because as i recall you two were behaving rather intimately on my breakfast table snorted percy as i turned a shade of crimson that jacques would recognize i was mostly clothed i corrected loudly as various ministry officials who actually have the sense to have a working lunch glared at me inquisitively which was mostly true besides harry harry being really stupid right now and he wontjust undress me because he too decent of a person so even if he loses his self control long enough to say blow my mind percy i saw that look you dirty boy over a breakfast table he certainly wontlose his senses long enough to actually be with me you d be surprised what the ministry halloween party leads to every year percy says mysteriously with only the faintest air of prudish disapproval which makes me wonder exactly what percy has been doing at these annual ministry parties and whether or not my presence there will hinder any other activities that may occur on or under cornelius desk semper paratus percy says finally returning back to earth after a few moments spent in some recollection in god knows where perhaps on cloud nine be faithful that might be too much to ask especially if harry shows up looking as unintentionally sexy as i ve trained him to be no be prepared 5 00 p m i have this horrible feeling that percy right and i should be prepared for this party because whether or not harry can control himself is up in the air but i almost positive that i cantcontrol myself any longer how long have i been lusting after him it feels like it been forever and we re finally on the brink of something and i think all it would take is one push maybe i should stop waiting for someone to push me 7 45 p m jacques made me dinner which was very lovely of him but i couldntconcentrate on any of it because my head was swimming with thoughts of his beloved janine and what i going to do about harry and the last thing on my mind is steak frites my eyes just wandered around the room for what felt like hours before finally landing back on jacques who was saying something that i sure was wonderful about our friendship he was wearing that sweater that i bought him back in our sixth year and i remember thinking he was sick because it was absolutely freezing in the apartment and he was turning red or maybe that was the candlelight this horrible sense of dread just flooded through me it started at my toes and by the time jacques started talking about the three of us how great we were together me him and janine my head was so consumed with fear that i wanted to scream and god fleur that just brings me to what i wanted to say he was saying practically clutching the tablecloth trying to catch my eye as i tried to find a conveniently located window to look out of i mean look fleur there something that i really have to tell you and i dontknow if you already know and i know i was gone a long time and i know this will probably be hard for you but i have to tell you you re my best friend fleur and i actually thought i was going to throw up i couldntdo it i couldntlisten to jacques talk about how much he in love with janine and watch him drift away from me dont i said abruptly and i think i sounded scared or upset because jacques looked alarmed okay just dont i know what you have to say and i sorry but i canthear it okay i know it sounds selfish but trust me it would ruin things for you and me there was a remarkably long silence and i thought he was going to yell at me or storm off and leave but he just swallowed hard and said okay um yeah i guess i should have okay he started clearing the plates away immediately and he blew out the candles and i felt like a huge bitch but it would have ruined everything i know it would have and now he realizes that if he going to be with janine then i want no part of it he paused at the sink and looked back at me can we can we just never talk about this again that is absolutely fine with me day two hundred fifty seven of free independence thursday october 20 th 2005 being awkward 6 15 am 6 15 a m all right so jacques is not happy with me i think i realized that was going to happen however i did not realize that this meant that i could no longer speak to him because that is what seems to be happening he tiptoes around me all the time and it driving me crazy because stopping him from telling me about janine was supposed to save our friendship not ruin it 7 00 a m i m um going to work i announce quietly to an unusually silent and spotless apartment ever since friday jacques has just been cleaning every surface of the apartment like he wants to erase me or something right now he dealing with the kitchen sink and therefore does not have the capacity to multitask and speak to me okay fine i mumble heading out the door 12 noon he not speaking to me percy i explain gesturing in violent despair with my fork when he does it s i already did the laundry fleur or dinner in the fridge fleur or i charming the dust out of this rug could you not walk on it fleur i told him i didntwant to hear about his stupid girlfriend no his stupid hook up buddy and now he wonttalk to me what the hell did i do percy sighs are you sure that what he wanted to talk to you about he asks probably exhausted by this conversation one which we have been having on repeat for the past week like an overplayed song on the radio he probably unbelievably sick of me and would rather be checking out more new interns i positive percy what else would he be talking about i think you need to have a conversation with him says percy thoughtfully about where you two stand now you re going to go crazy if you don t i paused hesitantly the way five year olds do before proclaiming i dontwanna and then bursting into tears fleur if you donttalk to him i ll have to and i think we both agree that that a terrible idea talk to him so much easier said than done day two hundred sixty two of free independence tuesday october 25 th 2005 passing notes in class 12 noon 12 noon i still haventtalked to jacques i have instead been distracting myself by passing by harry apartment a lot biting my fingernails to shreds staring mournfully at old pictures of me and jacques and assuring percy that yes of course i ve talked to jacques what makes you think i ve been lounging on the couch sobbing all day my mascara is not running 4 35 affol d affaires courant name fleur delacour height 5 foot 8 weight 135 going down very slowly creeping towards a state of not obesity great so i am no longer considered the elephant in the room in my apartment that spot is occupied by friday dinner hair blonde eyes blue lust situation terrible with regards to harry lust has become must pilates minutes 2 freaking hours just to distract me from the fact that i now live in a gleaming immaculate mausoleum or library where no one can speak and i can only sneak around while jacques sullenly grades papers in his room it feels like something died in the apartment on friday and we re both tiptoeing around a coffin orlie thinking minutes 90 day dreaming can be a good cure for total irreparable life turmoil jude thinking minutes 231 hp thinking minutes all the time hg glares only once when i was lurking too conspicuously in the hall outside of harry apartment and she popped her head out of ron apartment i guess she still staying with him thank god and looked at me as if i had risen directly from hell and had just taken the elevator up to her floor overall lust to love ratio 34 to 5 overall day the appalling awkwardness of my living situation combined with the pressure from my coworker to deal with the awkwardness of my living situation compounded upon the fact that i am desperate to be on top of harry right now brings my day right up to a negative 2 10 p m i have just done something remarkably brave i have slipped a note underneath harry door shut up i know it very fourth grade but this is the best i can do i am in the fourth grade and janine has cooties and i dontwant jacques touching her however harry has had more than enough cootie shots i mean he immune to everything including deadly curses and he can do anything to me he likes um well maybe fourth graders dontthink quite like that anyway the note read get ready for this are you going to the ministry halloween party fleur i know right so brave merde i about ten years old 10 45 p m note from harry also slipped under my door which i was monitoring carefully just in case retrieving said note while jacques was sleeping in the confines of his bedroom where he was been for seemingly two weeks it reads if you ll be there oh dear could it be possible that harry wants to be on top of me as much as i want to be under him writing note back immediately or perhaps i should put this on time delay so that harry doesntthink that i actually so desperate as to have sat by the door patiently waiting for his reply will send note back in ten minutes hm well it took him forty five to send it maybe i should send it in one hour to imply that i want him 15 minutes less than he wants me well maybe not fifteen minutes less that a little cold i ll want him 7 5 minutes less than he wants me 11 37 p m wouldntmiss it for the world i ll be tinkerbell and you ll be fleur 11 50 p m anything you want me to be harry midnight i am now wanting him five minutes less than he wants me and sending over a note in eight minutes saying then you ll be going as harry james potter fleur 12 13 a m the one who desperate to see you harry 12 20 a m i definitely want him at least two minutes less than he wants me definitely that might be the one it depends how desperate exactly is this harry potter to see me fleur 12 22 a m desperately enough to be at your door right now harry day two hundred sixty eight of free independence monday october 31 st 2005 halloween thanking god a lot 6 27 am 6 27 a m thank god jacques was asleep of course i opened the door i think it fair and not at all an exaggeration to say that harry leapt on me he nearly threw me against the door it a wonder that jacques didntwake up and i think i not guilty of hyperbole if i say that i leapt on him too we couldntkeep making out in the doorway of course the doorknob was digging into my back so we made out on the dinner table we um couldntexactly tear ourselves away from each other long enough to get to the couch for about nine years periodically removing articles of clothing until i thought i heard jacques footsteps threw harry off of me and told him i d see him at the halloween party probably wearing more clothes than his particular state of undress at that moment i never thought i d say thank god it monday but 8 12 a m then again why should jacques care what i do with harry he not even involved enough in my life to care now is he as a matter of fact he not involved enough in my life to even really make eye contact with me the closest we ve come to a real conversation was this morning when i said dontworry about breakfast i did the dishes and he replied thanks honestly it like he looks at me for two and half seconds and then he realizes that the mere sight of me wants him want to kill himself so he goes back to awkwardly pushing his sleeves up and down well who cares right he got janine and i have harry ish i mostly have harry in that sometimes he comes over and we make out oh dear god am i harry hook up buddy regardless if jacques wants janine i want harry and the whole world is at a happy equilibrium actual conversations between jacques and myself would only upset the happy equilibrium that we have reached through means that are assez d sagr able but nonetheless effective okay so i just wonttalk to jacques and he wonttalk to me and as long as we keep our lips otherwise occupied we wontrun the risk of violating our tacit agreement oh my god percy would be so proud of me for saying tacit agreement 12 noon so percy was not even remotely proud of me for my use of the words tacit agreement in fact percy is not even at lunch today percy is really busy with some official stuff fleur i ve got to um take some files to another office what what other office complex network of secrets and lies i tell you secrets and lies ooh maybe percy just being secretive about the fabulous curly toed shoes he bought for our peter pan costume i knew he would be a little self conscious about that he probably had a nice pair special ordered and he dashing off to make sure that his owl has delivered them in time oh perce totally unaware that i have his costume totally covered yesterday after work in what was totally not an effort to avoid making eye contact with jacques whose looks can now be described as alarmingly pained like edward cullen smelling bella outrageous flavor in biology i went shopping i purchased this totally fabulous strapless silver dress maybe a little too short but it a halloween party also percy and i are breaking up today so i thought i should be prepared and i wearing tights so it okay and i have a pair of silver curly toed shoes to match the ones that percy ordering plus a pair of wings my wand also glows in the dark now which i thought might be helpful you know in case it gets dark which it might under cornelius desk i mean not to imply that i going to end up there or anything but harry going to be there and right now i d really like to not think about percy or ren e or jacques and that stupid whore he thinks he in love with i d really much rather be under cornelius desk with harry 5 20 p m do you want to hear something crazy suspicious so as i was dashing back to the apartment to mentally prepare myself for a night of debauchery at the ministry halloween party who should i find racing out of my apartment but a certain percy weasley um hi percy i said raising my eyebrows because i not skilled enough to raise just one in a manner that said care to tell me what going on oh hey fleur said percy in a very anxiously nonchalant way as if he d just run up a flight of stairs and was now pretending that he d just been on a casual stroll i was just dropping by to check that our costumes matched well but then jacques let me know that they do in fact match well so that that ha ha laughed percy inanely there was an awkward and distrustful pause i going to go you do that perce okay so jacques will talk to my high strung gay coworker and not me seriously 7 30 p m so i took an extra long shower extremely pissed and unwilling to speak to the shady character sitting in the kitchen poring over japanese notes eventually i started to feel bad for the environment even though those polar bears sometimes eat their young so i hopped out of the shower grabbed my towel and headed for my room on the way there though jacques freaking face stopped me he being very moody today forest green is a nice choice of sweater color because no one going to accuse you of being moody for wearing it yet he was rocking it in the most sullen of ways black coat slung over the chair behind him super dark jeans black shoes his freaking messy hair in his face mm hm very moody and so sullen especially the way lighting was falling on his chiseled features i got very upset so i was standing in the doorway to the kitchen in my towel glaring at him until he at long last looked up and said what you re making me hate you i replied succinctly really jacques breathed i say breathed and not said because he literally just exhaled this word as if he d been holding his breath since october 14th yeah i replied eloquently and it sucks because as mad as i get at you sometimes i continued dragging my left foot back and forth on the carpet i ve never come close to hating you jacques literally almost laughed like one of those i laughing because five minutes from now i going to kill myself laughs fleur i ve never come close to hating you either you have a funny way of showing it i said rushing to my room and shutting the door 8 45 p m so it taken a good hour and fifteen minutes for me to get ready but now i have an awkward fifteen minutes before percy comes to pick me up that i need to spend avoiding jacques perhaps i should spend said time coming up with a definitive game plan for tonight percy and i have already figured out the first half the break up it a very elaborate set up percy should write screenplays basically we will walk in all body language coldness he ll be very come here and i ll be very donttouch me and after ten minutes of me avoiding him he will come over super macho super aggressive hopefully percy is a good actor and be very bradley cooper i e very dickish and unnecessarily affronted what is your problem fleur he will hiss only very masculinely i donthave a problem i ll say coolly and cruelly playing to the public image of me as frosty the snow bitch is there somebody else this percy will say loudly at the most punctuated silence i will give him an evasive look down my martini and migrate elusively into harry hearing range percy naturally will follow me to ask me again desperately and indignantly is there somebody else and i ll say yes percy there is very exasperated and the ice queen exterior will melt for a second as if i am about to cry wracked with guilt i canthelp it i just this isntworking this it over percy to avoid any sort of poor percy backlash percy will have to have a very dickish reaction to this i e you re going to regret this fleur delacour your life in the ministry is over i know it a little melodramatic but i thought it would be cute and percy wants an opportunity to flourish his cape dramatically after this percy will furiously bolt out the door probably with intern brian and i will stand thoughtfully like a wounded but resolute gazelle on the african savannah waiting for a very attractive and heroic lion to pounce on her seriously it cantgo wrong besides i look pretty good tonight if i do say so myself i have never succeeded in making my hair look as romantic yet just shagged as it does tonight think penelope cruz in vicky christina barcelona very mussed very wild but in a really good way like i just tragically beautiful like this dontquestion it the eye makeup is fantastic i had to look up so many spells and i was terrified that the eyelash curler was going to take me out since it was basically doing all the work itself but i can kind of see in both eyes so all is well plus i read somewhere that harry favorite flavor is cherry which i think is a little gross but he can do whatever he wants so i being katy perry tonight very the taste of her cherry chapstick i kissed the boy who lived and i liked it absolument and i ve lost like five pounds already so this short silver sparkly roxie hart dress doesntlook too shabby on me i dontthink so hopefully i wontbe standing alone on the african savannah of the ministry of magic for too long fabulous j merge 9 00 p m and so i emerged right on time percy knocked on the door and i surged past jacques in a desperate effort not to seem at all affected by his presence i opened the door for my soon to be ex fake boyfriend and percy came into view and mon dieu our shoes matched perfectly sometimes i really love life fleur you look gorgeous percy said and i was really happy that he didntsay gorge this time because that is a red flag if i ever heard one percy inexplicably shot jacques a look and it occurred to me that perhaps his conversation with jacques extended beyond costumes and my horrendous cooking skills are you ready for this he asked turning his attention back to me i snapped my gaze away from jacques who was staring at me in what appeared to be befuddlement and regret hm ah yes the ministry halloween party mais oui cheri showtime 12 midnight when i said showtime i didntmean like the channel like a drama filled sex filled twenty four hour orgy set in 16th century england with mothers who sell pot that not what i meant at all needless to say the plan went all wrong the first hint should have been that percy forgot his wand at my apartment oh god i sorry fleur he said standing outside the door to the party adjusting his forest green peter pan hat the red plume complemented his hair perfectly which was a shame since no one was going to see it do you have to go back it doesntmatter and besides my costume will look ridiculous without you there something about standing alone at a party clad in a too short silver mini dress that doesntscream seduction but rather desperation percy patted my head in a loving fashion usually bestowed upon small dogs completely misreading my worries well with all due respect fleur i dontthink anyone here knows who peter pan and tinkerbell are um what dontbe ridiculous percy it was a very popular play like a thousand years ago i retorted and i sure some people have read the book right it very amusing from a wizarding standpoint i decided not to add the point about johnny depp in any case darling i have to go back and get my wand he said looking quite apologetic and quite dishonest actually i feel dreadfully insecure without it but please dontwander away i think there something very important you should know well tell me now i said tapping my curlicue shoes on the parquet floors of the ministry foyer somehow it seems that whenever i go to a party i end up freezing alone and wearing a dress that in hindsight seems altogether inappropriate mm no i think it will all make better sense when i return percy said cryptically i swear he was much more open before i met him but it seems all the men in my life thrive on confusing me i allowed worst boyfriend ever to disappear into the night and contemplated my entrance clearly i was in no position to make hermione granger madonna entrance the holy one not the slutty one but at least no one would be watching me walk in i could slip into the party unnoticed and then wait until percy came back so that we could break up i would simply open and close the door very quietly and mingle with the old stuffy gentlemen i knew from work until perce rescued me no one would see me my dress wasnt that short harry probably wasntthere yet fine absolutely fine but then i opened the door and stuffy old men were nowhere to be found instead the room seemed to be overflowing with wait staff carrying enormous trays overloaded with champagne flutes marie antoinettes cavorting carelessly with their louis 16s prince charleses holding hands with their revenge dress dianas and making out with their horsey camillas mischievous angels chasing after scantily clad devils and quite a few ironic hipsters sporting hp scars on their acne ridden foreheads what in the name of sweet jesus the ministry had gone decidedly mad and dead ahead of me were four people i was least excited to see 1 remus lupin dressed inexplicably as a sheep probably thinking that everyone would laugh and shriek hahaa it funny cos he a wolf haaaaa which a few drunk people did 2 severus snape who is being crazy post modern and came as himself or maybe an executioner 3 hermione effing granger dressed as maid marion because that bitch is always one upping me on the virginal thing which is unfair since she is totally not a virgin and i am so jealous and her costume makes perfect sense considering 4 harry potter dressed like sex in his robin hood costume nice hat cary elwes isntthe only man who can pull off tights so um my first instinct was to get drunk so i grabbed a bellini off of the first tray i could reach and drained it in a record seven seconds leaving the waiter judging me mercilessly to which i mentally responded with you are a waiter stop judging me i not the one wearing a silk man vest and waiting for my acting career to take off my second instinct was to hide but the coat room was blocked by undesirable people so i looked frantically around and darted straight for the bathroom pull yourself together fleur i advised myself sternly in the bathroom mirror your eye makeup is holding up beautifully your thighs have almost stopped looking like baby orcas and harry freaking potter said he wants to be with you so what if he coordinated costumes with that evil bushy haired psycho you hate she probably caught a glimpse of it when he was bringing it back to his apartment whatever so what if this bathroom mirror dialogue is reminding you sharply of your early october encounter with your now distant best friend whatever his loss so what if percy has been gone for all of five minutes and you already feel like dying get it together take a deep breath and remember the sage words of lady gaga just dance it ll be okay and so i did i emerged from the bathroom as i emerge from all things like a radiant butterfly stepping out of her chrysalis into a bright new world filled with hope and iniquity i embraced this iniquity and stepped confidently out into the room humming i ve had a little bit too much all of the people start to rush in particular draco malfoy was rushing at me i have no idea why god insists on torturing me with his consistent presence from what i could ascertain draco was either dressed as chuck bass or the joker though neither of these options made any sort of sense maybe he just wanted an opportunity to wear purple or to grab my arm pull me close and absolutely nauseate me fleur he said fervently into my ear um yes i said panicked we can never be and at that moment my heart didnt shatter into a thousand little pieces i decided it was wisest to just say nothing i with pansy now he explained wistfully snape told me you were interested but i only date women of pure wizard heritage i have to pee i said wrenching my arm away from him and trying to think of a direction to walk in that wouldntresult in horror or pain glancing at the gilt clock on the wall i prayed that percy would show up in the next five minutes how long could it possibly take to pick up a wand god you d think he was passing along urgent messages like some spy involved in some covert operation fleur wait draco exclaimed hatred really doesntcut it anymore does it despite my relationship with pansy draco began the long pause explaining everything clearly what he had with pansy was really more like a shag and run a quasi comitted hook up relationship if you will i feel very possessive of you he said slowly and intensely as if he were trying to burn a hole in my face with his eyes am i supposed to find that sexy doesnteveryone i have no idea what draco has been watching that has him convinced that what a girl really wants is a pale stalkerish slightly obsessive boyfriend but about three things i was absolutely positive 1 that draco was choosing the sketchiest method of seduction possible 2 that harry was relentless eye sexing me from across the room and 3 that i was irrevocably and uncontrollably interested in letting him do whatever he wanted to me seriously suddenly all those things that normally sound like terrible self destructive ideas seemed incredibly logical and i turned to draco and announced loudly i going to get my coat approximately 2 5 minutes later wish i could shut my playboy mouth how d i turn my shirt inside out i ll tell you how i got stuck in a coat closet with harry james potter that how if we re going to be blatantly dishonest i have never put much thought into how i would lose my virginity but harry potter seemed like a good way to go and that total honesty so i was pretending to get my nonexistent coat when harry potter suddenly appeared between me and the coat closet door fleur yes harry tell me that i can just kiss you tell me that you and percy are broken up too drunk to lie oh harry we were never really together and just like that harry had pulled me into the coat closet where we were doing anything but putting on our coats in approximately half a second harry green robin hood hat was on the floor my curlicue shoes had been tossed carelessly aside harry doublet wait seriously doublet had been ripped to shreds in the manner of a poorly written victorian romance novel and we were both on our way to extremely fun bad decisions abruptly we both looked up taking a break from ruining each other clothing and taking a simultaneous deep breath fleur i dontwant you to regret this he said looking adorably flushed and almost shy as if he had just realized that we were stripping as fast as we could in a coat closet i won t i breathed granted i was not entirely sure of this at the time but harry was looking at me as if he was seeing something glorious that he was perhaps afraid of defiling and i was perfectly primed to be defiled i had lingered too long in the land of the pristine too long in a homeland of doubt uncertainty deception and denial for once i was determined to live my life experience something feel something because i was so incredibly tired of living in an apartment so ridden with feeling that it was devoid of it is it terrible to want to express something in reality not suppressed not in jest something really really felt i sure and harry kissed me and there were no strings holding us apart no hermione no michael no percy no press just the pressure of harry lips on mine and i felt wonderfully free to kiss him back the kiss i d wanted to give him since ever since i dontknow asp or his lucky shamrocks or our unlucky towel escapades or since he was sitting on my bed that morning in july asking me to casually save the world with him or actually more accurately since everything he said to mrs weasley and to me at the burrow and this is simple this is simple in the way that harry is this whole time it been just his blushing adorable desires and his infuriating admirable integrity and just those two things which occasionally come between us but now they both are satisfied and this is uncomplicated and maybe the situation hasntbeen but he has the same way that though darcy and elizabeth spun out a complex tale their motivations were simple and now there are no stupid secrets kept no words swallowed no hesitations and have i lived my whole life in hesitation because it feels as if those moments when i am moving have been with harry those moments when i am acting have been with harry and maybe thinking is overrated and that is what i am thinking when harry is taking off my dress and we are somewhere between a grey wool pea coat and some over expensive mink peta would die over and soon eyes shut hands clenched moments later the worst is over and harry wants to know if i am okay and i think i am and he kisses me and i could swear i am really feeling something and harry says i think i in love with you fleur after and now i sure that have felt something for once in the past month and before i can reply like a knife slicing through the night greatest silence excuse me i have to get my coat says some stranger in a borrowed peter pan costume because i was still putting on my stockings and harry was still buttoning his shirt when we bumped into jacques coming out of the closet a n wow that was long the chapter and the wait my dearest sincerest apologies obviously

adulterer and a prostitute is that it is it about the book i never returned to the library is that it i swear i would have returned it but i couldntfind it and then i found out how much i d owe in library fees and it not like i had 112 galleons and 62 sickles just lying around waiting to be spent and if i did i would spend it on shoes or um donating to charity or adopting puppies too but certainly not on boring research book on ogres snooze why do you hate me is it because i cheated just that little bit on lent one year because a sprinkle is not an entire cupcake it not a sweet i was

the great hall she just randomly showed up i wasnteven paying attention i was too busy looking at the nutrition facts on the back of my nutri grain bar and figuring out if it counted as protein to notice the telltale signs flowers wilted little children screamed and somewhere out there an entire family of cutesy little bunnies suddenly died that and thousands of male tongues spontaneously fell out of their mouths and rolled out onto the floor ren e may be a vicious tarte but she an unbearably attractive vicious tarte i finally registered that she was here when the final sign came bonjour ma petite soeur i turned around and promptly spewed my just brewed magical diet shake all over her causing her to shrink back in a brief moment of disgust and absolutely everyone to turn around and suppress giggles what are you doing here is that anyway to greet your big sister she said in that warm sweet completely unnatural voice which made her sound like she was in a stage production fleur me bestest buddies why are you here said i still completely dumbfounded by her overwhelmingly skasty presence i thought you were going to stay in france bother my parents and destroy all of my possessions why are you here to see you of course she smiled that nasty evil let the battle begin because we both know i ll win smile she looked like a lion eyeing an antelope on animal planet i about to get eaten alive 10 32 a m the prostitute that claims to be related to me has taken this entire effing school by storm they re all so obsessed with her blah blah blah fleur sister blah blah blah so hot blah blah blah so pretty blah blah blah so effing thin it some kind of mortal sin to wish death upon your sister isntit 11 14 a m on the way to dada for another awkward encounter with professor lupin unfortunately ma soeur sans valeur simply wontgive up trying to make nice and is following me trying to ask me how i feeling and how umm healthy i look wow she been here four hours and she already used code to call me fat i trying to ignore her but she wontstop 12 noon i have a new favorite class this is not possible you say nothing could surpass flitwick and his supreme oldness you say you are wrong because one thing and one thing alone can surpass nice old people let me say this slowly because i screwed up the effect of my evil sibling has followed me across the globe it michael the new and improved dada teacher that we have been waiting for has arrived and it michael michael my american cyber boyfriend and you think that all he even hotter in person you may now have your own little american spaz out aaaaaaaaaaaaaaah i ve got a boyfriend and he a hottie his name is michael and you canthave any muah ha ha ha ha muah ha ha ha ha 1 04 p m now that i have recovered from that fit of evil yet hysterical laughter and the delighted convulsions that followed i am able to think clearly with the aid of a whole bunch of butterbeer what am i not allowed to celebrate too it rather obvious that ren e thinks michael is just as attrayant as i do she gave him the eye and in a very snape like voice said hello professor she breaking records all over the place i never expected her to break out the desire me voice so soon in her visit of course i had been too busy writing i trying to ignore her to pay any attention as i walked into the room i have that horrible habit not paying attention and then suddenly i looked up from my book and voila c est mon amoureux michael this is just the typical thing that i do in movies people say such things to clarify that they know each other i however do it because i never quite sure whether there really is a cyber boyfriend that i had named michael or if i made him up then as clich s go michael looks up from his book fleur of course what naturally follows is my sister swiveling her head all the way around and going you know each other i smiled that acid smile she always giving me of course ren e this is the american cyber boyfriend that absolutely everyone knows about i swear to g her eyes went red d you think cyborgs can exist in the wizarding world without malfunctioning and spitting our sparks and such you re french exclaimed my hot american no longer cyber but actual boyfriend it so great to finally meet you warm embrace follows which allows me to have huge moment of total reveling over his shoulder which most consisted of wow i can so feel his abs underneath his shirt and they are rock hard and no i donthave a one track mind so this is danceswithhouseelves67 asked ren e in her own sneak tastic way arms crossed tapping her chanel vamp nails on her arm clearly plotting things i suddenly broke away from ab tastic embrace i knew you d been reading my emails you sneak tastic ho ren e jaw lowered to her prada shoes and michael laughed god he so great when he laughs it like better than a nutri grain bar it like better than dare i say diet coke of course ren e silence didntlast incredibly long why you self satisfied americanized little french curse word deleted for obscenity even though i use it all the time i was incredibly offended and nobody else in the room had any idea what she d just said at this point i d completely forgotten that there was a dada class waiting to be taught watching my sister and i curse at each other i gasped you whore slut she replied tramp vamp harlot fish out of water bat out of hell liberal conservative you grotsky little biotch gasp you plastic by this time professor lupin who was supposed to be setting things up for michael that professor turner i know it fabulous right was staring in our direction in absolute horror as was the rest of the class well actually it was only lupin who was horrified michael was surprised yet vaguely amused the girls were simply shocked and the 7th year boys were waiting for us to take our tops off and engage in full out girl on girl warfare boys are such sluts 2 00 p m have just finished apologizing to prof lupin and prof turner for completely unprofessional and inappropriate conduct today in the classroom for while the class was sufficiently entertained they learned nothing except for several french curse words and all the fun signals i can make with my fingers professor lupin said that i shouldntbe apologizing to him but that i should be apologizing to professor turner because after all it was his class i disrupted so i apologized to professor turner and probably only because i got to say professor turner a lot professor turner i just wanted you to know how sorry i am about what happened this morning i also want you to know professor turner that it will never happen again as soon as i get that restraining order filed and professor turner i would also like to thank you for continuing to allow me the opportunity to sit in on your class and to become your assistant if you please professor turner mon dieu you say it professor turner oh you know you love it 5 45 p m i must write letters now to my dear dear jacques and gabrielle expressing my pure delight inspired by spite nts will laugh wickedly later dear jacques the most wonderful thing you could possibly imagine has just occurred well it

so much better than they are and michael not giving little patil or any of the others the slightest extra glance he looking at me my heart has melted and is oozing into my shoes so naturally michael flashes the secret smile as if to say surely you remember yesterday adventures in snogging a wondrous private moment between the two of us as if we are the two upper echelon members of a super secret snogging society naturally i smile back with the sinfully happy smile of the initiated assured he continues if one were caught unaware secret smiles and had no time to prepare for an attack this would be a particularly useful spell dontyou agree ms delacour wholeheartedly mr turner god i love this class 9 02 a m am currently in the faculty bathroom with all my hair intact i skiving off history of magic at present which i sure god will punish me for by i dontknow sending a bunch of hungry auguries after me to drive me insane or give me a weather forecast or whatever i dontcare if the gods punish me i having too good a time being sinful and deliciously in lurve with michael you hear that bring it jesus 10 05 a m am in divination asleep with my eyes open learning about the magical pebble method i dontknow what the magical pebble method is however because i wasntlistening from what i am gathering the magical pebble is just a mood ring with uglier colors what is she trying to speak to me 10 28 a m i have just been pebbled or stoned whatever professor trelawney must have sensed that i wasntpaying attention with the third eye she and my sister have in common and decided to make me the example open your hand she said in her fake mystical voice you know i am going to show you the secrets of the universe blah blah pompous crap blah so i opened my hand and she put this burning hot pebble in my hand we both know she did that on purpose just because i dontpay attention to her stupid classes but irregardless dontgo getting on my case i know that irregardless is an illogical double negative it should either be regardless or irrespective but irregardless this word is so much more fun anyhoo she put this burning hot pebble in my hand and left it there as i stared at her in shock and agony after like fifteen seconds she snatched it out and threw it in a huge bucket of water now let me see your hand i still have that huge burn mark on my hand from that stupid evil pebble hm interesting it appears to be a mermaid she said and what the hell does that mean i snapped that i going to die a sudden violent marine related death trelawney looked even more sour than usual no as a matter of fact it means that you should expect a strange adventure involving romance and temptation after that death is largely possible biotch 12 noon i hate mermaids i hate pebbles i hate professor trelawney i hate diet drinks and i hate the world i hate every effing thing except nutri grain bars the world would be so lost if all the nutri grain bars were gone 2 30 p m if michael is my boyfriend

he not sitting down pourquoi 12 30 p m wow i love having a boyfriend okay he did not sit down exactement mais he did give me une bise tr s fantastique kissing obviously is the solution to everything

perfect for each other it really too bad i not attracted to him otherwise all my relationship problems would be over like that 5 30 a m returning to bed after so much banter is thoroughly impossible have decided to start reading the new trashy books that arrived in the mail for me on sunday i have ordered seven for good measure three in the temptation nyc series book one seduction in soho book two charming in chinatown book three lust in little italy two in the halcius pottotius and his band of merry knights series book two halcius pottotius royally flushed sequel to the one i just finished halcius pottotius and his fair lady book three halcius pottotius and the book of love and then dirty girls wear pink and dangerous girls eat chocolate 5 45 a m which book of pure unadulterated filth shall i start with first i mean i know from experience that the books in hp series get pretty racy but really they re more romantic than anything else i still upset that halcius pottotius chose harmonia granker so i think i boycotting everything athena o hereagall writes right now i haventever read anything in the temptation nyc series but i can already tell that they re filled with reckless spending which i relate to so should i read those then again there are the really tempting ones dirty girls wear pink and dangerous girls eat chocolate hm eeny meeny miny mo dirty girls wear pink it is 7 11 a m i was getting very into dgwp when i actually had to go to class it is actually incredibly enthralling you cannot imagine my anger and fury as i realized it was 6 30 and had to stop right in the middle of chapter seven winner takes it all i blame professor binns after all it was his class i had to get out of bed for i can still see the mermaid from divination curse that old hag 9 00 a m am wondering if i can sneak back into my room and get dirty girls wear pink though it might seem odd to professor snape if i were randomly reading a shiny pink book with a completely random tie and martini glass on the cover during his class with the words get what you want emblazoned on it in 3 d silver glitter maybe i should just pay attention 10 00 a m hah i am sitting at the very back during care of magical creatures deeply involved in dirty girls wear pink am sure hagrid wontnotice anything have slipped it discreetly behind a nondescript black notebook excuse me but violette delacrise is about to get cornered by henri potier in her posh parisian apartment wearing nothing but chanel no 19 11 00 a m damn you draco malfoy damn you he has interrupted the most important aspect of my day he stopped me from finding out what happened between violette delacrise and henri potier in that posh parisian apartment that horrid horrid child all right he not really a child if he seventeen but i swear he has the brain of a three year old released his stupid knarl which promptly attacked me i shall never forgive him for this 12 noon i have forgiven him as the scene i so ardently described to you at ten o clock was largely anticlimactic henri phone rang just as he was about to discover violette the only good thing about that chapter was the so you think you re a dirty girl section at the very end what i have learned a i am not a dirty girl b i could be a dirty girl c i should be a dirty girl 6 05 a m tried being a dirty girl was too exhausting will try again later day twenty four of free independence wednesday february 9 th in potions 7 10 am 7 10 a m alas potions is so uninteresting these days i spend this class thinking if only if only jude law who has been restored to full hotness capacity were potions master and orlando bloom taught divination the world would be perfect however potions is wasted on one who has yet to discover something we witches and wizards call soap and divination is run by professor t a loss to humanity that is my brain on potions 7 15 a m life is unbearably dull nothing in the world is fascinating except for michael nothing can compare to him no one is as funny as michael or as smart as michael or as hot 7 20 a m harry has come straight from quidditch practice and i dontbelieve i have ever wanted anything more than i want him to bend over and pick up that empty box of bertie bott every flavor beans for me right now he sweaty and all worked out and he wearing his quidditch robes and it like his entire body is being hugged by spandex oooh lust but we have a boyfriend dontwe fleur there is no longer room to think about your immoral irresponsible and probably illegal lust for this sixteen year old god oh my god he has just dropped his quill watch as i along with every other girl in this room nearly break my neck standing up and stretching god that was good no no no no no no no no no none of this we have promised ourselves to let this fan girlish lust filled part of ourselves go we cantgo breaking our rules can we no god that was good 8 40 a m am i mentally cheating on michael if i keep on wanting to go all psycho chick and imperius his hot self into dropping his quill again 9 02 a m he dropped his quill again 9 04 a m and again 9 06 a m and again 9 10 a m parvati patil has been sent out of the room for hexing harry quill well actually mcgonagall only mad that she missed and got draco quill instead ewww and yet hmmm and yet ewww 9 12 a m it was a definite ewww 9 20 a m it was an ew wasntit 9 30 a m of course it was 9 45 a m ewww i cantbelieve i ever thought hmmm 11 20 a m philosophical question time who got a better bum michael or harry because at the moment harry bum is looking marvelous and i not sure whether i should keep staring at it or just stare legally at michael s or maybe i should just imagine hugh dancy bum i mean i have a much better understanding of hugh dancy bum he spent that entire crappy movie ella enchanted worst movie adaptation of all time which i nevertheless watched 6 times because hugh dancy is one hot tamale in leather pants which i got to acutely observe because he spent all of his time rolling on the ground and kicking at things in a very manly way of course i hate anne hathaway why does she get to spend time with him 11 36 a m after a long bit of deliberation i thinking harry i know le tourneau alert le tourneau alert stop harassing me it not like he a sixth grader but this is not because his bum is any better than michael or hugh dancy s it because harry wears sexy pants i mean hugh pants while great bum viewing pants werentincredibly yum tastic 1 05 p m am now in dada waiting for michael to come in and teach this class have just realized the potential sexiness of this class i mean seriously what if michael is evil what if and no one gets this but harry and harry all i know what you re up to professor turner and you wontyou get away with it and then michael all actually harry i think i will and then they take their shirts off and do battle in bum viewing sexy pants 4 06 p m i have completely changed my mind only michael deserves the bum viewing sexy pants only michael bum is perfect enough 5 33 p m ew draco has clearly stolen the bum viewing sexy pants or copied them or similar and is wearing them at dinner ewwwwwww or is it hmmm

this conversation last time back off mum letter went rather like this dear flurry pie i miss you so much further tosh tosh tosh i cantwait to see you back home again tosh tosh tosh your father loves you very much etc the things i miss most about having you here are as follows your radiant presence etc the reasons you had to go however are as follows you spend too much money etc i have been going through your old things as i remodel the house and doing so has inspired the following emotions sadness etc the things your father has said concerning you since you been gone are as follows flurry would have liked that pink duvet cover etc miss you miss you miss you but anyway dahling i was speaking with the builders this morning up in the eastern tower and i thought dearie me i ve neglected to tell poor fleur about my little project so i best tell you since you left in january i have been on one big fat extreme homemaker as you say in your american shows i have decided that our house needs an entirely new look a look that reflects this lively and rejuvenated chapter in the book of my life i have never felt more liberated and free my life is taking a whole new direction as i venture into the world of arts and music and dance and exercise and i can see big things happening while i was in the library looking for books to send to you dear i found myself immersed in one while the paint was drying in the laundry room body by me a step by step guide to healthy and effective living you may think like i thought that this is a diet book but you are wrong this is not just a diet book this is a book that has changed my life and way of living i think differently now that i have read this book and i notice that my thoughts are more profound i have taken up yoga and pilates and discovered the art of feng shui i have opened up my chi and am actively pursuing the buddhist way of living the path of my life has taken a new turn i know you appreciate what i am doing for myself which is why i know you will appreciate this wonderful news and that i am broadening my worldly scope by staying in bangladesh for the next two months ah dahling it is wonderful to be able to communicate with you again i look forward to further correspondence kisses kisses your loving mum what the bloody hell 8 30 a m you may find yourself asking why would fleur find that letter disturbing when it was a perfectly pleasant expression of her mother zest for life there is one simple reason my mother doesnthave zest for life in my mother world everything pisses her off the city too big your brain is too small your grandpa too drunk everything you re too overweight you re taking up space why are you just standing there like a prat damn it all do something i clean this house day in day out and you have the nerve to come up and make this mess dontyou look away from me i want you to see what you ve done see it when you re around my mother something is wrong with you always damn it gabrielle stop growing if i have to buy you one more set of dress robes i ll have had it i ll have both your feet amputated my mother is never centered and she is always cursing it where we learn our curses for mum swears like a sailor ren e i wonthave you going out of the house looking like an effing poulet funny thing is gabrielle always thought that meant chicken i dontknow why dad even tolerates her because she an overbearing dominating madwoman but he does all the same oh and mum hates beauxbatons she thinks it beyond insipid to name a school beautiful sticks and she hates having to buy schoolbooks for god sakes for what effing reason do they have two effing spell books on here what the bloody hell do they mean by that one of the few things she hates more than beauxbatons is pop culture which makes me think that the only reason she bought me that ticket to new york is because she wanted to get rid of me i absolutely positive she hates kids too and dad made her have them she not very maternal she hates when people tell her she not very maternal it always just makes her go good job captain effing obvious what the eff else did you expect this new thing she doing this messed up project doesntmake any sense 9 05 a m i ve been thinking about my mother all through charms today which i suppose is rather horrible of me because i love charms and i ought to pay attention but this pressing matter is far more important what am i to do about mother i close to positive she gone round the bend new turn what kind of loser mother thing capitalizes random letters in the middle of their sentences my life is taking a whole new direction as i venture into the world of arts and music and dance and exercise and i can see big things happening what the bloody eff is that my mother hates exercise and that why she makes me do it she hates dance she hates happy people she hates music because to her it all trash and she hates people who say big things in that capital letter voice why on earth would she even go to all the trouble of switching up our house she never wants any extra work and what about the emotions it not like you didntsee the emotions my mother expressed emotions do you know how effing freakish that is she was like and now honey darling flurry pie with sugar and a cherry i feeling sad because you arenthere with me i dontknow what the bloody hell that is why didntgabrielle warn me something like this was happening in my own home to my own home ack this is such merde 10 15 a m ran into ren e between classes she seemed completely unconcerned when i explained about mum letter yep mum gone off her rocker so what i not living with her anymore i getting my own apartment and you re not either what are you so worried about god fleur you re such a spaz i can barely believe you at times i dontthink she gets that mum gone bonkers with the yoga and the pilates that just wrong ack no one here understands 11 34 a m i ve decided that i must write to jacques he the only one who can deal with this properly and in sixteen different languages in case mum taking up sanskrit as a part of her new freakish in the zone self dear jacques i have just received post from mum she is stark raving mad i swearing to you she said she remodeling the house which is outside of enough in itself but that not all she become immersed in this book body by me a step by step guide to healthy and effective living and she venturing into the world of capital a art and capital d dance and capital m music and capital e exercise she doing yoga and pilates and capitalizing random words like big things and using them in sentences like i can see big things happening in the future she mad jacques i ve known the crazy madwoman my mother usually is that i can handle but this is a different kettle of bad smelling fish she happy and lively and centered and into feng shui and calling me flurry effing pie scary thing is she didnteven put the effing in there just dontknow what to do jacques you must help me you must i dontknow what i ll do without you things can change of course they can they can paint my room ravage and ruin my books they can spray my room with foul smelling perfumes and rain havoc upon my clothing but my mother cantgo loopy and strange and loving and maternal outside of enough jacques outside of enough please say you ll help me understand this and fix this i cantdeal with it alone and ren e no help gabby didnteven think to warn me about this and who else is there dad doting mum worshipper i need you fleur delacour needs you love begging and pleading fleur if jacques does not respond to that i will have my pilates instructor murder him and that that 1 05 p m i wonder if jacques gotten my letter yet no is completely unreasonable to think he has but poussi re is unbelievable fast flier hm will floo me when he receives it right did not tell him to do so in letter damn in a bucket 1 56 p m poussi re isnt slow she must be there now jacques must be writing his letter now filled with sweet multilingual advice that makes amazing sense leaving me wondering fleur why are you such an idiot why cantyou think of things like this 3 00 p m jacques isnta slow writer he should be done with his profound thinking by now and poussi re must at least be halfway back ready to solve all my problems will build jacques an enormous shrine if he solves this problem should have mentioned in letter would be here by now 4 47 poussi re should be here oh eff watch me gain three pounds of stress weight i will be fat and unattractive hence michael will break up with me and pursue ren e leaving me crying in my room until i die of pure sadness damn you jacques 6 03 where is it i sent this letter some five hours ago jacques having read it by now must know how much it means to me why would he withhold such an important document from me does he hate me that me and want me to suffer suffer but he knows i adore him should have told him about shrine day twenty six of free independence thursday february 11 th breakfast with michael 6 31 am 6 31 a m am completely unable to enjoy this michael is sitting with me being brilliant and sexy and i am completely unable to enjoy it he talking theory with professor lupin who is departing today and he sounding so educated and hot but i can only stare at the sky and wonder what is wrong with my mother i cantbelieve that of all things i am worrying about my mother right now i thinking has dad noticed anything he hasntwritten me a thing since i left maybe he forgotten about me he would have told me if he noticed something he would have written me and then i think about gabrielle why didntgabrielle tell me she must be as alarmed as i am but then she was only in bordeaux a little bit on break before she went back to school maybe she was too busy thinking about her schoolwork or something but gabrielle never thinks about her schoolwork why the bloody eff would she start now she doesntbelieve in education how can you spend all your life believing that education is the greater evil among satan and conservatives and then suddenly licky boom boom down conversion michael looking over is now asking me why i have just written licky boom boom down in big letters how can he be american and not watch vh1 7 04 a m i have decided that jacques must die for making me so crazy i hate him i hate him despite the fact that he un sucky fied the suck fest that was my english and that he sweet and adorable and sometimes sexy in his own freakishly cute tutor ish way he sucks 8 32 a m he is a crappy friend i am getting him soap for christmas really feminine vanilla sugar bodywash not soap bodywash 9 00 a m no i getting him deodorant what better way to say you stink you evil thickheaded prat than with deodorant 9 56 a m you know if i really mad at him i wontget him anything for christmas this is a new concept not buying jacques presents at all hm 10 12 a m when his mother goes cracked i not going to lift a finger to try and help him 11 55 a m unless his mother really cracked and she has trouble getting around and she does crazy schizophrenic things like taking off on her broom and running it into the local liquor store then i ll probably offer to take her places safely like walking 12 09 p m michael has just asked me what wrong i ve told him nothing he says then why are you writing so much you seemed really preoccupied during dada this is true michael is observant and sexy which can only mean that he gets 50 boyfriend points for being so but gets 25 points subtracted for noticing me lying i never have this problem with jacques then again jacques is a filthy piece of pond scum isnthe and he notices he just never calls me on it 2 04 p m this whole day is stupid i think i ve gained four pounds of stupid day weight add this to the three pounds of stress weight i sure i gained yesterday and i will no longer be attractive enough to keep michael around will tire easily of constant snapping i told you i fine cantyou leave it at that will move onto ren e because she only snaps at members of the same sex and is an easy ho damn it all i think i turning into mum 3 15 p m i ve thought about it and naturally if mum going to go and not be mum anymore then someone has to be mum right so it entirely possible that i ve gone and become my mother so who ll be me that what i want to know and who mum if mum has gone and become madonna i will commit suicide 5 12 p m jacques still has not responded to letter 6 07 p m jacques has still not responded to letter though i have sent him 2 025 telepathic messages to do so and 4 051 telling him that he deserves to be crucified with thumbtacks hm maybe he mad about the whole thumbtacks thing would hurt i admit grrr if he has not responded by tomorrow then he deserves it day twenty seven of free independence friday february 12 th dying slowly in potions 8 09 am 8 09 a m professor snape is unbelievable let me rephrase that professor snape is a slimy git who should sod off and die i v piss 9 13 a m michael is now very pissed very enerv which is completely the fault of the disgusting severus snape will explain later wish very much could sleep for am feeling like utter crap but cantas michael is making speech must get to charms or will be late 11 05 a m have checked in and michael is still v enerv i do not blame him for being so very enerv because i am exactly the same though i have cooled down a bit and he is quite murderous and hot looking should have made him this upset much earlier for looks incredibly dashing on him ack must not get all excited about such am still sort of upset too must explain situation to you snape has sent me a very bad valentine was very inappropriate michael found such inappropriate valentine and was very upset valentine had illicit poetry such as cause what i feel extraordinary c mon be my sexcretary michael is now saying that he will strangle snape with his own bare hands which would be entertaining to watch hope he is serious 1 02 p m snape is still alive but i did get to watch as michael very sexily flipped him the bird at lunch and i am still letter less i cannot believe jacques he is usually so quick to help me of course fleur and sure thing fleur what the hell kind of turnaround is this damn you jacques where the hell are you when i effing need you 1 06 p m michael wants to know who jacques is he a stupid git and that all you need to know i have said so jacques if you are reading this which you shouldntbe but being a stupid git might be let it be known unto you that i know you are a stupid git and intend to spread the word 1 10 p m all right but how do you know him michael is asking damn him being so hot and observant and other such crap but i do wish he would stop asking questions and being so actively involved in my life canthe just be like other boyfriends and just sit looking excruciatingly sexy for a bit until i want him to ask me questions and find my life fascinating men are useless in the future they will be locked up in cages like the monkeys they are and their only use will be as sex objects 2 05 p m owls have already flown in and there is nothing from jacques or anyone else for that matter keeping eye out just in case poussi re comes flying in during comc like before am becoming incredibly distracted as of late god mum probably gotten up to the worst redecorating the library walls are probably bright pink with lime green curtains and bean bag chairs pushed up against them with several wild plants growing in and out of this and that and is probably sprawling shag carpeting everywhere what a thoroughly depressing thought i bound to gain more stress weight 4 12 p m will just send jacques anthrax in the post one quick whiff and all my troubles will be miles away will save money on christmas gift of deodorant however without jacques how am i going to figure out what to do with mum merde dans un seau 5 47 p m if i weigh myself i will only find i have gained weight which will make me depressed and gain more weight ha ha you cannot make me fall into that trap again scale company i ve caught onto you and your evil stress pound plan of world domination and instead of listening to the voices in my head asking combien fleur combien i will not find out how much i will

you well now i sold the abs diet must be right for me if this david z blah blah is so confident in it not during the course of this 6 week plan you can lose up to 20 pounds of fat much of it in the first couple of weeks and from your belly first and gain 4 to 6 pounds of lean muscle wait a minute skipper 20 pounds hm 9 51 a m am imagining self 20 pounds lighter i am an emaciated sex goddess la hyper standards of femininity wait must not get sucked into the world of fad dieting and low self esteem caused so easily by the media hm too late have already been to america 10 04 a m this diet involves an incredible amount of protein i am going to have to eat 128 grams of protein a day that is ridiculous so i had better start now i am also going to have to be super crazy exercise bulimic obviously protein will only work as diet supplement if there is crazy exercise bulimia will finish chapter 2 later as must go become super fit hot chick 1 05 p m spent all of lunch on floor doing crunches and leg lifts am extremely hungry but my physical fitness is far more importance that sustaining my body with meaningless food must exercise more 1 17 p m have just realized utter crappiness of situation am supposed to eat six times per day which is 3 snacks and 3 meals if i skip lunch that only five would eat now but there is nothing to eat and i am in care of magical creatures i could eat one of the bowtruckles but i doubt they d taste incredibly good am wondering if i could informare the abs diet and make pictures of food come to life then again might taste like paper wait why have i never tried to informare my orlando bloom poster 1 45 p m am reading about the evils of high fructose corn syrup the ultimate food enemy would very much rather be reading dirty girls wear pink actually finding out about the mysterious disappearance of violette delacrise and how henri potier is frantically searching for her instead must do squats grrr fleur do you want abs or not 3 05 p m have just actually finished reading chapter two states specifically that for the first two weeks of the abs diet no exercise is required merde 3 30 p m have weighed self again and am horrified to discover that in all my protein gorging i have gained a pound ack the world is conspiring against me and i ve still received no word from damn jacques 4 12 p m i fat and letter less and miserable i hope jacques is happy at what he done to me because there no way i happy about it i never speaking to him ever again i locking myself in a closet and never coming out of it ever 5 06 p m post has come 5 07 p m post is merde and there is no letter from damn jacques there isnteven a trashy book monthly for me to browse through in my misery if i going to grow old single i might as well have a good selection of smut 6 30 p m 131 pounds ack day twenty nine of free independence sunday february 14 th valentine day coming thisclose to putting my tongue in jacques mouth 6 45 am 6 45 a m he here he finally here jacques demontmorency love of my life has arrived michael is looking fairly appalled at this last sentence completely in capital letters do not have time to reassure him amid all this happiness 6 55 a m let me explain the joyous news i was sitting in the great hall with michael who was being sexy and marvelous talking to me about the influence that the media has over the world ren e unfortunately was sitting across from us staring at her piece of lettuce with disdain but anyway michael was saying happy valentine day as i beamed down at my abs diet power shake i was actually thinking i looked up just at that moment to see over michael shoulder jacques that gorgeous being jacques screamed i leaping up from the table and running to him as clich s go with my hair streaming out behind me in slow motion no doubt oh my god i love you i squealed in surprise and delight oh thank god for you you dumb sexy creature you i sure that at this point michael was wondering who exactly jacques was and wondering whether or not he should be incredibly worried serious i so happy i d do just about anything for you at this point i smiled i did hear a couple of gryffindors yell take your top off but i simply ignored them in favor of doting unnecessarily on jacques my new favorite person hey you said jacques in his own studly way which caused several female heads to swivel around to stare at him being all well studly i totally thought you werentgoing to come but this i believe in miracles i grinned coming so close to losing all my sense and just jumping up and down like a little kid which is what i really felt like doing since you came along said jacques with a smile you sexy thing i replied as we both walked back to my table have just realized michael will probably think we re sleeping with each other oops 7 02 a m must make sure michael is fully aware that he has no reason to think jacques and i are an item must write him a message we re not having sex 7 03 a m michael has just looked at me and mouthed we re not i am such a crappy communicator me and jacques i mouth back hoping he ll get the message which he wontbecause i am a crappy communicator grrr michael has just mouthed that he has no idea what i ve just said will just casually bring it up at dinner hm turkey rather dry just like my sex life since jacques not doing me at all too forward hey could you send the gravy my way i totally not getting any from jacques 7 45 a m well i cantjust bring up sex in the middle of class so i ll just have to wait until lunch to assure michael that jacques is not my lover he just a guy that thinks i am the one god america got to me haha michael jacques michael jackson hee hee okay that it i swear 8 21 a m but the world is bound to get better now that jacques is around jacques stops me from going completely crazy over such things which reminds me that i must talk to him about my mother that much more important than the fact that we re not sleeping together 10 45 a m am slowly starting to get as bananas as mum despite jacques presence i have showed jacques mum letter and he was very infuriatingly calm and reasonable has occurred to me that michael may have wondered what jacques was doing up in my room v bad maybe your mother just had some kind of spiritual revelation or an epiphany or something said jacques it entirely possible that she can be open to something new and not taking drugs smoking floo powder or crazy but jacques she capitalizes letters in the middle of sentences and calls me flurry pie and talks about how she misses me and about how dad misses me and about her feelings and she has emotions and do you want to have rollicking good sex with me asked jacques quite seriously interrupting me mid rant looking very grave and important what your mother may just be going through a phase in her life maybe she had a very repressed childhood and is only now beginning to express herself now that she has more room in her life after all gabrielle is off at school and you are here as is ren e and she has time to herself now she has time to really take care of herself as opposed to constantly taking care of you and ren e and gabrielle hence the yoga and the pilates now she has times to do all the things she may have really wanted to do all along but never had time to but we were going to have sex i said what asked jacques just as if he had no idea what on earth i was talking about or where i had gotten the idea from in the first place when he so clearly did you asked me if i would like to have rollicking good sex with you i can t of course because i in a committed relationship with michael and because i ve already established that i not having rollicking good sex with you not that i can have rollicking bad sex with you either but this morning i already told michael i wasn t so i cantjust go back on that fleur said jacques what i was rather put out at having been stopped in the middle of my explanation to jacques which i thought was rather good considering the fact that i was going rather batty inside and had no composure i just said that to shut you up oh i replied being even more dazzlingly articul e than ever jacques is so wickedly intelligent and i take things so literally hm nts stop taking things so darn literally or you ll never stop misunderstanding jacques 11 05 a m jacques is staying up in my room analyzing the letter as i sitting through divination i am resisting the temptation to seize that freakish crystal ball on that freakishly bright purple cradle and chuck the whole thing right at that batty old hag head i shouldn t because come to think of it professor trelawney was never that wicked to me besides the whole pebble incident that is and that time she made me come pick up tea leaves when i was explaining the sexiness potential of various names 11 15 a m i have not chucked the freakish crystal ball at professor trelawney head for i have decided that it is enough of a punishment to look that much like a bug 11 17 a m i am getting very upset i have just realized that i am still fat even though i on this abs diet and i have no abs hold on while i produce this worthless piece of diet y trash from my handbag 11 19 a m yep the book clearly stated that i should lose five to eight pounds in the first one to two weeks ahem ahem still grotesquely fat i cantbelieve my mother bought this disgusting rip off where did she even get this disgusting rip off i too disgusted to even wonder why 11 45 a m i have checked my stomach again there are still no abs there and i still feel fat why is my stomach not flat hm book says that indicator of healthiness can be found in bmi weight x 703 height x height 131 x 703 67 x 67 my bmi is 21 book says am not overweight but could definitely afford to be hot lean supermodel last half of that sentence did not come from book just in case you thought it did 12 00 noon am sitting across from that wicked witch what s her face ren e that right am sitting across from ren e reading the valentine that wonderful no longer damn jacques sent me is that from your husband or your boyfriend she asks picking at her no carbs no fat granola bar which i assume serves as lunch and dinner i donthave a husband i remark casually wondering what the hell kind of crack my sister is on after she admits her problem i going to tell her all about the deviated septum you can get from smoking crack then what do you call jacques she replies looking ridiculously thin i mean how can you be that thin my sister is tall supermodel dwarfing tyra banks all over the place tall five ten and a half last i checked grrr who still five seven over here and worse than being so tall i swear to g she must be about 116 pounds i am very surprised that my parents never put her on the gain some poundage stick child diet jacques is my friend i explain calmly flipping to valentine number two which is from michael right ren e says sarcastically he criticizes you constantly you fight like children he always pays he hates all your boyfriends and you re not having sex sounds like a husband to me absurdities if jacques is my husband then what is michael i ask suddenly intrigued at something my wicked sister is saying no matter how ridiculous it may happen to be michael is your on the side lovah says ren e as if i have just asked the single stupidest question in the world she wickedly flips her hair and behind her some sick fifth year gapes ok i ve set fire to his pants he gone now lovah i ask skeptically watching as that fifth year tries frantically to extinguish his underwear in the hallway and quite unsuccessfully i might add ren e nods her head confidently lovah i am now close to laughing out loud with pure condescension at the idiocy of this statement which is quite obvious to ren e fine if michael not your lover then jacques is jacques is not my lover i have said this a little too loudly and a couple of seventh years trickling by are giving me the eye of course after that they see ren e and really give her the eye ren e has that i know better than you stop acting like you know what you re talking about look on her face which is quite disconcerting fine whatever you say michael jackson said the same thing about billie jean and we all know how that ended i thought you didntgive a crap about muggle things i said so how do you know about michael jackson cha who doesnt know about michael jackson replied ren e super crazy sister witch she getting up to leave completely showing off her damned skinniness and her damned tallness she says jacques is not her lover he just a boy who thinks that i am the one which means the sex isntthat fun get out i yell but she jumps out of the way just before i can set fire to her too 1 05 p m this is just brill tr s effing brill it just brilliant how now both michael and ren e think that jacques and i are red hot lovers ew must talk to michael after class is over meanwhile he just like there is a reason all of you are required to take this class you simply must be able to protect yourselves when there is no one around to protect you and other blah it very hot so i trying to act like i paying attention so he can get validation for his hotness one thing i learned reading witches are from mars wizards are just stupid is that men need constant validation of their sexiness where is that book anyway i really could use learning what to do about inappropriate lustifications occurring during a relationship with such a wizard 2 30 p m was going to talk to michael after his lecture but apparently jacques got there first this is bad bad bad bad bad decided for sake of historical accuracy to transcribe their entire conversation mostly so i can look over it and see whether or not michael has any reason to be all suspicious and angry and upset and hurt hold on while i imagine michael being suspicious angry upset and hurt that was so hmmm okay now to the transcription which i was able to listen to while i was behind a column on my way back from my trip to the kitchens to get chocolate from the house elves jacques michael the first encounter episode one michael casually walking down the hall on the way to get coffee in the very very empty great hall hey jacques walking in the opposite direction looking pissed i mean not drunk or anything just really really upset looking if he d looked this apprehensive and concerned when he arrived ren e would have started hitting on him by now jacques walking in the opposite direction looking apprehensive and concerned wait i have something to ask you at this point i become concerned jacques is using the now i want you to know that if you ve been doing something you know will upset me that you can tell me at any time because i ll be okay with it i not like a regular over protective tutor i a cool tutor voice jacques gravely what are your intentions michael swiveling around in a very michael jackson in the cool years way what jacques looking more apprehensive and concerned what are your intentions towards fleur i will take a moment to describe to you what jacques is wearing today so you can accurately imagine him in your mind he is wearing all black he is wearing a black long sleeved shirt but the sleeves are too long so they re pushed up and then he wearing black jeans which are baggy and faded so they re more like dark gray and he got his black jacket slung over his shoulder like so his hair is dark brown so he looking dark and brooding today and currently reminds me of dean from gilmore girls before he spent forty days and forty nights in the forest being tempted by satan where he couldntshave bathe or maintain any form of hygiene michael sizing up jacques who is sizing up michael at the same time i m not sure he says this suspiciously as he is trying to assess who is taller him or jacques i know this because this is what jacques does all the time michael is taller by a quarter inch which will piss jacques off jacques is very upset that he is not six feet tall five foot eleven and three quarters michael is six feet exactly jacques realizing that michael is six feet exactly takes out little black book filled with secretive secrets and mutters unsure of relationship with fleur possibly has no intentions b c does not intend to stick around michael glaring hey jacques returning to book aggressive michael calming down after hearing such a judgement passed upon himself look i dontknow what your problem is but if fleur likes you then i dontwant to get into this with you jacques passive aggressive michael hey what the hell is this jacques unrestrained use of profane language seems uninhibited by presence of headmaster in distance seemingly no respect for authority michael quickly jerking around to see dumbledore passing by then turning back to hate on jacques what with that no jacques looking up from his dark black bleakness may i see some kind of identification a license perhaps michael exasperated at jacques endless questioning like what a driver license a pilot license a gun license jacques expresses an interest in harming others possible sadistic violent tendencies michael light heartedly oh come on it not as if i go around shooting bunnies and lighting small children on fire that only on the weekends jacques quite seriously takes pleasure in the pain of others frequently tortures small animals has structured way of going about such depraved practices michael that was a joke jacques shaking his head in his hm that will take points off your grade kind of way has crappy sense of humor michael now more pissed off than jacques was in the first place which is understandable as jacques is practically provoking him my sense of humor is fine jacques seems to live life in denial okay at this point you are probably thinking that jacques is an annoying judgmental prat i will not disagree with you i must only say that jacques has always been a sweet funny easy going easy to get along with stand up guy today i sure his synapses are misfiring michael seeming to have realized something and looking properly and hotly angry and vengeful reminds me of the look on his face when he read snape dirty valentine anyway michael well what going on between you and fleur damn it i knew this question would come up jacques dubiously as if he is sensing something dodgy i could ask you the same thing michael no you really couldn t i her boyfriend now what are you merde merde merde jacques has a crap way of explaining things jacques i her friend michael do you think i stupid damn in a bucket of tuna really bad smelling crappy tuna this is one sick bucket of seafood a rotten kettle of fish jacques do you want me to answer that ooh kay fleur must step in now 4 00 p m have had good long talk with jacques numbers have said what the hell were you thinking 26 times have said what the hell is wrong with you 43 times have kicked him in the shins twice have used colorful language 104 times have forbidden him to speak 31 times have ordered him to apologize to michael once has apologized to michael zero times have asked god to smite me 446 times 4 15 p m have loudly complained to ren e that jacques is the world curse she has responded may the lord smite me with it ew 5 05 p m well now michael hates jacques guts this is fantabulous grrr how can my two favorite guys hate each other this is just like nathan and will on will grace i will just have to explain to michael that jacques is the will to my grace and if he cantget along with him then tough 6 00 p m had a jolly old dinner with michael ren e and jacques not it was ridiculous beyond ridiculous how badly michael and jacques get along with each other you would think that given their common interests being male y chromosomes me etc they would find a foundation for a healthy and altogether nonviolent relationship but instead war like aggressive man children in the middle of dinner i was complaining to jacques about the food i dontknow how much protein this has and i really dontthink i ve gotten all 128 grams of protein that the abs diet dictates that i should have should i run out and find peanut butter or are you going to eat that why are you on a diet you re thin enough says jacques as if i have just said the stupidest thing in the entire world completely ignoring my peanut butter query way too skinny agrees michael quickly emaciated even jacques says looking up one could go so far as to say you need to gain some weight says michael who is not looking at me but rather looking directly at jacques you could afford to put on a few pounds concurs jacques nodding his head emphatically that what i just said says michael in that grrr fierce kind of way no what you said is that she needed to gain weight what i said was that she could afford to put on a few pounds that entirely different phrasing said jacques in that infuriating you ve just conjugated that verb incorrectly voice now who being aggressive says michael you are michael starts to get up and i am quite sure that he is about to punch jacques lights out i think that most of the people in the hall realized this as well because there were lots of necks craning over to see what was happening i start to laugh unconvincingly now if you cantplay nice you cantplay together i say stuffing a tart in my mouth look i eating now you re both happy oh come on dontmake me turn this car around or we re not stopping for ice cream fine says michael sulkily as jacques says the same in an equally sulky voice i swear to g in five seconds they re both going to go jinx you owe me a soda a couple minutes later i actually attempted to start a conversation amongst all of us so why dontwe go around in a circle and say nice things about one another jacques why dontyou go first say something nice about michael jacques looked so very ven re at that moment he has good taste in girlfriends at least i must admit this was very sweet but it was kind of ruined by that look on his face i looked at michael and he shifted uncomfortably in his seat and he has a good taste in friends you could just tell how much it was paining him to say this there that wasntso hard was it i said far more exasperated than relieved i swear i said thinking of witches are from mars wizards are just stupid men are such children jacques smiled you re only mad because we re not having rollicking good sex michael took this very much the wrong way he called jacques some very inappropriate names after which jacques proceeded to tell michael to do something to his mother that i cannot even print here happy effing valentine day further further february screw me shoes of doom day thirty of free independence monday february 15 th my room 4 12 am 4 12 a m last night event have awakened me at an ungodly hour which only adds to my distress still in state of shock michael called jacques a what jacques told michael to do what the only good thing that came out of dinner last night was the validation of my best friend and my boyfriend telling me how damn skinny i am but what i simply cannot comprehend is how this could happen when jacques is such a freakishly nice person he so non confrontational i simply don t 4 20 a m weirdness in a bucket jacques is here has he no respect for the sanctity of my sleep whether or not was actually sleeping irrelevant hm hope michael never finds out about this it may not sit well with him that jacques was up in my room at 4 o clock in the morning he has come to apologize well dontapologize to me apologize to michael i say parce que no matter how sweet and adorable and wonderful jacques is to me he was not very nice to michael last night obviously cannot promote one code of conduct with me and different code with everyone else as seems like beginnings of weird codependent potentially abusive obsessed relationship like oh but he really great when we re alone sounds suspicious clearly cannot condone even if true fleur jacques says kneeling by my nightstand he is awful i do not forgive him despite kneeling oh damn him he using the sweet adorable forgive me please so darn cute voice do not forgive him fleur je dois tre forte je dois tre forte i not forgiving you i say bien fait fleur 5 01 a m i forgave him i mean i couldnthelp it he was being all rational and sweet and everything he said made sense and well i was strong for a little bit at least it was the crestfallen disappointment face that did it as he rose from my bedside crushed looking awful hate him ahem so obviously forgive him he says he simply doesntknow what came over him and that he knows he embarrassed me and feels like utter crap about it and that the only reason he overreacted was because he possessive and a huge control freak and that i simply must forgive him for his sudden bout of madness or else what the point of him being here who can argue with that 6 14 a m it has just occurred to me that michael will be really pissed off when he finds out that i have forgiven jacques seeing as how he would like very much to smash jacques into tiny bite sized pieces but whatever 7 23 a m i dontget men i just dontget them they re on they re off they re up they re down they re freaking roller coasters that what men are breakfast today was so messed up so i sit down at the table expecting another full out row complete with violence and profanity and yet jacques and michael are already sitting there talking to each other blah blah viktor krum blah blah chudley cannons blah blah quidditch quidditch quidditch said michael to which jacques responded with a variation of the same krum offense has been kind off all season said michael looking very thoughtful and serious as he made incomprehensible hand gestures as he had been talking about some freakish play called the brunei twist or whatever new girlfriend that it said jacques gravely as michael nodded his head in comprehension agreeing wholeheartedly girlfriends will do that to you he said enter me ahem hey fleur they said simultaneously like scary twins or brothers or bestest bestest friends what going on here asked i suspiciously because there could not be any logical for their sudden cooperation with each other other than some kind of conspiracy or body snatchers or something polyjuice i swear it like ren e suddenly turning around and being really nice to me and not just fake nice but honestly truly caring about my wellbeing knitting me sweaters and taking me shopping ooh shudder we were just discussing the brunswig twist said jacques at which several fifth year girls looked over and giggled ew ew ew well that odd i said smiling as if doing so were the only thing that would keep them from attacking each other because i could have sworn yesterday you wanted to modulate each other i think the word you re looking for is mutilate said jacques being the obnoxious snot that is always in there but being obnoxious and snotty in a sweet i smiling so it okay way douche you re an insufferable prat you know that i said smiling so it okay i pulled out a chair and situated myself cautiously across from them wary of disrupting the strange balance that had suddenly arisen seriously i dontget it yesterday you were like that i said miming an explosion with my hands and today you re like this so what happened donttell me guys just turn on and off like a light bulb actually michael started to say oh my god do not even go there hm where did it say in witches are from mars that men were like light bulbs because i swear i do not remember that chapter 8 05 a m i finally found the section about all the different things men are like men the metaphors men are like many things blenders microwaves fire detectors pencil sharpeners dvds ankle weights scales shoes wildfires tissue paper balloons and toilet stalls men are like fire detectors once you set them off they wontshut up men are like dvds always cursing right when your parents come in the room men are like tissue paper reusable disposable and soft men are like balloons one blow and it a party but more than anything men are like toilet stalls all the good ones are taken and all the rest of them are full of crap see nothing about light bulbs 10 04 a m men are just stupid if there anything i ve learned from extensive study of witches are from mars it that men are stupid jacques has just very stupidly rushed into this room in the middle of charms and come up to me and looked me in the eye and i mean like seriously in the eye like so close i can smell that crest fresh breath close and just said hey fleur i think i know what going on you know with the feng shui and everything he pauses to grin at me with a crest bright smile to match that crest fresh breath i have been experiencing just thought you might want to know he says then he makes his way to the door is about to exit turns around leans against it very james dean leaning on whatever james dean leans on cars motorcycles women whatever and says what no smile shakes his head and walks away all the girls were sitting dumbly quills in their mouths staring at the door as if they were wondering when he would return you could hear the silence just echoing bouncing from wall to wall to wall flitwick unawares horrifyingly enough there is no denying it jacques is hot in a bucket hot this is why gabrielle is obsessed with him and ren e is denying that she is obsessed with him when you are hot it is like the same thing as owning a gun you must use your weapon wisely what jacques has just done is like taking out a machine gun and shooting everyone in this class down thank god he only grazed me jacques should know that he cantjust go unleashing his hotness all over the place stupid stupid stupid doesnthe know how inconvenient this will be now with the giggle giggles everywhere and the crazy fan girls he will have now following him around hiding behind bushes and other such to get a nice good look at his rear end i will never get a word in without having to pause every five or six seconds to barf discreetly damn you jacques you dumb sexy creature at least they will have michael and harry to distract them wait a minute 12 noon i was so right there is a group of ravenclaw girls over there looking over at jacques and then quickly looking away amateurs they should know that i can see them hiding behind their books as if that way i wontknow god i thought rowena ravenclaw took the smartest caught up caught up i dontknow what it is but it seems she got me twisted oh caught up caught up i losing control this girl got her hold on me sorry the usher took control damnation i wish i had my ipod right now and i wish those ravenclaws would go to buggery 1 45 p m jacques by this time has become the new hottest thing ever that took what four hours idiot he like so scorching hot i like sweating like right now the moment i heard this i seriously considered shrieking ten points from hufflepuff for hormonal misconduct dear god this is rather odd actually because jacques has never been the new hottest thing ever i ve known jacques since before he was my english tutor he moved to bordeaux from england where he moved when he was like 4 when i was 8 years old a couple houses down this was in the supra outcast fricking ugly duckling phase of my life when i was drastically impopulaire and nobody liked me except for dad mom hated everyone because gabrielle was in her fearsome fives so when jacques showed up i latched onto him like a crazy leech which was fortunate because he gets me i sure at the time my delusions were charming when i was fourteen and three quarters he moved back to england for a year which sucked more than anything and i was stuck with gabrielle all summer entertaining the truly annoying eleven year old that she knows she was as ren e sixteen partied her way through life being that slutty social papillon that she was even then my fifteenth summer was such merde i donteven want to discuss it anyway after that summer was over i went back to pretty sticks for my 4th year weirdest school year of my life definitely applies it was as if the entire male population had just suddenly noticed i existed to tell the truth while it was flattering it was also scary as hell dates flew by like well butterflies so when i was fifteen and a half jacques moved back to bordeaux to review when jacques left the airport to go to england he was a scraggly rail thin brown haired mess that looked like he had just had a fight with a rabid monkey and the rabid monkey won when jacques came back he was no mess i kind of just stared at him when he knocked on my door until hey fleur can i come in it kind of cold out here i think i kind of got over jacques looking like sex after a couple of months after getting used to him after all newly emerged hotness does little to hide the idiot best friend that lies underneath of course gabrielle never really got over it because he came back when she was turning thirteen and had just hit puberty otherwise known as my my there are a bunch of hot guys i never noticed before and unfortunately for her jacques never got less attractive ren e was just like my that hot jailbait fleur has got there but she moved on to go shag her boyfriend at the time franz can you imagine shagging a guy named franz but anyway that the skinny on jacques and the odd chemical effect he has on the female species and those hot gay guys who live across the street while i heart jacques so effing much his oddly effective pheromones drive most relationships i attempt to have into deep deep ditches yeah right he your friend and you ve been getting tutoring every tuesday i totally believe you i cantmake it i ve got tutoring with jacques sounds like a really bad way to get out of a date which is what every boyfriend aaron to zachary has thought damnity damn if this happens with michael i will dismember jacques so badly that he wontbe hot anymore 4 07 p m i ve just weighed myself 125 joy in a bucket full of escargot i just poked my stomach and i think it hurt i mean it hurt my finger not my stomach because that would just be stupid 4 30 p m i going to eat tuna to give further kick to my metabolism 7 02 p m ate tuna feel fat

conjured me chicken soup and michael has just popped in to make sure i have not died yet have spent entire day in bed finishing up dirty girls wear pink which has reached the point where violette and henri are somehow stuck in locked office together tension tension tension sniffle 12 noon jacques has come and visited me and been very kind about my complaining about my stomach for five minutes god love him 1 02 p m god relieve me of this pain i cantkeep anything down and i need six meals six not eating enough might throw me off of this diet and i might gain those six pounds back ack 2 34 p m jacques is so considerate he has just sent me a meal complete with abs diet power foods yay turkey sandwich with cheese tas in the t in abs diet power and dairy is the d in abs diet power with raspberries as the r and a little bowl of instant oatmeal and then god love him it sprinkled with extra strength whey powder god i dontcare if i taken i want to snog him senseless 5 00 p m ack my

now because jacques has gone out and gotten it for me i dontknow how the hell he did it but somehow he got it perhaps smuggled it under cover of night ou quelque chose heroic like that where can you get muggle dvds in the wizarding world 10 45 a m i have just asked him he says that he went down to a store called closet muggle in hogsmeade where they sell muggle things for wizards with fetishes or loonies or those who have been through the mugglefication process and need to step out of it gradually the good thing is that most of the things they sell there are modified so that they dontmalfunction around magic 11 23 a m am now absently wondering if i am preggers no doesntmake sense haventhad sex yet 11 25 a m then again i could be like the virgin mary jacques is now looking at me like i a crazy bird are you pregnant my god men are so stupid 11 40 a m this movie is making the both of us crazy it has infiltrated our minds and i swear we will be shrieking about how we re filled with christ love all week are you sure you re not pregnant asks jacques staring with concern at my food baby perhaps considering giving it up for adoption yes jacques smiles looking absolutely infuriating are you sure you haventbeen having unprotected sex trying to save souls shut up 12 30 p m yay best movie ever are you down with g o d yes pastor skip i am down with g o d even jacques is getting jiggy with jesus we are chilling with christ 1 46 p m jacques and i are now just sitting in my room thinking about our souls i mean are we going to be saved right now i thinking that we re both going to burn in hell i figure that i ve always been backsliding into the fires of eternal damnation and such but jacques was heading to heaven up until that thing with michael mother jesus was so not down with that what have you done wrong asks jacques we re both just sitting on my bed looking out the window still snowing me tons of things i curse a lot i envy a lot and i lust a lot badabing badaboom hell i explained also i take the lord name in vain and i did kind of tell him to go sod himself and i continually blowing off his son i am so down with damnation 3 00 p m ooh made the mistake of wandering outside of my room found michael talking to ren e didntget to see any more before jacques realized what i was seeing and forcibly dragged me back into my room 3 45 p m jacques is now telling me to chill i haventeven done anything i was just wondering how long it would take ren e to seduce michael into leaving me for her that all 5 21 p m jacques is leaving but he promised to come back and bring me dinner i am simply too befuddled and upset to do anything but nod i was lulled into a false sense of security thinking that ren e hadntdecided to sink her claws into michael damn i going to console myself by starting halcius pottotius book 2 what that called again halcius pottotius royally flushed delightful 6 03 p m dinner was good and very abs diet for which i thank jacques but am still very much down in the dumps why did i think ren e would leave michael alone day thirty nine of free independence wednesday february 24 th up again 6 21 am 6 21 a m i up again i feel much better now and i can devote more time to preventing the theft of michael turner grrr i at breakfast and ren e is just being infuriating i dontunderstand she hit on him the first day and for twenty two days she was quiet she didntdo a thing and now suddenly she on the attack again what the ruddy hell is going on new silent missle approach 8 57 a m quite a little problem has presented itself in the form of ren e delacour on top of this there is the problem of figuring out how to fix my mother which jacques claims to have found the solution for and is simply not telling me so as the mom situation is presumably under control we must focus on the far more pressing issue ren e 14 ways to solve the problem of ren e delacour 1 drop a cd player into the tub while she taking a bath 2 put paint thinner in her coffee 3 shove her into the lake when no one looking leave alfie the giant squid to deal with her 4 trick her into drinking a polyjuice potion that will have her looking like one of the targets of the wizard mafia 5 strychnine in her granola bar 6 hot wire a car and run her over with it 7 cast a spell of celibacy over her 8 cast a spell of lesbianism over her 9 cast a spell of devout christendom over her 10 shove her head in a car door and shut it over and over and over again 11 shove an umbrella down her throat and then open it 12 push her down an elevator shaft 13 take her on a trip to italy and over the alps push her out the emergency exit 14 lock her in a room with hilary faye she will go crazy i thinking car door right about now she flirting with michael outside the charms room laughing like a schoolgirl i hope she chokes on her own vomit 11 04 a m i ve something to tell you that will make you like me stop worrying about the ren e problem so much while i cannot let my guard down i can relax a bit i think shall i start at the beginning well for starters i was outside in care of magical creatures not paying attention to the lesson but rather thinking of more ways to dispose of that tarte of course completely unexpectedly michael dashed onto the scene looking ridiculously attrayant as always and came up to me i smiled like an idiot at him as seven or eight hufflepuff girls turned around to covet my boyfriend hey he said as i continued smiling like a maniac one would think the smile dumbly phase would pass once dating has commenced hm hey i replied i so damn articul e around michael dontyou think fleur i ve been meaning to talk to you about something he said i ve just discovered something and i cantlie to you any longer there something between your sister and i and i must pursue it or else i dontknow what i ll do without her fleur she beautiful and clever and you you just cantcompare to her goodbye fleur no he totally didntsay that fleur i ve been meaning to talk to you about something i mean we ve been doing the whole online thing but you re here now and so um he paused shuffling his feet i was going to ask you on valentine day but anyway i was wondering do you think that on friday i dontknow you might like to go out somewhere or stay in or something he looked so sweet just then if you could have seen him of course i said yes to him and got dirty glares from those same obsessive hufflepuffs yay actual date with michael finally 12 noon sitting with jacques discussing this new event in my life jacques seems eager to talk about mum but i ve insisted on discussing this first parce que je suis trop trop excited to talk about anything else oh damn i ve got a date to prepare for what in merlin name am i supposed to wear jacques just rolls his eyes being flippant and uncaring in that way that he does which i am far too used to by now he like this about each and every one of my boyfriends michael who but that just jacques oh come on fleur jacques says it one date michael wontgive a crap what you re wearing if he didntthink you were hot why would he ask you out in the first place if you look too amazing you ll raise his standards and he ll expect you to be fantastic looking all the time be yourself ignoring all of the compliments and backhanded compliments in there which cancel each other out whatever men know nothing i continue musing a dress would be too formal but then jeans would be too casual i say dreamily wondering fleur michael is just like all your other boyfriends jacques says downing a glass of orange juice all my other boyfriends were assholes i reply it too true it almost as if i am a jerk magnet attracting only the worst of the dating world and then when they reveal their true colors usually in the form of premature horizontal advances they must be dumped scum all of them you got that right jacques agrees 12 56 p m the more i think about it the more i see it i only date jerks jacques has just responded yes you do i have decided that even if michael and i do break up i will try my very best to avoid big headed slimy prats from now on 2 49 p m i have just had a very interesting conversation with jacques about my boyfriends he made the statement you always date jerks break it off and then you re in a state for a month and go through one of your phases i donthave phases i reply because it absolutely true i a completely rational and consistent person and men are unobservant ignorant idiots so why should i listen to a word one of them has to say witches are from mars all the way air karate chop oh yes you do jacques said matter of factly like in seventh year when you dated that ass fernando and after like three months in all his sexual frustration i make a face at jacques because as if that was my fault he ended up shagging nanette du loire in the dungeons over christmas break you were so pissed off i remember and you went into your jet phase for about two months are you implying that i was a cold hard bitch i asked alarmed looking at jacques as if he had just told me sea slugs were tracking through my hair and were about to enter my ear canal you thought you were jacques laughed looking at me as if i were the single funniest movie he had ever had the pleasure to watch it like your sex appeal is a weapon theory he said sitting down on my bed you went around seeing how many people you could seriously injure just to piss him off the funny thing was that you didntcare how much you got off on it because you hated everything oh i remember that when i went to hogwarts for the triwizard cup i said finally seeing what he was talking about dear god i was a pissy mess then i hated this dank stupid castle i hated the other champions god i hated fernando the only effing good thing about that effing tournament was harry potter really now said jacques grinning and i suddenly knew that i had said too much come off it jacques i said instantly trying to backtrack though i already knew that he d have a field day with what i d just said so he was the only good thing about the school interesting what about now is harry potter the only good thing about this school now damn damn damn no you idiot harry potter isntthe only good thing around there you of course and michael and orlando boom and jude law damn it jacques you make everything such a big deal i just fancied him for a bit you know flirted with the idea just to have a go at fernando i swear right sure said jacques smiling as he got up off my bed and hung around by the door his hand on the knob ready to leave i believe you 5 05 p m i ve just weighed myself 124 lbs yay abs diet 6 21 p m i ve completely forgotten about my date with michael how could i be so stupid what am i going to wear c est comme s il n y a rien dans mon armoire merde dans un seau bah i ll figure it out tomorrow day forty one of free independence friday february 26 th losing it cannot go to class 7 34 am 7 34 a m dontknow what to wear 8 45 a m i am going to be out in hogsmeade with michael having our very first date sit down face to face date unshielded by the glow of a computer screen in approximately eleven hours and i have no fricking clue what to wear jeans no dress no so there ought to be something in between pretty shirt jeans and heels but what shirt jeans and heels 10 05 a m calm poised have decided that i will wear my blue sort of ruffled shirt fairly dressy low riders and my slingbacks yes now i can exhale 12 noon hm low riders too slutty for a first date maybe could counter balance with more modest shirt something down right demure the white one with the dramatic sleeves but perhaps too nun like do not want to encourage idea of inviolable purity maybe the pink shirt with stripes instead no too casual grrr 1 34 p m 6 hours and 11 minutes damn it all red shirt much prettier and i look much thinner but awfully low cut but then grrr what about the blue one gah jacques is no help in this department damn him for being born male didnteven have the courtesy to be gay putain de merde 2 01 p m back in the room in severe emotional crisis which one i ask holding up the blue shirt and pink shirt and balancing the red shirt on my foot yes jacques says sounding confused yes that not an answer pick one being under stress i am understandably very irritable at the present time and jacques not answering my clothing queries directly will only serve to further agitate me um the pink one he says the pink one i cantwear this shirt with those shoes jacques a two year old could see that i screech in the depths of turmoil by this time and taking out all of my untapped completely unrestrained frustration upon poor unfortunate jacques who as usual is just in the wrong place at entirely the wrong time then then go find a two year old replies jacques just as stressed out as i am hm a two year old would pick the red one 4 56 p m red one blue one red one blue one feel like dr suess maybe blue is too sad and mellow for my personality maybe i should be more enrapturing and outgoing and seductive so red then my god why is this so hard 6 03 p m i have exactly one hour and 42 minutes fine then i picking the red one and that it no going back it the red one but the blue one is so much nicer than the red one it obvious that the blue one is fancier so much more appropriate but then the red one is so much prettier and more comfortable and didntjacques tell me to be myself and wouldntthat mean being comfortable but what if the laws of dating state that i am simply prohibited from being that comfortable as if i might as well be sitting at home on the couch watching the telly 7 14 p m am all ready to go putting on shoes now i finally have decided that i look absolutely perfect for tonight outing nothing can turn me back sally forth damnation ren e just come in in a cloud of cigarette smoke oh god fleur you re not wearing those are you she asks pointing her smoke ash disgusted at my feet what wrong with them i ask suddenly worried i know that i should never ever under any circumstances listen to my sister when i think everything okay but i was paralyzed looking from her to my feet wondering what on earth had made her say those horrible words she laughs all haughty derision you cantwear those on your first date ren e says in that same voice regina george uses in mean girls damn you are so lucky you have us to guide you she tilts her head at me like a silly baby with a bucket on its head playing with the pots and pans she sighs oh fleur what kind of slut wears screw me shoes on her first date excuse me oh come on fleur dontact so innocent the only reason any girl would wear shoes like that would be if she wanted to get laid so if you were counting on getting screwed tonight go ahead wear those shoes but if i were you i d take them off and try something else dontwant the new boyfriend thinking we re all shoes and no action i just stared at her these are not these shoes are she patted me on the head they re screw me shoes fleur just accept it she walked across my room took halcius pottotius royally flushed off my nightstand plopped down on my bed and started reading 10 00 p m back from date michael turner rocks my socks and my shoes too march no i will not be your sexcretary day forty four of free independence monday march 1 st at breakfast 6 33 am 6 33 a m hmmm feel all warm and fuzzy inside spent whole of weekend in bed reliving date did not even make the effort to move i had a really good date with michael on friday i say dreamily as jacques looks at me as if my hair has just turned green and is growing tentacles really really i reply thinking of it michael is so much better than fernando i mean fernando was gorgeous and all but he was a total sleaze i really should have guessed the first time that i saw him and claudette chatting it up at the annual beauxbatons winter formal that he was a total man slut but i kept going out with him because he was gorgeous and charming and because it pissed ren e off fernando was way more gorgeous than franz 6 40 a m jacques has just asked me the single oddest question i was just thinking about the way michael said hey on friday when jacques just says out of the blue did you make out with him what the hell kind of question is that is what i want to know so that exactly what i said what the hell kind of question is that jacques looked uncomfortable you know as i was boring little holes in him with my eyes so it took him a while to respond before i shut off my lasers i dontknow did you guys you know i just wanted to be sure of his his intentions i know i finished for him jacques can be so predictable sweet and wonderful and endlessly helpful yes but altogether too predictable what it canthurt for at least one of us to be sure what you re getting into sputtered jacques this is what sucks about having a best friend who is this clever and talented he is always being practical i mean sure practical counts for something when the evil super villain has you tied up in his lair up against your chairs which are bolted to the ground and there is nothing within a 30 foot radius of the both of you and all you have is some chewing gum and lighter fluid but when all you want to do is think about your date without any hassle then practical means diddly squat and is just plain annoying what does what i getting myself into with michael have to do with what we did last night the answer by the way is yes yes yes yes yes yes i did get kissed by the fantastic michael turner seriously high level making out and it was as would be expected fantastic and romantic and sweet it has everything to do with it how else am i supposed to know his intentions said jacques tensely i swear jacques needs some serious acupuncture my friend janine from 6th year was all tense and uptight right before exams but then she went to switzerland for like a week and got acupuncture from this freaky chinese guy and then for exams she was so calm and collected that she passed every single one with honors well the answer is yes i said happily you could just tell jacques was going to have some kind of hoity toity practical reason why what i had just told him was absolutely wrong jacques had that furious animal that been kept up in his pen too long look and he was just looking at me like i d told him i was going to give up my education screw english and become a stripper jacques eyes bulge on the first date i really felt like asking jacques if he needed a megaphone or if he thought he d said it loud enough trust me i said buttering my toast even though the toast wasntwhole wheat and butter is like a load of pure fat he was a perfect gentleman about it and you let him asked jacques irritably as if once again he was trying to talk me out of throwing away my education and becoming a stripper it not as if he pounced on me and i responded with all righty then force your tongue on me you just let him kiss you not just kiss make out with you on the first date okay the truth is not even my father acts like this it rather obvious that my mother never acted like this because she never cared who i was dating and why my father was always just like have a nice time honey dontget back too late on my way out the door nobody ever gets this frigid over my love life except jacques right now seriously nobody gives a crap it not like we were doing under the table i said disregarding the look of utter disgust on jacques face i am beginning to think that jacques has a very low opinion of me maybe he wouldnt be surprised if i told him i was going to throw away my education and become a stripper i told you already i said wondering if i could perform an exorcism on jacques and make him a believer michael was a perfect gentleman the entire time how could he have been a gentleman and still have the audacity to try to make out with you on the first date asked jacques completely befuddled like einstein theory of relativity had just been disproved or something ridiculous was not even real first date as we already mostly know each other and have been talking forever so obviously purpose of date was not further talking ridiculous also as if jacques thinks we have not kissed before though obviously didnttell him about mr turner office situation well you d know if i told you about my date but i not going to tell you about my date so i guess you ll never know i said picking up my things and getting ready to leave jacques is going to drive himself absolutely batty about this one i can already tell 9 30 a m even if i not disclosing the intimate details of my date with michael to jacques i might as well write them down so i can relive them over and over and over again at will my date with michael turner episode one after i left ren e sitting in my room reading my copy of hp royally flushed still wearing the screw me shoes mind you i slipped out into hogsmeade it was actually really nice outside i mean it was sort of cold but not freezing cold and everything was really still and quiet and dark and it was just the moon up in the sky practically no stars and it was kind of windy but not too windy it was just perfect you know because on the intersection of vesta and orion where michael had told me to wait for him it was completely silent which had me kind of wondering for a second whether or not some serial killer would come out and slit my throat but whatever so i was waiting on the intersection of vesta and orion when suddenly this figure just appears walking straight down the road without any fear of brooms crashing into him and crushing his bones or whatever and walks up to me and was just like are you ready of course this fantastic figure in black was michael looking sexy and dashing as ever in a really bond james bond kind of way really what i will never understand is why hogsmeade was so quiet and still it was only eight o clock but it seemed like it was midnight the way all the street lights were on but nobody was around but anyway when michael asked me if i was ready i was just breath taken so i just wordlessly followed him as he led me into this bar and this was just too odd to be coincidence the bar was completely empty too so i looked over at michael to get his reaction and he was just smiling sweetly at me in this adorable romantic way i know it may have killed the moment but for like a split second i seriously thought was what i was thinking before was right maybe michael was an evil serial killer and he was going to hold me hostage and lure harry out here saying that if he didntcome i d die and then he was going to kill harry and help lord v return to power or something but then the violins started up and then the piano and then michael led me through this door and there was a string quartet and a concert pianist sitting on a stage in the front of this absolutely gorgeous room that was completely covered in rose petals and swathed in white i wanted to throw my arms around this michael turner and snog him until he could no longer retain the capacity to speak but i restrained myself do you like it he whispered and seriously at that very moment i really really couldntthink of any words to say at least any words that made a modicum of sense after i regained the power of speech i just turned to him and said such a stupid question any idiot could tell that this is probably the best thing that ever happened to me and i suppose that was his cue to lean over and kiss me yay so after the epic kiss of the century he took out his wand and swished it around this sounds really odd but i meant the magical instrument oh damn that sounds odd too but you know what i mean and then flowers just started sprouting and then this dinner table appeared with approx fifty billion courses on it i stared blankly like a dumb animal and he had to lead me over and pull out my chair and everything why is michael so damn thoughtful i mean most other boyfriends would drag me down to a pub and not even pay for my drink i know he did drag me down to a pub but it wasntreally a pub it was a romantic site that was posing as a pub why is he so wonderful digress okay not only were there really freakishly expensive looking napkins and glasses and centerpieces there was caviar and escargot i was just like yay i can get my french ness on there was bouillabaisse galore and all sorts of other soups and filet mignon and i took a deep breath and thought fleur prepare to fall off the abs diet there was not a raspberry instant oatmeal or extra strength whey powder in sight did you do all this or did you fly someone in to cater this or something i asked kind of gaping i have never seen so much food in my entire life i mean when there are only two people who are prepared to eat it i was beginning to think that we should invite the string quartet and the pianist to come eat with us which was selfishness working because i didntwant to fall that far off the abs diet yeah actually i kind of just checked out some recipes and conjured a bunch of stuff up and hired the musicians he said pointing to mr string quartet and mr piano man i mean that is just ridiculously hot my boyfriend did all of it sure it not as if he slaved away over a hot oven cooking all of this crap but he did spend a bunch of time conjuring it up and decorating and with the flowers and the whole illusion of oh honey i just thought this sleazy pub would be nice for our first date which he had running for a bit will not tell him about serial killer suspicions i looked at the musicians he was pointing to so what exactly do they play michael smiled fantastic fantastic fantastic and made some incomprehensible signal at them and then mr older than flitwick violinist started playing usher caught up i was just like oh my eff i am watching a mini orchestra play usher did i mention that michael was looking sexy in a tuxedo that has nothing to do with anything but i just like saying that so then we started talking as the mini orchestra switched up to destiny child lose my breath which was drastically appropriate considering i had totally forgotten how to breathe and was thinking damnation fleur we should have worn an effing dress and you know the conversation was great it was crazy because i was thinking that it would be all awkward but it was easy to talk to him and we talked about everything as we were eating our fantastic dinners and listening to the mo play disco inferno from defense against the dark arts theory to music to america to alfie the giant squid that last topic made me want to segue into jude law but i resisted since michael is hotter than jude law ever was i think i might actually have a nice boyfriend for once 10 12 a m i am beginning to wonder what jacques and ren e do all day while i sitting through my classes i am not sure i want to know since they probably get up to all sorts of mischief as a matter of fact jacques and ren e could be having an illicit affair and i wouldntknow because i sitting through classes all day long i hope jacques and ren e arenthaving an affair because that would scar me for life then again it is very probable because ren e is always alluding to me having a secret affair with jacques which might just be her way of letting out her passion for my best friend it just the kind of thing that is discussed in my newest book am i fat the psychology of today women 11 30 a m i am as always reading during care of magical creatures am i fat the psychology of today women is a surprisingly insightful book which is enabling me to understand my motivations as well as the motivations of others to do what they do with luck i ll be able to understand ren e and my mother for that matter when is jacques going to tell me the solution to all of my problems 12 noon all right jacques has just told me the solution to all of my problems i think it was pretty stupid of me not to realize this solution because it pretty elementary i must go visit my mother now no duh right jacques believes i should wait a bit for my mother to exhaust this new phase ness in her life before i charge in there and say mother this isntyou be you which he supposes should take about a month so in april i am going to have to charge off and spend time with my family 5 05 p m you re effing kidding me i ve gained back a pound i ve got to stop eating so much wait no i should eat more why does the abs diet conflict so much with traditional dieting methods 6 45 p m aac name fleur delacour height five foot seven and a recently acquired i am gaining height at an alarming rate ever since i incorporated calcium and protein into my diet weight 126 damnation i bob up and down like some sort of freakish buoy hair blonde eyes blue lust situation i am too in love with michael to lust after anyone else hm i lurve him cyber boyfriend were you just not paying any attention at all when i discussed how freakishly wonderful michael is god what is the point of my pouring out my heart when you dontpay any attention michael is the best favorite class sf charms and that may never change least sf potions because snape has been taking sleaze lessons and has moved up to level 3 sleaziness soon he will be teaching the class himself pilates minutes 17 orlie thinking minutes 40 jude thinking minutes 28 hp thinking minutes 10 hg glares 1 odd slytherin draco malfoy winks 302 overall lust to love ratio 2 to 9 overall day i in a euphoric state because of my lovely date last night so absolutely nothing can go wrong day forty five of free independence monday march 2 nd in potions 7 43 am 7 43 a m this is very odd dumbledore has requested my presence in his office oh god this is like lupin isntit didnthe say that teacher teacher relationships while not prohibited were frowned upon oh damn someone has told him about me and michael i should just start crying and apologizing 8 35 a m i didnteven get to start crying and apologizing before dumbledore got right down to the reason he had called me into his office ms delacour you have been at this school for oh a month and a half is that correct i just nodded wondering when the appropriate time to start crying and apologizing would be now that he d gotten his little intro to why we re here started well then i should say that i have given you more than ample time to decide which class it is that you wish to co teach dontyou think i nodded my head and swallowed hard i suck at everything my idea of being an assistant teacher was running around fetching cauldrons when the actual teacher was too lazy teaching that just asking way too much from a girl who doesntpay attention during class and has no real academic skills the only thing i was remotely good at in school was charms but you know flitwick is nice enough i could choose his class i would like for you to choose a class by the end of the day said dumbledore amiably lemon drop no thank you i said uncomfortably after which i promptly dashed out of the room to go hover in my own room skiving off all my classes of the day thinking about what on earth i supposed to do which is what i doing now of course 9 05 a m different classes and their pros and cons by f delacour arithmancy pro saying oh yes mother i ve gotten a job teaching arithmancy carries a bunch of weight nobody actually knows what arithmancy is but they re always pretending they do so they re not going to go asking you questions about it for fear of being exposed as a fraud however they ll be very impressed when realize that you actually understand it con i have no idea what arithmancy is even though i ve been sitting in on classes i always use arithmancy to read my self help books because i know that even if i listened i wouldntunderstand jacques did arithmancy in school and tried to explain it to me once and i had a headache for two days that how i know it over my head care of magical creatures pro i actually know something about comc i know what the uses of the animals are and what they do and how they act and such well most of the time con i am always either skipping out on care of magical creatures or reading one of the trashy books from the athena o hereagall romantic book club during it also the gamekeeper does not like me that much charms pro professor flitwick is nice and i actually have some charms aptitude for the most part i do pay attention in this class i make extraordinary effort to pay attention in his class and have even improved my fire setting skills hence poor underwear boy from my conversation with ren e con well michael doesntteach that class other than that i cannot think of anything wrong with this class at all defense against the dark arts pro michael teaches this class and i get to see him looking really sexy all the time pacing around the class in his abnormally sexy pants giving lectures also this is harry best class and he looks abnormally sexy in this class too all knowledgeable and concentrating con michael expects me to pay a ridiculous amount of attention in this class i am sure for example he might feel slighted if i decided to read seduction in soho during his class or something he will need constant validation for his sexiness besides i will always feel as if he is noticing me checking out harry while he talking about unforgivable curses and then sometimes i zone out and think about i dontknow the two of them doing random battle and i dontthink he realizes that i am thinking about how hot he is and may think that i am just not paying attention because i dontcare and i do divination pro there are no pros at all to this class the most pointless class ever wait i am for the most part always able to ignore everything professor treloony says and do other things like make lists con professor trelawney is an evil hag who is wicked to me and pebbled me she makes me stop making lists to do mundane tasks such as picking up teacups filled with tealeaves she is constantly predicting my death and i know she is an evil fraud harry is not even in her class so i would fully like to see the point history of magic pro professor binns never asks me to do anything probably doesntnotice that i am alive so i can always sleep or read during his class actually i read and sleep during a surprising amount of my classes con i always fall asleep in this class even against my will and then draco comes over and whispers obscenities in my ear so much worse than sexcretary also there is always the chance of a repeat of the neville incident and i might unwittingly fall asleep on some other student and though he is sexy beyond belief i dontbelieve i could bear falling asleep on harry is my lust for him back on i do believe it turned off after jacques and my mother got involved in my life again but is it now back on potions pro none none none con snape is a disgusting sleazebag who is only interested in getting out his years of pent up sexual frustration by unlike normal sleazebags who would just watch porno on the internet hitting on me constantly he is constantly unfair to harry and treating him like crap and demeaning him when in actuality he is a pretty okay potions student because he favors the slytherins so draco has a ridiculous amount of confidence in this particular class and finds it totally okay to hit on me just as much as snape does transfiguration pro at least mcgonagall is a fair teacher and is kind to harry con she notices when i reading smut during her class so i can never get away with doing anything but paying rapt attention however if i her assistant and i mess up she will yell at me and then i will probably cry 12 15 p m have just recounted the entire list of different classes and their pros and cons to jacques and he says that i should go with flitwick since i have some expertise in that area and because the teacher is nice i would have thought you would have dada as your first choice since you re seeing the teacher and all he said he does not understand about my entire dilemma with michael and harry because i left out that part it not as if jacques wouldntlaugh uproariously at my unrequited lust for harry potter as he was saying this harry was coming in from quidditch practice harry never looks better than when he just come in from quidditch practice jacques was talking about the advantages of charms and his confusion as to why i didntmake a greater effort to display the pros of defense when he realized i wasntlistening so he just turned around saw harry and snapped his head back around oh i see is that the problem with dada god fleur if you canttake the heat get out of the kitchen but if i leave the kitchen that doesntchange the fact that there something cooking i said absentmindedly staring at harry as he wiped a bead of sweat from his forehead shag me you know on harry sweat does not look like something gross your body does to keep you cool it looks like something fantastic your body does to make you look even more fantastic i sure this only applies to males because when i sweat it sort of nasty fleur jacques said decidedly all you think about is sex head swivel instantly offended that is not true how could you possibly insinuate that all i think about is sex i think about tons of other things oh come on fleur your mind is like one of those smutty books you re always reading everything revolves around sex jacques said firmly counterpoint how can my world revolve around sex if i haventeven had it yet i exclaimed triumphantly absolutely infuriated and probably talking too loudly grrr the nerve of jacques thinking that all i think about is sex he ll see well you spend hours on end obsessing about your boyfriend which basically amounts to sex you spend hours upon hours obsessing over movie stars and that basically amounts to sex the selection of your classes is being delayed because of one little issue sex every single book you read is about one thing sex you ve even said the guys you date are assholes but you keep seeing them for one reason sex your entire life is sex i was ready to beat jacques with a stick by this point in time jacques how can the reason that i date the guys i date be about sex if i never have sex with them you re all about sexual attraction fleur said jacques loudly i was beginning to feel as that if i tried to beat jacques with a stick he d find a tree and shove me into it well jacques it not like you re this perfect little celibate angel if you think all i think about is sex then you re being a huge huge hypocrite i retorted jacques shook his head at me look i think about substance too which is more than i can say for you most of the time you donteven know harry potter and you barely know michael that is outside of enough jacques if you think you can claim that you think about substance i have one freaking word for you gretchen you can take your hypocrisy and your lectures and your theory and shove them right up your hey ms delacour could you pass the salt some pointless third year yelled at me get it yourself shrimp i yelled and promptly stormed out of the great hall leaving jacques with his mouth wide open behind me 3 07 p m i have no fuh reaking clue what is the matter with jacques lately it like he been possessed by this argumentative demon he not even right about the fact that i only think about sex is he 3 12 p m have spent last 5 minutes going through journal using excruciating analyzing skills worthy of sherlock homes and doctor watson numbers variations on the word sex 67 variations on the word lust 41 variations on the world hot 59 harry 68 michael 221 boyfriend 53 overall number of words implying sex obsession 509 oh my god jacques was right i am obsessed with sex 5 45 p m walked somberly into great hall for dinner head hung with shame jacques i said solemnly you re right i am sex obsessed i am a planet and sex is the sun my entire life revolves around it i am shallow and superficial and now jacques i am repentant forgive me for wasting your time talking incessantly about sex even though i didntrealize i was doing it jacques looked at me as if he had just seen me rise from the dead which might as well be true as i have transcended my sex obsessed half life what and i have decided just to prove to you that i am leaving this sex obsession behind i am not as you may have previously suspected going to choose defense against the dark arts as a means to selfishly fulfill my hedonistic desires but instead have decided to do potions as a testament to how much i have changed i said in a very business like manner jacques choked on his sandwich and then said what i believe to be a few japanese curse words before talking to me what and subject yourself to sexual harassment day in and day out i cantlet you do that no jacques i have already made up my mind i must do potions not only to prove that i am not sex obsessed but as a means to reach the top of the jungian tree of self actualization i must be all i can be and in order to self actualize i must face adversity and better myself through that course i dontgive a damn i believe you you re not sex obsessed whatever do not choose potions said jacques almost as firmly as he had said that all i thought about was sex your betterment through the adversity of sexual oppression that masochism that faust selling his soul to the devil for the chance to experience life with superhuman knowledge and power forget experiencing life with the superhuman knowledge and power that comes from not being obsessed with sex do not go and work with the devil jacques it doesntmatter i ve already told dumbledore i confess to which jacques says something that sounds like a mixture of cuso benjo and the f word well i sure dumbledore will let you switch courses if you file a sexual harassment suit but if you are forced to endure sexual subjugation by one of those disgusting slytherins and you want me to contact the ministry or dismember someone or something you just tell me okay jacques i said smiling faintly i pretty sure the slytherins wontforce me to endure sexual subjugation but if they do i ll either set them on fire or call you okay it funny how jacques switches between being a total jackass and a concerned sweetheart you re the best you know that and i bent down and gave him a kiss on the cheek damn i hungry i barely ate any dinner day forty six of free independence monday march 3 rd in potions 8 26 am 8 26 a m i dontthink i ever really realized that being the potions assistant meant that i would have to stay in the potions classroom for an inordinate amount of time and have potions period after period after period god it like these students have nothing better to do than sit in potions and mix bad smelling things you dontwant to know how many students have dropped their green goop on my shoes and let it sit there long enough for me to tell that no this isntdraught of peace this is draught of burn a fricking hole in fleur fricking shoes good god i may die of having to go around checking to make sure that the potions are actually correct knowing that none of them are because all of them are bright green when they should be light pink nobody in any of these frickafracking classes has any idea how to properly mix draught of peace which any idiot knows how to do especially me because how the heck else do you think i got through les breakups avec fernando aaron zachary ivan neal and lex god how hard is it not to put the frog leg in the potion until the very last fricking step you fricking idiots breathe fleur breathe think of something pleasant like the ending of ever after or something 9 00 a m i am still in potions i not leaving the dungeons until lunch god snape has time to have his dirty way with me during transition if he wanted to jacques was right and i didntlisten i am so not made for potions charms was calling which i instead ignored in favor of a class whose teacher jacques compared to mephistopheles from faust oh hell they re leaving once all the students leave i will be alone in this dungeon with snape this is always the part in my smutty books where the heroine finds herself backed up against the wall by her wealthy but wicked employer benefactor sick stepfather who then tells her that either she submits or he kills her family yanks his money out of her family farm gets her disowned god i hope snape doesntkill my family i hate ren e but she my sister and i love her you know 9 30 a m thank god all he did was tell me that i ought to wear my hair up more often presumably to avoid any hideous accidents which leave me bald though he gave no actual spoken reason for this preference merely a head to toe review of the current state of fleur before this class at breakfast jacques asked me to tell him every off topic thing snape said to me and i suppose i shall have to report that to him too god i hope snape doesntgive jacques cause to contact the ministry or kill him or something because jacques would totally kill him when fernando cheated on me the next day at pretty sticks jacques broke his nose it was sort of unfortunate because fernando had a very nice nose but he was a wicked scumbag anyway 11 30 a m harry class is filing in now oh wicked wicked fate why do you toy with me so testing me to see if my heart is true i ve already pledged to give up my life of hedonism please give me at least a mini break 12 05 p m i swear to god i want draco malfoy to die i hope jacques breaks his perfectly shaped nose and then snaps his fingers one by one and then strangles him to death slowly as if this entire day hasntbeen merde dans un seau i was walking around in agony looking at the potions and making sure they were at least all the right color when draco malfoy goes fl ms delacour and he says my name like i a stripper and he calling me over to put money in my underwear by the way what was my mother thinking naming me fleur i mean flower no i totally dontstrip in my spare time i cantread this footnote he said he was pointing at the most miniscule writing i had ever seen at the very bottom of page 412 the page on veritaserum textbook authors can be such jerks so i peer at this footnote to no avail as it absolutely impossible to read so i lean in closer it still absolutely tiny so i lean in closer and then i can finally read what it says it says look up so i look up just to see what the hell draco thinks this means so i jerk my head up and then draco fricking kisses me i completely spazzed out what the hell was that you pervert i shrieked wiping my mouth on my sleeve the little jackass was smiling what do you think that was fun for me you blonde haired pale skinned freak va te faire enculer connard putain de merde je ne te croix pas quel con i think by this time the entire class realized that i was cursing after a bit more of cursing i regained my composure flipped my hair and hissed in draco general direction draco you psychopathic narcissistic self absorbed half wit you re a fricking mannequin and that why you disgust me you re too fricking pale you re too fricking skinny and you ve got a fricking pole right up your ms delacour shouted snape and if you ever do that again i will personally see to it that after defense against the dark arts today every single bone in your body is broken fractured or removed you got that freak ms delacour said snape sternly because he seemed to think that saying my name will automatically shut me up oh shut up you self important git i said whirling around on snape who looked about ready to spank me we both know that you just get a kick out of making me pick up crap and you can go blah blah curses blah just like draco over there okay and no i will not be your sexcretary you fricking sex offender and that was my first day of potions 2 07 p m i am so not going back to potions you cannot fricking make me i am taking the day off 4 39 p m i have now fully cooled down from this morning total spaz but it was totally justified seeing as how draco malfoy stuck his tongue down my throat okay maybe not so cooled down 6 15 p m i have just finished recounting the events of this morning potions class to jacques and michael and they want to take turns breaking draco face michael in his fury is very happy that i yelled at draco so thoroughly hey what does enculer mean anyway before i can answer jacques clears his throat and says just think of a word that begins with f and ends with u c k and i didnttell draco to go firetruck himself if that what you re thinking i mumbled into my bouillabaisse please let me break his face said michael if you do you ll get fired once lucius malfoy finds out about it i protested looking at jacques for backup support if michael gets fired there will be absolutely no point in my meaningless existence and i should just go to dumbledore and announce my resignation so let jacques break his face gladly said jacques giving draco table a very filthy look i would completely not be surprised if jacques actually went over there and hauled off and socked draco malfoy for violating my sanctity or whatever michael looked fairly upset at the prospect of not being able to do something to protect my honor which is understandable i ve read about how men are prone to feeling incompetent when a woman has to rely on another man to feel protected and safe not that i have to rely on jacques to feel protected and safe i just do sometimes you know we could all just take turns setting his feet on fire under the table i suggested so that michael would feel included michael and jacques both seemed to like this idea even though jacques really wanted to be violent he a pacifist but every once in a while he has to release his inner rage somehow that why he likes things like boxing and israeli hand to hand combat training like krav maga in the end we all went around in a little circle aiming spells for draco feet it was quite amusing watching him yelp and jump a little bit during the tales he was entertaining crabbe and goyle with well i know she wants me ow every four minutes and giving scathing glares over at our table where i just gave him a little wave what a thoroughly satisfying way to get a little revenge on that disgusting creature jacques still maintains that i should file a sexual harassment suit and sue the malfoys for all they re worth and michael is still encouraging me to forget about his job and let him slam his head in a car door see everyone likes that option but i continue to tell them to restrain themselves to doing little things like giving him second degree burns i ll get better revenge on him later day forty eight of free independence monday march 5 th in potions no fricking duh 9 40 am 9 40 a m i have returned to potions after my day and a half off and have told professor sleaze git that if he or any one of his students pulls any kind of crap today i will go to dumbledore or worse i will sue the pants off of him but you know he can keep his pants on and all and if he cantafford any after i ve finished with him i will graciously supply him with a pair he looks incredibly sour but that only because his student stuck his snakelike tongue in my mouth and he didntget a chance it like it says in the glass jockstrap the superiority of women to men my new favorite book we hold these truths to be self evident that all women are created equal and that all men are whores and it the gospel truth 10 20 a m so far i have gone through my classes without incident okay one mr stupid head in 4th year asked me to sample his happy potion that not what it called but i cantremember the actual name and that what it does anyway and it made me cough up blood oh yeah i bet snape thought i was really hot then 10 36 a m since when does harry class have potions at this time i am really tempted to run out of the door and hide in the bathroom but that would be childish of me wouldntit draco is coming in looking smug he flashes me a look and i swear he looks just so fernando right now i am so tempted to forcibly remove him from this room so that i can make him eat his wand whoa bad imagery there snape is giving a nice long lecture about the veritaserum potions they concocted the other day and how they were all crap i am forced to agree so he going to make them all drink each other potions to see what could have happened if they were out in the real world and effed up their potions like they did before of course neville has come down with some sort of illness or perhaps bashed his head in so i ll have to take someone in order to keep the balance snape just wants to interrogate me as to whether or not i want to let him into the candy shop and well you know the song 10 47 a m frick i ve gotten hermione potion and you know hers is like the only one in this entire batch that actually going to work damn damnity damn 10 50 a m now that we ve swallowed our potions we re going to ask other people probing questions and write down their reactions to test the relative strengths of the students veritaserum i get to ask harry questions because harry got neville potion does this make any sense i never could work out these group project dynamics hermione gets to question me and i have to question harry well there jacques looks like

your turn to answer questions and vice versa damn i get to go be viciously cross examined by bushy haired smart girl 11 30 a m well the interrogation didntgo as crappily as i thought it would

make me curse out loud q well then did it suck when draco kissed you or did you secretly enjoy it a oh god it was absolutely disgusting it was like swallowing a worm and then having the worm trying to find its way out but this worm is a blind worm and keeps going the wrong way there is no way i could ever even think about that kiss with even a modicum of enjoyment q are you dating professor turner a yes yes yes yes yes q how that a it new but so far it is beyond fantastic q but doesntprofessor turner have a problem with that guy who follows you around all the time a oh that just jacques mais non non non non non jacques is my very best friend and he doesntfollow me around all the time he great i mean yes in the beginning michael was just like yeah he got to stay away from you but now he

you know window shopping or something q window shopping a window shopping just in case you decide to return the things you bought you have to window shop so i window shopping q okay thanks a you re welcome that was very truth or dare esque of you well see it wasnt total merde but i think she combined the instructions for veritaserum with the instructions for babbling potion why else would i say the word hot and non so many times despite suspicions i am beginning to think that maybe just maybe hermione granger could be okay 5 44 p m ack seamus fidgety frick is over at his table talking about how he overheard me comparing kissing draco to having a blind worm in my mouth grrr what else did they overhear day fifty of free independence monday march 7 th freaking in the dungeons 11 29 am 11 29 a m ack ack ack professor snape has just asked to see me after class and i ve no frickafracking idea what on earth to do i not quite sure if he wants to harass me or something and cantdo it in public or something 12 noon you ll never believe what snape has asked me to do i mean it not like he actually asked me to give him a guided tour of the muffin factory or anything because if snape ever even said the words muffin factory to me michael would remove his innards and jacques would string a guitar with them no it was nothing like that but he asked me to do something so ridiculously ironic that i just know fate wants me to be sex obsessed just needs me to be sex obsessed snape and dumbledore want me to give harry private potions lessons when he told me this i was tempted to ask him if he just wanted me and harry to have sex on tape or something because that is just what private potions lessons sounds like this is even crappier than i cantmake it i have private tutoring sessions with jacques i know you re thinking so what with the quotation marks around potions indicating that it not really potions you ll be giving harry private lessons in so i going to satisfy your curiosity by telling you exactly what i ll be giving harry lessons in alternative self protection what i want to know however is why exactly snape seems to think i am the person to instruct harry in means of alternative self protection in the dead of the night yeah michael we cantgo out on a second date any time soon i so sorry but i have teach harry potter alternative self protection around eight ish tonight and we may be up all night so i dontknow if that opera we were going to fits into my plans oh yeah michael will love that 1 05 p m i asked jacques what he thought alternative self protection could be defined as jacques looked me right in the eye and said it means they want you to teach harry to use genetic gifts to get out of trouble and why the hell would d door and snappy want me to teach harry about using his genetic gifts to get out of trouble i responded stuffing a rather large cookie in my mouth fleur you really are dull sometimes sighed jacques taking a shamrock shaped green cookie from the plate between us i cantbelieve you think i dull ren e who had been sitting there watching me eat in utter disgust finally spoke up stop complaining you big loser he just told you you re hot i just shook my head at her in confusion i donteven i canteven you re just absolutely she right you know jacques said getting up taking the enormous plate of cookies with him men are so inconsiderate maybe i wanted to eat the rest of those cookies or maybe ren e who am i kidding ren e doesnteat wishful thinking 4 09 p m if i have no clear idea of what alternative self protection is then how am i supposed to properly train harry in it you know starting tonight from what jacques seems to think all i d have to do is sit harry down explain to him that his hotness is like a gun walk out and that it but you see first i d have to tell harry that he hot i very glad michael does not know about this alternative self protection thing 5 55 p m michael knows about the alternative self protection thing he says that d door had a good long talk with him right after breakfast and asked him whether or not he wants to teach it with me you know add some aspects of defense theory in with my lessons or whatever i have to offer as if there is a secret book of veela passed down through generations sitting up on a bejeweled stand in my room with chapters called seducing dark lords and escaping through fishnets it infuriates me that michael knew about this before i did and didnttell me anything about it so i had to get my 411 from snape good god and if harry kidnapped by some assassin and taken off to the mountains to be killed quietly and have his body buried underneath a willow tree then what good is sex appeal going to do him hey mister assassin sir i getting all sweaty would you mind if i casually take my shirt off in a seductive way right because your abs shall set you free harry your abs shall set you free 6 00 p m damnation i have two hours before i supposed to scamper down to the dungeons where snape is so graciously allowing us to hold our potions classes and teach harry how to go around seducing people just another case of people thinking i just like my sister 6 30 p m jacques is up in my room now knowing i d freak out 1 hour and 30 minutes before the beginning of this treacherous lesson i have tried to convey to him my emotions regarding my feelings of incompetence when it comes to casual seduction but he is not having it well what about when you came to hogwarts for the triwizard cup and some five million people asked you to be their date for the yule ball i think we can safely call that mass charm says jacques he is actually quite endearing when he is trying to convince me that i possess even an iota of animal magnetism so you ve said it yourself i was a haughty snotty bitch who disrespected everyone and everything in sight but still found time to run around toying with the affections of others i was like ren e ber clone or something i was bitter and awful jacques gave me a meaningful look as though he was the director of picture perfect telling jennifer aniston about the subtleties of her character and finally having come up with the perfect metaphor well then there you go there your inspiration ren e the super slut oh jacques now if they sold that in bed bath beyond that would so be in the beyond department well this entire alternative self protection thing belongs in the beyond department doesntit he replies giving me yet another meaningful look though this one looks more like the director getting back good reviews and looking at his wife like you knew i was right didntya honey oh and we both know he is so what the point in even putting up a fight 10 45 p m okay it may not be the dead of the night but it pretty late and i ve just gotten back from my first alternative self protection lesson michael was there so it wasnt un tas de merde he was already educated on the subject having done some background study in the field the hell so he spent some time at least attempting to train me and harry at the same time though he did think i had some natural aptitude blah i scattering about with this lesson let me start at the beginning okay so first i walked in the door at which point i saw harry and michael standing there staring at the door it was kind of odd seeing them standing side by side because though they were both kind of slouching i could see very clearly that harry is tall i dontknow why i haventnoticed this before he like the same height as michael which is like four full inches taller than me and i dontknow when i had time to figure this one out when i was supposed to be walking through the door nts work diligently on sex obsession so michael said okay fleur now that we re here we can all get started i really wanted to make fun of him for sounding so much like a teacher but then i realized hey you are a teacher and decided not to at the risk of sounding inescapably stupid so out of pure unadulterated curiosity i asked michael soooo what is alternative self protection anyway harry seemed slightly taken aback that i his co instructor had no idea what i was supposed to instruct him in but he didntsay a thing michael grinned it a means of protecting oneself without using magic or violence okay well just to clarify things does sex have anything to do with this because jacques seems to think that this whole thing has something to do with sex so i d just like to formally know does this little lesson thing here have anything to do with sex michael glowered a bit sex is probably all jacques thinks about he said and isntthat ironical i was horrified when he continued and in a way he right kuso asp has a lot to do with using personal presence and charm to in a way protect oneself you mean like how the dumb henchmen in halcius pottotius royally flushed fell for it when flora was like hey boys come open up my cell so we can make this jailhouse rock michael looked at me like he had never heard me use a sexual euphemism before which i must admit he hadn t well yes sort of he said hm and what do you want me to do i asked because at the time i was thinking what could i do lend harry a long string of very trashy books make him sit down and watch a couple of episodes of xena warrior princess and some tapes of my favorite shows that i never saw but like 4 times like 2525 and jack of all trades with that ridiculous english lady and the uptight french general who looked like he d accidentally scratched his watch and wound his butt or something well michael cleared his throat as if he were going to divulge something indelicate dumbledore and various other members of staff assumed that you might be experienced in these fields oh ho i see i said walking slowly towards michael you and your little staff buddies think i just like my ho bag sister dontyou fleur we dontthink you re a ho bag said michael and we dontmean to objectify you in anyway we just assumed that as a contemporary young lady of your structure you might be wise to some of the means such contemporary young ladies employ in order to further themselves in society and in other aspects of life thank you michael i said smiling and i realize that what you just said is a dressed up version of sex sells and we know who selling it but i appreciate you trying to pg that i appreciate you appreciating my efforts said michael in a very sexy way which and i dontknow why made me look at his tie i really didntrealize until that very moment that michael tie was just kind of hanging lose around his neck and his top button was unbuttoned at this point i had to mentally kick myself and go stop that stop that stop that no thinking about that and i appreciate you appreciating my appreciating so harry interjected what about this asp i could at least answer this question you need to learn it because everyone in the world is afraid you ll die ooh was that too frank i have a distinct feeling that that was too frank okay said michael cutting in to my rant on harry mortality fleur what do you think we should start with today i could totally see michael just worming his way out of having to actually start the teaching himself it a pity because i think he d have no problem exploring the fields of asp well harry i going to tell you something that my very very intoxicated grandmother once told me when you are physically attractive it is the same thing as owning a gun you must use your weapon wisely we are going to teach you how exactly you abuse your weapon and break several gun laws are you ready for this harry nodded clearly deciding to ride the wave of this absurdity okay i said i going to begin by telling you harry something that will make you michael go screaming all over the place with absolute infuriation harry you re hot michael seemed to be struggling to keep his composure which was just evidence that he actually likes me and isntjust pretend liking me to further his plans to kill harry and help lord v mort return to power you re not just hot you re sexy as okay fleur that enough said michael finally seizing me roughly by the shoulders and walking me away from harry see that is the kind of thrilling thing that f nando never did it was really nice because michael smells really ridiculously good and i must admit that i did get a little carried away with telling harry he was attractive and now harry was blushing which was my fault i regained my self respect you know with the help of michael and his arms and continued my point is that you are one of the blessed of this world and if you re not going to use what god gave you isntthat just selfish michael was now grinning like some kind of crazy maniac but i didntgive a flying plate of shitake mushrooms because he had forgotten to take his hand off of my waist so fleur care to regale us with some stories of how you ve used asp to your advantage just to demonstrate how useful this skill really is i really dontbelieve this is real i think this is some sort of elaborate practical joke designed to make me out to be some sort of a fool but despite my suspicions i regaled them anyway erm well i once flirted with a guy on a train so i could get his window seat and he ended up sitting next to this 300 pound man with a flatulence problem instead i said recalling how i met the boyfriend before fernando ivan and i once flirted with a guy in a department store who ended up giving me an 80 percent discount on everything i was buying as far as life threatening goes well i made out with my old ex boyfriend lex to get the explosives out of his back pocket without him noticing see said michael happily asp does work i cantbelieve i taking a class in this harry said and personally i couldntbelieve i was teaching that class is there going to be homework only if you cantfind a way to asp your cute ass out of it i said to which michael gave me a sharp look seeing as how he had never heard me say the word ass before and as how i d just told harry that his was cute and so we spent the entire rest of the time instructing harry in the crucial business of just standing there looking unexpectedly hot even when you expected you would which surprisingly michael knows a lot about then again not so surprisingly after all he is ridiculously sexy damnation just thought about sex again a n the line i should just start crying and apologizing you may have noticed is from one of my favorite movies as well as fleur s mean girls keep a watch out for my next chappie i sorry i just happen to love the word chappie ever since someone on fictionalley said it expect much intrigue much lustification and much much more harry maniacal smiling ensues much love femme teriyaki further march luff labours lost day fifty one of free independence wednesday march 9 th having b fast with j 6 19 am 6 19 a m jacques wants to know how the asp session went last night and you can so tell that he trying to be all casual about when he really dying to know i conflicted as to whether or not i should actually tell him sure he already knows about the lessons so whatever but is it wise to tell him in public after yesterday debriefing sounds so wrong on asp i feel rather like a secret agent you know fighting the forces of evil one lesson at a time this could warrant code names and dead drop boxes and perhaps a secret handshake then again the only thing we did was teach harry how to stand in sexy positions so what sort of harm could i do by telling jacques we explained to him that not only is his body a temple but that it is also a weapon that is always loaded and ready to go we just need to teach him how to aim and fire i said showing jacques that i can come up with cute little metaphors and say them in a director ish voice too oh god said jacques you didntuse that metaphor did you he was grinning as if he already knew that i was going to smack him but didntcare very much anyway so even though i knew i wouldntget much satisfaction out of it since i wouldntbe smacking him properly i smacked him anyway yes i did use that metaphor and it went over quite well i might add oh snide one i said jacques was so sweet and accommodating when i first met him so i would fully like to know what major life event occurred to make him so so sarcastic i mean i know spending an inordinate amount of time with me might have something to do with it but whatever anything you said would have gone over well said jacques bluntly it a class that all about exploiting your looks anyway with just you and two guys one with raging hormones and one with what i would call an entirely too active imagination oh god jacques you silly frigid man i sighed trying to make my utter exasperation with the not so gentle men of today clear enough for jacques to see and absorb you know what even the point of this asp i mean he good enough at it without all this special training ren e took this opportune moment to arrive bringing a wave of absolutely disgusting perfume with her and what may i ask is asp i decided to ignore her and continue on with my conversation with jacques i mean last night it was evident that the entire thing was pointless because he has nothing to learn awkward sexual positions shouted ren e like a contestant on wheel of fortune trying to fill in the blanks while vanna white walks back and forth in her freakishly high heels amazing sensual pleasure oh my god you freak i said finally gaping at her what kind of scary schizoid maniac goes around screaming phrases like awkward sexual positions and amazing sensual pleasure at breakfast of course ren e does not care because all the seventh year boys got amazing sensual pleasure out of hearing her be all schizoid and such bah humbug 6 32 a m teaching the heroically gorgeous how to reap further benefits from their gorgeousness makes me depressed about my life progress i have just realized how fully unsuccessful i am sitting at a table where you ve got a clear view of hordes of successful ravenclaws does that do you i guess but i so unsuccessful that it becoming unbearable must solve immediately by finding root of problem hmm perhaps it is because i haventgotten any books on it yet when i arrived in london before i left for hogwarts i stopped in flourish and blotts and i saw this book called making a list checking it twice using positive thinking to get what you want which happened to be on sale that day for 4 galleons 2 sickles and 9 knuts looking back on it i probably should have bought that book regardless can extrapolate main message from title fleur delacour list of goals to be achieved by summer holidays 1 be sufficiently hot being hot encompasses a being wicked skinny la twiggy i actually hate her for starting the whole rail thin thing but whatever bygones are bygones think bmi of like 17 point 4 my best friend from 6th year you remember janine dontyou had a bmi of 17 4 and she was very thin super fit super toned for an entire week and a half she had abs which was very impressive considering the fact that she bobbed up and down between 99 and 100 pounds of course while she was my best friend i totally hated her at times because how can you not hate a thin fit girl with abs whose weight sometimes only has two digits anyhoo then i found out about bmis and told her that she was malnourished and she had a spaz and gained 2 pounds which made her still malnourished but i didnttell her that so whatever b being in the possession of a hot attitude la asp and working the skinny factor c maintain possession of hot boyfriend in order to further emphasize aforesaid hotness as equivalent of being card carrying member of hotness united 2 be self actualized with a full understanding of what psychological self actualization actually is this may requite asking jacques about jung and freud and all that other crap 3 reduce your american ness while you have tried to reduce this american ness it has not worked incredibly well evidence in numbers like 235 times that more times than you ve used michael name as if 25 times whatever 21 times duh 8 times overall american ness 289 awful 4 reduce overall profanity as striving to be graceful elegant catherine deneuve type character without a trace of foulness in her vocabulary very attractive to men etc 5 stop thinking so much about s e x 1 3 of everything i say is about sex this is bad 6 get better body image numbers fat 38 skinny 13 diet 42 weight 36 pound 22 thin 10 overall number of words implying weight obsession 125 not bad but could be better progress imperative 7 be less self centered it is very important not only to love yourself as witches in relationship ditches points out but also to realize that if you only focus on yourself you can never fully love another as true love true sacrifices notes do you want the numbers because trust me there are numbers i 1 583 267 me 376 myself 20 fleur 173 this includes the implied i in which sentences have no i but there is an am example am very fat hate self 6 of everything i say is about me 8 actually read hogwarts a history all the way through or or or what about emma i ve always kind of wanted to read that book ever since marie claude gave me a copy for my birthday 4th year but i never actually did i read about the woodhouse family and my reaction was very much blah blah blah there are no hot guys in this book only old people and twee meddling little girls what the point okay so my goal is to become well read 8 45 p m in potions j ai oubli la raison que je suis ici mais je sais qu il y avait une raison evil evil evilness and a bucket filled with sardines i simply am unable to recall whatever it was that made me harbor the desire to do potions when i could have been reveling in the supreme oldness of the world most supreme old person no seriously i really really like old people that kind of odd i know but i grew up around old people like my father mom grandm re jeanette who happens to be the second drunkest person i know and my mother dad grandp re gustav who is the overall drunkest person i have ever met now when you re like seven drunken people are really nice grandpa was very accommodating and a very sweet person when he was awake when he was sober he was just cranky so we traditionally left the door to the wine cellar open grandmother alcoholism just doesntmake any sense whatsoever however how did the delacour side of the family get so bad seriously my dad is as straight as an arrow as was his father before his tragic death so how did his mother become a raging drunk anyway grandm re jeanette is very drunk which makes her more interesting than grandma claire who bakes cookies and all that other boring grandmother y stuff i d rather have a drunk grandmother who tells me important stuff like fleur put those shoes away all that patent leather makes for a pretty good reflection and honey go tell your sister that her boyfriend is not edible would you 10 44 a m harry class is in here now he must think i very strange after last night come to think of it i mean overall what must his perceptions of me been in his life 1 i have uttered the phrase soooo sexy during one of his dada classes and quite noticeably one might feel the need to add 2 i have interviewed him and asked him about the inner workings of his mind as well as whether or not he thinks i fat 3 i have explained to him that he hot that his body should be used to his advantage and that he ll get out of doing any homework if he can asp his cute ass out of it i screwed also nosy slut 11 05 a m but what do you care you have a boyfriend a very hot boyfriend and with the power of asp you can get whatever it is that you want you know once you figure the whole thing out both asp and what you want exactement chill much fleur 11 15 a m oh merde he thinks i a freak doesnthe he must think i absolutely crazy or something god frick it i ve screwed up everything but there nothing to screw up because harry is not your boyfriend i way confused the mind reels when lunch 12 noon i dontthink i making any progress with my sex obsession problem well i have kind of stopped thinking of michael as a purely sexual object and i spent yesterday thinking about orlando bloom as an actor not as a shirtless hottie who should totally take his shirt off more often so i can have a giggle fit and fantasize and i spend less time thinking okay totally wouldntshag him but might shag him if there was no one else on the island but then there the fact that i keep on thinking about harry and you know in a kind of purely sexual way seriously all my sentences about harry are variations on harry hot sexy sweaty god i want his sex you know so maybe i just sex obsessed with harry god that wrong i need to go wash my soul out that it 12 15 p m i couldntfind a way to wash my soul out so i washed my hair instead 4 04 p m i wondering now what my ultimate mother figure drunken grandm re would say in a situation like this hm perhaps i should channel her or something for a moment of s ance like clarity grandm re if you were having sort of sick thoughts about a teenage hottie except for he was like three years younger than you and you had a boyfriend who was actually in the right age group for you and you know you should stop having a demi moore spastic moment and stick with your bruce willis how you would deal with or otherwise squelch these sick yet reoccurring thoughts cherie if the object of your affection is that gorgeous you should seize the day lock yourself in a closet with him and have your dirty way with him and then you can go shag your boyfriend okay chouchou now give your grandm re some bourbon whoa that totally didnthelp wait boy toy bundles of joy fleur bundles of joy okay that settles it no more talking to the imaginary grandma jeanette inside my head 6 13 p m dinner sucked like hell allow me to explain the suck fest that entered into my life the instant i was stupid enough to sit down to dinner with michael and his newest flunky ren e the cocaine junkie ack just the name makes me want to murder someone elle doit mourir cette putain m chante good god what gave her the right to completely throw herself at michael like that i mean what the bloody hell was that self control one of my books says that repeating mantras to oneself is a good way to keep yourself from going crazy and murdering your husband the author of this book agatha firebrick knows because she has almost murdered her husband on several occasions i completely relate to this feeling because i feel as if i would like to murder that evil tarte right now the whole paint thinner in the coffee thing is actually starting to look really good no seriously the entire dinner was so michael tell me about defense against the dark arts i mean i did it in school obviously but i didnthave a teacher like you to hold my attention and i didntget to get as up close and personal as you do and i just think that fascinating maybe you could show me that sometime and you know i just love teachers i mean i just think it so noble putting yourself out there so that other people can learn from you that really sweet sweet my bloody sister has crossed every single line dancing across each and everyone and shaking her butt in morality face i hope she gets what she bloody well deserves this is of course a right punch in the face 6 40 p m aac name fleur delacour height have finally hit five foot eight this makes me feel much better as everyone knows that the main requirement of models is to be tall and anything that i have in common with a model is good i think weight 125 i tell you i am a freakish buoy wasnti 125 the time before last i canteven rightly tell how much i weigh anymore this morning it was 120 and then five seconds later it was up to 127 and then after lunch it was 130 and i started weeping and just now it happens to be 125 so which one ought i to put down i think i ll average them all that comes to 125 pounds hmm that good i guess hair blonde eyes blue lust situation well i am quite too angry to be all slaggy and lust after people i d

malfoy winks 83 overall lust to love ratio 1 to 1 overall day aujourd hui c est tout chier day fifty eight of free independence monday march 16 th by the lake v close to spontaneous combustion 11 23 am 11 23 a m i have been a very annoying assistant all day i must confess and insisted on taking une petite break just now to well sit by the lake and stare at michael and ren e michael must just not have noticed that i here because he hasntsaid hello to me and seems to be overly focused on ren e all right the truth is i saw them out the window in the potions room and told snappy kins that i had to take a tinkle so now i out here behind a tree trying to make sure ren e doesntdo the dirty with michael which might be a little bit easier if you know he was aware of my presence oh well 11 27 a m what the ruddy hell she got her hands all over him damn her she clinging to his arm like it her life support they re walking around the lake and i sitting behind a tree all stalker like but i ve got a right i the girlfriend 11 30 a m what would grandm re say god i know she d have some sort of advice for me now fleur if you dontdo something now you ll end up like grace alone and living with your gay roommate move kiddo move well if grandm re thinks it what i should do who can deny the wisdom of a woman whose favorite pastime is drinking 11 32 a m merde still completely haventmoved what would i say oh michael i was just hiding in the bushes and i saw you and my ho bag sister walking around the lake so i thought gee fleur leave them alone together and you re screwed so i here now right because he totally wouldntrun away kicking and screaming i must find someway to play this cool have i learned nothing in effing asp okay well i must quite obviously not look like i was hanging around here jealously jealousy is not good at all besides it only kind of hot when guys are jealous men dontlike to be treated like possessions because it interferes with their perception of their wild untamed manliness also just like he cannot feel possessed i cannot allow him to believe that he has full possession of me i must show interest in something other than michael 11 33 a m jacques is here can i show interest in jacques hmm michael has shown evidence of suspicion over jacques who is undeniably sexy creature who cannot control aforementioned sexiness perhaps i shall laugh aimlessly with jacques and fawn over him while walking past michael and ren e and just casually notice them over my shoulder as i walking away with jacques yes 11 40 a m mission keep his interest was a success jacques agreed after much begging to be my pawn for a while and we walked around the lake just where michael and ren e were walking jacques was just like so i said tony there arentany bengal tigers in antarctica and i just started laughing hysterically we were doing the arm in arm thing so we looked very couple y you know kind of charles and camilla during the royal marriage type thing and we just walked by them and i didnteven give them a glance until i casually bumped into ren e shoulder turned around with jacques and said oh hey guys and turned around again at which point jacques made some mumbly comment that i could barely hear and i started laughing again michael had a bit of a deer in the headlights look going on so i think he got the message maybe now he ll leave the awful skank that is my sister alone 12 noon jacques has just now given me a long speech about how i oughtntto be manipulating my boyfriend because manipulation is something ren e would do well what else did you want me to do stand back and watch her throw herself at him i thought you were past all of this all the mind games jacques protested giving me a very stern look as if he was my big brother or something and besides you cantdrag me out every time your boyfriend cantkeep his hands off your sister sure i can and if you re supposed to be my best friend why cantyou do this for me out of sheer frustration i buried my face in my pillow god i dontknow why jacques and i get into all these bloody fights lately i mean really we re good friends we get each other but we re always fighting now and i donthave half a clue why but he seems to resent me or something it just like i dontknow jacques just sighed and sat down okay fleur if he spending every waking moment just gaping over ren e then maybe you should just call it quits with him and there he goes saying it like it the simplest thing in the entire fricking world call it quits i repeated stunned as anyone in their right mind would be at such a ludicrous suggestion jacques are you mad why would i subject myself to a life of utter loneliness good god he not the world fleur you could get another boyfriend in an instant so why are you sticking with one who doesntpay you any attention and is flirting with your sister your sister always going to do what your sister does you ve just got to choose a boyfriend who cares about you enough not to fall for all the crap she pulls okay so maybe he just not right for you but jacques he perfect for me jacques looked like he was only barely resisting the urge to roll his eyes so furiously that he could see the front of his brain fleur he may be smart he may be funny and sure you may think he attractive but that does not make him perfect for you oh my frick i thought i in for the superficiality is not the answer lecture jacques had gotten up again and was pacing a sure sign he was just about to get all philosophical and practical and you know how much i hate it when he gets all practical you know some days i think that jacques would be much more fun if he were drunk jacques just gave me a look like i know what you re thinking and sure whatever i get it but just listen okay and then he sat down again i swear i wanted to just yell choose one at him looked at me and said i know you think i being a complete prat right now but i ve got my reasons okay okay 2 45 p m poussi re has just arrived with a copy of independent women and their gradual disjunction from men and who says i need you is this some kind of hint hint anyway they re both from cousin louise who has just been jilted by her fianc e according to latest news from dad and is very pissed of at men at present i suppose that this would explain these books but whatever i going to start reading who says i need you because that title is so much more interesting 3 02 p m back in potions for some unknown reason i am just now realizing how utterly disgusting snappers is looking today and every day for that matter hmm am feeling generous today after rescuing boyfriend from clutches of wicked sister perhaps will give professor snape a big fat extreme makeover necessary procedures in giving snape a bfem by f delacour 1 find some way to make him wash his hair greasiness is unsettling there are some truly wonderful hydrating shampoos that can strip away some of that buildup 2 put him on strict meal plan i suspect him of having some form of anemia pale skin awful fingernails can all be cured with folic acid etc 3 ugh we must find a way to make him look less gothic schoolmaster i mean sure whatever you re a teacher dontget carried away with it must take the creep shopping perhaps for color 5 05 p m harry class is in here now damn why am i so weird about this i should not be having such a monumental spaz every single time i see that pillar of pure attraction damn damn damn stop being obsessed with sex fleur damn why is everything so fricking confusing okay i fine 5 13 p m but now harry looking really good i mean my boyfriend is hotter than can be believed but really harry looks very very nice that was a stupid choice of words nice is one of those words that means everything like putain putain means every bad word i can think of it great super versatile but at least with putain no matter what they re saying you know it not very nice with nice it so confusing so do you like the people you work with oh yeah they re nice nice is a word you use when you cantthink of anything else nice to say nice can be replaced with anything i may say someone is nice but i may mean oh yeah she a bitchy harlot who should be face down in a river as opposed to screwing up my life like so so what are you supposed to think when i describe someone as nice what i meant was that harry looks very hot right now he is fully on the hotness plateau what on earth is the hotness plateau you say disgusting mildly repulsive not hideous average pretty okay looking cute rather attractive hot sexy ridiculously sexy that is the official fleur hotness scale the hotness plateau is from cute to the halfway point between hot and sexy once you get past that halfway point you re no longer on the hotness plateau you re on the hotness mountain from pretty okay looking to not hideous is the prairie of mediocrity after not hideous you re in the valley of repulsion of the four hot zones i can surely say that harry is on the hotness plateau and climbing the hotness mountain he scaling that mountain and looking down on those in the prairie of mediocrity but of course he so far away he can barely see the unfortunates in the valley of repulsion naturally i am at the bottom of the hotness mountain fruitlessly chucking rocks at his feet screaming stop if you climb any higher i ll die 5 20 p m harry should be forbidden to look so wonderful i am fully trying to not be a sex addict over here because hello i should think the hormone years are over now i mean i nineteen right and nineteen is practically twenty and twenty is practically twenty one and twenty one means you can by this time drive smoke have legal sex and drink all across the world and a person who can drive smoke have legal sex and drink is what i would call an adult and an adult would not be having these very inappropriate and unprofessional thoughts about their student because the years of hormonal crushes and sex obsession are the years of adolescence and i practically an adult as an adult i have the right to contribute to this society and i say that i should be able to proclaim harry sexiness fully illegal look at him he inviting my attention he is just asking for it now and damn snape and his horrible hair and complexion and the fact that he is blocking my view will drive me crazy until the end of time 5 45 p m came back to the room and found a bright purple book sitting on my bed naturally i figured it was cousin louise trying to tell me that all men are scum and that i should just become a lesbian while i still have the chance oh louise how i ve tried actually it was the asp handbook by karamus hooking who knew that asp was actually a legitimate course 6 13 p m am one and a half chapters into the asp handbook which is truly a fascinating book karamus hooking is bloody brilliant and moreover damn sexy would very much like to meet him at a book signing and have a casual snog in a v ren e type way then we cantbase judgment on the about the author flap can we even if there is a picture my my am backsliding into my obsession and i dont mean the perfume must as remedy think something intellectual about physics or something 6 45 p m ended up flopping back in bed to finish final chapter of halcius pottotius royally flushed it was quite a fantastic ending really and far more satisfying than hfl which left me feeling much hatred towards athena o hereagall for writing harmonia halcius crap i mean i know there are people out there who write harmonia halcius stories and crap but people do you not see the allure of a flora halcius relationship der people is all i have to say 7 02 p m do you have to look tempting and hot if you re going to teach asp or would that just be an unnecessary impediment to knowledge hm will consult the asp handbook it makes me feel so empowered to say that as if i a superhero or something and i shouting at my sidekick to the bat cave 7 05 p m according to karamus hooking one image is very important one body is a temple and it is very important never to let one guard down you never know who is watching i guessing that means that i ve got to look nice from now on god it like going on a date every single day if i dontget to snog my boyfriend i dontthink this is a very good idea 7 30 p m i have at last found the perfect outfit actually i have no idea how on earth it got to hogwarts maybe it was mistakenly packed into my suitcase by some crazy or my mother or ren e trying to remind me of worse days but it my school uniform i hated pretty sticks but you ve got to admit the uniform is pretty naughty britney spears schoolgirl actually it more naughty britney spears schoolgirl meets bad ass avril lavigne skater chick remember when we used to think avril lavigne was a bad ass let just go with that and what self respecting man wouldntgo for that kicky ensemble hm 7 45 p m have put on uniform and have realized is same kicky ensemble that broke hearts at beauxbatons but i am not the same girl who broke hearts at beauxbatons i am much much fatter so obviously i cannot afford to work this outfit like i have worked it in the past because my humongous butt is standing in the way and it is not like you could bounce a marble off of my flat stomach either or spend forever trying to find the beginning of my imaginary long lean legs merde merde merde where did i go wrong i must now find a new kicky ensemble and everyone knows that kicky ensembles of such kicky magnitude only come along every 74 years like haley comet 8 00 p m replacement outfit was nowhere near as mischievous schoolgirl as the first one and very tame but whatever all i here for is taking notes and looking pretty that all so does anyone even care no i ve already showed michael the handbook a copy of which he received as well and he is now teaching lessons out of it you can just tell harry praying to god he doesnthave to read out of it for homework i am personally opposed to homework it not that distant a memory but back to my complaints what am i even here for nobody learns a damn thing from me anyway why d dumbledore even give me this job if my potential is nil and i dontdo anything i cantteach harry a thing and harry doesntneed to be taught a thing he hot and sexy all by his lonesome thankyouverymuch he doesntneed any help to harness it or channel it or shape it or whatever verb stupid yet hot karamus hooking used have just seen that this entire class is pointless merde with a capital m this upsets me perhaps d wanted to give me purpose and that why he put me on this case i mean it not like i joined the ootp or anything so maybe he thinks that by letting me do this i can feel like i helping the cause or whatever but i not and this little asp thing has totally helped me see that or maybe that what they want maybe they want me to see how useless i am so they can get me to get into action and join the order hm tricky devils merde michael is saying something and looking at me and i have no idea what it is 8 12 p m michael was asking me to take over on flirting with a random important person lesson 3 wait a godforsaken minute why did michael get the teacher edition while i got stuck with the crummy student edition 8 15 p m oh wait they re the same thing never mind 8 27 p m jacques has just dropped by because now that i ve mentioned asp to him he has to make it obvious that i an awful secret agent and cantkeep secret locations secret i ve just asked him what are you doing here in a really scathing way because i feeling very wicked and nasty now that i cantfit into my school uniform properly he just said i ve suddenly become a chronic insomniac with nothing better to do which is code for i figured fleur was feeling purposeless so i swung by to play superhero jacques has a saving people thing for the most part i like guys with saving people things but i cantfall into jacques arms and snog him so there no point in his saving people thing 8 45 p m had ridiculous breakdown of the mariah carey sort and started feeling all bad and horrible and less purposeful than ever because even jacques wasntseeing my purpose because his purpose for wandering down to the dungeons ostensibly wasntme it was insomnia sometimes i get these awful cases of the mean reds but unlike audrey hepburn in breakfast at tiffany s i dontwake up to george peppard every morning and my boyfriend and i dontmatch burberry trench coats so who really has a case of the mean reds i ask you moi bien s r unfortunately did not display such calm rational logic in the dungeons rather i regurgitated all this stuff about my sadness and purposelessness while the massive amounts of testosterone that surrounded me stared at this estrogen bomb in human form jacques i pointless i sniffled sitting on snape desk looking sorrowfully on at the continuing asp lesson harry and michael were practicing lines from the elements of suave an exercise which completely does not require me i not contributing to anything i cantteach and i bad at effing everything you re not bad at everything jacques said softly i sometimes think he has a completely different voice when he talks to me because he totally reams his tutees who are only bad at the subjunctive oh coming from you mr perfection in a fricking bucket with your e is for excellent job perfect academic record and your rakish good looks coupled with einstein like brains coupled with musical genius coupled with that stupid thing you do where you conjugate verbs in like 13 different languages you cantcouple something with that many things it doesntwork then it not a couple anymore i childishly hopped off the desk and stamped my foot at jacques while michael and harry continued discussing lesson three oh shut up mr i have a point so i ll wave my so not humongous butt in your face and laugh at your inferiority besides my pointlessness my life is a pile of merde with my crackpot crazy mother and my ho bag sister and such and we have yet to discuss the so not romantic plottage of my life i heinously bored jacques nothing tragic yet exciting that belongs on the front page of a romance novel ever happens to me why am i so pointless not having ridiculous things happen to you doesntmean that your life has no meaning jacques argued oh god i so happy we avoided having that absurd camus discussion again i would have died ahem which would be meaningless oh ridiculous things happen to me all right but none of them are romantic at all none of them belong in an award winning romance novel jacques narrows his eyebrows at me clearly trying to compile a short list of award winning romance novels i sigh heavily waiting for jacques light bulb to go off i ve got it he says calling my attention not to mention harry and michael s what about the tristan fernando incident oh i d forgotten about the tristan fernando incident so i shut up day sixty two of free independence friday march 20 th at breakfast with j m and r 6 14 a m 6 14 a m hm i should have known that michael would ask about the tristan fernando incident i have decided not to tell him anything 6 20 a m you know though he still bombarding me with questions even though i haventsaid a word about it since last night who tristan who fernando what happened why arentyou saying anything why are you hiding this from me what going on i cantsay i blame him because i d do the same but really the t f incident was ages ago and hardly even matters so nobody should care about what it is 6 25 a m ooh haventthought about tristan in forever i obviously think about fernando frequently usually in context of that disgusting slime ball fernando or that worthless piece of merde fernando also because sometimes when i buying groceries in between the muzak the melodic strains of that abba song emerge and so naturally my mind leaps to fernando but haventthought of tristan much at all strange tristan was so much better than fernando but i bet no one even remembers tristan and fernando and yesterday jacques just had a brain leak and the first thing that leaked out was t f incident but now he totally has no idea what the t and the f stand for 6 37 a m hey jacques do you still remember the tristan and fernando incident jacques is giving me this look like what do you think i an idiot i giving him this look like do you want me to answer that of course after all this look exchanging jacques says of course i remember the tristan and fernando incident can we please call it something other than the tristan and fernando incident as you ll recall i had a starring role that true if it were a movie tristan and fernando would have been leading men but jacques would have at least been a supporting actor so he begins tentatively are you planning on discussing the great auditorium scene with your boyfriend or have you decided that past is past and you should live in the present great auditorium scene i ask looking at him rather incredulously jacques is admittedly very horrible at making up names which is a welcome relief as he is always prancing around being perfect at all times i readily welcome this imperfection i told you i sick of calling it the tristan and fernando incident it not descriptive enough the great auditorium scene it was really more like the great fountain bedroom hallway auditorium crunch scene i suggested and where on earth did the crunch come from he asked sometimes jacques is so inescapably stupid just because he cantmake up names doesntmean that he should be excused from understanding the names made up by others i sighed from the delightful sound of f nando nose breaking in three places the duh was implied and i not telling michael anything he had enough time turner like past of fleur when you came rolling around with all of your random reminiscing inducing phraseology i seriously doubt that that any of what you just said is grammatically correct and your perfecto fancy pants show offy ness that he may feel he has to live up to and the whole manly man protector thing that he must now get over now that you re here being all manly man protector ish because while you re a great manly man protector some people need the role more than others and another thing you must stop causing so much inferiority in others because i dontthink anyone appreciates your perfecto fancy pants showy offy ness was any of that a real word yes 7 34 a m pros and cons of telling m about t and f pro by telling him i would be promoting a healthy respectful open relationship con by telling him he might decide that i have too much stuff in my life and that it overwhelming because it is and decide he has to take a break and because of that break he finds that ren e is actually much hotter than me and runs off to vegas and marries her totally plausible ren e would thrive in the nevada brothel industry pro by telling him i would not feel like horrible liar for not telling him if say fernando ever decided to sweep into town and pay his favorite ex a visit con if fernando ever did sweep into town to pay his favorite ex a visit i couldntbrush it off with i dontknow what he thinks he doing but then again the french do tend to be a little woo hoo if you know what i mean pro if i told him then when tristan finally paid me a visit keep in touch my royal derri re then michael would totally understand why i was gazing at him with complete adoration of his pure hotness con if i told him then when tristan finally paid me a visit the only way we d ever get to see each other would be surrounded by bodyguards and nuns pro if i told him he d stop asking who tristan who fernando what happened why arentyou saying anything why are you hiding this from me what going on con if i told him he d still ask are you thinking about tristan what about fernando i cant believe you didnttell me what happened why didntyou talk to me why did you hide this from me is there something else going on i stressed i need pills 8 20 a m i couldntfind any pills to my surprise what kind of stupid castle isntriddled with painkillers especially when a girl could use some vicodin or some oxycontin hell i will take ritalin i just need to be either beyond smashed or ludicrously focused right now to endure this whole entire long painful potions class plus the whole tristan fernando michael thing i mean why do new boyfriends need to know about old boyfriends they don t right because they dontand shouldntcare right this is where someone says right oh sod all of you i going to go steal adhd medication from colin creevey room he too happy and hyperactive not to be on meds 8 45 a m pills pills pills pills for god sake people bring me some fricking pills 9 20 a m jacques is very obligingly brewing me an extra strength draught of peace sure snappers may be incredibly sick of all the coffee breaks i take but even if he is the worst thing he could do would be fire me and as if that wouldntbe a welcome punishment ooh potion done jacques is saying something but who really cares all i can concentrate on is drinking every last drop of that draught of peace ooh peaceful goodness now what that jacques is saying but just a warning it really strong so dontdrink the entire bottle oops 10 30 a m happy bunnies fluffy fluff and round and round and round and round la la la happy little plot bunnies dancing through the forest full of snow and sunshine lalalalalala ya make me wanna lala in the kitchen on the door i ll eat the lemonade i dontlike milk but i ll have some more 12 noon i am in a very white very clean room ooh looky looky it madam pomfrey isntit what she doing here am i in the hospital wing 12 05 p m and looky it michael and jacques they ve come to visit me but why am i here je suis tr s confus pourquoi est ce que je suis ici ack my pounding headache has returned and the room seems dizzy and jacques hair is this funny green color pretty stars 7 54 p m damn damn damn damn damn damn damn damn damn day sixty four of free independence sunday march 22 nd on my deathbed 12 03 p m 12 03 p m i have not moved all day long and not not moving in a good warm fuzzy way either this is more of not moving in an it pains me to move because i d rather lie down and die die die kind of way how could i let this happen i keep on saying i ll die but jacques keeps on telling me i ll be fine you ll get over it you always do he says i ll get over it does jacques honestly think that i ll be able to survive the flower of love being viciously stomped on and ripped into a thousand pieces is he that delusional has he never read gardening and your life how to reap the love you sow true love is like haley comet and kicky ensembles it not something you ll find every day and when you do find it you must hold onto like it the last rose before the winter you must water it with affection and turn the topsoil of fidelity constantly and you must never never never leave it untended because someone else prize rosebushes will win first place at the county fair and you know what this county fair i didntwin first place or second place or even third place i got honorable mention which is code for we feel sorry for her so let give her a prize to make her pathetic life seem meaningful why am i such an idiot i ll spend the rest of my life thinking why what could i have done differently where did i go wrong did my mom drop me on my head when i was two or something did grandm re jeanette put bourbon in my baby bottle instead of milk ughhhh if this were a blockbuster teen movie after this much head shaking and bed ridden wishing i would be transported back to the nineties to do all my relationships over again 12 39 p m jacques must stop trying to drag me out of bed i dontwant to get out of bed or go to lunch eating is no longer important i just want to waste away like a tragic romantic figure in a very trashy romance novel until i am nothing but bones and can die quietly looking very tragic and perfect and pale 12 45 p m all i feel is pain it unbearable i dontknow what i d give if jacques would just give me my wand back and let me avada kedavra myself but he took my wand away for that exact reason aaaaaaaaaaah at this time i would probably be flirting with michael outside the dungeons while snape isntlooking but alas all i feel is pain 12 58 p m i dontknow if i strong enough to talk about it yet but i do know that if i dontget it out that i ll spontaneously combust and that would ruin my wasting away slowly plan i sure my blood sugar has dropped some 50 points because i haventeaten since 3 o clock yesterday michael came to visit me while i was on my happy potion and plastered beyond reason because apparently i wouldntknow i barely remember any of yesterday i had passed out my way back to the dungeons and had to be carted off to the hospital wing so i was babbling about fluffy bunnies and happy sunshine or happy bunnies and fluffy sunshine you never can tell and then i dontknow what came over me according to jacques this is basically how it happened thank god you re up says michael in a sexy way because michael never says anything in an un sexy way are you okay i heard you collapse right outside my class dizzy i said in a rather disoriented tone but then again wouldntyou be disoriented if you walked into a wall and then passed out at this point jacques absently muttered something about the fact that i wouldntbe dizzy if i hadnthad the entire fricking bottle of extra strength draught of peace stupid much i hope you feel better you fell pretty hard i was afraid you d broken something said michael which was very sweet of him i would have told him so if i werentso inebriated and for the sake of your health i will refrain from asking questions about the tristan and fernando incident until you have fully recovered of course michael had to go and remind of tristan sure he could have just said fernando incident then he d just get an earful of multilingual curse words but noooo he had to include tristan excuse my french amigos but this is where the shit went down being on too much dop is like being on drugs dop is just dope minus the e you see you say stupid stupid stupid stupid things like the first thing that comes to your mind i miss him i sighed in what it can be assumed was a wistful longing way what he was really sweet and i miss him why did we break up jacques why did we break up i babbled err fleur said jacques in that do you have any idea what the hell you re doing at all kind of way the very least he could have done would have been to fling himself across the room and shut me up right then but no i just kept on talking and talking and talking and he was hot he was really hot too not that you re not hot i said looking at michael who acj according to jacques looked mortified but tristan was beyond hot he was like a twelve on a scale of one to ten god why did we break up she still a little woozy said jacques looking at michael who acj didntgive a damn about the fact that jacques was even talking and was still just as mortified as he had been before hm i said getting dizzier by the second putting my head back on my pillow i love him i said and this acj is when michael just left the room he hasntcome to visit me at all even though i ve been out for a day and a half and i dontblame him i a horrible girlfriend if i even his girlfriend anymore 2 39 p m jacques has just come back from closet muggle apparently he got me elektra on dvd one tree hill the first season and an outrageous amount of cds i know what this means michael said it michael broke up with me when fernando and i broke up the first time jacques bought me the first halcius pottotius book and our entire mutual cd collection wait no this could just be a coincidence after all i dontsee any ridiculous junk f damn here comes the cheetos 3 44 p m i canttake it anymore we re an hour into elektra and i just have to know before it burns a hole in me sure it may cause me searing burning pain to hear it recounted but still if i dont hear it recounted wouldntthat be much much worse so how did he do it do what break up with me i say quietly how did he break up with me fleur this is jacques using his fleur i know you dontwant to hear this so why are you trying to pretend like you want to hear this because after i tell you you re going to be mad at me for telling you voice and it true that i probably going to be mad at him for telling me afterward but i still need to know tell me i say demandingly stopping the dvd right before jennifer garner starts kicking butt again and such i quite obviously going to have to pay full attention to jacques during this particular conversation he didnt really he just kind of shook his head and wandered away muttering i dontbelieve this but i dontknow he never really stuttered jacques he obviously didntwant to tell me give it to me straight i said putting on a brave face all the while knowing that the only thing i d want given to me straight was the martini i d need after jacques finally told me he said maybe we shouldntsee each other until you ve got your feelings sorted out said jacques well that as straight as it comes i guess and it not like i didntexpect it i mean what else was he going to say i mean but i ve never been dumped before i ve always been the dump er the thing with fernando was mutual the first time i guess and the second time i chucked him but god being dumped is horrible i just want to crawl up into a little ball and cry day sixty five of free independence monday march 23 rd in my bathroom 7 25 a m 7 25 a m i just calling in sick today no one ever told me getting dumped felt like this not even jacques when marie or as i like to call her the nazi bitch queen did a mexican hat dance on his heart he just took it when he and gretchen broke up he moped around for three seconds and then he was fine why couldnthe tell me that it was this much hell did he just not feel it and how can i feel like this it not like i ve known michael forever he was my cyber boyfriend from last november until january and then we met in february and broke up in march face to face 4 months it shouldntfeel like forever 7 45 a m he wasnteven that great a boyfriend anyway i mean sure he visited me when i was sick and conjured up banquet like dinners and created ridiculously romantic scenarios and defended my honor by setting certain 7th years on fire and was generally very hot but like that all that wonderful damn why was he so wonderful and caring and understanding and smart and sensitive most guys dontgive a crap what you do but he did damn it 9 03 a m jacques in here trying to convince me that no i not sad and such okay be sad all you want but eat something exclaims jacques as if food is really the issue here he prepared this ridiculous amount of food that is so disrespectful to my diet just because i had a jumbo bag of cheetos and a liter of coke yesterday does not mean that i am off the abs diet though no abs have appeared how can you think of food at a time like this the love of my life has left me i shriek in the manner of an insane banshee hag thing oh you dont love him fleur jacques says dismissively dont trivialize my feelings i love him and now i ve lost him because of my draught of peace induced stupidity god frick it jacques what if he was the one and now i destined to be aloooooooooone i sure he wasntthe one fleur and besides he cantbe all that great if he idiot enough not to know the difference between love and luff at this point jacques has completely lost me what luff got to do with it got to do with it okay sorry i couldnthelp myself when a tina turner song is just delicately placed in front of you it is your responsibility to carpe diem that one v important thing i learned from america where michael is from gah now an entire country is ruined 12 noon i at lunch but i not eating in memory of what could have been wait can you have a memory of what could have been what luff come on you say it all the time says jacques in a completely unhelpful way well i say thinking back to all the times i could have possibly said luff and not have noticed i dontremember any so what is it well i was just saying you ve got to be a total idiot not to know the difference between love and luff like when you were talking you said i luff him not i love him he raises his eyebrows in a dontyou get it way soooo so love and luff are not the same thing when you say love you mean love but when you say luff you mean will grace love like you re my gay roommate i adore you and will never have sex with you or those shoes make my day i luff them or lust as opposed to love usually preceded by an omigod with that weird vapid inflection you sometimes take on omigod i luff him luff not love l u f f luff luff like fluff what luff got to do with it luff will find a way luff lift us up where we belong luff is not love love l o v e love i love you not i luff you michael quickly looks at us in a no i totally not staring at you way this is going to be hard then again luff is a battlefield a n i know i a super nuclear nazi bitch queen from hell for not updating but other super nuclear nazi bitch queens from hell were trying to ruin my life i love luff all of you for waiting also i dontown that horrible ashley simpson song and ash i sorry for mutilating it koppa i beyond flattered unfortunately at the moment i consumed with bile for the male sex so that just a matter of timing luff to you all ps to all of you who are worried about the harry fleur aspect of this fic dont worry you will get more harry fleur than you can even handle soon april wanderlust day seventy four of free independence wednesday april 1st 2005 at breakfast 6 34 am 6 34 a m have got to return to france break up has made me see that i need to get away and squeezing in reacquainting my mother with reality doesnthurt either i dontknow what the hell ren e going to do without me to torture she honestly canthang around hogwarts any longer but i dontcare she not coming with me and it better that way 6 57 a m this is good though going back to bordeaux will be a fresh start for me okay it will be like an old start actually well like if you had your clean slate and then you wrote on it and then you erased it but you can still kind of see it but mostly it clean you see what i saying plans for new life well old life er whatever back in bordeaux 1 actually read some of those books that i never got around to reading like emma and northanger abbey and the phantom of the opera which i told everyone i read but just really looked at the words and then watched the movie and now i looooooove patrick wilson that hot sexy thing with his sexy sexy voice ahem which doesntcount 2 new goal weight 116 wouldntthat be nice i mean yes it completely impossible and i delusional to think that i could reach that sacred number but still a girl can dream can she not you see even if i only get halfway to 116 i still impossibly thin right so not succeeding is kind of like succeeding see only i might only get one quarter of the way if i think like this so my goal is still 116 i think right 3 meet up with janine again haventseen her in what seems like 4 000 years and a day also she can probably tell me where tristan and fernando are hiding out so that i can try and avoid them seeing them again wouldntexactly be the cherry on top of the ice cream sundae of my happiness 4 cure my mother of whatever disease it is she has contracted restore my room to its previous condition and try and steal self help books from the library 5 say hello to grandm re jeanette and grandp re gustav before they both die their livers have got to give out someday after all 8 04 a m i have just talked to jacques about my leaving he said that he going back to france anyway so we could both just arrive in paris and then take separate flights me to bordeaux and him to lyons where he has his own freaking apartment lucky bastard 10 30 a m jacques is some sort of travel genius he booked us a flight already departing london on april 7th which is next tuesday it was very considerate of him to get us a plane as opposed to just apparating because he knows how much i love planes now there only one problem am i supposed to say goodbye to michael now that we re broken up and all does he care does he want to know if i leaving merde why am i still obsessing about michael even though we re officially not dating anymore why why why is he like most narcotics and recreational drugs like marijuana and crack addictive and hard to get out of your system and if he is why was this not mentioned in the men the metaphors section of witches are from mars wizards are just stupid 12 noon i have just asked jacques if he would like for his ex girlfriend to notify him if she is leaving the country depends says jacques seeming more intent on stabbing his chicken to make sure it completely dead than answering my question ugh i said dramatically trying to express just how annoyed i was at this response depends depends are adult underwear not an answer to a question men are like warning labels pointless just like it says in men the metaphors i say hoping my remark was derisive enough that even jacques one who trivializes all got my derogatory message that was a simile not a metaphor replies jacques eating his chicken now that he brutally stabbed it to death similes my derri re answer my forking question i demand rather loudly and forcefully at that why is it so hard for people to answer yes or no questions i asked a yes or no question and i got depends excuse me but shouldntthe answer to a yes or no question be yes or no forking repeats jacques i avoiding cursing this week i explain quickly but just pick a girlfriend like gretchen if you and gretchen had just broken up and she was going to say ireland would you want her to notify you before she got on that plane i d be beyond pissed off if she was leaving and decided not to tell me i might have had something to say to her or something but i guess it watch out fleur i going to use the d word depends on how she said it the last thing i d want to hear from gretchen would be i hopping on a plane so if you want to come declare your love for me in a very romantic made for tv scene then you might want to do so before 2 35 next wednesday okay not needy got it 2 50 p m have just happily notified snape that i will be away from his class for an entire month he has just told me i am a horrible assistant i have just said well why dontyou fire me he has just walked away grumbling 3 05 p m in the time that i have not being doing my snape free happy dance i have been discussing relationships and breakups with jacques this discussion basically consisted of how on earth did you get through it are men just devoid of emotion look it was difficult i guess but you ve just got to remember the reasons it didntwork out and not think about what you could have done differently because it couldnthave gone differently anyway your being the person you were at the time it was wow i said marveling at the deepness of this statement did you get that from a self help book or something jacques gave me this completely mocking smile actually unlike you i dontspend 75 percent of my time taking advice from people who have killed their husbands shut the fork up i said dismissively the fork wasnttalking i hate men i really really do they re all evil insensitive pigs who care about nothing but things making sense and grammar and football and such so i told jacques this very rudely in french well it your fault for walking straight into it he smiled in that infuriating hee hee i a jackass and i love it way jacques when you point a finger at someone there are three pointing back at you and one of mine that is sticking straight up jacques just shrugged true day seventy seven of free independence saturday april 4th 2005 in my room putting my fat ass to good use 8 37 a m 8 37 a m if your ass deserves its own phone line zip code and talk show as it is the size of texas then you should be able to use it to close your evil demon suitcase right then why the bloody hell wontmy suitcase fricking cloooooooose i am calm i am centered i am one with the universe what the hell am i talking about i am not one with the motherf calm centered one 10 00 a m jacques stormed into the room when he heard me referring to my suitcase as a forked up son of a bitch from the quidditch pitch but it doesntmatter because no one can close that son of a suitcase 12 noon holy mary mother of god jacques has done the impossible he has closed the suitcase from the fires of hell of course after this he had to turn to me and be like so whatever happened to not cursing this week so i had to be like whatever happened to you shutting your mouth what about that but then he had to be all when did we establish that so i was like why dontyou establish your way up out of my business jacques and then me and my homey gs were all like fo shizel and i was like why you be hatin and we bounced up into my crib sup yo yo what yo mama i am so beyond in for another grammar lesson from jacques 2 05 p m i seriously have to figure out whether or not i saying goodbye to michael if i am i going to need some time to prepare not that i going to do some big formal thing or anything i mean i ll have to play it cool oh who am i trying to kid i dontknow the meaning of the words play it cool if i try to play it cool i ll probably come off sounding stupid and it ll be this horrible awkward scene me um hey michael hey me so how ve you been michael good me oh okay michael see you around me no actually i going back to france silence michael oh me see you then michael see you instead of fleur walks along tragically having reached a level of desperate attention seeking thinness she is lugging one suitcase behind her and is making jacques carry the other two and making her way through the door michael fleur fleur turns around suddenly she sees michael who looks sweaty and hot from his strenuous exertions in the defense against the dark arts classroom what these exertions may be no one knows michael where are you going fleur tragically back to france not only is she tragically thin but she has acquired a voice that is whispery faint and thin sounding michael but why fleur there nothing keeping me here anymore after it becomes painful for her to speak what happened between us it became so easy to see that i needed back in bordeaux that i need to be with my family that they need me i have to leave michael i have to michael no stay with me fleur you cannot know how much i love you i was a stupid insensitive pig who did not deserve a tragically thin goddess like you if you leave me now i will have nothing to live for please stay fleur please fleur her heart wrenching with indecision i so sorry michael but i must go fleur heads out the door leaving michael looking after her thinking of what could have been so naturally one comes to the decision that i cannot tell michael goodbye i should just conspicuously disappear so that he can come running after me shouting dontgo dontgo at the top of his lungs looking sweaty and hot from his exertions in the dada classroom and i ve got to leave anyway to punish him make him want me back yes mm hm is brilliant idea 3 27 p m okay so i have to just not say anything at all about leaving to michael got it 4 12 p m and that means no hints 4 34 p m so saying by the way i might not be here next week so dontcount on me being here just as michael passes by is out of the question 5 14 p m and spending all your time musing oh how i miss bordeaux i might go back and visit sometime is also out of the question 7 02 p m can i like casually mention it in asp i mean seeing as how it work related and such 9 39 p m this asp lesson we are teaching harry about appropriate asp skills to be used at appropriate asp times such as dontuse the sexy sexy wink in the presence of a person you perceive to be person of consequence type two shy and unused to sexiness instead try the sexy cute smile and gradually work your way up to actions of the sexy sexy magnitude why are we teaching him this i mumble i mean he like jacques he cannot control his sexiness so he sexy all the time so who can resist him michael glances over at me ooh shivers he so hot even now jacques doesntexactly have girls falling all over themselves about him are you kidding me there used to be a poll over who could get into his pants first i would definitely say jacques has girls falling all over themselves about him and in case you haventnoticed some members of your fan clubs have retreated fan clubs both harry and michael say at the same time yes your fan clubs the ravenclaws have stayed loyal to their respective clubs but all the hufflepuffs have abandoned your causes and rushed off to fawn over jacques and his cute butt his cute butt repeats michael he soooo something since we broke up but i cantfigure out what it is yes his cute butt not that i d hop into bed with him but it not like you can go around denying sexiness all over the place you ve got to be aware and i very aware of jacques cute butt the fact that it does nothing for me is irrelevant irrelevant repeats michael in that skeptical professor way which is very hot but that i should stop thinking seeing as how we re no longer seeing each other is there an echo in here i say giving him a look come to think of it i am probably obligated by the code of separation not to give michael looks anymore hmmm why isntthere some kind of constitution for his kind of thing god fork it did the two of you break up or something says harry he looks sweet today okay harry the second lesson we re going to learn today is tact i say with a smile a smile that masks my true heartbreak and despair sorry couldntresist the tragic romantic novel moment there harry smiles back has he learned nothing that was the sexy sexy smile you cantjust go around using the sexy sexy smile it too overpowering sorry he says but he not sorry if he were really sorry he wouldnthave just taken out the stun gun of hotness and shot me with it i forgive you now frolic along be sexy wait no frolic along and control your sexiness that what i meant to say whatever happened to not controlling your sexiness asks harry i swear say the word sexiness too many times and it will start sounding really funny sexiness sexiness sexiness sexiness sexiness damn now it sounds like a naughty spanish word well it different for you we ve already made you acknowledge your sexiness so you cantpull off the whole i dontknow i sexy so i not going to care about how sexy i being right now deal instead you have to pretend you dontknow you re sexy and totally control your sexiness it a raw deal yes but there are perks you know just as long as you never never ever say i too sexy for this class you know ever what oh my i d forgotten that you were never exposed to the wonderful world of vh1 or right said fred how unfortunate i say i might as well be talking about orphans in liberia that how sad life without vh1 is really because i found the whole on the catwalk yeah thing a little disturbing interjects michael what are you talking about asks harry and now we have unwittingly confused him how great of us i too sexy for my shirt too sexy for my shirt so sexy it hurts says michael hoping that the line will trigger a memory of the right said fred song that is just so wrong even though we both know that it won t which is cause for much sadness and i too sexy for this song i add what nothing michael says quickly never mind i smile we never said anything it approaching ten so we head for the door harry going one way towards the dorms and michael and i going in another we couldnthelp ourselves we both spontaneously erupted into i do a little dance on the catwalk yeah as we walked back to our respective rooms god i going to miss him je fais une petite danse sur la passerelle oui je fais une petite danse sur la passerelle oui parce que je suis trop sexy pour ma chemise trop sexy pour ma chemise tellement sexy il fait mal day seventy nine of free independence monday april 6th 2005 in my room contemplating important things 10 50 a m 10 50 a m to tell him or not to tell him that is the question whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of getting on that plane without saying goodbye or to take arms against all the rules of tragic romantic figures around the world and by opposing end them to say it to wonder no more gah 12 noon i want to know the depth of his feeling for me i mean does he still care about me does he regret breaking up with me maybe he wants to get back together with me and he too afraid to ask me i am so confused 2 57 p m in my ultimate confusion i turn to jacques my savior and confidante i dontknow whether or not i saying goodbye to michael and it driving me crazy i say which is just a hint but a fairly obvious one i thought you were he says eating a bagel god guys have it so easy i mean think about it they donthave to worry about when their significant other is going to pop the question they do all the asking out they dontcare about what they eat they dontlook in the mirror and go i fat they get to keep their last names on average they still get paid more and they pee standing up i would totally rather be a guy you know if i didnthave to forfeit being in love with orlando bloom and such then again gay guys have less perks i should be a lesbian 4 45 p m i ve just fully realized that if i were a lesbian i wouldntbe able to have dirty thoughts about orlando bloom and what life without that 6 06 p m then again if i were a lesbian i wouldntbe having these huge michael problems the ones that should have ended when we did 6 12 p m jacques is slightly disturbed that i just stood outside my door and screamed michael turner you are a narcotic drug to the fourth years passing by but what ever at least i picked that one over michael turner i just want you to know that because of you i am seriously considering becoming a lesssssssssssbbbbiaaannn a huge same sex shagging lesssssssbian a rosie o donnell loving will and grace watching lezzy that would have really scared the fourth years i going to go listen to some britney spears 10 17 p m grrr i ordered a magic proof ipod from closet muggle like a week ago and it not here yet i remember in my order i specified that it should be delivered to hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry oh hee hee to the dungeons now i have to go back to that devil place you know what i shouldnthave to deal with this i should be in bordeaux relaxing and eating crap and not having to look good because who am i looking good for no boyfriend no worries all men are trouble i should be a grace and get myself a will and be happy i going to start with my magic proof ipod with 10 pre ordered songs no better way to start anew than with a bunch of kick ass feminist songs right day eighty of free independence tuesday april 7th 2005 sitting on my suitcase in humiliation 1 06 a m 1 06 a m ended up having to sneak down to the dungeons and retrieve my ipod from where it had been delivered so i was admiring its mini pinkness and listening to the top ten power songs i had ordered in the depth of my emotional break up induced distress because by this time i had completely figured out the way it was going to be why should i be stressing i am a capable contemporary independent woman who should concentrate on making herself the best she can be i dontneed a boyfriend to validate me unfortunately i just happened to be thinking this just as love is a battlefield ended and i am woman began and they re not called power songs for nothing they re incredibly inspiring so it is completely not my fault that i started singing i am strong strong i am invincible i am womaaaaaaaaaaan that you are said draco malfoy standing in the doorway as i danced around in the naughty pajamas what the hell wh wha what exactly are y you doing here now at this moment just a question you know seeing as how you re here now at this moment why are you here now at this particular point in time just a question so what i babble when i nervous why are you not enjoying our midnight rendezvous he said sleazily walking into the dungeon it amazing how it suddenly struck me just how dark it was no actually i getting a very stephen king feeling right now i said not betraying my nervousness of course hey you re right it midnight the witching hour said draco and you re out of bed hm i think i remember something about that being in the beginner guide to teaching oh right it forbidden isntit at this point draco shifted uncomfortably which promptly spread the smell of his melvin klein wizarding cologne all over the room now let me see i said suddenly gleeful four no five weeks of detention oh oh and you have to spit shine all the trophies in the trophy room twice a week every week and you re on cauldron duty too and if you fail to do any of these tasks then i give professor turner full permission to whip you yes i think that ll do oh wait before i forget sixty points from slytherin for this and twenty more because you bother me that not fair draco muttered now now draco if life were fair then it wouldntbe any fun would it 4 02 a m wow that was just about equivalent to three hours of sleep but i cantsleep i close my eyes and i dream about michael i see him and he standing there looking perfect fiddling with his tie in that infuriating way like he knows i have a thing for ties or something and you know it makes me realize that i dontwant to be away from him i mean i miss him and yeah we re not together anymore and wasntthat just a huge misunderstanding wouldntit be just fantastic if i could tell him that and we could get back together i mean yes in theory that would be beyond fantastic but i leaving for bordeaux in like 12 hours so how the hell can you get back together with someone and just leave you cantright right so i should just say goodbye or not say goodbye and miss him so badly damn it damn it damn damn damn this sucks i need to just go on my damn vacation damn 5 19 a m but i ve read men are from mars women are from venus it was nowhere near as good as witches are from mars wizards are just stupid in case you were wondering and you re supposed to let guys be martian rubber bands and pull back ready to snap back when they ve pulled away far enough and i think bordeaux is far enough so i should go have fun drink lots come back and michael will be here all martian and snappy snapping back to me right 6 00 a m but that book was bad really bad and really boring and it was written by a man what do men know they know nothing or do they know everything and insist on hiding it from us okay so this guy is a man right and this man is therefore qualified to write about the way men are because he a man right but men are stupid however he understands the male brand of stupidity and can translate it into what we women should do or maybe all the men in the world are pretending to be stupid and this book was part of the male plan to make women look like utter fools by believing all this martian rubber band crap so all men are pigs and i should be a lesbian and now we re right back where we started damn it hm now i depressed thinking happy thoughts draco being whipped as he spit shines trophies i feel better 7 30 p m damnation damn damn evil indecision i mean quite seriously i just had b fast with jacques and he was just like do whatever you think is right fleur when i asked him about the michael dilemma which is total bull right i mean that the kind of thing really lazy people say to get out of giving advice like just follow your heart and it not my place to tell you what to do like that time janine was at a restaurant and she asked what should i get to the waiter and he just replied in his own little suave way well the salad is good a wholesome healthy mix of three different types of salad and four vegetables the pasta is divine the cook a world famous chef has won awards for it we have seventeen different soups and janine turned to him all the ice queen cometh about it and said i asked you what i should get not what was in your freaking salad you idiot men are stupid get me a waitress dumb ass admittedly janine is a bitch on pms but who isn t once i started crying in potions and screaming that nobody respected my pain but that kind of thing is natural i guess mm hmm this is going to be soooo uncomfortable for jacques when he snoops through this later 8 12 a m standing outside the dungeons biting my nails furiously ewww i know i never used to bite my nails you know until i saw someone doing it in some movie as a manifestation of their nervousness maybe it was the parent trap why am i trying to figure out what movie this is from i frazzled out of my mind i need to express my frazzle ation hold on i need to scream at the wall no really i sane harry coming out of the classroom looking like walking sex and sigh i canteven care what does that say about my current emotional state that i canteven properly appreciate sexiness anymore wait a minute is he actually stopping hey fleur he says looking at me in that sweet concerned way of his are you okay do i look like i not okay do i looked disheveled or distracted or something i going to look like such merde when i arrive in bordeaux then and mum will get to criticize me or maybe since she tr s zen like now she ll just tell me she loves the natural no makeup looks like merde look okay is not the word i sigh because that all i can do now in an expression of my angst well if i ve got to spill to someone why not harry he here isnthe i dontknow what to do at all about what he says we just keep walking i not any surer of where we re going than i am of anything else i leaving today i going back to france and i really dontwant leave without working things out with michael but i going to be on a plane in an hour and a half and i just want to know he s he going to miss me you know that someone going to miss me you know yeah i understand he said as we walked out into the snow sigh there probably no snow in france now there a lot of things i going to miss it turns out i guess i just wanted this huge fantastic movie scene you know i walking towards the door dramatic music playing and suddenly michael screams out from the back of the room fleur wait and i turn around and he looks into my eyes and but you know it doesntmatter because it not going to happen because because i guess we re over harry smiled well fleur how can he say goodbye if he doesntknow you re leaving what oh my god that makes perfect sense how can he i started jumping up and down in the snow for sheer joy oh harry you re a genius by this time he seemed just a little bit freaked out but he still had that sweet smile thing going on you cantknow how much i adore you right now i screamed still jumping up and down for sheer joy and then because this is just the way i was made i did something stupid in my immense excitement i grabbed him and started spinning around like i was six years old i admit i had sugar for breakfast so this is not completely my fault until i fell over ack i dreading telling you this so he reached his hand out to help me up and ack i kissed him on the mouth aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah and then i ran away i mean before i ran away i sure there was a brief look of utter and complete panic on my face as i realized what the hell it was i just did but after that i ran away it was kind of like yay then panic then thanks for the advice bye and then i ran away aw merde 9 45 p m so jacques was like what the hell when i explained the whole thing to him which i did kind of like this i kissed him i said speeding up next to him with beyond long strides who harry now let keep walking i ve got to get to the dungeons to talk to michael i said continuing to walk at turbo pace what he gasped turning around and stopping me in my tracks with this deer in the headlights look on his face you did what why i dontknow i cried helplessly i dontknow why i do any of the stuff i do we were just talking about michael because i didntknow what to do and then he made everything seem so simple and you know how much sugar i had for breakfast and i started jumping up and down and getting really excited and i just i just kissed him oh god jacques what am i supposed to do i didnt mean to okay okay calm down i know you didn t he said but why are you going to see michael because i have to say goodbye i explained my happiness at finally having found a solution to this particular dilemma was slightly diluted by the fact oh i made out with his student god frick it why cantanything in my life just be normal or happy or good why must everything be so damn complicated oh so you ve finally decided on that then he said oui oui mon ami and then i can get on that plane and forget about all of this for four whole weeks i sighed i really should stop doing that it become like a disease or something irrepressible sighing syndrome and michael and i will be back together and harry will have forgotten my temporary insanity and i can come back here all composed and thin and well read and everything will be fine okay sure said jacques not sounding incredibly convinced and besides i can just tell harry that i probably had some sort of synaptic misfire that day i said happily do you even know what that means no and neither does he and that what matters i said contentedly walking ever onward because that the success of arithmancy teachers all over the world besides i cantthink of anything that you might have had a reaction to it not like you ve never had sugar for breakfast before i started to protest but then i realized he was right so i shut up is there anything you did differently today well i got my monthly shipment of madame matilda magical mesmerizing love perfume today i said it supposed to come in every month on the first but i swear the people at madame matilda are soooo unreliable do you have it with you asked jacques tr s apprehensively as if he was a scientist on the verge of discovering the cure for irrepressible sighing syndrome no duh jacques it the single most potent love perfume in the world i carry it with me everywhere i said airily cautiously removing a bottle of pink perfume from my handbag which jacques promptly snatched from me hey careful with that that 20 galleons worth of l o v e right there buster jacques spend the next two thousand years reading the label i swear to god fleur can you read he pointed to the words side effects in bold may cause impulsive impetuous irrational overly friendly and or amorous behavior as well as hiccups weight loss and irritability if you are pregnant nursing or may become pregnant do not use the perfume holy merde this thing causes weight loss i shrieked so not the point fleur jacques said exasperatedly pointing at the may cause overly friendly and or amorous behavior part but i ve been using this thing for years i objected wondering if it could possibly be true would i seriously have to stop using madame matilda magical mesmerizing love perfume that explains a lot about you jacques said but yay now i can tell harry that my tonguing him was an adverse side effect i exclaimed you did what it not like i put my tongue i started to say but then i realized he had so i shut up you have no shame do you no but i do have a winning smile i said flashing him my winning smile as i passed by one of those humongous mirrors ew is that breakfast in my teeth i tongued the boy who lived with breakfast in my teeth shh do you really want the whole world to know he warned and this coming from mr would you like to post that in a chatroom or do you think you told enough people hm i think i ll put it on a t shirt i the girl who kissed the boy who lived and you can be the boy who knows the girl who kissed boy who lived and ren e can be the slut who is unfortunately related to the girl who kissed the boy who lived and michael can be michael can be the boy who knows nothing about the kissing incident with the boy who lived you re insane right no you re insane for being friends with me i retorted continuing on my way to michael vaguely wondering whether or not i was attention seeking ly thin enough to do this properly or how the good scenario in my mind had gone all i could remember was the um hey version of my playing it cool which you know wasntcool at all so what are you going to say asked jacques hands in pockets looking tr s serious college student like gilmore girl dean la harvard i going to tell him that i leaving but i didntwant to leave having screwed things up and that i prepared to try again with an open honest relationship if he ready to meet me halfway i said slowly there was a long pause this is the part where you say oh that so mature fleur uh i swear to g jacques you re so unsupportive it like you dont want me to be happy sometimes you know and it just really makes me upset fleur because you re like my best friend and i just want to be sure that i can always count on you to respect my decisions and not think that i crazy just because i use perfume with questionable side effects or have a questionable sex obsession or engaged in questionable activities with fleur turn around i did as i was told and as always there was a not so nice little surprise behind me oh ha ha hi michael hi and then we just stood and looked at each other in that tension ridden way that exes and especially ex sexing exes always look at each other as if we re trying to send each other telepathic messages even though in the wizarding world we know that doesntwork michael i going back to france today i blurted out he started to say something but i cut him off and just hear what i have to say before you say anything okay i miss you i miss you a lot and i hate it i hate missing you over some stupid misunderstanding about absolutely nothing except the fact i seriously should not take any draught of peace anymore and i think that maybe we could you know start this thing over and well i thought we had something god however incredibly short lived our whole face to face relationship has been and i know that it could be great if we just tried again so i just want to know if you think we should try again michael smiled floo me the instant you get to france he said sexily yiiiiiiiipeeeeeeeeeee i shrieked flying into his arms i promise you wontregret this i said enthusiastically as jacques kind of stood in the background with this if they start making out i leaving look on his face he laughed before letting me go you smell really good i love it typical dumb guy comment and i still love it i stuck my tongue out at jacques see madame matilda never fails 10 00 a m naturally i was on my way out the door when ren e sidled up to me with that hee hee i love to cause trouble look on her face so where exactly are you going back to bordeaux i said evenly repeating skank killing is illegal skank killing is illegal to myself as my new personal mantra my god france to london and now back to france what are you virgin mobile i smiled acidly so how long have you been waiting to say that all my life she said with a tr s witchy smile she abruptly reminded me of the st pauli girl well anyway little sis i ll miss you she said oh so splenda sweetly no you won t i replied yeah you re right no i won t she said nodding her head in agreement well there an entourage of hot jailbait that wontflirt with themselves so see ya when i see ya see ya when i see ya i nodded feeling content though as i walked away i felt slightly disturbed by how little evilness and hostility there was in that farewell but since skankicide see skank killing is illegal i decided to keep walking and instead found myself rooted to the spot i looked down and saw the flamingo pink bubblegum that was magically fused to my heels so i de gummed them shot ren e an underwear freezing spell over my shoulder and kept walking though by the sound of neville longbottom shocked scream i guessing i missed ah well there nowhere to go but up right a n all right well that about it for now i unfortunately will be spending the next 3 weeks with snooty geniuses who have nothing better to do than say my sat score brings all the boys to the yard my act score is better than yours damn right it better than yours i wontteach you because i a horrid snooty rich kid then again they all probably spend all day cooped up in their rooms filling out college applications and wonteven catch the reference your reviews will keep me going amidst a world of turmoil and fricking calculus does anyone understand why anyone would choose to take a college course in calculus i went easy on myself and chose debating so if i come back and i witchier than before not my fault and you evil people who visit this story 300 people today and dontleave reviews that 300 lost reviews people i despise you it people like you that make me want to stop writing altogether well much love to you sorry for the crazy long author note pray for me or the nazi math witches will murder me in my sleep muttering damn writer under their breaths planes pains and his lucky charms day eighty of free independence tuesday april 7th 2005 on a plane 12 noon 12 noon love planes love planes love planes i dontknow what muggles are always complaining about when it comes to airplanes because even though they generally donthave chocolate frogs or treacle tarts or pumpkin juice which would upset all those hogwarts students because they are oddly obsessed something that doesnteven taste that good i still love the experience i mean though the ear popping sucks it can be avoided with gum and though sometimes the pilot is stoned and leaves 55 bags at the terminal or you land in the wrong city or your airport is snowed in and you end up having to take a six hour bus ride to your destination as long as you arentsitting next to someone who is a total unmentionable it not like you ll die you might actually enjoy yourself and as long as you donthate the person next to you and you get to know them a little bit you can always complain to them when your ears pop or the pilot is stoned and leaves 55 bags at the terminal or you land in the wrong city or you have to take a six hour bus ride to your destination and if you do hate the person next to you asp your cute ass out of it and then when you re comfortable when the flight is underway you can look out the window and enjoy the view and read your book and think of where you re going and come on the food isnt that bad maybe i just insane but i lurve airplanes 12 35 p m yippee aye ay jacques is sitting next to me constantly warning me that if i keep on going yiiiiiipeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee as i ve been prone to doing lately some people are going to guess that i love planes and then they re going to think i crazy but dontyou just love planes i mean flying without wings or brooms fleur and it totally better than levitating because there no thinking involved and no wands fleur because magic is fantastic and all but fleur this is not wizard air people are going to think you are a nut job jacques says giving me that exasperated look that he seems to love handing out are you being annoying have an exasperated look fine i reply grumpily but i still getting peanuts they stopped giving out peanuts on airplanes because too many people were allergic to them jacques settles back into his seat and opens up his muggle newspaper what jennifer garner and ben affleck are so not married what how dare they get rid of peanuts they re

sounds like shisa but jacques like no fleur i know my german swear words and it true he knows his german curse words he once used all of them at the german shepherd that attacked him and ripped his shirt off much to the delight of the very female german exchange students 4 05 p m jacques has reassured me that my grandparents are probably not sober and i have nothing to worry about he has also reassured me that if ever my plan for fixing my mother gets off track all i have to do is floo him and ask well grovel a little bit him to come to bordeaux and help me and he ll be there he has also

guy thirty ish i replied okay okay we can work with this ren e twenty two right she totally legal right asked jacques walking through the newly remodeled kitchen bypassing the newly remodeled cabinets oh god jacques i said loudly spinning around suddenly you are not are not interested in ren e that is sick she is my sister for crying out loud god of course i not exclaimed jacques as if the idea of

and let jacques have his space for a while what the bloody hell was that he asked i smiled weakly floorgasm 5 00 p m so now mum and aylesford and ren e and jacques and i are sitting in the living room feeling uncomfortable and not saying anything well mum aylesford jacques and i arentsaying anything ren e cantstop blabbing over aylesford i swear my buns are tighter than ever shouted ren e delightedly doing a slutty little dance and shaking her ass all over the place hey aylesie dontyou think my buns are tighter than ever thanks to your sexy little program my god i whispered leaning over towards jacques it like she ll flirt with anything that talks isntthat what you ve been saying your whole life smiled jacques and i have an idea i mean seriously you wontbelieve it but now i have 10 percent body fat can you believe it ten percent i ve never felt better about myself i now a size one and a half which is a major improvement from when i was a size two and a half last year gosh aylesford she smiled suggestively i dontknow how i ll ever repay you fleur you now suddenly have to go to the bathroom and i urgently have to accompany you whispered jacques i now suddenly have to go to the bathroom jacques will you accompany me i said forcedly mum smiled and waved us along as jacques and i left the room out in the kitchen which by now seriously does not look like the kitchen i left behind jacques said i ve got it we get ren e to seduce aylesford what i mean obviously she already got a crush on him we just have to fuel that crush and get her to er steal aylesford away from your mother okay let me get this straight you want me to convince my sister to convince my mother personal trainer to cheat on my mother with my sister so that i can stop my mother from cheating on my dad um yes said jacques yeah i going to go find my drunk grandparents they re the only sane people in this house i said heading out the door you ve never met them have you jacques shook his head leaning against the kitchen counter then stay for dinner 5 47 p m we sometimes like to indulge him by letting him do small things around the house today he making dinner so donteat anything i whispered to jacques jacques was staring at ren e who was doing aylesford supreme booty shaking workout jacques did you hear me yeah uh huh sure he making spaghetti but donteat it it probably forty percent alcohol okay and dontdrink the water either because it probably not water since grandp re has long since forgotten how to use the tap or where water comes from and the applesauce is probably not completely apples okay what the hell kind of family do you come from fleur asked jacques but he was still staring at ren e supreme booty shaking well basically drunks goodies goodies sluts and bitches i said looking around the room and druggies some druggies too but arentyou glad i so normal jacques turned to me no grandp re no do not put that near the stove that is my special lighter that i got in america put the lighter down yes i so glad you re normal said jacques quit staring at ren e like that i wontbe able to eat a thing at dinner tonight i complained not only have i built up a strong immunity to grandp re cooking but i also intend to survive on the stash of nutri grain bars and chocolate that is upstairs in the secret compartment behind the painting in the library i am not staring at ren e said jacques completely lacking conviction as aylesford yelled at ren e to keep shaking her ass i not staring at ren e at all he persisted just because she in my direct line of vision does not mean i staring at her you sicken me jacques i said shaking my head all you think about is sex i a heterosexual male it my job ren e stopped shaking her butt and jumped up and down with enthusiasm and screamed tchia aylesford 2005 yes my mother putting two plates down in front of me and jacques smiled i swear that workout does wonders for everyone especially ren e aylesie is seriously considering making her a spokesperson for aylesford aerobics she leaned in closer they ve already copyrighted the phrase tchia so be careful because every time you say it you pay aylesford and ren e a knut i am not paying ren e to say something as stupid as tchia i protested then i exasperatedly pulled a knut out of my pocket and put it in the collection jar that mum had placed in front of me i feel so inspired so fabulous exclaimed ren e across the room i feel i feel this is one of aylesford brilliant designing ideas there the most fabulous spell you just wait and see said mum enthusiastically suddenly the room was booming with sound i feeeeeeel good nana nana nana na i knew that i would yeah i feeeeeeel good i knew that i would yeah i feel good so good i knew that i would wait are you trying to tell me that aylesford cast a singing spell on this house i asked incredulously does no one but me see what a bad idea this is yes to get us all inspired to lose weight and do what we want with our lives what could be more inspiring than the sound of music said my mother like this was the single most rational thing she d ever said in her entire life i liked her better when she was evil the hills are alive with the sound of music with songs they have sung for a thousand years how do you take this spell off i said covering my ears and looking at jacques like oh my effing god do you see what my mother lover has done oh you can t said my mother giddily only aylesford can do that actually but you can scream stop the music really loudly and wave your wand counterclockwise and that usually shuts it up i sighed and pulled my wand out of my pocket when my mother stopped me what on earth are you doing dontyou love this music i love this music almost as much as i loved fernando i said sarcastically now let me stop it before i go crazy can you hear the drums fernando i remember long ago on a starry night like this in the firelight fernando you were humming to yourself and strumming your guitar fernando doesntplay the guitar i screamed at the ceiling i could hear the distant drums and sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar they were closer now fernando every hour ever minute seemed to last eternity i was so afraid fernando afraid of what we were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die and i not afraid to say the roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry good god if cannons made you cry you should see spiderman 2 sometime i shouted still directed towards the ceiling bearing in mind that i couldntseem any crazier than the people around me there was something in the air that night the stars were bright fernando they were shining there for you and me for liberty fernando stop the music now i shouted waving my wand counterclockwise dear my mother interjected thanks i muttered stop the music now slowly the sound of that one most horrible abba song died oh well at least it wasnt mamma mia awwwww ren e sighed and i just loved that song 6 00 p m fabulous now we cantsay the names of any song titles in this household and whenever you step into the entranceway or the bathroom you get a magical tingle up your leg this aylesford guy is an idiot who really needs a magical tingle up their leg when they need to pee jacques what did i tell you before dinner i said watching him move his spoon towards the applesauce which was more like apple martini sauce nothing is safe except the bread jacques sighed exactly have another roll it so good to see you again fleur said grandp re gustav you ve grown so much when i last saw you you were this high he said bringing his hand down to his knee grandp re the last time you saw me was last christmas i said there was a brief awkward silence so mum where dad i said giving aylesford a very threatening look oh he still in bangladesh said my mother stabbing her spaghetti with a fork and continuing on like she hadntjust mentioned a small swampy country in asia what i gasped remembering mum reference to visiting there in her nerve wracking february letter how could you just leave him there i briefly began thinking that this was part of her and aylesford plan to ditch my father in asia while they continued their open affair on a different continent well you see actually he not in bangladesh it turns out that when he went to visit singapore he was chewing some gum and public gum chewing is very very illegal in singapore so the feds apprehended him and he still in a singaporean prison sorting all this out with the loony muggles who work there explained my mother calmly you let my father go to jail because he was chewing gum i said gawking at her and how can you just visit singapore from bangladesh isntit like 2 000 miles away why did you even visit singapore in the first place what in singapore that you wanted to see exactly well i heard they had really good takeout said my mother my father is rotting in prison because you heard they had really good takeout i shouted are you mad woman this really is getting suspicious why is my father in prison 5 000 miles away from here on gum chewing charges and why is my mother taking this in stride and isntit just a little bit funny that while my father my mother husband is off rotting in some dinky little jail my mother personal trainer personal trainer is living in my house you know dear said grandp re looking at my mother i think she angry with you thank you captain obvious i shouted standing up and pushing my chair back in red with fury if you ll excuse me i want to be alone i said dramatically rushing out of the kitchen my best friend wants to convince my sister to have an affair with my mother lover my father is in a prison in singapore my house sings to me i cantuse the bathroom without having a floorgasm and before i left i tongued my boyfriend student what is happening to the world day eighty three of free independence friday april 10th 2005 in my weird new bedroom 8 03 a m 8 03 a m my room is so bizarre now ren e wasntlying she really did have the walls painted jet black and a canopy bed carted in here and all my books packed up in big brown boxes it doesnteven really feel like my room anymore it feels like some sort of bizarre ordering accident since when do jet black and canopy beds go together so far i ve only made a list of things i ought to do to fix it 1 try frantically to remove the smell of ren e skanky perfume from my room and replace it with madame matilda candlelight vanilla concoction 2 put my self help books back on the shelf in order of actual self helpfulness 3 change the walls from jet black to some far more calming color like cream or light blue or something 4 get a normal bed 5 put up the orlie and jude posters that i never actually got rid of hee hee 8 45 a m went downstairs for breakfast only to discover that jacques is the only one up reading the daily prophet looking all responsible i swear jacques is going to make a really good stuff businessman someday hey i said hey he said absently putting down his newspaper he smiles nice pajamas i nodded airily until i actually looked down and saw that i was wearing my favorite sintimate lingerie oh this i said laughing nervously this is going to change really quickly hold on so then i apparated up the stairs zapped on some actual clothes and came back downstairs jacques smiled dontworry you re not the only one with interesting underwear today he said tossing me the paper they re after his lucky charms by rita skeeter what is this i asked jacques looking at him curiously jacques only shrugged in that noncommittal i wontexplain anything type of way that he so famous for it just something i thought you might be interested in that all he said fine i said sitting down at the table with him and beginning to read the article was an in depth analysis of harry potter underwear i kid you not his underwear it was like a teen magazine with stupid quizzes what does your underwear say about you apparently harry very attached to his very favorite pair of lucky boxers the lucky shamrocks which he wears to every quidditch game and apparently these boxers have been kidnapped by a crazed fan who wants to do some evil voodoo on them to make him fall in love with her and apparently there a thirty galleon reward for anyone who will return harry boxers to him all i can say is good luck with that those are harry potter knickers lady whoever got them isntgiving them up that easily you have a better chance of finding those boxers on ebay selling for thousands of galleons than you do of getting them through a reward sorry harry your underpants arentcoming back but there is one thing the article got right these girls arentafter the lucky shamrocks they re after his lucky charms if you dontknow what those are i am not going to tell you and you should not be reading my diary you thought i d be interested in reading about harry potter boxers i asked you know this is one of those times when i really wonder what jacques opinion of me is then again he spent half of yesterday looking at my sister ass so he should be worrying what i think of him you were werentyou asked jacques looking at me in that knowing way yes i was i said in that abashed tone of voice stealing the style section from him and sinking into it thinking very dirty thoughts involving harry lucky charms 9 00 a m jacques and i are now talking about our plan for getting ren e to split up mum and aylesford well you cantjust spring it on her says jacques taking a drink from his glass of orange juice you ve got to sort of be nice to her for a couple of days make her more inclined to listen to what you ve got to say he advised i opened my mouth but jacques quickly silenced me yes i know being nice to ren e is no picnic but neither is having aylesford here is it no i agreed because he was exactly right i was all set to complain about making nice with ren e when i should have been concentrating on the greater good breaking up mum and her boyfriend personal trainer interior designer right he said putting his hands together like some devious villain donald trump mixture plotting something so here what i think you should do after a couple of days of softening her up you pull her aside and tell her what you think is going on with your mother and her personal trainer you provide some evidence so that she doesntthink you re loony you ask politely for her help appealing to her vanity above all appealing to her vanity well yes i know no one could do this quite as well as you could type things blatant flattery you know go all out with it and be sure to tell her how pretty and thin she is i must have winced or something because jacques gave me a very sharp look you re the one who wanted your mother and this interior designer to split up and if you re not willing to be nice to your sister over it no i willing i willing i just have to get used to the well the idea of being nice to her i just haventdone it in so long it sort of a foreign concept to me well i sure you ll find the perseverance to be nice to her for two whole days said jacques reassuringly he very good at assuring people of things he should become a psychiatrist or a personal therapist even if he would make a fabulous stuffy businessman or underwear model oh there an odd combination all right all right i said nodding my head in agreement as jacques finished off his tall glass of orange juice you didntget that from the fridge did you i asked pointing to the empty glass in his hand of course he said looking at me curiously why you re going to have a wicked headache later i said which part of dontdrink anything did you not hear nothing safe he asked incredulously not even fruit juices fleur we ve got to go grocery shopping oh no i cantdo that i protested giving jacques a pleading you must understand sort of look i swear jacques has never read a self help book in his entire life i already have a boyfriend what does that have to do with grocery shopping oh everything grocery stores are filled with people who only want to meet other people it like an alternative low key underground dating service just waiting to burst i met lex in the dairy aisle i explained wishing i could rush upstairs and find love where you least expect it and show him the entire section they spent detailing how to find true love in the grocery store grocery stores are also filled with people who need groceries sighed jacques you can always just avoid the single people that true i ll stick next to men with lists and kids and prissy looking old women i said nodding my head i swear fleur sometimes i dontknow what to do with you 9 45 a m okay standing in the dairy aisle trying to figure out which kind of milk is good to get for current diet and future diets skim milk seems to be widely accepted but what i really want is ice cream and it isnttotally insane to replace milk with ice cream because that like a beverage in and of itself dontyou agree 9 50 a m jacques has just finished explaining to me why i cantreplace milk with ice cream and that i to go back and get 2 percent 9 55 a m jacques has now just finished explaining to me that i cantbase my entire love life off of what i read in trashy grocery store paperbacks and that if i buying one i using my own money i ve just said fine be that way in the manner of a six year old child jacques has just said you re acting like a six year old child well yes but do six year olds read trashy grocery store paperbacks with regency women being ravished on the cover noooo 10 35 a m up in my room i swear of all the trashy books of baseless smut i own point of passion is the most baseless and the smuttiest i love it 11 50 a m took a break from my baseless smut to go downstairs and confer with jacques one last time over what to say to ren e but couldntfind him instead found mom in the kitchen nodding along to some cooking show on the radio i asked her where jacques was and she just nodded even more determinedly and said oh up in the exercise studio sweetheart sweetheart shudder we ve got to fix her rushed upstairs because it seems that entire attic has been converted into humongous exercise studio for aylesford to train and slim down entire family except dad in singapore who still his portly old self and will come back to family full of thin androids except me because i ll just walk up to him and pat his shoulder and say i fat too dad i fat too so i get up to attic gym place and enter into exercise studio and find ren e doing supreme belly dancing workout with aylesford who i beginning to think is just a pervert if he has ren e belly dancing and booty shaking and jacques with a ginormous weight bench pressing or whatever that thing is called i briefly pondered over whether or not it would be inappropriate to send gabby a picture of this while she at school to cheer her up i mean it would be akin to sending me a shirtless picture of orlando bloom while i rotting at hogwarts mm hm i d definitely appreciate that and with pictures of jacques you can actually see him lifting weights as opposed to completely still orlando bloom so i eventually decided that for the greater good of gabrielle happiness i just had to take the picture so i took the camera out of my bag and click what the hell fleur no seriously how many times has jacques uttered that sentence it for gabrielle i explained i pressed the button again and took another picture and so is that and this and this and this oh and this one for me click for you he repeated well yes i confirmed for blackmail purposes oh whatever jacques sighed resigned to my freakish ways going back to lifting weights or whatever it is he does gabrielle is going to be ridiculously happy but i am going to avada kedavra myself if something is not done about ren e and mum and as jacques is obviously busy with those large heavy hunks of metal i ll just have to figure it out by myself so i going on a walk 3 00 p m success i have achieved goal number three in my list of plans for new life back in bordeaux and have met up with janine again after what seems like 4 000 years and a day i ran into her on my walk while i was thinking of exactly what one would say to convince manic slut sister to do her maniacal slut thing and steal her mother man ewww so now she in the house right now sitting on my couch drinking two percent milk and listening to the weird sisters on the radio she quite jumpy and hyper and excited kind of like me all the time now so how about later we go down to a restaurant and terrorize waiters or do you not do that anymore i went away for a while i didntget a personality transplant what do you think i said despite how horrible it sounds terrorizing waiters is a really fun way to pass the time please dontthink i evil thank god you re the same old fleur now tell me how everyone ren e as horrible and slutty as ever sluttier i replied and is your mum as mad as can be still i sighed wistfully remembering the fond days when my mother was still insane and wicked no those golden day are long gone now i replied and is jacques still as wickedly hot as he was at beauxbatons she asked it was horridly obvious that this was the question she wanted to ask in the first place see for yourself i said accommodatingly jacques it really wasntentirely necessary for me to shout seeing as how he was just on the stairs but it is always nice for the last time fleur i am not a dog and i cantjust come when you call me he said he always says this but then he always comes does that make sense to you but that not the point that soooo not the point the point is this jacques stops dead in his tracks on the stairs in his full shirtless godliness janine stops talking and looks at jacques stopping dead in his tracks on the stairs in his full shirtless godliness got this so far jacques sees janine looking at him in his full shirtless godliness jacques has brief yet obvious flashback to beauxbatons years and recalls janine the sweet fabulous wonderful girl that he always known and adored you know when he wasntoff with gretchen his actual girlfriend janine is looking at jacques without a shirt on their eyes meet there is a brief connection before they each look away but a brief moment was all i needed to see do you see the point here my two best friends are going gooey gooey over each other they are totally not allowed to do this they are so completely completely completely not allowed to do this this is completely against the rules dontyou see what will happen jacques and janine damn their names sound cute together will be so busy being in love with each other that neither one of them will pay the slightest bit of attention to my woes and everyone knows that jacques is my substitute brain so how am i supposed to get my mother back with my father and not with her trainer dontyou see the point so my mother is happy and giddy and with her aerobics instructor interior designer and this limber thirty year old is my stepfather and my real father is in prison in asia and my boyfriend will break up with me when he finds out i kissed the boy who lived whose boxers are missing and my damn sister will move in and steal my boyfriend and i fat and i still cantuse the bathroom without having a floorgasm that the point now if you ll excuse me i going to go drink some orange juice a n i baaaack gee fleur life really makes mine look calm i so glad my father not in prison and that my mother not weirdly nice because i was really worried about that anyway all you people who review i love you and i dontown any of the songs fleur house sings to her tee hee now scurry along and review now becomes plagued by terrible thought that is if you still like me okay this is where i descend into my pit of despair not just at the thought of not getting reviews because i a review ho but because shudder i have to get into a bathing suit soon further shoulder go along review now
