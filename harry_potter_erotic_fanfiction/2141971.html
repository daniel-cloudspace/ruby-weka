couple of chapters are still with my betas but they will soon be up chapter 1 the boy who died albus dumbledore stared thoughtfully at the ancient wooden box lying on a shelf in the founders cabinet between the sword of godric gryffindor and the sorting hat the box was long thin and decorated with tiny griffins flying about in intricate geometric patterns after a few moments of deep contemplation he waved his wand at it uttering an incantation which caused the lid to hinge back a glow of pure white light surged from the box for a moment and then a dark brown wand rose gracefully upwards floating into his outstretched hand as he felt the gentle surge of power running through the wand he knew with certainty that the dream from which he had just awoken was not just a dream but a vision a communication from the world of witches and wizards long departed from this earth he had dozed off as was his want when the demands of the world permitted such luxuries in the late morning warmth of his sun filled office slowly he became aware of a beautiful yet strangely haunting song which seemed at first to come from far away but grew gradually nearer a white glow appeared all around him then slowly it began to coalesce finally taking the form of a wizard it was a wizard whom he knew very well from the many pictures and sculptures of the founders that were displayed about hogwarts it was godric gryffindor or perhaps more correctly the spirit of godric gryffindor i come bearing a message from the spirits of the great witches and wizards of the light said the spirit in an unearthly voice we are very concerned about the rise of voldemort and the forces of the dark the light is in very grave danger the very future of wizardkind hangs precariously in the balance as you must know we of the spirit world are unable to act directly in the world of the living we have however devised a way to help those on the side of the light in the momentous struggle which lies ahead but how is that possible asked dumbledore the soul of a boy recently departed from the world has been selected for the purpose each of the great witches and wizards of the light has blessed that soul with their own particular powers and magic it was a formidable challenge to find a soul that was worthy of such gifts one with qualities of goodness compassion bravery and selflessness the temptation to abuse such enormous powers will be strong but who can it be mused dumbledore someone recently died i cannot think of anyone with such outstanding moral qualities ah but he is not from your world and yet he knows all about it i think you will be surprised he will appear in this very office at midday you shall call him by the name of rick godfry i would like you to give him my own wand that has lain these past thousand years in the founders cabinet with that the image of godric gryffindor was gone and the vision ended albus dumbledore placed the wand of godric gryffindor on his desk it was midday he felt great anticipation but more than that a sense of optimism and hope that he had not felt for many months after the events of the last school year that had culminated in the confrontation with the death eaters and finally voldemort himself at the ministry of magic the wizarding world had slowly descended into darkness although fudge had finally been forced to acknowledge the return of voldemort his response had been far worse than his previous policy at pretending it was all a just a fairytale invented by albus dumbledore and harry potter fudge immediately declared a state of emergency he issued a decree dissolving the wizengamot and all judicial bodies he issued decrees dissolving all ministry committees and vested all powers in the minister of magic himself cornelius fudge he imposed total censorship on the media so there was no longer a platform to voice dissent or criticise these authoritarian measures all of this was done in the name of security but in fact fudge was doing nothing at all to resist voldemort and his death eaters the auror division had been decimated all but the few yes witches and wizards who were prepared to do fudge bidding with no questions asked had been removed those that remained were not engaged in battling death eaters but enforcing fudge draconian state of emergency most of the death eaters involved in the battle at the ministry of magic had claimed to be under the imperious curse and had been pardoned by fudge who was rumoured to have received barrow loads of gold from lucius malfoy for his mercy only those like the lestranges who had recently escaped from azkaban were convicted but no one knew what had happened to them or where they were most likely they were back in the service of voldemort the only opposition to voldemort was from the order of the phoenix fudge had issued a decree outlawing the order and declaring them an enemy of wizardkind what on earth is fudge game was a question frequently bandied about in the order albus dumbledore doubted that fudge was a death eater or even particularly sympathetic to voldemort cause but still he was clearly in their pocket or more precisely lucius malfoy pockets which were deep and lined with gold fudge was rumoured to have stashed away a mountain of gold in his gringotts vault but dumbledore considered it was probably more than plain avarice which motivated fudge it was his lust for power fudge was determined to keep hold of the reigns of power no matter what come hell or high water or voldemort perhaps he had decided that the dark lord was likely to win in the end and if he was compliant and did the bidding of malfoy and voldemort other proxies he would be seen as an asset by the dark lord and left alone to his little empire dumbledore reverie was interrupted by the sudden appearance of a very startled looking boy standing just a few feet away from his great desk dumbledore rose to greet the boy who jumped back from him with an expression on his face of utter disbelief and shock albus dumbledore he muttered to himself how can that be no this is just a dream oh no said dumbledore this is not a dream i am most certainly professor albus dumbledore headmaster of hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry and it is my great pleasure rick godfry to welcome you to hogwarts rick godfry said the boy my name not rick godfry my name is err um my name um after some moments of anguished thought he finally said how is it that i cant remember my own name and yet i know yours how can that be well rick mused dumbledore nodding his head thoughtfully from side to side death is perhaps the greatest mystery of life there are many theories speculating about the journey of the soul upon death but no one really knows with any certainty what happens what said the shocked boy are you telling me i died he paused for a moment and then looking around in astonishment continued and this is heaven no rick laughed dumbledore our world the wizarding world is not heaven sadly it is very far from that happy state at this time but yes it is true that you died can you remember nothing at all about your death or your previous life the boy stood lost in thought for a minute or two slowly shaking his head from side to side he was trying to grasp at the elusive memories of the life he had lost but they seemed to slip away and dissolve as he reached out towards them dumbledore took the opportunity to scrutinise the boy standing before him about sixteen he thought to himself yes of course they chose someone the same age as harry potter for surely they will become comrades he was a handsome boy with dark brown hair and warm affectionate brown eyes his height and physique were average he had more the look of a scholar than an athlete it was difficult to say exactly what it was about him that was so attractive yet he had a palpable charm an inner glow almost a gift from helga hufflepuff perhaps thought dumbledore it very strange said the boy but i can remember hardly anything about my life i canteven remember my parents or if i had sisters or brothers all i can remember is sitting in the back of a car driving down from the mountains i must have lived in the mountains i think i remember that i was on my way to town to see a movie harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban dumbledore looked a little surprised at this but allowed the boy to continue what is so baffling is that while i can remember nothing of my own life i can remember everything about the world of harry potter all the books and movies and the countless fanfics harry potter books what on earth are you talking about movies i ve heard that word before ah yes those funny moving picture things that muggles find so entertaining but why would muggles have books or movies about harry potter surely they know nothing about him well actually professor dumbledore i a muggle what i can remember from the world i came from is that there were no wizards or witches and no magic those things were make believe they only existed in stories the most famous of those stories was about a boy named harry potter about his friends and his battles with the dark lord voldemort who killed his parents when he was just a baby how utterly extraordinary murmured dumbledore shaking his head his eyebrows shooting up in astonishment the universe never failed to amaze him you have no idea how popular harry potter has become in my world said the boy some people have become quite obsessed with him and his world and if i am not very much mistaken said dumbledore smiling at him you were one of them am i correct the boy nodded he had indeed been obsessed with harry potter and the wizarding world apart from the books and movies and the endless fanfics he could recall spending many of his waking hours daydreaming about that world imagining and wishing he was part of it professor dumbledore he asked thoughtfully do you think it possible that my obsession with your world has somehow caused me to appear in it dumbledore mused for a few moments before answering life is a great mystery my young friend as i said before no one really knows what happens when we die some people believe that our soul reincarnates passing from one life to the next they believe that the thoughts and desires we have during our life actually create the world into which we are subsequently reborn it seems to me that something like that may have happened to you but that doesntmake sense said the boy firstly you get born as a baby not a teenager and secondly this world already existed so how could i have created it well to answer the second question first if we do create the world we are born into from the desires and volitions of our previous life that world must have already been in existence or we could not be born into it i know it seems like a contradiction if you think of time as linear with events following one after the other but perhaps time is not linear perhaps before i die i will dream longingly of a peaceful world in which men and women have lived in love and harmony for hundreds of thousands of years and that very desire will make it real bring it into existence as if it had always existed yes what a wonderful idea i think i might just give it a try and that world will have the most wonderful delicious sweets imaginable you mean to say that if a person is obsessed about some imaginary world and daydreams about it and all the people in it that their thoughts might somehow create that world for them to be reborn into after they die yes indeed there are whole religious systems of belief based upon such ideas what about the answer to my first question asked the boy people are born as babies but i am obviously a teenager ah said dumbledore perhaps you should sit down he waved his hand to summon a chair for rick you see you were not actually born into this world you were sent here he then proceeded to explain what godric gryffindor had revealed to him in the vision rick just sat there with his mouth agape after dumbledore had finished although he could remember nothing of the personal circumstances of his previous life he was quite certain that he had been a muggle and had never performed a single act of magic why would the spirits of the great witches and wizards of the light have chosen him or his spirit or soul or whatever it was for such an important task it just didntmake any sense and he didntfeel especially magical or powerful so it must all be a huge mistake did he even have the qualities of goodness compassion and bravery that godric gryffindor had spoken of to dumbledore rick had no idea he just couldntremember anything about himself in his previous life not even what he had looked like perhaps it was exactly the way he looked now or perhaps it was totally different for all he knew he had might have been a girl he didntthink his name had been rick godfry anyway it just didntfeel right the only thing he could remember was his obsession with the world of harry potter and then he realised that he must have been a boy he clearly recalled an infatuation with one particular witch dumbledore smiled gently at rick seeming to understand the doubts and confusion that were churning through his mind picking up godric gryffindor wand he handed it to rick saying perhaps this will help to convince you when rick hand touched the wand it was as if a switch had been thrown within him it was like somehow being connected to unknown forces or beings beyond his own body perhaps they were the spirits of the great witches and wizards of the light that dumbledore had spoken of it didntfeel so much as if they had entered his body but more like his mind and soul had somehow expanded to merge with theirs he could not identify who or what these powers or beings were but it felt to him that he could know anything that they knew or perform any magic or use any power that they had if he needed it he smiled and nodded to dumbledore to acknowledge that what he had told him must indeed true dumbledore told him about recent events in the wizarding world of how the ministry of magic was under the influence of lucius malfoy and of fudge single minded attempts to retain power at all costs the order of the phoenix is now the only thing preventing voldemort and his death eaters from taking total control but dedicated as we are our numbers are too few to withstand the forces of the dark which are daily increasing if voldemort should choose an all out confrontation so what stopping voldemort from launching a final attack asked rick the prophecy said dumbledore voldemort spent a great deal of effort trying to obtain the full prophecy as he only knew the first part when it became clear that lucius malfoy had fudge and the ministry in his pocket and that the power of the dark forces had become almost unstoppable i decided upon one last desperate gambit i allowed voldemort to acquire the full prophecy it goes the one with the power to vanquish the dark lord approaches born to those who have thrice defied him born as the seventh month dies and the dark lord will mark him as his equal but he will have power the dark lord knows not and either must die at the hand of the other for neither can live while the other survives the one with the power to vanquish the dark lord will be born as the seventh month dies while listening to dumbledore rick had put godric gryffindor wand back on the desk noticing that the effect from holding it had not ceased that initial touch had initiated the link with the unknown forces but it did not seem necessary to keep hold of the wand to maintain it rick was about to ask dumbledore why he had wanted voldemort to know the full prophecy but as soon as the question appeared in his mind so too did the answer you hoped that voldemort would become so obsessed with killing harry potter that he would make it his top priority he would be afraid to make his final move until he was certain that harry potter was dead once and for all and no longer posed a threat to him because harry potter is the only thing that stands between him and his most cherished goal immortality said rick wondering how he knew all this my goodness said dumbledore you appear to be blessed with an unparalleled ability for legilimency which can only have come from merlin himself for those were my very thoughts although i am highly skilled in the art of occlumency you read them perfectly without my even noticing i suggest that you try to hide this skill it will be very very useful to you but should it be known it might make you somewhat unpopular most people feel very uncomfortable at the idea that another person can read their thoughts i suggest you learn how to control your legilimency and use it only when required otherwise you may find life a little chaotic i am sure you will not want to be deluged with the unspoken thoughts of everyone in the great hall at breakfast each morning err no said rick feeling a little embarrassed at his unintended invasion of the headmaster mind i guess i am going to have to learn how to control all the powers i have received so that it just looks like the normal magic of a sixteen year old wizard but how am i going to explain my sudden appearance at hogwarts sir dumbledore had obviously though about this at the welcoming feast tomorrow evening you will simply be introduced as a sixth year student who is joining hogwarts from the remote mountains of new zealand where there are no schools of magic from your accent you could very well be from that part of the world when asked you will say that you are an orphan brought up by muggles you can say that you do not know who your real parents are that way you cannot be traced or have your story challenged you will say that a few years ago a friend of your foster parents who turned out to be a very powerful wizard recognised your magical abilities and began giving you private instruction however because there were areas of wizarding knowledge that he was unable to teach satisfactorily he decided to enrol you at hogwarts to complete your magical education this will help account for any surprising magical abilities you may show particularly if you perform magic that is not in the hogwarts curriculum or known to your professors it will also cover any initial deficiencies of knowledge in other areas such as potions herbology care of magical creatures etc although i suspect that you may turn out to be a fast learner rick looked horrified as he realised how much he didntknow that a student who had spent the past five years at hogwarts would know sensing his distress dumbledore carefully selected a large book from a bookshelf let us try a little experiment shall we rick he said handing the book to rick with an encouraging smile try to absorb its contents rick looked at the huge tome in his hands it was hogwarts a history concentrating on it for a moment he suddenly became aware that he knew everything that was in it as if he had studied it for months and memorized every word and picture amazing he said this gives speed reading a whole new meaning just as i thought said dumbledore smiling rowena ravenclaw has blessed you with her gift of speed reading as you call it but it is time for you to leave i do not want any of the hogwarts professors to discover you here it is not that i donttrust them but our greatest weapon is to keep your true abilities secret for as long as possible and the best way to do that is to hide them from everyone hogwarts professors fellow students even harry potter in fact especially from harry until you absolutely have to reveal yourself to him but why protecting harry will be one of my main objectives surely i can be more effective if he knows protecting harry is your number one priority said dumbledore since i leaked the prophecy to voldemort death eater activity has diminished to very occasional attacks on strategic targets i have it on good authority that voldemort will not make his move while harry is still alive harry potter is all that stands between us and the deluge harry has been very angry and somewhat unstable since the death of sirius black for which he blames himself i am afraid that i have not helped by hiding things from him over the years even though it was with the best of intentions i am not sure that he fully trusts me any longer now with his godfather gone he has no one he trusts enough to turn to for help hiding things from him was a mistake but perhaps revealing the prophecy to him was an even greater mistake said dumbledore sadly letting out a heart felt sigh for now he knows that he must kill voldemort or die in the attempt it is not the fear of death that is playing upon his mind for he is as brave a gryffindor as ever walked the halls of hogwarts rather it is his fear of failing the wizarding world and being responsible for the untold deaths and misery that would be the certain consequence of voldemort victory he added this sense of responsibility is i fear crushing harry you must convince him with deeds not words that he is not alone that help is at hand and victory over the dark forces is possible so where will i go until school starts tomorrow asked rick you will go to diagon alley where you will buy all the clothes you will need including your hogwarts robes your books and other school supplies said dumbledore handing him his sixth year booklist while you are at flourish and blotts i suggest that you go to the curriculum section where you will find the required texts for each year at hogwarts on a separate shelf perhaps a little speed reading may be in order you will take a room at the leaky cauldron tonight and apparate directly to platform nine and three quarters at king cross station tomorrow around ten thirty but but i donthave any wizard money and i dontknow how to apparate and what if they donthave a free room at the leaky cauldron protested rick in alarm i have taken the liberty of owling a reservation in your name to tom at the leaky cauldron said dumbledore in a reassuring voice please remember rick you have the powers of the greatest witches and wizards who ever lived i think you will be surprised at your magical abilities for example if you put your hand in your pocket wanting to take out some galleons to make a purchase i am sure that you will always find them in sufficient number there it is an ability you will have inherited from my late friend nicolas flamel as for apparating all you need to do is concentrate your mind on wherever you wish to be and you shall be there of course i must warn you that you are not yet of a legal age nor do you possess the required licence to apparate so i would advise you to make yourself invisible first then upon arrival when you are certain no one is watching you can make yourself visible again like many of the great witches and wizards of the light you will have the ability to perform wandless magic in order to conceal this you must remember to wave your wand when doing magic in fact until school begins you are subject to the decree for the reasonable restriction of underage sorcery in your mind project a shield around your body which is impenetrable to the minds of others this is a very advanced occlumency skill which will also serve to protect you from whatever means the ministry have of detecting underage magic dumbledore paused a moment while rick closed his eyes and followed his instruction i see that you are a little sceptical said dumbledore smiling reassuringly at rick i am quite certain that you have these and many other powers besides i know the witches and wizards of the light who manifested them and i know that they have blessed you with them you will no doubt have noted during your perusal of hogwarts a history that it is not possible to apparate to or disapparate from hogwarts however i think you may find that it does not apply to you godric gryffindor possessed the ability to apparate unharmed through all magical wards and barriers i am certain he has bestowed this skill on you there is one final thing i would like to add you are not omnipotent your magic is limited to the powers that were bestowed upon you by the great witches and wizards of the light for example you will be totally incapable of performing dark magic while the nature of your birth and your great magical abilities are unusual to say the least your life henceforth will be subject to all the usual laws of nature of this world you are not immortal and you cannot return to your previous existence you will age perhaps raise a family and eventually die in this world like other witches and wizards this is another reason that i would counsel you to keep the circumstances of your birth and of the blessings bestowed upon you a secret from as many people as possible since you seem to be familiar with the story of harry potter you will be aware of the unpleasant burden that comes with fame assuming we win the coming war and you survive you have a long life ahead of you if the truth about you were known you would probably find the fame and notoriety unbearable with that the headmaster rose to his feet and handed gryffindor wand back to rick who tucked it into the inside pocket of his muggle jacket dumbledore extended his hand grasping rick firmly and said take things slowly you have a lot to learn good luck and goodbye for now rick smiled at him and dumbledore noted with satisfaction the look of brave determination on his face as he disappeared from his office if you like this fic please take the time to leave a review at the end of each chapter it only takes a moment and you will make the author very happy chapter 10 a witch prerogative within a matter of days professor dumbledore tonks and hagrid had returned and hogwarts felt like hogwarts once more argus filch and mrs norris were also back prowling the corridors at night ron muttered something about every silver lining having a dark cloud but as harry pointed out it wasntreally hogwarts without them and that the students would have missed the sport of evading them in their after hours excursions professor dumbledore invited harry hermione ron and rick to his study the afternoon following his return he had laid on a lavish tea by way of thanks for their achievements during his absence harry had already met with the headmaster earlier in the day to recount the details of his encounter with lucius malfoy and his subsequent squibbing by the ghost of godric gryffindor i am very proud of the way you led the students to stand up to fudge and his tyranny i believe that in the years to come this will be remembered as one of the great moments in hogwart history just think hermione said ron with a sly grin your name might end up in your favourite book hogwarts a history hermione blushed but the headmaster agreed i would be most surprised if miss granger name and indeed all of your names do not appear in some future edition of that venerable book now i thought about awarding points to gryffindor in recognition of your great achievement however that would detract from the fact that students from all four houses the whole school almost rose up so bravely behind you that right said harry we succeeded because almost all of the students and the professors were willing to stand up and be counted it wouldntbe fair to single out anyone for a special reward or to award house points only to gryffindor well said harry well said the whole school deserves a reward and they shall have it on the final day of term there will be a yule party for the younger students and a yule ball for the older ones harry and ron werentquite sure if this was any kind of a reward at all balls could be very problematic as they had discovered on previous occasions they were going to have to invite girls and ask them to dance the thought terrified them both dealing with umbridge was one thing but girls were quite another while they were lost in fear and loathing of this new challenge that lay ahead hermione spoke up professor dumbledore despite all of our efforts and the support of the other students and professors we would have ultimately failed had it not been for the ghost of godric gryffindor yes miss granger you are quite correct it was fortuitous indeed that the spirits of the hogwarts founders had determined to intervene although it is not perhaps entirely surprising after all this school was their life work one would hardly expect them to stand by and allow it to all be undone by lucius malfoy and cornelius fudge yes sir replied hermione but have you ever heard of a ghost being able to exert so much power in the realm of the living it unprecedented turning wizards and witches into squibs is unheard of yes indeed it is most unusual miss granger and i cannot recall reading of such ghostly powers however remember for every genre of magic ever manifested there must always be a first occasion it seems we are witnessing something new and i for one am very thankful to the ghost of godric gryffindor as they were leaving his study the headmaster caught rick eye in a way that invited him to read his mind the headmaster requested that he visit him alone later that evening allow me to congratulate you said the headmaster when rick apparated to his study after dinner that evening your ghost of godric gryffindor is a masterpiece simply brilliant wherever did you get the idea well it was all rather sudden it sort of happened on the spur of the moment sir when umbridge summoned harry to meet with her that evening i read her mind and discovered that it was a trap and that lucius malfoy was going to be there so i quickly left the great hall and apparated invisibly to the room after lucius malfoy stunned harry i had to do something to stop him taking harry to voldemort but i didntwant to reveal myself so i decided to pretend to be an invisible ghost why the ghost of godric gryffindor asked the headmaster intrigued i dontknow sir it just came to me out of the blue i have his wand and i probably have as many gifts from him as i have from any other witch or wizard it also gave my actions a purpose because if gryffindor ghost had the power i think he would have done all the things that i ve done in his name it just seemed to make sense yes i understand gryffindor was a perfect choice but where on earth did you get the squibbus curse from i ve never heard of it nor read about it dark wizards have searched hard for just such a curse but as far as i know none ever succeeded in finding one your magic comes from the great witches and wizards of the light to the best of my knowledge none of them ever used such a spell rick told the headmaster what hermione had told him about germaine pankhurst book about circe pankhurst claimed that that circe once cast a spell on an evil sorcerer destroying his power circe later turned to the light and she was great witch so i figured that i might have received gifts from her including that spell it strange but generally i not aware of all the spells and powers that i ve been gifted with i only seem to become aware of them when i need them it almost as if the spirit of the one from whom the power comes actually links with me when i need to use it i ve been spending quite a bit of time experimenting with my powers professor however i have discovered a serious limitation i dont think that it possible for me to kill another person not even voldemort it hard to explain it it something very deep within me which seems to be connected to all of life it makes me feel connected to everyone and everything even villains like lucius malfoy killing another person even a deadly enemy would be somehow like killing a part of my self said rick struggling to explain this perplexing feeling so you searched for a non lethal way of neutralizing your enemies asked dumbledore yes replied rick exactly i didntknow for sure if the squibbus curse would work until i tried it on lucius malfoy my backup plan was to apparate him to some remote part of africa without his wand but that would only have been a temporary solution it brilliant said dumbledore impressed now you have the ultimate weapon to use against the forces of the dark and the perfect vehicle in the ghost of godric gryffindor to wield it or simply threaten to use it as you did so effectively with fudge you handled him very well he never likely to be much help to us but at least he will no longer be aiding and abetting the death eaters by the way please be sure not to squib percy weasley it ok professor i checked him out the first time he came to hogwarts i knew he was working for you i do hope that you haventtold anyone only his parents are aware that he is my top informant at the ministry not even his brothers and sister know i guessed as much sir i haventtold a soul i had thought about squibbing fudge so that percy as his deputy could take over but i didntknow if you would want me to that would not be a good idea at the moment rick while voldemort and his death eaters are so strong it is not possible for the ministry to recover its rightful role if percy took over and attempted to rebuild it he would certainly be killed if the ministry began to pose a threat to voldemort it would be destroyed it too visible and too vulnerable a target no i d rather leave fudge in charge for now he such an incompetent fool that voldemort will probably leave the ministry alone and it wonthinder us either fudge is adept at rolling with the punches he ll maintain a neutral position now but behind the scenes percy will be able to pull some strings and also keep me informed of any important news with the state of emergency and the rest of fudge authoritarian measures lifted the ministry may begin to provide at least some measure of order in the wizarding world once more dumbledore proceeded to question rick at length on the development and use of his powers and his efforts at concealing them rick told him of hermione abduction by pansy parkinson and her subsequent rescue from draco malfoy clutches it was fortuitous indeed that miss granger pleas alerted you to her plight if i am not mistaken some kind of special link has developed between the two of you most curious most curious it may be worthwhile investigating it further i couldnthelp but notice you exhibiting a certain affection towards miss granger when you were all in my office earlier today he added his eyes twinkling mischievously rick blushed err are my powers of occlumency that bad he stuttered desperately hoping that all his thoughts and feelings about hermione were not an open book to the headmaster why no rick you are an outstanding occlumens your mind is totally impenetrable however you are not very gifted in hiding your emotions from your face and body language professor snape is adept in these matters i wonder if i could ask him to give you a little coaching perhaps without arousing his suspicions err no thanks sir rick blurted out quickly keen to scotch that idea i sure i can find a good book to read on the subject as you wish said dumbledore with amusement i think that you are likely to have great difficulties in concealing your secrets from miss granger she has a brilliant and penetrating mind and an insatiable thirst for knowledge you must represent quite a mystery to her and she is not the witch to leave any mystery unsolved yeah tell me about it thought rick the following evening in the great hall professor dumbledore announced his intention to treat the students to a yule party and ball as a token of his gratitude for their outstanding bravery the hall was immediately abuzz with whispers and giggles and it took a few moments for the headmaster to restore quiet in order to continue on the final day of term there will be a yule party in the afternoon for students in years one two and three in the evening hogwarts will once again host a yule ball for fourth year students and up it would be wrong to single out individuals for special praise as the great success of your actions was due to the collective solidarity shown by almost every one of you and i am very proud of you all however it would be remiss of me not to acknowledge that both the petition and the strike were the brainchild of miss hermione granger in recognition i have decided that the yule ball will be a little different from previous hogwarts balls it will be a witches prerogative again whispers and chatter filled the hall everyone was asking what on earth a witches prerogative could be ah i seem to have caused some confusion said the headmaster smiling well usually it the prerogative of the wizards to invite the witches to a ball however when it a witches prerogative the tables are turned it the witches prerogative to invite the wizards the hall was once more filled with excited chatter and giggles and added the headmaster using a powerful sonorus charm to make himself heard above the din it is also the witches prerogative to ask the wizards to dance rather than the other way around at this point the noise became deafening the headmaster sat down with a smile on his face if he had intended saying anything further he had obviously given up all hope of being heard hey said harry this witches prerogative thing could work out quite well for us for once we donthave to worry about asking someone to the ball i really hate that yeah me too said ron but err what if no one invites us he asked apprehensively well then we wonthave to go to the ball at all said harry i mean you dontreally want to go to the ball do you i know i don t ron didntseem so sure but he didntwant to look like he was keen to go especially since he might not be invited well there d be lots of really good food remember we could just eat and look at the girls all dressed up in their finest robes err ron said harry didntyou hear what dumbledore just said about it being the witches prerogative to ask wizards to dance we might have to dance all night no i definitely dont want to go right said ron suddenly thinking how embarrassing it would be if no one asked him to dance harry right he thought it would be better not to go at all it was probably the noisiest evening meal that anyone could remember at hogwarts all the noise was coming from the girls as they excitedly discussed who they wanted to invite most of the boys were quiet many of them like ron felt apprehensive wondering if anyone would invite them at all hermione thought the whole thing was a load of nonsense she was not particularly pleased to have her name associated with a ball she pulled a book from her bag and disappeared behind it the most obvious difference in having the witches doing the inviting was that they were all very keen to get the wizard they wanted having the power to decide who they would ask was a rare opportunity and they werentgoing to waste it by waiting to the last minute to make their move like the wizards usually did in fact as the meal came to an end there was as air of great expectation the great hogwarts wizard hunt had begun i wouldntturn around right now if i was you harry advised rick there are about twenty witches hovering about behind you i think they re waiting for you to get up from the table so they can invite you to the ball oh no sighed rick wishing he could just apparate away hermione who was also sitting opposite him looked up and saw all the witches and when she did she realised that she really wanted to invite rick but she wasntsure exactly how to go about it this really wasntin her skill set this witches prerogative was a real bother rick observing her thoughts was trying to think of a way to prompt her he wanted to go with hermione and no one else umm hermione said rick nervously could you do me a a really huge favour and what would that be asked hermione suspiciously well as soon as i get up a whole bunch of witches are going to pounce on me and ask me to go to the ball with them and asked hermione raising her eyebrows exactly what am i supposed to do to rescue you from your hordes of besotted admirers well i d have to refuse them and that would cause a lot of hurt feelings explained rick with a sigh and why exactly would you have to refuse them asked hermione because i d want to keep myself free in the desperate hope that the witch who i really want to go with would invite me that why said rick staring meaningfully into hermione eyes hermione was really in a quandary now she really did want to invite rick and he was making it all too obvious that he wanted her to invite him but it was her prerogative not his to do the inviting but this is supposed to be a witches prerogative protested hermione and you re trying to usurp my prerogative by suggesting that i should invite you no no not at all said rick i i just trying to point out that i currently available but i wontbe for much longer it entirely your prerogative but if you dont hurry up i likely to be usurped by lavender brown he added nervously noticing that lavender had decided to jump the growing queue of witches behind him and was attempting to squeeze herself down on the bench beside him to pop the question hermione was definitely not going to let lavender get away with that ok so err um d youwannacometotheball with me mumbled hermione feeling very self conscious why yes replied rick smiling with relief i thought you d never ask once word got out that hermione granger had snared the most eligible wizard the bunch of witches behind him quickly broke up it was time for plan b or c the hunt was on in earnest now witches were roaming the hall purposefully determined to find a partner many of the wizards were feeling a little intimidated and anxious err harry said rick i wouldntturn around right now if i was you but ron turned around and then turned back even faster hey harry it look like it your turn now somehow i dontthink you re going to get your wish about missing this ball ron and rick werentthe only ones who had noticed the bunch of witches lying in wait for harry ginny weasley had squeezed herself down on the bench next to rick and without further ado spoke to harry from across the table she was blushing so furiously that it was hard to say whether her hair or her face was the redder but she was determined harry will you come to the yule ball with me err sure said harry he couldntrefuse her he didntwant to hurt her feelings and if he was being honest with himself if he did have to go to this stupid ball he couldntthink of anyone he d rather go with ginny quickly got up to go as she rose she met a wall of glares from the witches opposite but they didnthang about for long they still had a mission to complete they needed to find a partner by the time they left the hall that evening most of the eligible wizards those from fourth year and up had been snapped up the competition had been fierce ron was stunned by just how assertive the witches were in comparison to his own timidity talk about taking no hostages he was also pleasantly surprised that a number of witches had actually invited him he was particularly pleased that the first one had been padma patil like her sister parvati she was a dark haired dark skinned beauty but padma seemed less frivolous than parvati she had intelligence as well as looks and had been one of the leading lights in organising the ravenclaws with the petition and the strike ron was surprised that she seemed to have forgiven him for being such a prat when he d taken her to the yule ball in their fourth year and then proceeded to ignore her the whole night he sure wasntgoing to make that mistake again one saturday afternoon harry hermione ron and rick were sitting together in the gryffindor common room hermione was deeply absorbed in a parchment she was writing with books piled up all around hey it the weekend hermione time to relax said ron anyway you said last night that you d just finished your last assignment for the term so what are you working on now with difficulty hermione disengaged herself from her deep train of thought oh didnti tell you i doing a special research paper under professor mcgonagall this year whatever for asked ron you re already taking more classes than everyone else do you really think you need the extra marks dont be silly ron i not doing it for marks although i may earn gryffindor some house points i doing it because it something that really interests me what the topic asked rick the special powers of witches answered hermione what do you mean asked harry confused i thought witches and wizards could all perform exactly the same kinds of magic i mean we all learn the same stuff here at hogwarts dontwe well that what most wizards would like to believe said hermione with a superior smirk and generally it true however there seem to be some types of obscure magic which only witches have been known to perform ron was sceptical well i ve never heard that before and i grew up in the wizarding world i mean if it true why isntit a well known fact why isntit mentioned in the history books why isntit taught here at hogwarts why arentthere special subjects just for witches because all the things you just mentioned are controlled by wizards that why said hermione with growing passion how many ministers of magic or even departmental heads have been witches how many hogwarts headmistresses have there been well there was umbridge said ron with a smirk dont mention that stupid witch said hermione dismissively this is a serious subject the wizarding world has always been controlled by wizards i mean there were times like those of the founders when witches rose to prominence and had their rightful influence but wizards have almost always been in control of the political establishment the educational institutions the publishing houses and the media even in so called enlightened times like these when witches are not being overtly oppressed wizards still have the levers of power and communication firmly in their hands and it allows them to largely define the reality which everyone in the wizarding world believes in the wizarding world is far behind the muggle world in according females an equal place in society and even the muggle world has a long way to go just dontget me started on that the bottom line is that wizards have been in control and they have never been interested in the special powers of witches so it has always been overlooked and largely invisible err want a game of wizard chess harry asked ron desperate to escape from hermione impassioned lecture harry readily agreed and they were soon absorbed in their game so you re hoping through doing this special research paper and publishing it to make these special powers of witches more visible asked rick impressed once again with hermione gumption yes that right professor mcgonagall is very interested and supportive if i can define and document a large enough body of witch magic she says that we may be able to run special seminars here at hogwarts just for witches eventually there may even be an elective course in the subject at senior levels i impressed said rick so what kinds of witch magic have you identified so far well there are the obvious ones that derive from the anatomical differences between witches and wizards of course there is the whole area of witch midwifery then there is magical birth control said hermione blushing slightly and averting her gaze from rick much of this magic goes back centuries she continued trying to assume a more academic tone the spells have been handed down from mother to daughter but the magic has never been officially recognised or recorded however there is another area which is far more interesting again it relates to differences between males and females but it has more to do with the differences in emotional make up than err physical differences that sounds interesting said rick the origin is probably the nurturing instinct that witches have for their babies did you know that witches seem to know to some extent how their baby is feeling many witches can feel their baby pain if it is sick for example it very useful before the baby is able to talk and tell its mother what it feeling so is this magic restricted to witches with babies asked rick becoming increasingly interested no there is plenty of anecdotal evidence that even witches who have never had children can manifest this kind of magic it called empathetic magic and it requires neither a wand nor a spell like other forms of magic there is a variance between individuals in their ability to perform it but the key factor seems to be affection you mean the more a witch likes someone the stronger it will be asked rick exactly said hermione there is a story about helga hufflepuff in her earlier years at hogwarts she had a err lover it wasnt gryffindor or slytherin in fact his name is unknown he was a wizard who lived in a village on the other side of the forbidden forest and he would sometimes cross it to err visit helga there were probably as many dangerous creatures living in the forbidden forest at that time as there are now the story goes that on several occasions this wizard was badly injured by some dangerous creature he d encountered but because of her great gift for empathetic magic helga would immediately know that he was in danger and where he was and would go to rescue him just like i knew when you were in danger down in the dungeon mused rick certain that he had discovered what his link with hermione was and from whom the gift had come he reflected on how fortunate it was that even though he was a wizard he had been blessed with witch magic well i have no idea how you heard me calling you and how you found me that night but it obviously wasnt empathetic magic unless of course you ve got anatomical secrets that you re hiding as well said hermione with a smirk please take a few moments to leave a review chapter 11 s ances and interrogations professor trelawney had become obsessed with the ghost of godric gryffindor ever since his appearance in the great hall unfortunately she had missed the spectacle since she rarely descended from her lofty spiritual abode to join the school for mundane meals she was however utterly thrilled that this venerable visitor from the world beyond had returned to hogwarts and she was determined to make contact with him as hogwart self proclaimed mystical mistress she saw it as both her right and her duty however the ghost did not appear to share her enthusiasm for over a week all of her divination classes had been devoted to this her sacred mission of reaching out to the ghost of godric gryffindor but with no success at all finally she decided that the most conducive environment for forging contact with the ghost would be his own former abode gryffindor tower lavender and parvati enthusiastically agreed to help her organise a s ance which was to take place one evening in the gryffindor common room all the gryffindor students were requested to attend this unusual event trelawney hoped that the ghost might come to his own students the tables were arranged into a large circle with the students seated around the outside the lights were dimmed and incense was lit lavender and parvati had made artful mystical arrangements upon the tables they were covered with an assortment of crystal balls tarot cards and various other divination and psychic paraphernalia it was all rather impressive hopefully the ghost of godric gryffindor would be impressed enough to put in an appearance hermione granger however was not impressed she was annoyed very annoyed she d been working hard on her research paper when her table had been all but pulled out from under her to join the mystical circle she was outraged everyone knew that trelawney was nothing but a fraud and that divination was nonsense suitable only for light entertainment well maybe not everyone knew though hermione lavender and parvati who had stolen her table from under her obviously didntknow but hermione most definitely did know and she was furious at having her serious research work interrupted by this mindless nonsense as she gathered her books together intending to go to the library ron called out hey hermione where are you going you ll miss all the fun he didnthave any more faith in trelawney than hermione but he thought it might be entertaining i going to the library so that i can get some work done she replied huffily i donthave time for trelawney theatrics you never know hermione she might just manage to summon the ghost of godric gryffindor said harry who seemed more willing than his friends to give the divination teacher a chance sometimes she gets lucky i mean it was trelawney who gave the prophecy and she given a couple of accurate predictions since then that makes her success rate about one genuine achievement every five years replied hermione archly i really donthave the patience to wait for the next one err where rick she asked looking for him among the students seated around the circle of tables hermione was in fact very interested in the enigmatic ghost of godric gryffindor he was number two on her list of great mysteries that she was determined to solve but she didntexpect trelawney and her silly s ance to yield any useful information rick was mystery number one and hermione had a suspicion that there was some kind of link between him and mystery number two for one thing no one could remember seeing rick around on the two occasions that the ghost of godric gryffindor had appeared perhaps she should stay in the common room she might find some clues to one or both of these annoying mysteries which were starting to drive her crazy he over there said harry pointing to a table in the corner of the room that had not been requisitioned for the circle he was reading a book and did not appear to be taking much interest in the preparations for the s ance hermione was about to go over to join him but then changed her mind instead she joined the silly s ance circle choosing a spot where she could surreptitiously observe rick hey hermione called ron so you decided not to go to the library after all good move you can observe the special powers of witches firsthand with trelawney he added snidely hermione glared at ron and was about to make a very unflattering remark about the divination professor and her art when the portrait hole swung open professor trelawney made her usual dramatic entrance looking even more ethereal and mysterious than usual she was evidently anticipating great happenings this evening parvati and lavender led her to the special place that they had prepared for her in the circle everyone please hold hands she said we are gathered here this evening to summon the ghost of godric gryffindor she closed her eyes and nodded her head slowly from side to side in a dream like way focus your mind on godric gryffindor she instructed in a low ethereal voice open your inner eye and visualise him standing before us in the centre of our sacred circle call him silently from deep within you he will surely come but he didntcome after some minutes professor trelawney called out in an eerie voice godric gryffindor oh brave and noble founder of hogwarts we beseech thee to grace us with thine presence please make some sign to show that you hear me nothing happened no sign nothing the students were becoming restless murmurs of discontent could be heard from around the circle professor trelawney continued her attempts at enticing godric gryffindor to make an appearance each time adding more and wilder superlatives to her litany however he staunchly resisted all entreaties finally she announced that it appeared that the ghost of godric gryffindor was otherwise engaged that evening however since they were all gathered together in a mystic s ance circle she would attempt to contact others from the spirit world she tried summoning helga hufflepuff and then rowena ravenclaw but without success there was general opposition when she proposed summoning salazar slytherin the gryffindors were not having him or even his ghostly apparition in their common room so she tried merlin morgana mopsus and merwyn the malicious all without success ron suggested she try the great wizard chess master montague knightly as there was a particular opening gambit that he was keen to ask him about but he didntshow either after attempting without success to summon the ghost of every great witch and wizard that she and the students could think of professor trelawney made a remarkable discovery first she consulted her crystal ball then she unfurled and examined her personal star chart which she carried with her everywhere then she did a quick tarot reading i am very sorry to have to tell you she announced to the students but all the signs concur this particular evening is not at all auspicious for contacting the spirit world i do apologise i should have checked before arranging the s ance for this evening perhaps we can try again at a more auspicious time she thanked everyone for their participation and began packing away her crystal balls and talismans and other baubles and bangles and beads lavender and parvati were escorting her to the portrait hole when suddenly the lights dimmed and a cold presence made itself felt throughout the common room nothing could be seen but a ghostly voice reverberated throughout the room sibyll trelawney i come with a message for you from the spirit world are you the ghost of godric gryffindor have you have finally heard our summonses and come asked professor trelawney in ecstasy she seemed to have totally missed the irony of the fact that the ghost had not appeared until after she had ceased summoning it yes i am the ghost of godric gryffindor and i have come on account of your summonses in fact i have a message for you from some of the other inhabitants of the spirit realm rowena ravenclaw helga hufflepuff merlin morgana and all the others that you have been so enthusiastically summoning this evening how wonderful so you did hear me our s ance was a success after all how marvellous this is the most exciting moment of my life to have been in contact with the spirits of so many great and illustrious witches and wizards the divination professor was in raptures but you must have noticed that none of us responded to you umm yes why was that asked trelawney sounding a little perplexed well you see we dontgive interviews i beg your pardon we dontgive interviews you do understand my meaning dont you asked the ghost emphasising each word very clearly err no replied trelawney now completely confused perhaps i need to put it a little more bluntly said the ghost sounding annoyed the message i have for you from the inhabitants of the spirit world is that we do not wish to be disturbed your little s ance tonight and your other feeble attempts to contact me over the past few days and indeed your attempts at contacting various members of the spirit world from time to time as the spirit takes you disturb our peace we have a message for you and the message is do not disturb we do not want you to contact us at all rest assured that if there is anything of great import that we wish you to know we will contact you i believe there is a colloquial expression in your world which sums it up rather nicely dontcall us we ll call you the ghost of godric gryffindor said no more and appeared to have departed a very embarrassed professor trelawney followed suit and dived through the portrait hole laughter and giggling and much joking at professor trelawney expense ensued but there was one witch who was not laughing giggling or joking hermione had been keeping an eye on rick while the ghost of godric gryffindor was present in the common room rick had been slumped back in his chair as if he were asleep or perhaps unconscious she had kept checking on him and he was like that the whole time the ghost was present no one else would have noticed as he was in the corner and all attention had been focused on professor trelawney by the portrait hole at the other end of the common room as soon as the ghost was gone rick was sitting upright and very much awake he was now laughing as loudly as everyone else but when his gaze reached hermione and he saw the way that she was scrutinising him he stopped laughing and quickly looked away hermione walked over and sat down next to him she knew she was on to something but she wasntquite sure what this time she wasnt going to let him wriggle off the hook rick she said looking at him accusingly i know you had something to do with the ghost of godric gryffindor appearance i was watching you the whole time he was in the room and you were slumped unconsciously in your chair you might as well tell me the truth you know because i determined to find out rick took out his wand and cast an imperturbable charm around them so they couldntbe overheard he also cast his wizard repelling charm he knew he was going to have to deal with hermione curiosity and he didntwant to arouse anyone else s hermione meanwhile had removed one of the colour coded folders from her bulging book bag she opened it up and started adding notes to the bottom of one of the many parchments it contained i a medium said rick attempting to deflect hermione i was channelling the ghost of godric gryffindor i have psychic powers hermione looked unconvinced she was not a great believer in such things but she added a further note to her parchment this is my rick godfry dossier she said matter of factly i ve recorded the details of every strange event that has occurred around you since the start of term i guess i should feel flattered said rick but he didn t he felt more like a fox cornered by a pack of ravenous bloodhounds let start with your name shall we said hermione turning to the beginning of her thick dossier err what about my name asked rick perplexed it an anagram of godric as in godric gryffindor what said rick genuinely puzzled rick god fry put the god in front of the rick and you get godric k didntyou realise that umm no it never occurred to me how strange i wonder if it was intentional rick mused intentional what exactly do you mean by intentional asked hermione raising her eyebrows rick didntanswer hermione noted his comment in her dossier then she picked up rick wand from the table and started examining it carefully it just a wand said rick nervously he wished he d put it away in his robes he was usually very careful to keep it concealed he really didntwant hermione examining it but if he grabbed it from her it would only increase her interest i know it looks a bit different but that because it s err it made from err the wood of an unusual tree err the giant kauri but hermione wasntlistening she had transformed her own wand into a magnifying glass and was examining rick wand painstakingly i knew it there it is she said triumphantly pointing to a small symbol at the top of the wand it the rune of the moor barrow we learned about it in ancient runes this rune symbolises the power and strength of godric gryffindor it was etched into his wand i thought i recognised this wand from a painting of gryffindor it very distinctive looking rick straight in the eye she said this is godric gryffindor wand isntit rick err yes said rick with a sigh there was no point denying it what on earth are you doing with godric gryffindor wand professor dumbledore gave it to me said rick trying to make it sound like it was no big deal i knew it was displayed in the founders cabinet in the headmaster office it mentioned in hogwarts a history but why would he give it to you err because the ghost godric gryffindor asked him to would you believe said rick smiling and trying to lighten things up a little no said hermione i would not believe there is absolutely no need to introduce psychic phenomena everything can be explained from well established and accepted magical principles it unbelievable that professor dumbledore would give you this wand it an antiquity but i dontimagine that you stole it so he must have given it to you but why hermione stopped talking for a few moments while she jotted down some notes about the wand umm it because i a psychic said rick trying to sound convincing the ghost godric gryffindor came to me in a vision and said that he wanted me to have his wand so that i could channel him then he asked the headmaster to give it to me and he did see there really no great mystery at all let review some of your activities said hermione totally ignoring rick attempts at a psychic explanation she was working her way down a highlighted summary list we ll start with how you dealt with those death eaters who attacked the train on the way to hogwarts but err that was professor dumbledore protested rick you heard him ordering everyone to stay in their compartments yes i did or at i least thought i did however when we got to hogwarts i discovered that the headmaster had been here all the time i made some enquiries you locked harry in his compartment to stop him getting off the train impersonated the headmaster and then somehow managed to dispose of twenty death eaters rather impressive i must say i suppose you have an invisibility cloak or something like that but there is nothing supernatural about that continued hermione nor is there anything supernatural about apparition i guessed some time ago that you can apparate and you subsequently admitted it of course it completely illegal as you re under age and could not possibly have obtained a licence i just cantunderstand why you haventbeen picked up by the ministry detectors for illegal underage magic she added jotting down a note to this effect in her burgeoning dossier and somehow you are even able to apparate at hogwarts perhaps professor dumbledore modified the castle wards to allow it there must be a logical explanation it seems that i shall have to accept that hogwarts a history isntalways right at least not where you re concerned she said in a tone of regret just as a child might concede a cherished belief of childhood such as the tooth fairy you apparated back to get your potions things the first day and then apparated down to the dungeons getting there before harry and me then you answered all those questions from snape hermione picked a parchment out from her dossier and examined it carefully it contained all of snape questions along with notes on each one i checked them out the answers to some of these questions can only be found in books or research papers that you could not possibly have accessed so how did i know the answers then asked rick becoming more and more nervous under the onslaught of hermione accusations you plucked them straight out of snape mind it the only logical explanation you re a legilimens arentyou i think it totally outrageous that you are allowed to do that in class why it unethical and unfair for the rest of us who have to find things out the hard way oh said hermione suddenly as another piece of the puzzle dropped into place i remember the first time we met in flourish and blotts i was watching you for several minutes although you didntnotice me you were walking along the shelves running your finger along all the books what exactly were you doing err day dreaming said rick weakly oh no you weren t i ve read that rowena ravenclaw had an amazing gift she just had to touch a book and she would immediately know its contents no other witch or wizard has ever been known to possess that ability but you do dontyou rick rick remained mute deciding that the best policy was to neither confirm nor deny hermione accusations that explains your perfect knowledge in every subject how you know things that you have no no right to know it explains how you are able to quote hogwarts a history chapter and verse it just not fair how am i supposed to compete with someone who can absorb a book in seconds or pull the answer to an examination question out of the teacher mind hermione single minded pursuit of unravelling the mystery of rick godfry had temporarily become sidetracked by her outrage at this enormous injustice that had been visited upon her who said we need to compete asked rick attempting to mollify her outrage err anyway professor dumbledore knows all about me if i do possess any unfair advantages he ll know about them and what about the other professors do they know does anyone else know about your secret abilities no only professor dumbledore and apparently a bloodhound witch named hermione granger sighed rick hermione couldnthelp but smile a little at the compliment and rick pun but then she immediately switched back to the main subject of her interrogation and was on the offensive once more you read malfoy mind in potions that day didntyou that how you knew he d put the powdered death caps into our folliculus rerverus potion and how you knew he had the envelope in his pocket she said jotting these details down on a parchment as she spoke and that how you knew that he was about to fling a furnunculus curse at me instead of casting a shield charm that day in defence against the dark arts of course i d already worked out that it was you who d thrown up the reflecting shield to protect me and send malfoy curse back at him but i couldntfigure out how you knew what he was about to do added hermione making a further note and then there were all those times when malfoy and his inquisitorial thugs were stalking us in the corridors you always seemed to know what was going to happen come on rick admit it you re a legilimens you must be it the only explanation rick tried to look away but hermione was determined to look him in the eye she suddenly gasped why rick that means that you can read my mind you must know exactly what i thinking you must know exactly how i feel about everything she said blushing fiercely and hiding her face in her hands look hermione i going to be completely honest with you on this one it is true that i have err some legilimency abilities i ve used them to keep an eye if you will on draco umbridge and anyone else who might pose a danger to harry and our side and what else demanded hermione ok well i may have used them in class on some occasions to err you know get the right answer i used them on snape as you guessed when he gave me that grilling in our first potions lesson you cannot imagine how awful it is in there in where in snape mind answered rick distastefully oh so is he really on our side asked hermione i sure you would have tried to find that out yes and yes yes i did try and yes he committed to dumbledore absolutely but you have to believe me that i haventbeen going around just reading people minds without a good reason i ve only used legilimency to protect harry and help those on our side not for my own curiosity and amusement or romantic interests so you haventbeen looking into the minds of any of us your friends then asked hermione still suspicious umm well i do check harry sometimes like when we re going to bed at night just to make sure that he not planning to go out and fight a duel or something like that please donttell him he d be furious with me i just trying to protect him but that about it if i d been monitoring everyone i would have picked up on ron giving pansy the password and what about me asked hermione have you been probing my mind no said rick emphatically i ve made a special point of not using legilimency on you why is that asked hermione curiously well umm because i like umm well because of how i feel about you said rick shyly hermione blushed she found herself feeling quite uncomfortable and quickly turned her attention back to the parchment with her highlighted summary list did you really use legilimency on lucius malfoy at the quidditch match i remember now that you claimed you did but i didntbelieve you at the time we were a hundred yards away from him to use legilimency you need to be in very close proximity to the other person and you need to cast the legilimens spell which you didntdo umm i guess there must be different kinds of legilimency said rick look hermione it really true that i psychic err in a manner of speaking why wontyou believe me the reason i can speed read like rowena ravenclaw is because i can contact her spirit hermione looked sceptically at rick she was looking for a rational logical explanation of his powers not one that involved the supernatural and i really do have empathetic magic that how i heard you calling me from the dungeon that night i think it because of my connection with helga hufflepuff oh piffle puff that what it is all this mystical nonsense is just a big red herring designed to throw me off the track said hermione defiantly i dontknow what alerted you to my plight that night in the dungeon maybe it was just an intuition and as for finding me i suppose professor dumbledore has given you a magical map of hogwarts similar to harry marauders map after all if harry dad and his friends could create something like that i sure professor dumbledore can rick realised that hermione was simply not going to accept his hints at a supernatural source of his abilities and there was no way that he was going to tell her the whole story she would steadfastly refuse to believe anything that she could not understand or explain unless he could provide scientific proof ok said rick how about we conduct a scientific experiment to determine whether or not i can actually contact helga hufflepuff but how are you going to prove something like that scientifically asked hermione wait a minute i ve got it i ll test you i have several books which contain rather obscure information about her that doesntappear elsewhere she pulled several library books from her bag holding them up for rick to see but not letting him touch them have you read any of these she asked i want you to swear a wizard oath no said rick looking at the books i haventread or speed read any of those books and i promise not to read the answers from your mind i swear a wizard oath to it go on ask away alright agreed hermione what was helga hufflepuff favourite flower rick closed his eyes and saw crocuses blooming at the edge of the forbidden forest the crocus what was her favourite bird he saw a flock of swifts wheeling high over the lake the swift what was her mother maiden name fawcett what was her favourite desert gooseberry tart her favourite drink elderberry wine you promise you haventcheated said hermione in defeat resigned to the fact that rick could answer every question she asked him you know i couldnthave broken my wizard oath hermione answered rick the answers all came directly from helga hufflepuff i promise you so now that i ve proved that i am able to contact helga hufflepuff will you accept the possibility at least that she could be assisting me to do empathetic magic after all she famous for it i d really like to learn more about the subject and i sure it will be useful for your special research paper hermione too was keen to learn more about empathetic magic she realised that rick was using her interest in it to sidetrack her to end her interrogation she had learned a lot tonight and added some valuable notes to her dossier it was obvious that rick was not going to give in and divulge his secrets she would have to figure it out for herself hermione knew she was making progress and that she would solve the puzzle of rick godfry sooner or later he had been in quite a bit of discomfort at times during her cross examination hermione took pity on him and decided not to subject him to further questioning for tonight at least so how do you propose proving that you can do empathetic magic then asked hermione for the next week at random times i d like you to try summoning me said rick summon you how with my mind well yes and with your err your feelings said rick finding it a little difficult to explain you need to feel that you really want me to be there with you write down the time and place if i feel you summoning me i ll write down the time and where i think you are then at the end of the week we ll compare notes all right but no using your magic hogwarts map to find me you can only use empathetic magic agreed agreed said rick i know ffn has been in read only mode a lot of late and it wasnt possible to post reviews but it back to normal now you can review my enhanced stats show that lots of people have been reading this fic but sadly there are very few reviews please take a few moments to leave a review now chapter 12 a witch a wizard and a room of requirement rick i would like you to spend the christmas holidays with the weasleys said professor dumbledore one evening when rick had apparated to his office mrs weasley is demanding that i allow harry to spend the holiday with them and well she can be very persuasive when she has her heart set on something it would also be good for harry morale for reasons of his own safety i had no alternative but to insist that he spend the whole summer holiday with the dursleys mrs weasley has invited him and i dontwant him to have to remain behind at hogwarts this christmas as well but will he be safe sir i believe so especially if you are with him the hogwarts express will be protected by a defensive shield members of the order will escort you between king cross station and the burrow which now serves as the backup headquarters for the order and has been heavily warded its defences are now equal to those of grimmauld place but the weasleys may not want a stranger staying for christmas said rick feeling a little uncomfortable about intruding on their family celebrations ah i have already spoken with molly about you and she is keen for you to come the more the merrier were her exact words as i recall she wouldnthear of you spending christmas all alone at hogwarts so far away from your home my home thought rick yeah it far away that for sure and not just because it may be on the other side of the planet it was a different planet a different time a different reality not that i complaining i wouldntwant to be anywhere else but right here but still mrs weasley has no idea just how far from home i really am what did you tell her about me asked rick just the usual story and that you are a good friend of ron and harry and played an important part in the recent student uprising she knows nothing of your powers or indeed that you saved her daughter life in the quidditch match against slytherin a friend of ron thought rick who would have thought a month ago that he could be described as a friend of ron but it was true after confessing how he had been duped by pansy into divulging the gryffindor password ron seemed to have had a road to damascus experience and was at last able to see rick without prejudice they had been comrades since the struggle against umbridge and even though ron was unaware of how much rick had done he now recognised him as a powerful and valuable ally there was still some discomfort between them around hermione while there was nothing overt between rick and hermione it was pretty obvious that they liked each other and they were going to the yule ball together ron had finally been forced to accept that hermione loved him as a friend and a brother and not the way he would have preferred however since padma had invited him to the yule ball his romantic fantasies seemed to have shifted somewhat from hermione to padma not to mention some of the other witches who had also invited him rick was aware however that even if ron feelings towards hermione were now more brotherly he still needed to be careful he remembered how protective ron was of ginny and how he had seen off dean thomas after a week of their empathetic magic experiment rick and hermione compared notes hermione had attempted to summon rick thirty times rick had detected eleven of them accurately identifying the time and the location from which she had summoned him you re absolutely sure that you didntcheat or use your magic hogwarts map or whatever it is to find me asked hermione she was stunned at rick success and could no longer deny the fact that rick could do empathetic magic i promise said rick smiling but the experiment isntover yet what do you mean asked hermione curiously well eleven out of thirty isntall that good i d like to see if it possible to improve upon it explained rick but it amazing that you even sensed me summoning you once it quite extraordinary and remember i was just summoning you for experimental purposes it wouldnthave been as forceful as if i was really in distress like when malfoy had me captive in the dungeon i think there a way to strengthen both your summons and my receptivity said rick thoughtfully but how asked hermione i ll show you said rick smiling but not here in the common room come on let go go where asked hermione puzzled to the room of requirement said rick softly but why do we have to go all the way to the room of requirement trust me said rick and anyway it not that far if you know how to find it hermione was curious as to what rick meant so she agreed to go with him it was still an hour until the night curfew rick turned left down a corridor not more than twenty yards from the gryffindor portrait hole he touched the wall and a large polished door with a golden handle suddenly appeared after you witches first said rick chivalrously opening the door for an astonished hermione but this cantbe the room of requirement said hermione in confusion the entrance is opposite that ridiculous tapestry of barnabas the barmy trying to turn trolls into ballerinas it nowhere near here the room of requirement said rick with a smile is where ever you require it to be just as it always how ever you require it to be hermione entered the room and looked around most of the light came from a cosy fire crackling in a large fireplace along one wall in front of the fire was a very large and comfy looking leather couch on either side of the couch were low tables each with an elegant candelabra and vases of beautiful flowers upon them on one table there was a pitcher of pumpkin juice and two glasses on the other there were several plates of delicious looking pastries wow said hermione the room of requirement never looked so inviting rick and hermione sat down taking in the soft ambience of the room well said hermione curiously so how do you think empathetic magic can be strengthened i ve never read anywhere that it possible well said rick the way i see it empathetic magic depends upon the feelings between the people involved yes that obviously the crucial factor agreed hermione a mother love for her baby is fierce and powerful she mused then there was helga hufflepuff being summoned by her lover added rick so if you could strengthen the feelings between two people the empathetic magic between them would increase said hermione thoughtfully yes that makes sense but how can you strengthen the feelings hermione had been thinking hypothetically up to this point suddenly she realised that the two people in question for the purposes of their experiment at least were her and rick hermione looked up at rick her mouth dropped open as she suddenly began to suspect where this might all be leading rick meanwhile was trying very hard to convince himself that understanding his powers of empathetic magic was really very important to the cause dumbledore himself suggested that i investigate my link with hermione so it must be important important enough to justify me using my charm this is all for the cause he told himself why you just want to snog dontyou demanded hermione outraged yeah i d really like to responded rick candidly without thinking but but no that not what i meant that not really what this is about at all i mean what i mean is i really do want to learn more about empathetic magic i think it could be really important to investigate it and err i want to see what happens if i err kiss you he mumbled what you want to kiss me gasped hermione you dontunderstand said rick desperately what i mean is if we were to kiss then err our feelings for each other might grow and then the empathetic magic between us would grow stronger dontyou see then we could do our summoning experiment for another week and see if there is any change in the success rate just think of it as a something we re doing err purely in the interests of science rationalised rick hoping to appeal to hermione insatiable thirst for knowledge so you dont really want to kiss me then it all just in the interests of science said hermione arching an eyebrow rick realised he was now trapped if he said he didnt want to kiss her hermione would probably slap his face and walk out but if he said he did want to kiss her she would also probably slap his face and walk out rick now understood what it felt like to be on the horns of a dilemma not very good he couldntsay yes and he couldntsay no so he just did it he leaned over and kissed her rick had dreamed of this moment for a long time both in this life at hogwarts and also often in his past life but it wasntanything like the way he had fantasised about it it was the most magical moment of his life either life he felt himself flow together with hermione it was a bit like the experience in dumbledore office when he took gryffindor wand it was that same feeling of connectedness he felt totally connected with hermione and also connected with everything at the same time rick was stunned hermione had stopped thinking by the time rick lips had touched hers she had looked into his eyes and felt him enveloping her her thoughts had stopped and once she stopped thinking analysing assessing and evaluating the situation it was easy she really wanted this she welcomed his kiss and met his intense feelings and passion with equal intensity like rick she too felt the powerful connection between them it was as if their souls had somehow merged both together with each other and with all existence by the time rick and hermione got back to the deserted gryffindor common room it was well past curfew they didntwant to part to go their separate ways to their separate dormitories so they sat together in front of the fireplace rick i think we should keep our our relationship to ourselves for now said hermione i donteven understand it myself i mean what happened between us tonight i certainly dontwant to try explaining it to anyone else or face a grilling from lavender and parvati or ginny or anyone yeah i understand how you feel replied rick putting his arm around hermione and snuggling up close to her i feel exactly the same way let keep it our secret i sure dontwant to have to face ron when he finds out we re just getting to be friends rick can you imagine what all those witches with crushes on you are going to do to me if the news gets out i ve already been getting death glares ever since they found out that you are going to the yule ball with me i think there would be some serious interest in voodoo around here and a ready market for hermione granger dolls agreed said rick life will be a whole lot easier for both of us if we keep what between us to ourselves well i just hope we can hide it said hermione the bond between us is so strong i mean i never imagined that it was possible to feel so close so much a part of so connected with another person i ve never been in love before she continued shyly turning her face away from rick and staring into the dying embers of the fire i ve read some of those romance novels and i know all about the emotions and passions and fireworks that are supposed to happen well they sure did happen but there is something else as well something quite different that not in the books but i cantexplain it there are no words to describe it hermione granger at a loss for words quipped rick i feel i ve been paid the ultimate compliment but seriously i feel the same way as you and i also at a loss to describe it we seem to have bonded together at some very deep level it more than love it i dontknow spiritual magical the only thing i know for sure is that it happened in part because of my umm special magical powers i sure of it hermione sighed and you still wonttell me about them will you you re still keeping secrets from me arentyou rick why cant you just be open and honest with me why cantyou tell me everything she asked in frustration hermione please believe me i do want to tell you everything it not easy keeping so many secrets from everyone from my friends and especially from you there nothing i d like better than to unburden myself and tell you the whole truth about myself everything do you have any idea how lonely it is for me can you imagine what it like having to constantly hide behind barriers do you realise how hard it is to maintain this i have to keep track of what a whole lot of different people know about me and try to be consistent and not contradict myself do you really think i enjoy having to conceal the truth asked rick sighing heavily but why do you have to asked hermione and anyway i thought you said that professor dumbledore knew all your secrets professor dumbledore does know everything and he told me that i should keep as much secret as possible please trust me hermione hermione sighed in resignation i do trust you rick you ve saved harry and me enough times to earn my trust but it a bit scary i feel so close to you now almost like i no longer a separate individual yet at some levels i just dontknow you at all where did you really come from i dontbelieve that story about you being an orphan from the remote mountains of new zealand it just too convenient what are you she continued it like when i discovered that there really was something other than just muggles that there really were witches and wizards who can really do magic and that i was one of them but you are just like some other category again all by yourself you break all the rules you apparate around hogwarts you do magic which no one has ever heard of that not in any of the books and now there this strange magical bond between us how did you get all your extraordinary magical powers why i dont even know what all those powers are or what kind of magic you are capable of you keep it all hidden and it just so frustrating said hermione resentfully maybe you should just think of me as a wizard of requirement said rick trying to lighten things up what do you mean asked hermione puzzled well explained rick just like the room of requirement manifests because it required i here at hogwarts because i required by who asked hermione confused by everyone on the side of the light professor dumbledore harry maybe even you said rick with a grin rick that silly is it if the room of requirement can manifest and manifest in the way that it needed then why not a person asked rick but rick a room isntlike a person it isntborn it doesnt have a life a history all the memories of childhood growing up and all of that protested hermione neither do i said rick what do you mean asked hermione flabbergasted dontyou remember your life before you came to hogwarts no said rick shaking his head i don t they were both silent for a few moments i ve got it exclaimed hermione suddenly you re a time traveller arentyou it the only logical explanation she said beginning to regroup her ideas about rick around this intriguing new concept you ve come from the future most probably although it could be the past no it must be the future that why you can do magic which no one in this time knows anything about you ve come to help the light battle voldemort and the dark forces you ve come to avert a terrible calamity that has befallen the wizarding world in your time as a result of voldemort victory in this time i sure i right it explains everything what year have you come from rick hermione you are one clever witch you know that said rick you are right about the reason i have come it is to prevent voldemort from winning because right now the odds are stacked heavily in his favour but i have not come from the future or from the past i not a time traveller i a reality traveller a reality traveller what do you mean by that i mean that i haventcome from a different time i ve come from a different reality a different universe if you like explained rick but that not possible is it asked hermione no longer quite sure of anything at least not where rick was concerned well before you used the time turner in your third year said rick you would have said that time travel wasntpossible maybe you are just going to have to learn that nothing is impossible rick how do you know about the time turner asked hermione suspiciously only harry ron and professors mcgonagall and dumbledore know about that aside from me i didnttell you about it and i cantthink why any of them would who told you or have you been doing some extensive reading in my memories she demanded i did read about it hermione but not in your memories it was in a book said rick why of course said hermione it a book you read in the future which hasntbeen written yet goodness it feels strange to think of myself appearing in a book but it all makes sense now she added fitting it neatly in with her rick the time traveller thesis what was this book called harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban it all about your third year at hogwarts about sirius black and everything that happened said rick yes of course said hermione it so obvious now harry famous there are bound to be loads of books written about him and his adventures here at hogwarts then hermione had a terrible and devastating realisation she burst into tears rick hugged her and asked gently hermione what the matter why are you crying because sobbed hermione if you re a time traveller then you ll return to your own time someday without me i dontthink i could bear being separated from you it would be like having a part of myself of my soul torn away rick held hermione close comforting her i wontleave you hermione ever i promise said rick reassuringly like i told you i not a time traveller i a reality traveller i ve come from another reality and there is no way i can go back why not asked hermione not sure if she believed there was such a thing as a reality traveller if there was she didnt understand what it might be because i died in the reality i came from that why i cantgo back i sure you ve heard of reincarnation well i died and then i sort of got reincarnated into this world this reality i guess it all pretty normal if you believe in reincarnation said rick the only unusual thing was that i wasnt reincarnated as a baby but as a sixteen year old boy on august the thirty first this year 1996 do you remember what year it was when you died asked hermione dropping her latest theory rick the time traveller and the countless preceding ones rick was telling her the truth bizarre as it was i know without a doubt that what he is saying is true she thought to herself but how am i able to know that it must be some kind of empathetic magic it because of the link between us no i ve no idea what year it was said rick i donteven know where in the world i lived or any of the personal details of my life what my parents or brothers or sisters were like or if i even had any i donteven remember what i was like how old i was when i died or even what my name was it all a total blank wait a minute said hermione you said you read a book called harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban how can you remember that and anyway how could there possibly be a book about harry potter in the reality you came from that doesnt make any sense at all rick proceeded to tell hermione everything that he could remember of his previous life he told her about the harry potter books and movies about how amazingly popular they were in that world where there was no magic only hard cold impersonal science i was totally obsessed with harry potter and his magical world explained rick it was the most important thing in my life that much i can remember i guess that why i can remember it because it was so important to me i lived in that world well it was this world really it was more real to me than what was called the real world professor dumbledore explained to me that in some religions they believe that your thoughts and dreams and desires create the world that you reincarnate into after you die and that how i ended up here hermione was fascinated yes i ve read some of the tibetan ideas about death and reincarnation then there the tibetan book of the dead which is really a manual for guiding the departed soul into the next life it mind boggling really in a way we create the next world that we re born into and yet it was there all along you re dead right said rick it is mind boggling especially when it happens to you i mean this world was always here just the way it is now with absolutely no reference to the world you came from continued hermione warming to the topic but from your perspective you actually created it all with the help of the author who wrote the books of course because the author really created it out of his or her own imagination to start with it really is mind boggling so that how you knew my name when you tripped over me in flourish and blotts that day you knew me from the books said hermione am i just the same as in the books then you re exactly the same said rick after all i created you from whatever image i had of you in my previous life you were beautiful then and you re beautiful now i ve been in love with you for so long hermione i ve dreamed about you for so long i ve wanted you for so long you have no idea i think it was my love for you that made my obsession with this world so strong strong enough to draw me into it if i manage to make a difference in the battle between the light and the dark then you can claim the credit for it hermione snuggled up closer to rick it was nice to feel so loved loved with such desire that it had drawn rick to her from another world another reality i guess that sort of makes me your witch of requirement then said hermione with a smile i came into existence along with this whole world because you wanted me hermione was silent for a while before suddenly asking but rick that still doesnt explain all your amazing powers in fact it means that you were a muggle that you had no magic at all so where did all your magic come from in for a penny in for a pound thought rick the game up now i might as well tell hermione everything she not going to give me a moment peace until she knows the whole story rick proceeded to tell hermione what had happened on that fateful day when he appeared in dumbledore office he told her of godric gryffindor message from the spirit realm and of his astounding experience upon touching gryffindor wand how a connection had been forged between him and the spirits of the great witches and wizards of the light then they are the source of all your magic and all your power said hermione in awe and wonder you have all the magic of the most powerful witches and wizards who ever lived well the good ones at least rick you must be the most powerful magical being that ever existed said hermione shaking her head in incredulity yes sighed rick but along with all those gifts comes a very heavy responsibility i have to make sure that we win that what i here for i really am a wizard of requirement just like i said before and it a most formidable requirement rick you can do it with all the powers you possess i know you can and i going to help you if you ll let me said hermione with determination but i cantkill voldemort sighed rick i cantkill anyone i canteven hate anyone not even draco malfoy i feel connected to everyone and everything it would be like killing a part of myself so you see i not omnipotent i have my limits i can help harry i can protect him but in the end it harry who will have to destroy voldemort not me just as the prophecy predicts said hermione but rick there are lots of ways of dealing with enemies besides killing them hermione abruptly stopped but of course she exclaimed looking at rick in wonder as the penny finally dropped how could i have been so stupid not to see it before you re the ghost of godric gryffindor it so obvious now you squibbed lucius malfoy and umbridge you cantkill anyone so you squib them it absolutely brilliant she said in admiration actually laughed rick i got the idea of squibbing from you remember how you told me about that book in which germaine pankhurst claimed that circe once cast a spell on an evil sorcerer and destroyed his power well i figured that since she turned to the light i probably have her gifts so i tried it on lucius malfoy and it worked a treat rick told hermione about all the other powers he had discovered so far but i still learning more about my powers every day said rick i mean i was really serious about experimenting with empathetic magic it wasntjust a clever ploy to kiss you although i desperately wanted to and i awfully glad that i did yes me too agreed hermione throwing her arms around him please take a few moments to leave a review chapter 13 the yule ball the last day of term finally arrived and with it the eagerly awaited yule ball as they dressed for the ball the wizards were all paying meticulous attention to their appearance after all the slipper was on the other foot tonight the witches got to choose the wizards they wanted to dance with so they really wanted to look their very best boy wouldntit be embarrassing if no one asked you to dance the whole night said neville echoing the anxieties of the other sixth year boys who were busily and rather awkwardly preening themselves in front of the long mirror on the wall of the boys bathroom now then boys you have nothing to fear enough of your wallflower worries the witches will find you irresistible i sure said the mirror encouragingly delighted to find itself the centre of attention usually the mirror was lucky if it got as much as a cursory glance from one day to the next from most of them harry dear if you put anymore of that sleekeazy hair potion on your head there will be an oil slick following you wherever you go it could make dancing dangerous let it go dear your hair just isnt meant to lie flat yeah guess you re right said harry sighing with resignation and then submerging his head in a basin of water to wash it all out much to the amusement of the others rick blasted harry with a heavy duty drying charm when he came up for air rick himself was being especially careful not to step in front of the mirror while everyone was in the bathroom these mirrors mean well he thought to himself but they re really a pain sometimes especially when they embarrass you with their flattery in front of your mates how come all the mirrors around here have to be female anyway the long mirror in their bathroom was particularly uninhibited and rick didntwant to have it sweet talking him tonight when all his friends were for once feeling very self conscious about their appearance hey neville said dean you must be the luckiest wizard in the school how on earth did you manage to get yourself invited by susan bones hey guys i reckon neville here must have some hidden talents yeah said seamus he must have boy i sure wouldntmind taking susan bones to the ball or up to the astronomy tower she sure filled out rather nicely of late that is one foxy witch you re a lucky bloke neville you know that err yeah replied neville blushing fiercely he d been stunned when susan had invited him she was the subject of the fantasies of many of the wizards himself included but it had never occurred to him that she might like him he certainly wouldnthave dared to invite her had it been the other way around yes there a lot to be said for a witches prerogative he thought happily to himself seamus said ron did you realise that we both got invited by the same witches who we invited to the yule ball in fourth year yeah mate bragged seamus lavender obviously knows what she likes although as i recall you were a real prat to padma you didnt even ask her to dance once the whole night maybe she decided that you ve grown up a bit since then and decided to give you another chance err said ron suddenly becoming very nervous you dontsuppose that she just invited me so she can pay me back and do the same thing to me damn i was so chuffed when she invited me that it never occurred to me she might ve been planning to get even relax mate said rick reassuringly padma likes you believe me i um i know it probably that brilliant mind of yours she after she quite the brainy one herself you know added rick she welcome to the rest of me as well said ron grinning in truth padma mind did attract him but it wasnther mind that had been occupying his thoughts and fantasies of late speaking of which said ron deciding to shift the subject away from himself didntyou get invited by vicky frobisher dean now there a witch who really knows how to handle a broom dean grinned the old broom euphemism was a favourite amongst teenage wizards yeah ron i heard that she did better than you in the quidditch tryouts for keeper last year she quite the athlete i hear you do know that she also a real wiz with charms dontyou dean said seamus you better behave yourself with her my boy or she might just decide you re a handsome prince who desperately deserves to be turned into an ugly toad he added laughing come on said ron we d better get going i know it a witches prerogative and all but i dontthink it means that we have the prerogative of keeping the witches waiting like they do to us i ve got to get over to ravenclaw and i dontwant to keep padma waiting i going to do it right this time when they got down to the common room there was no sign of the witches the younger students were back from their yule party happy exhausted and bursting the younger wizards seemed to have opted for an early night after the copious consumption of the afternoon but the witches were sitting around chattering in groups waiting to see the older witches and wizards all dressed up for their ball they seemed suitably impressed when the sixth year boys made their entrance and rick as usual was the bashful centre of their attention what is it with girls grumbled harry after fifteen minutes had passed and still the witches hadntput in an appearance i think they do it deliberately said seamus to heighten our anticipation you know hey i just caught a rumour that the mystery band for tonight was spotted entering the castle you will not believe who dumbledore got he totally lost it this time who is it the others all asked quentin quaffle and the broom boys i do not believe it exclaimed dean that rather risqu for a school ball isntit who are they asked neville i ve never heard of them that because you re not a witch said dean witches go crazy over them they re one of the up and coming boy bands if you get my drift said dean with a sly wink they re all the rage at witches nights and that sort of thing guess it all part of the witches prerogative theme i imagine that they ve been told to tone down their act a bit though some of their stage antics are apparently pretty outrageous it all very well for the girls complained seamus they ll be drooling all over the band and ignoring us they might not even ask us to dance but the discussion about the band ended abruptly at that point because the gryffindor witches had begun to make their entrance they descended the stairs from the girls dormitories at carefully timed intervals to give each witch her moment of glory in the limelight it was all a bit theatrical but appreciated nonetheless by the audience gathered in the common room they all looked absolutely stunning and quite transformed from their everyday appearances parvati and lavender were no great shakes academically but when it came to cosmetic magic and glamours their knowledge and expertise were legendary they had given all the gryffindor witches a special makeover for the night the transformation was particularly noticeable with witches like hermione who rarely bothered much with their appearance rick stood gaping open mouthed as hermione descended the stairs she was utterly stunning her hair was braided and swept up revealing all the beauty of her face rick had to resist the urge to throw his arms around her and plant kisses all down her neck and bare shoulders too late he realised that he had unintentionally deluged her with his charm it was going to be all but impossible to keep it under control with the way she looked you re the most beautiful witch in the world he said softly in her ear as she took his arm hermione blushed all the way down her neck where rick seeing that no one was watching planted a quick kiss come on said hermione let go the ball while i can still resist the temptation of dragging you off to the room of requirement when rick entered the great hall with hermione on his arm he noticed that the four long house tables had been replaced by many smaller round tables that were clustered around the perimeter of the hall leaving the centre free for dancing in place of the teachers table was a glitzy stage all ready for the band upon the tables were elegant silver candelabra giving off a soft romantic light the enchanted ceiling had turned to an opaque golden colour for the evening in fact it looked as if it were made of pure gold and suspended beneath it were dozens of ornate crystal chandeliers the whole effect was one of baroque opulence and grandeur there were many oohs and ahs as the couples entered the transformed hall the sixth year gryffindors and their partners all sat together at one table ginny was looking absolutely ravishing her mane of bright red hair fell with striking effect on bare milky white shoulders with long twists of flaming hair hanging in front of each ear tonight thought rick ginny wonthave any trouble captivating harry attention that for sure in fact harry was looking at her mesmerised as if he had never really seen her properly before rick just hoped ginny realised that no matter how much harry liked her nothing was likely to come of it anytime soon how sad he thought for the boy who lived even normal things like having a girlfriend are too dangerous for the girl ginny really would be better off finding someone else to love reflected rick sadly rick thoughts were interrupted by a tap on his shoulder it was pansy parkinson in a hot pink robe that left very little to the imagination rick hadntnoticed that quentin quaffle and the broom boys were now on stage and starting to strut their stuff rick may not have noticed but the witches certainly had they were gazing dreamily as the seven very handsome and scantily dressed wizards pouted and posed before their adoring audience it looks like they re about to play rick may i have the pleasure of the first dance purred pansy in her most seductive voice rick had to think quickly he really wanted to have the first dance with hermione err yeah i d love to dance with you pansy but maybe a bit later hermione already has me booked for the first dance he lied pansy smiled at him then turned a death glare on hermione as rick stood up and pulled back hermione chair helping her to her feet rick godfry you re a terrible liar she chided him as he led her onto the dance floor and that the second time you ve assumed my witches prerogative she said feeling slightly annoyed would you prefer to give pansy the pleasure of the first dance with me asked rick smiling sweetly and putting one arm around hermione and taking her hand in his as they began to dance no she said smiling back oh rick you are just so irresistible what can i do she said squeezing his hand and where did you learn to dance like that you re so smooth and sensual looks like i received more than just magical gifts said rick smiling and drawing hermione nearer you re not so shabby yourself in the dancing department who would have thought that hogwarts best and brightest bookworm would turn out to be the witch who wows the wizards on the dance floor stop being silly giggled hermione rather pleased at the compliment i not being silly said rick dontlook now but we seem to be the centre of attention and i pretty sure that all those wizards who are gazing longingly in our direction are longing for you not me at least i certainly hope so hermione looked around and blushed rick was right well rick you ought to be proud of yourself you have more witches looking wistfully at you than at those toy boys on the stage i ll say one thing for quincy quaffler and the brush boys or whatever they call themselves they re not just a bunch of pretty faces they really can play said rick i just hope they do some slow numbers you look so beautiful tonight i cantwait to hold you close very close rick got his wish well the first part of it anyway they did play some slow numbers but sadly for him he didntget to hold hermione close the minute the first dance was over pansy was onto him it must be my turn now she said smiling enticingly at rick excuse me said hermione proprietarily but we re still dancing oh but it witches prerogative tonight you know replied pansy coolly so what demanded hermione well normally a wizard can approach a couple and say to the wizard may i cut in you ve probably never experienced it yourself said pansy snidely but i quite used to it it considered very poor form for the wizard to object to giving up his partner but since it witches prerogative tonight it the witches prerogative to cut in with that she grabbed rick arm and dragged him away from a furious hermione hermione tried to get rick back at the end of the dance determined to steal him away from that tart pansy but it was hopeless a solid wall of witches formed around rick towards the end of every dance as they vied to pounce on him for the next one hermione couldnteven get close to rick and he was too polite to refuse anyone rick really wanted to be with hermione but he soon realised that there was no chance of that most of the witches with crushes on him had probably never spoken to him and were never likely to get another opportunity to make contact tonight was their one chance to be with rick for a few minutes at least and they were determined to make the most of it the witches were overjoyed severus snape however was anything but overjoyed he loathed school balls with a passion a bunch of hyperactive hormone fuelled teenagers totally out of control he thought to himself as a student at hogwarts he had been friendless melancholy self conscious and awkward he had shunned school balls parties and every other kind of social activity and now he was obliged to baby sit this lot there was no justice out of his memory came unwanted images of the past james potter and sirius black he didntknow which one he hated the most for seven years they had taunted and tormented him for their amusement but it wasntthat which had earned them his lifelong enmity no the true cause of his hatred was bitter envy they were everything that he was not handsome sporting heroes successful popular but most of all the witches all seemed to adore the pair of arrogant conceited gryffindors while he himself led a solitary miserable existence lonely unloved and unwanted he had been spurned by the witches during those hypersensitive and emotionally turbulent teenage years it was hardly surprising that he had been such easy prey for the dark lord recruiters snape really didntwant to think about all of that the progression from his purgatory at hogwarts to his own personal hell with voldemort death eaters where did those thoughts come from he asked himself he usually managed to keep them well buried beneath his angry arrogant superior persona what triggered these indulgent thoughts of self pity he wondered as he tried to repress them and then he saw the answer right in front of him rick godfry there in the centre of the dance floor was rick godfry surrounded by at least twenty witches all vying with each other to be his partner for the next dance they were starting to get out of hand several of them were completely motionless it looked like they d been hit by an impedimenta or immobilus jinx sirius black thought snape to himself of course that who godfry reminds me of the similarities are so obvious how did i miss seeing it before the same irresistible attraction to witches the same carefree attitude he thought with disgust everything comes effortlessly to godfry it all just falls into his lap it was exactly the same with black no wonder he had instinctively disliked godfry from the very first moment plus he was a gryffindor and close to a potter the parallels were unmistakable stand aside bellowed snape as he pushed his way through the gaggle of witches surrounding rick mr godfry he said as he pulled two of his fourth year slytherin witches off rick what is the meaning of this unseemly melee you appear to be causing a riot rick was actually relieved at snape intervention he was starting to feel rather claustrophobic and was becoming desperate to escape from his over enthusiastic suitors so desperate that he had briefly been tempted to apparate away i dontknow what gotten into these witches tonight said rick they ve gone quite crazy perhaps the choice of band wasntsuch a good one they seem to have all the witches rather err wound up dont try passing the blame elsewhere mr godfry there is only one riot happening in this hall and it is happening around you and no one else i believe a punishment is in order you need to be put in your place mr black err godfry ever since you came to this school you ve been nothing but trouble i warned the headmaster you think you re just so wonderful dontyou god gift to witches why they should be attracted to a puny insignificant person such as yourself i have no idea although i have my suspicions he added darkly glaring hard at rick i have suspected for some time now that you are using dark magic perhaps some variant of the imperius curse there is something amiss about you mr godfry and it makes me very suspicious by all rights you should be far behind your peers in every subject yet unaccountably you appear to be at the top of every class even surpassing that insufferable know it all granger in some yet you do not appear to be making any effort at all how exactly would you explain all of this mr godfry err i dontreally know sir said rick feeling most uncomfortable well at least the witches werentdaring to approach him with snape about that was one consolation rick became aware that snape was trying to probe his mind he had his wand in his hand and had quietly uttered legilimens rick kept him out he had to but this just made snape all the more suspicious he glared hard at rick if i catch you using dark magic godfry you ll be out of this school i promise you and if it anything illegal i ll make sure that you end up where you belong in azkaban just like sirius black thought rick snape may have failed to penetrate his mind but rick had no trouble reading snape s he understood now why the potions master hated him but there was really nothing he could do about it let me see said snape having stopped himself before saying black name once more now where were we ah yes i was deciding how many house points to deduct from gryffindor for your riotous behaviour house points from gryffindor demanded a sharp voice from behind him and why severus would you be deducting points from gryffindor asked a very stern looking professor mcgonagall because professor mcgonagall mr godfry has been causing a riot said snape glaring back at her well from what i could see mr godfry was not the one who was rioting it was the witches said professor mcgonagall and i couldnt help but notice that the ones flinging curses and behaving the most unscrupulously in their attempts to get to mr godfry were all slytherin witches if you are determined to be a wet rag and put a damper on the festive spirits by deducting house points then may i suggest that you start with your own house why that preposterous spat snape mr godfry was the one causing all the trouble he needs to be dealt with someone needs to take this arrogant conceited upstart in hand and oh for heavens sake lighten up severus it christmas get into the festive spirit of the season said professor mcgonagall then smiling at him she said in any case i was fully intending to take mr godfry in hand she then turned to rick and said mr godfry would you do this old witch the honour of dancing with her snape jaw dropped his mouth momentarily wide open before he snapped it shut grinding his teeth together his face turned red and his knuckles white as he balled his fists struggling to keep control of his fury the honour is all mine professor mcgonagall said rick gallantly then rick had a truly wicked idea and once it got hold of him he just couldntlet it go he suddenly remembered all those fanfics written by girls who seemed to be utterly infatuated with the dark persona of severus snape he could never quite understand it he hadntread many but there were certainly a lot of them he had also understood that snape hatred of sirius black and now himself was the result of envy it was jealousy at their popularity in contrast to his own loneliness he had wanted to be loved but instead he was spurned by the witches in his youth maybe emboldened by the proximity of professor mcgonagall rick said excuse me professor snape but honestly i did nothing at all to cause all the pandemonium and i dontenjoy being mobbed like that but there is a way you could help sir to restore order what are you talking about godfry barked snape menacingly well if the witches had another wizard to dance with one whom they secretly fancied then it would take the pressure off me and things might quieten down and how exactly did you imagine that i might help godfry perhaps you would like me to fetch that insufferable popinjay gilderoy lockhart from st mungo for the evening said snape sarcastically why no sir said rick i was meaning that you should dance with the witches you d be surprised how many of them have secret crushes on you sir i think it the authority figure thing sir it seems to appeal to submissive temperaments i think you might find after the first dance that you ll have quite a mob waiting to ask you for the next dance you might even need to fight them off with your wand sir dont push me godfry snarled snape in fury his wand hand itching to hex this clone of his hated nemesis black into some lowly life form like a slug or amoeba but in spite of himself he wondered if perhaps there wasntsome truth to godfry words it might be rather pleasant to spend the evening dancing with a lot of adoring witches no it just a trick of godfry to try to humiliate me it exactly the sort of thing that black and potter used to do they were always trying to make a fool of me in front of the whole school no i too wise to fall into those traps again he thought to himself professor mcgonagall meanwhile had whisked rick off to dance leaving severus snape musing alone his thoughts were interrupted by luna lovegood excuse me professor snape but would you care to dance with me she asked looking up at him dreamily snape was momentarily transfixed by indecision get out of my way he finally growled and without a further word gathered his cloak about him and swept out of the hall determined to take his vengeance upon the rose garden and any couples unfortunate enough to be caught snogging there professor mcgonagall meanwhile was in very lively spirits she was still chuckling over what rick had said to severus snape it was probably quite true but she doubted very much that severus would ever oblige his admirers after all he had a formidable reputation to uphold as the potions master from hell you dance divinely mr godfry professor mcgonagall said after their second dance i seem to have intimidated your fan club none of them seem very eager to cut in on me ah but i spoke too soon she added minerva come come now you mustntmonopolise the handsome mr godfry said professor sprout taking rick by the arm i believe it my turn she said leading rick away by the time the supper break came rick had also danced with madams hooch and pomfrey and professors sinistra vector and tonks tonks was by far the most fun but rick was thankful when the band finally stopped after two hours of continuous playing and continuous dancing for him he was exhausted hermione was not in a good mood when he eased himself into the seat beside her well rick i hope you ve been having a wonderful time dancing tonight god knows i have she said icily rick tried to put his arm around her shoulder but she shrugged it away angrily honestly rick i dontknow why i allowed myself be persuaded to invite you i ve had exactly one dance with you the whole night she fumed i really sorry hermione but there was nothing i could do i just couldntget away i kept trying to get back to you after every dance but witches kept asking me to dance i swear that i ll never go to another witches prerogative ball sighed rick and what wrong with a witches prerogative bristled hermione that a typical male chauvinist attitude blaming it on the witches just because they re in a position of power for once hermione i not blaming anyone i just trying to tell you that i wanted to come back to you but i couldn t i mean what could i do you could have said no said hermione evenly you could have refused to dance you dontknow how hard that would have been for me whispered rick imploringly in her ear they were all so i dontknow eager and hopeful i mean it was their one big chance to make contact it would have really hurt them if i d refused i just couldntsay no it would ve hurt me so you hurt me instead said hermione bitterly she understood why rick couldntrefuse it was because of the empathy he felt with everyone it was one of the things that she loved about him but sometimes it had very annoying consequences you could have at least refused to dance with that horrible pansy parkinson i mean after what she did abducting me and delivering me to draco malfoy to to hermione let not go there please implored rick i know what she did was terrible and i sure she done lots of other bad things but i canthate her i ask myself what i d be like if i d been born in a death eater family and brought up with all their hatreds and prejudices just imagine growing up in that kind of environment then when you turn eleven you come to hogwarts and get sorted into slytherin where lots of your housemates are also the children of death eaters who have all been indoctrinated since they were little with that racist pureblood ideology and all their other warped values i really feel sorry for draco and pansy and the other slytherins from death eater families most of them never had a chance in fact the only chance they have is if we treat them like human beings rather than just shut our hearts and minds to them as if they were irredeemable monsters you re right sighed hermione i know what you re saying is true rick but it incredibly difficult not to hate them especially malfoy and pansy parkinson after what they tried to do to me but i ll try i just wish i had your generosity of spirit hermione put her hand on rick arm let forget about all of that for now and try to enjoy what left of the evening i sorry i got angry with you before i know it not your fault you were just the wrong wizard in the wrong place at the wrong time but i feel much better now that i ve vented my frustration she said finally smiling at him just call me mr wrong laughed rick hey guys said rick raising his voice so that the others at the table could hear him you just have to hear what happened earlier when snape came up and accused me of starting a riot rick amused them describing his encounter with snape and his timely rescue by professor mcgonagall the image of rick being whisked away from under the potions master hooked nose to dance with professor mcgonagall had them in hysterics rick recounted how he had suggested that snape help him out by dancing with some of the witches because lots of them secretly fancied him most of the boys broke up at this thinking it was hilarious ron almost gagged on the black forest cake he had just stuffed into his mouth hermione felt ill at the thought of dancing with their potions master but she noticed that lavender and parvati were blushing guiltily goodness thought hermione maybe rick is right about the submissive ones crushing on snape who would have thought it all that greasy hair and those yellow teeth yuck it made her feel sick hermione said rick i ve just thought of a plan that will allow us to dance undisturbed after supper and what makes you think i want to dance with you asked hermione coyly i hope you re not trying to usurp my witches prerogative yet again by suggesting that i ask you to dance why no not at all said rick in feigned innocence i was merely indicating that if you did happen to want to dance with me and you were the first one to ask me after the break that i might be able to stop the other witches from cutting in on you sounds interesting said hermione what exactly did you have in mind you ll have to ask me to dance and be the first one if you want to find out otherwise you ll never know said rick with a big grin then looking up his grin vanished as he noticed lisa turpin approaching fast with several other witches in hot pursuit hermione umm i dontwant to rush you or anything but in five seconds this discussion is going to become purely academic hermione looked up and spotted lisa coming towards rick and said quickly any chance of another dance mr godfry there sure is said rick relieved as he stood to lead hermione to the dance floor it was a nice slow number and rick pulled hermione close to him wrapping his arms around her waist hermione who was only a little shorter than rick put her arms around his neck and snuggled up to him it felt so good she was lost in the feelings which flowed from him when they were physically close like this it wasntuntil the fourth dance that she thought to ask rick what he had done because no one had tried to cut in on her this time it my wizard repelling charm said rick it just like a muggle repelling charm except it works on witches and wizards i cast it around the two of us if i had just cast it around myself then you wouldntbe noticing me and that would never do no it certainly wouldn t agreed hermione it wouldntbe any fun at all she said resting her head dreamily on rick shoulder you know i could kiss you said rick and no one would even notice i d notice giggled hermione well i certainly hope you would said rick come on let give it a try err purely in the interests of science you understand this is the perfect environment for assessing the effectiveness of the wizard repelling charm wouldntyou say asked rick hopefully purely in the interests of science answered hermione that was the last thing she said for a very long time when their kiss ended the music had stopped and the dance was over that some charm that wizard repelling charm of yours purred hermione happily although i think in light of how it has been deployed and the fact that this is a witches prerogative it should be renamed the witch repelling charm for this evening i couldntagree more said rick cheerfully lifting the charm as they walked back to their table to join their friends who were getting ready to leave where have you two been asked ginny no one has seen either of you since supper rick been using some kind of disillusionment charm to stop witches cutting in on us it worked brilliantly said hermione happily i ve had him all to myself since supper i wish i knew how to do one said a very frustrated ginny weasley the few times i managed to get a dance with harry one witch or another would cut in as soon as it was over and then it was impossible to get through the mob to ask him for another dance i was furious i was ready to start hurling hexes it was terrible you can say that again added harry as they left the hall i not all that fond of dancing and i just couldntget off the dance floor and back to our table it seemed like all the witches had decided it was open season on harry potter tonight he sighed you cantreally blame them said hermione wisely most of them will never get another chance to talk to you or make contact they ll probably all be telling their children and grandchildren one day about the night of the hogwarts yule ball of 1996 when they danced with the famous harry potter yeah come on harry just think how happy you ve made so many witches get with the spirit of the season said rick smiling at him and clapping a hand on his shoulder well i guess you re right said harry but i was sure feeling like scrooge at the time i was desperate to get away from them in the end ginny and i had to hide out in the rose garden what demanded ron in a rather unfriendly tone and what exactly were you doing in the rose garden with my little sister how dare you ronald weasley said ginny bristling i not your little baby sister any more and i ll do exactly as i please i ll go to the rose garden or wherever i please with whomever i please and do whatever i please it absolutely none of your business hey relax ron said harry ginny virtue was safer out there in the rose garden than in a convent full of nuns you should have seen the way mother superior snape was prowling about blasting rose bushes apart the sadistic slimeball he was deducting house points like there was no tomorrow he even took points from slytherin it was five points just for holding hands it was so funny giggled ginny he caught blaise zabini and pansy parkinson in a very compromising situation he deducted fifteen points each from slytherin but didntparkinson go to the ball with malfoy asked ron puzzled yeah she did in fact snape caught her with malfoy a little later and deducted more points laughed ginny pansy parkinson has quite a reputation you know i think she may have read a meaning into witches prerogative that professor dumbledore hadnt fully intended she added giggling please take a few moments to leave a review chapter 14 voldemort plays santa the hogwarts express chugged its way through the wintry snow covered countryside rick was sitting next to hermione in a compartment with harry and ron thanks to rick wizard repelling charm no one had noticed rick and hermione dancing together after supper at the yule ball the previous night although they had gone to the ball together and although all sorts of rumours regarding rick were rife pairing him with hermione amongst others including tonks no one but rick and hermione knew of their relationship and they intended to keep it that way harry and ron were absorbed in a magical parchment they had created which allowed them to simulate complex quidditch moves they were working on some new strategies for their next match which would be against ravenclaw rick surreptitiously slid his hand under hermione thick woollen cloak and took her hand in his they had been quietly comparing notes on their empathetic magic experiment since the evening in the room of requirement hermione had tried summoning rick thirty five times rick had detected every one of them and accurately identified the time and the location from which she had summoned him a perfect score whispered hermione impressed squeezing rick hand do you think it depends upon proximity she asked softly i not sure rick whispered back probably not i know let try it over the holidays while you re at home with your parents and i at the burrow we may as well use our separation for something useful sighed rick sadly neither of them was looking forward to being apart when they reached king cross station rick and hermione waited until harry and ron had left the compartment before embracing and sharing a goodbye kiss the magical bond between them had become surprisingly strong and they were both finding it very difficult and painful to part even for such a short time rick joined harry ron and ginny on the platform as hermione exited to find her parents mad eye moody replete in bowler hat pulled rakishly over his magical eye was there to meet them along with fred and george a tall slender dark haired witch by the name of griselda was the fourth member of the protection squad moody ushered them into what looked like an ordinary london cab complete with cabbie obviously another member of the order inside it was very spacious and mad eye assured them that it was heavily warded making it virtually impregnable to both physical and magical attacks rick found himself sitting opposite mad eye for the short journey to diagon alley where they would have a chance to do their christmas shopping before flooing to the burrow rick did not enjoy mad eye inquisitive questions or suspicious looks a quick tour of his mind revealed that mad eye paranoid to a fault was not about to trust rick on anyone else say so not even dumbledore s guilty until proven innocent seemed to be mad eye motto thought rick their shopping spree in diagon alley was not much of a spree they moved together in an escorted group which limited the number of shops they could visit rick made most of his purchases in flourish and blotts it was easy to know if a book would be suitable for someone when you could speed read it first rick bought the greatest grand masters of wizard chess for ron potent spells for powerful wizards for harry a theoretical appreciation of the animagus transformation for hermione everything you ever wanted to know about enchanting the wizard of your dreams but were too afraid to ask your mother for ginny muggle machines doing things the hard way for mr weasley gilderoy lockhart a self appreciation by gilderoy lockhart for mrs weasley and a year subscription to playwizard for fred and george ginny was not very happy at having her shopping time curtailed after less than a hour when mad eye moody shepherded them up a small side alley and then through a series of narrow alleyways until they arrived at what appeared to be a dead end mad eye stationed himself at the entrance to the alleyway while griselda beat out a rhythmic tattoo with her wand on the brickwork causing a small green door to appear she ushered them through the door and into a dark empty room with a fireplace in one corner griselda took a strange looking golden coloured device from her cloak it looked a little like a double pocket watch except that the twin dials had far too many hands and in place of the usual numbers were strange hieroglyphics i opening up a secure floo connection to the burrow she explained to the curious students as she manipulated the hands on the left dial for security reasons the burrow has been disconnected from the floo network when they get my signal they ll open the connection at their end and you ll be able to go the hands on the right dial suddenly began dancing about right said griselda throwing some floo powder into the fireplace which flared up with green flames off you go and be quick about it just jump into the fireplace there no need to say anything this is a dedicated connection ginny jumped in first and immediately disappeared ron and harry followed her finally it was rick turn the twins who had their own digs somewhere off diagon alley remained behind with griselda and mad eye rick didntenjoy his first experience of flooing i d rather apparate any day he thought to himself he came stumbling out of the weasley fireplace struggling to keep his feet just as mrs weasley was releasing harry from a fond embrace rick felt a little awkward but mrs weasley welcomed him warmly and proceeded to dust him off in a motherly fashion as if he were just one more of her own brood rick loved the burrow it was a homely higgledy piggledy triumph of magic over gravity and the laws of physics mrs weasley took to rick immediately without any deliberate charm offensive on his part with her nest depleted only ron and ginny lived at home now she was more than happy to have another young wizard to brood over and rick found himself enjoying being mothered rick was sleeping in percy old room harry as usual had been squeezed in with ron hey rick have you ever played wizard chess asked ron when they were sitting in the kitchen drinking hot chocolate rick shook his head ron decided that it was time to initiate rick into the cerebral pleasures of his favourite game ron won the first few games but he became rather alarmed at the way that rick was improving with every game rick managed to win the fifth game he suspected that one or more of his benefactors from the spirit realm must have been a grand master of the game ron was a brilliant player but rick was very soon more than a match for him without cheating it would have been easy for him to read ron mind to discover his intended game plan rick would have won most of the time had he really tried however he decided it wasntworth risking his tentative friendship with ron so they ended up winning about the same number of games how the hell did you manage to pick it up so fast mate asked ron in astonishment i ve never seen anyone learn this game so fast it a bit of a new experience for me losing at wizard chess err sorry ron said rick apologetically s ok said ron it good to have some serious competition for once i haventhad to play this hard since my first year at hogwarts when i had to beat a giant chess set that mcgonagall had enchanted to protect the sorcerer stone but my game hasntimproved much in the last few years to be honest i kind of ran out of serious competition until now that is well i think your game been improving said rick it only because mine been improving too that i able to keep winning my fair share of games you know you re one of the few wizard chess players i know who doesntmind talking about their strategies and explaining them that really helping me a lot i suppose you noticed that i ve been using some your own strategies against you the thing that really flaws me though is the number of moves you can think ahead it seems almost limitless yeah i guess i ve got a good memory said rick modestly in fact he had a perfect memory he figured it probably came from rowena ravenclaw along with her gift of speed reading it gave him a huge advantage at wizard chess rick explained to ron and ginny at the start of the holiday that professor dumbledore had asked him to give harry some private one on one training in duelling rick was worried that they might feel left out and resentful but in fact they both realised that harry talent and power exceeded their own and if they joined in they would be slowing him down they understood that harry needed all the help he could get and neither wanted to hold him back rick found himself having to analyse the process by which he became aware of the spells he used they just seemed to appear in his mind when he needed them he remembered the time in defence against the dark arts when draco was about to fling the furnunculus curse at hermione he needed something to stop it and somehow the knowledge that he could cast a spell which would send the curse rebounding back to its caster suddenly appeared in his mind he could identify the incantation associated with a spell if he wanted to but in fact he didntseem to need to say it or even know it he just had to concentrate on achieving the effect of the spell and it was cast rick was fascinated by the way magic worked through his vast and fast reading and his own contemplation he had concluded that both the incantation and the use of a wand were merely aids he reasoned that the fact that witches and wizards had uttered a certain incantation century after century in order to cast a certain spell imbued the incantation with a certain energy which was why correct pronunciation was important it also gave the caster confidence that the spell correctly performed would work because it had worked before when performed in the same way but since rick lacked neither magical energy nor confidence in his magical ability the incantation seemed unnecessary the function of the wand he concluded was to focus and magnify the magical energy of the witch or wizard that was why mr ollivander art of matching the wand to the witch or wizard was so important it had to resonate with each individual magical energy rick knew that both professor dumbledore and voldemort could do wandless magic they both have such extraordinary magical power that they can perform magic without needing a wand to magnify it thought rick and it exactly the same for me that why i can do wandless magic harry was also a very powerful wizard and rick decided to find out if he too was capable of wandless magic he explained his theory about wandless magic to harry well i ve certainly done some unintentional wandless magic said harry with a grin like blowing up my awful aunt marge so i know i can do it i just hope i dontneed to get that angry to make it work for me they decided to go back to basics and started with wingardium leviosa it took quite a bit of effort but harry eventually mastered it without his wand this gave him the confidence to progress to more difficult spells they went on to banishing and summoning charms harry was soon able to do these without his wand as well although not with the same power as when he was using it he even managed the immobilising curses impedimenta and immobulus with some success rick was also teaching harry some of the unusual spells that he had discovered harry was a serious and focused student he treated these practice sessions with rick as if his life depended upon it and indeed it might some day after a lot of effort he mastered the virga evanesco spell which made an opponent wand simply disappear they got through several of fred and george fake wands in their practice it was an excellent defensive spell an opponent without a wand was virtually useless they spent a whole session working on the somes leviosa charm which causes the caster to fly up in air it was very useful in duelling the tricky part was coming down where you wanted to and slowing down before you hit the ground the first couple of times rick had to help harry avoid a crash landing however after a lot of practice harry became really good at it and was even able to cast spells in flight the pair of them had a lot fun flinging themselves about in mock duels rick taught harry the lumos prorsus spell which shoots a straight beam of light out from the end of the wand this allowed them to curse each other harmlessly using the spell for target practice with his athletic agility and seeker reflexes harry was more than a match for rick in their mock battles rick also taught harry the reflecting shield which he had used so successfully to protect hermione from draco furnunculus curse and later against the morning attack by draco and his gang this was a tricky one to practice rick had to put a deflecting shield up around himself for protection from his own curses which came flying back at him as harry mastered the reflecting shield harry was really enjoying these training sessions with rick but more than that he was gaining confidence it seemed to him that his magical power was growing stronger and he was right rick noticed it as well although it wasntsomething that he d deliberately done because he didntknow how to do it rick thought it must be the great witches and wizards of the light to whom he was connected perhaps they were using him as a conduit to transfer power to harry harry i think we should keep all of this a secret said rick your ability to do wandless magic and the other spells particularly the reflecting shield could be a real bonus for you in a tight situation especially if your opponents arent expecting it it ok if ron and hermione and professor dumbledore know in fact it would probably be best if they did but i wouldntlet it get any further yeah agreed harry you re probably right the element of surprise and all that harry was silent for a few moments there was something that had been increasingly troubling him finally he said you know rick i really dontbuy your story about how you learned all these unusual spells from this mysterious teacher of yours in new zealand err why not asked rick well for one thing replied harry i ve read lots of books on spells especially combat spells none of these spells of yours like the reflecting shield are in any of them and also these are really difficult spells you need a lot of magical energy to perform them it not just a matter of knowing how to cast the spells and doing them correctly you need to use a lot of power or they wontwork umm well yeah you re right harry but you do have the power that why professor dumbledore asked me to teach you and why i didntwant ron and ginny joining us yeah but i donthave nearly as much power as you rick i mean you re probably even more powerful than dumbledore and voldemort where did you get all that amazing power and where did you get all these spells it wasntreally from some mysterious teacher now was it ok sighed rick no it wasntfrom some mysterious teacher but i canttell you the source of my power and the spells i sorry harry but i can t why not asked harry becoming annoyed and frustrated at rick unrelenting secrecy professor dumbledore told me not to tell anyone he said that strategically it an advantage if our enemies dontknow explained rick it the same as you keeping your ability for wandless magic and the other spells secret the best way to keep things a secret from our enemies is not to tell anyone not even people on our side people can be captured and tortured put under a spell given a truth potion or simply be tricked but what they dont know they cantdivulge yeah i guess dumbledore right agreed harry grudgingly it does make sense but rick if you ve got so much power why cant you just go after voldemort and kill him i remember one time you said you didntthink you could kill him but how can that be you re so powerful why cantyou just kill the evil monster then this whole awful nightmare would be over i cantexplain it to you harry said rick apologetically i dontactually understand it all that well myself but i am certain now that i cantkill him it nothing to do with the prophecy it because of something about me but professor dumbledore seems to believe in the prophecy if he believes you re the one who going to have to kill voldemort then it probably true he knows so much more than any of us yeah sighed harry and he keeps it all secret he only tells you what he wants you to know i sure there are still lots of things about my destiny he hiding from me so is he the only one who really knows all about you then asked harry err yeah dumbledore knows everything replied rick evasively and hermione maybe suggested harry with a knowing grin that witch has the instincts of a bloodhound sighed rick you have no idea how she kept at me she even got a rick godfry dossier where she been recording everything about me in the end i caved in it was just too hard to hide stuff from her it wasnta question of if only of when she would finally uncover the truth dont worry laughed harry i know exactly what hermione like she has to know everything and once she sets her mind on finding something out she doesntgive up she a bloodhound alright and a damn good one too but it more than that isntrick there something going on between the two of you isntthere err yeah conceded rick nervously but it meant to be err a secret for one thing we werenttoo sure how you and ron would take it err does it bother you harry no i ok with it i think i guess hermione is more like a sister to me than anything else i really care about her an awful lot you know maybe even more than a lot of brothers care about their sisters just make sure that hermione doesntget hurt rick that all otherwise you ll have both me and ron to answer to thanks for the warning mate said rick nervously i think i d already figured that one out it just lucky for me that ron developed an interest in padma yeah ron sure fancies her alright said harry not that he d admit it have you noticed how distracted he gets when she around i just glad she not on the ravenclaw quidditch team ron wouldnteven notice the quaffle if padma were flying around in front of him we d be slaughtered laughed harry yeah i noticed said rick grinning you d have to be blind not to but nothing going to happen there unless padma takes the initiative ron is the most clueless git in the world when it comes to girls he terrified of making the first move in case he rejected not that he would be it obvious padma likes him i mean she couldnthave made it any more obvious inviting him to the ball and all right agreed harry they were together the whole evening padma kept asking him to dance and ron didntrefuse not once funny that and i thought he hated dancing looks like he changed his mind smirked harry err harry said rick tentatively i couldnthelp noticing that you seemed pretty err interested in ginny that night at the ball you like her dontyou dont even go there rick said harry harshly his good humour vanishing i dontlike girls any girls do you understand for me to like a girl is to hand her a death warrant the only kiss i have to offer is the kiss of death if voldemort suspected that i liked someone she d immediately become a target so no i do not like ginny i can t christmas morning arrived at the burrow and they were joined by fred and george for the traditional feast and fun percy of course was persona non grata and wouldntdare show his face at the burrow the two older weasleys bill and charlie were not coming home this year so it was just the eight of them after they had opened their presents fred and george entertained them with some of their new inventions and here is the latest and greatest addition to our popular line of culinary magical confectionary announced george as they sat around a large table the healthy alternative boasted fred for the magical children of the health conscious witch and wizard our fabulous fruity frogs finished george what do you say fred shall we give young rick here the great good fortune to sample our latest flavours christmas cometh but once a year george my heart overfloweth with good tidings to all men yes agreed let allow him the incredible privilege of an exclusive pre release tasting now rick my boy we do hope that you appreciate how amazingly fortunate you are this said fred removing a small orange coloured frog from his robes and placing it on the table is our new tangelo toad and this added george placing a bright yellow frog next to it on the table is our banana newt rick looked at the two frogs in amusement as they hopped about the table he guessed that fred and george were hoping that as a newcomer to hogwarts he was ignorant of their prodigious reputation as practical jokers a quick glace at fred mind however was enough to convince him that he definitely didntwant to eat either of the frogs err i not all that hungry said rick yeah i think i d better save my appetite for the delicious smelling christmas dinner your mother cooking up in the kitchen umm maybe someone else would like one ginny ron harry you re most welcome but they all quickly shook their head and protested that they werent the least bit hungry either you really know how to destroy a budding entrepreneur confidence said george feigning hurt and rejection yes added an equally depressed sounding fred this rebuff may be the fatal blow that consigns weasley wizarding wheezes to the scrapheap of commercial history and on christmas day and all he added pretending to choke down a sob rick was so impressed with their performance that he decided to play along alright alright please dontthrow yourselves from the attic guys i d never forgive myself so umm which one should i try first do you think the tangelo toad said fred no no eat my banana newt pleaded george tangelo toad insisted fred banana newt begged george the twins started really hamming it up they got down on their knees with palms pressed together beseeching rick to try their frog first with perfect aim and timing rick banished the two frogs into their open mouths they didntstand a chance it looked as if the frogs had just up and jumped straight down their throats on the floor where the twins had been kneeling only moments before there were now two very large toads one orange and the other bright yellow yiddup said the orange toad yiddup replied the yellow one the four hogwarts students were rolling around the floor in hysterics i wonder how long those things last for laughed ron struggling to control himself they might have to eat mashed flies for christmas dinner instead of roast turkey what a crying shame hey let go out and have a snowball fight before the meal said harry ginny had gone to help her mother and fred and george were hopping morosely around the lounge so it was just harry ron and rick for the snowball fight but when they got outside they noticed something strange there was a large bird flying back and forth just beyond the hedge at the end of the garden it looks like a post owl said ron but for some reason it doesntseem to be able to fly beyond the ward line that strange because post owls can normally cross it without a problem as they approached it they saw that it wasntan owl but a large powerful black hawk attached to one of its legs was an envelope with the cruel talons of its other leg it gripped a large metal ring as they climbed over the hedge it approached them and dropped the envelope and the ring at harry feet before flying away dont touch the ring warned ron there must be something dangerous about it that must be what was preventing the hawk from flying past the ward line harry opened the envelope which was addressed to him as he silently read from the parchment the blood drained from his face and his hands began trembling finally he read aloud to his friends in a shaking voice harry potter i am holding hermione granger captive please accept the brass ring which accompanies this message as a christmas present from me it is a portkey which will transport you to her if you wish to see your friend again alive come immediately in case you are in any doubt as to the authenticity of my claim you will find affixed to the bottom of this message a lock of her hair come immediately without delay the next message will include one of her fingers the next one of her hands followed by an arm a leg and so on the final letter should you forsake your friend will contain her heart lord voldemort harry dropped the parchment and made a lunge for the large brass ring but before he could reach it rick had blasted it to pieces nothing remained but a shallow depression in the ground where it had been why the hell did you that yelled harry turning furiously upon rick to stop you walking straight into voldemort trap replied rick steadily and what about hermione demanded harry that lock of hair is hers i know it voldemort got her and he going to to mutilate her and then kill her and you ve just destroyed my only chance of saving her i have to save her cantyou understand he took her because she my friend he took her because of me she going to die now all because of me and you ve take away my only chance of saving her harry said rick trying desperately to master the tumult of his own emotions he felt like his heart was being crushed are you really that stupid i know you feel responsible for hermione being taken but use your brain what did you think would be awaiting you at the portkey destination hermione no think again not hermione but voldemort hermione is almost certainly being held somewhere else far away from where the portkey would have taken you taking that portkey would have done nothing to save hermione it would have done nothing at all but to have lost harry potter rick right agreed ron struggling to control his emotions you wontsave hermione by walking into voldemort trap but we have to do something screamed harry in desperation we have to find her and rescue her harry said rick i think i know how to find hermione and if it possible to rescue her i have the best chance of succeeding but i cantdo it if i have to worry about you doing something stupid like walking right into voldemort trap you are the one he really after if he gets you then the game is up voldemort will win and everyone on our side not just hermione everyone will perish i ll do absolutely everything in my power to save hermione but you have to promise to stay here at the burrow or wherever dumbledore wants you to go and let me get on with finding hermione i need your promise so that i donthave to worry about you will you give me a wizard oath harry but how will you find her demanded harry how will harry there no time to explain please just give me your oath he right harry said ron urgently there no time to waste i know you feel responsible for what happened to hermione and that it your responsibility to rescue her but rick right he has best chance of succeeding there seems to be some kind of special link between rick and hermione how else could he have found her in the dungeon with malfoy that night he probably the only one who can find her and he probably the only one powerful enough to get her back the only thing keeping hermione alive right now is you harry vol voldemort wants you hermione is valuable to him only as long as you remain out of his reach if you rush off and get yourself captured then hermione will be of no further use to him she ll be dead please harry for hermione sake please promise alright sighed harry i give you a wizard oath that i ll stay here at the burrow or wherever dumbledore says good luck he added shaking rick hand sombrely just bring her back to us yeah good luck mate said ron his voice filled with emotion as he too shook rick hand please bring her back to us unharmed i ll do everything possible believe me said rick contact dumbledore immediately tell him everything goodbye ron and harry stared at empty space rick had simply vanished rick apparated to hermione house he found her parents seated together on a couch looking very worried they gasped in surprise when rick materialised before them in their lounge room who are you demanded mr granger recovering from the shock i a friend of your daughter hermione from school said rick do you know what happened to hermione cried her mother we were opening our christmas presents this morning there was a small present wrapped in green paper without a card under the christmas tree all that was written on it was hermione it looked like it might be a book it was i think but when hermione removed the wrapping paper and touched it she just disappeared into thin air we haventseen her since at first we thought it must have been some magical practical joke said her father hermione often talks about the things ron weasley brothers get up to but she been gone almost two hours and she d know how worried we d be by now we are becoming very concerned that whatever took her away from us was not some friendly prank but something more sinister err mr and mrs granger err rick was about to tell them that hermione had been taken captive but he couldntbring himself to tell them the truth it would fill them with dread and despair there was absolutely nothing they could do to help her it would be kinder not to tell them the truth i err i think i know where she might be please dontworry everything will be alright err try to stay calm you will be hearing from hermione soon i sure of it said rick trying to sound reassuring in fact he wasntsure of anything at that moment he knew hermione parents would have lots of questions questions that he couldntanswer or wouldntwant to answer so he took the easy way out he disapparated in the days leading up to christmas rick and hermione had continued their empathetic magic experiment as planned to see if it worked over long distances it did rick had felt hermione summon him several times a day not only that but he could sense the direction from which the summons was coming in theory by apparating to various distant locations he should eventually be able to get a fix on where she was to his immense relief rick could sense hermione summoning him however her summonses were sporadic and worryingly they were very very weak but at least he knew she was still alive during their experiments hermione summonses had always been very clear no matter what he was doing at the time he had always sensed it the moment she summoned him but now he had to concentrate extremely hard to catch a very occasional and very weak summons that was why he hadntbeen aware of her summonses after she d been abducted by voldemort portkey she must have been summoning him from the moment of her capture but why are her summonses so damn weak he asked himself fretfully rick didntknow and he didntwant to think about it it was too distressing rick finally pinned hermione location down to somewhere west of arisaig but arisaig was on the west coast of the scottish highlands which put hermione location somewhere out in the atlantic ocean that didntmake any sense at all then hermione summonses stopped completely rick was beside himself with worry and anxiety he was also frozen to the bone it was a bitterly cold christmas day in arisaig rick decided to apparate to hogwarts ron had already spoken with professor dumbledore through a secure floo connection from the burrow so he already knew what had happened to hermione he praised rick for his quick thinking in destroying the portkey he agreed completely it would have taken harry to voldemort and his doom not to hermione the headmaster conjured up some hot tea and crumpets to help rick warm up then he listened attentively while rick explained about his empathetic magic link with hermione and how he had attempted to use it to find her she being held somewhere west of arisaig but there nothing west of arisaig except the atlantic ocean it doesntmake any sense do you have any idea where she could be professor asked rick despondently azkaban said dumbledore with a sad sigh they must be holding miss granger at azkaban it about thirty miles west of arisaig there are no longer any prisoners at azkaban voldemort forces took over the island when the dementors decided to throw in their lot with him i had been expecting it for some time he has a lot more to offer by way of satisfying their abominable craving for human souls than our side the remaining death eaters who had not escaped in the previous breakout were released voldemort gave the other prisoners criminals mostly as gifts to the dementors to feast upon their souls they were then killed by death eaters and their bodies disposed of voldemort has no use for a prison because he takes no prisoners he is merely using azkaban as a holding pen for his dementors until he ready to deploy them in a full scale offensive as far as we know there are no death eaters or anyone else on azkaban just dementors several hundred of the foul creatures well there a prisoner there now hermione said rick yes sighed dumbledore helplessly shaking his head sadly from side to side it is no surprise that her summonses were so weak and then finally stopped she is the only one on the island her emotions are all that those loathsome dementors have to feed upon i am very surprised that she managed to keep summoning you for as long as she did yes it very lucky said rick otherwise i d never have located her i ll apparate straight to azkaban i should be able to project a magical map once i get there it wontbe hard to find her then i ll disapparate us both out easy no sighed professor dumbledore sadly shaking his head unfortunately it not easy it true that you can apparate in and out of azkaban it also true that you are able to apparate others with you but the wards protecting azkaban will prevent you apparating miss granger out unlike you she is not immune to wards what if i could turn into a hippogriff or a winged horse or something like that asked rick some of the witches and wizards whose powers i received must have been animagi i could fly hermione out on my back you are correct replied dumbledore there are many noted animagi amongst them however before you go rushing off to azkaban to rescue miss granger there is something to which you are going to have to give very serious consideration said the headmaster in a very grave and serious tone i appreciate that miss granger is in grave peril at this very moment and that any attempt to rescue her must be immediate time is not on her side i also understand that there is a great bond of affection between the two of you however rick you also need to consider why you are here in this world you were sent here for a purpose to help secure the victory of the light over the forces of evil you have already had some notable successes here at hogwarts however the battle is not yet won far from it to be perfectly honest the odds are still heavily against us you are our only hope of victory if you were to perish in your attempt to rescue miss granger our cause would almost certainly be lost but why would i perish asked rick what do i have to fear from azkaban dementors replied the headmaster for all your powers and magical abilities i can think of nothing that will protect you from the terrible effects of dementors rick by now you must have understood the nature of your magical endowments you are not omnipotent you cannot do anything and everything you wish your magical abilities are limited to those of the great witches and wizards who chose to give you their powers none of them had any magic that would have made them immune to the dreadful effects of dementors none of them had any magic which can defeat or destroy a dementor if you go to azkaban continued dumbledore you will i fear be as badly affected by the dementors as any other witch or wizard making yourself invisible will not help the dementors will sense your presence and find you disillusionment charms shields none of them works against dementors the patronus charm is the only magic that works against them surely i will be able to cast a powerful patronus charm said rick yes i am sure you will replied the headmaster however it is one thing to repel a handful of dementors with a patronus charm it is quite another to hold off several hundred of them attacking in unison determined to suck out your soul a patronus no matter how powerful would not be able to keep that many dementors at bay for very long the dementors are under orders i imagine not to suck out miss granger soul yet but anyone else straying onto their island would be fair game as soon as they detect you they will immediately come after you to suck out your soul make no mistake about it do not underestimate the difficulties you would face rick said dumbledore gravely if you go to azkaban you will not only be putting your own life in grave danger you will also be putting the very destiny of wizardkind at great peril i shall not try to tell you what you should do it is a most difficult decision to make but it is your decision you must choose between love and duty rick felt completely conflicted he knew he was here in this world for a purpose a great purpose if he perished in azkaban the dark would almost certainly triumph over the light all the hopes and hard work of the great witches and wizards of the light who had sent him here would be lost thousands would die in this world all the squibs and muggle born witches and wizards would be tortured and exterminated voldemort would also unleash his evil upon the muggle world how can i risk all that for one person rick asked himself but try as he might rick could not leave hermione to her fate in azkaban he just couldntdo it she was a part of him he could not abandon her he would rather die than live without her if it was only his life he was risking the choice would be simple but it was far more than his life at stake and yet he knew he would take the risk it was not a matter of weighing up the odds or of trading off the possible gains and losses in some mathematical equation it was an emotional imperative he simply could not abandon hermione professor dumbledore replied rick eventually i truly sorry to disappoint you but i am going to attempt to rescue hermione i know it selfish to risk the lives of so many good people for the life of just one but i canthelp myself that one life is precious to me beyond all others including my own the bond of love between us is so strong that i cannot think of myself as separate from hermione i cannot imagine living without her i must try to save her please forgive me sir please try to understand i do understand sighed dumbledore in resignation i had very little doubt what your decision would be but please promise me one thing rick if you find yourself being overwhelmed by the dementors you will disapparate away from azkaban immediately even though it means leaving miss granger behind you will have to judge it very carefully because once they take hold of your mind and your emotions you will lose the power to act then it will be too late and you will be lost miss granger will be lost we will all be lost please take a few moments to leave a review it a bit of a cliffy here and well while i wouldntwant to give the impression that i blackmailing anyone i wouldntbe at all surprised if the length of time till the next chapter is posted turns out to be inversely proportionate to the number of reviews posted not so subtle hint anonymous reviews are accepted chapter 15 the prisoner of azkaban lucius malfoy apparated into the cold wet cobblestone courtyard of azkaban prison it was enclosed by grimy grey cellblocks built several stories high on all four sides it was horrible and desolate like something out of a medieval nightmare lucius malfoy no it wasnt really lucius malfoy but it looked like him exactly like him rick had discovered some months ago that like tonks he was a metamorphmagus he d practiced a bit and found it was really easy to transform himself to look like anyone whose appearance was familiar to him although he d never seriously attempted to use this ability until now he d forgotten to ask professor dumbledore if dementors had eyes and could actually see but he didntwant to risk it plus there was always the possibility of running into death eaters rick didntwant to be seen and possibly identified so he decided to morph himself lucius malfoy seemed like a good choice if he was recognised at azkaban it would simply serve to confuse voldemort and his followers they probably had no idea that lucius malfoy had been squibbed narcissa malfoy had hushed it all up and was almost certainly the source of recent rumours to the effect that her husband had disappeared in dangerous circumstances and was presumed dead having lucius turn up at azkaban to spirit away voldemort prize prisoner would have the dark side dumbfounded and would likely send them on a wild goose chase then there was always the possibility that dementors could see if they recognised him as lucius malfoy they might leave him alone rick immediately closed his eyes and projected a magical map of the prison he had no difficulty spotting hermione hers was the only name visible she was in a cell one level up on the northern side of the courtyard rick was about to apparate to her cell when the wave of numbing coldness hit him it was unlike anything he had ever experienced his whole body shook uncontrollably he was struggling to breathe either the dementors didntrecognise him as a high ranking death eater or they just didntcare a meal was a meal looking around rick saw that he was completely encircled by dementors how had they got there so quickly could dementors apparate the stench of rotting flesh was overpowering and a hideous rattling noise came from all around him waves of coldness of fear and of helplessness surged through him rick struggled to keep his feet finally he fell hard on the filthy freezing cobblestones mike mike we re going to crash screamed a woman voice which seemed oddly familiar i cantcontrol it there black ice on the road we re sliding yelled a man voice also somehow familiar we re going to die screamed the woman his mother rick was certain of it she was screaming hysterically rick was gripped by the most terrible fear he couldntsee anything but he could hear and he could feel the motion of the car as it hurtled out of control down the road he was frozen with terror my god screamed the man we re going too fast that safety rail wontstop us noooooo rick was certain now it was his father there was a bang and a jolt it felt like the car had left the road and launched off into space before beginning its sickening downward plummet all he could hear were screaming voices his mother s his father and his own he was witnessing the last harrowing moments of their lives rick became aware of something dragging him up by the shoulders he was assailed by an unbearable fetid stench forcing his eyes to open he saw the huge dementor it held his shoulders in a vice like grip it was bringing his face up to meet its own the dementor had thrown back its hood there was a terrible rasping rattling noise coming from its mouth if you could call that hideous hole in its face a mouth rick felt terribly weak he had to struggle hard to remain conscious it was too late now to disapparate away he felt so utterly miserable and bereft of happiness there was no hope of casting a patronus charm what could he do suddenly he remembered how sirius black had used his animagus form to protect his mind from the terrible effects of the dementors of azkaban closing his eyes rick tried to visualise the animagus forms of his spiritual benefactors but he couldntconcentrate something cold and slimy touched his lips desperately he tried to turn his head away from the nauseating creature for a moment he succeeded and managed to draw a breath of stinking air then he felt the slimy scabby hands of the dementor grabbing hold of his head and pulling it back to its own fowl putrid face desperately rick tried to force his mouth shut to seal his lips he felt the cold slimy mouth of the dementor pressing hungrily against his lips again somehow it was forcing his mouth open merlin help me he thought to himself desperately trying to conjure up an animagus image in his mind what that he asked himself as he caught the image of something small and furry a mouse he willed himself to transform to become the tiny brown mouse which he saw in his mind the dementor was about to begin its loathsome feast upon rick soul but suddenly it found it was empty handed and empty mouthed its prey had unexpectedly vanished or so it seemed the dementor didntnotice the tiny brown mouse scurrying fearfully away across the cobblestone courtyard the frightened little mouse passed unobserved and un sensed through the vicious circle of dementors which had been surrounding it the soul numbing coldness and unutterable misery caused by the dementors had all but vanished the vile creatures seemed to hardly affect rick in his mouse form it feels really weird being a mouse thought rick he knew who and what he was and what he was trying to do but his senses and perceptions had completely changed everything looked entirely different so huge and the smells they were far more intense and far richer but somehow they didntseem unpleasant to his rodent senses rick psyche and emotions however were still very much his own and they were in turmoil as he struggled to overcome the fear and shock from the traumatic experience of the hideous dementor which had almost sucked out his soul when he reached the corner stairway leading up to hermione cell he realised he had a problem the steps were immense for such a tiny animal how was he going to get up them yes he could jump very well he discovered but still it was hard work and very tiring to leap up all the steps to get to the next level when he finally got there he was quite exhausted and had to stop to rest before proceeding when he finally reached the door of hermione cell he discovered to his dismay that he couldntget in he had hoped there would be a gap under the door for him to squeeze through but there was none there was a small barred window set in the door at head height but he wasntable to climb up the metal surface of the door to reach it he couldntget any traction at all with his tiny claws he needed to stop for a moment and think of a plan for getting hermione out of azkaban things werentworking out as well as he d hoped at least the dementors hadntfollowed him nor had they come to check up on their prisoner obviously they werentbright enough to connect rick appearance with their prisoner or think that it might be a rescue attempt but the minute he turned back into his human form they would sense him and be onto him again rick wondered if he could change from one animagus form to another without having to change back into his human form rick tried to visualise his potential animagus forms again yes even as a mouse he could visualise them so perhaps he could make a direct transformation his deliberations were interrupted by a loud scurrying sound he looked around to find five very large nasty grey rats stalking him they looked hungrily at him with their beady black eyes whiskers twitching in anticipation of a nice juicy meal rick rodent instincts kicked in and sent him scurrying away he bolted down the corridor only to find more of the horrible rats at the other end he was trapped the rats moved in for the kill just as they were about to pounce on the tiny mouse to their great surprise it vanished in place of their quarry sat a large grey tabby cat getting ready to pounce on them the rats didntbother hanging around to investigate this mysterious transformation they turned tail and fled rick breathed a sigh of relief that was a close call too close rick padded back along the dark corridor to hermione cell he liked the feeling of being a cat he felt sleek and lithe and powerful there was no sign of the rats it looked like they had disappeared the cat positioned itself a couple of feet back from hermione door he leapt up to the window wrapping his paws around the bars but it was obvious that he was too big to get through them rick changed back into a mouse now in his smaller form he could easily get through the bars looking down from his vantage point rick was able to make out the shape of someone lying huddled on a filthy mattress in one corner of the dark dank stinking cell rick jumped down from the barred window and changed back into a cat just in case there were more rats around rick bounded over to hermione her wrists were manacled and attached by long chains to the wall she seemed to be unconscious rick rubbed himself up against her purring loudly hermione slowly opened her eyes they were full of fear and anxiety when she saw the cat she gave a start and sat up the cat immediately jumped into her lap continuing its contented purring wherever did you come from she asked she looked closely at the cat it was very clean and in excellent condition if there were any cats in azkaban she thought they would be filthy mangy creatures there was something oddly familiar about this cat just having it sitting in her lap raised her spirits it seemed to radiate a sense of warmth and calm and love rick she whispered is that you the cat nodded its head in a very human way i should have guessed that you d be an animagus said hermione picking up the cat and hugging it to her chest as she sobbed oh rick rick you heard me calling you and you came you have no idea how absolutely horrible it been one moment i was with my parents happily opening presents under the christmas tree and the next i was imprisoned in this wretched cell then that horrible bellatrix lestrange came and took some of my hair she said they were only keeping me alive so they could use my body parts to lure harry to his doom that once they had him i d be given to the dementors to feast upon she was laughing and cackling like a maniac i sure she must be half crazy from her time here in azkaban who wouldntbe she asked shuddering hermione patted the cat while she talked its presence gave her comfort i ve been feeling so miserable and desolate since i ve been here it was almost impossible to summon you i found it so hard to think about you because all my thoughts of you are happy ones it must be the dementors my mind keeps going back to that dreadful dungeon and malfoy and all the fear and terror of that night i just dont seem to be able to push it out of my mind but i feel so much better now that you re here you always seem to have that effect on me even as a cat rick how am i going to get out of this loathsome hell hole we need to plan our escape but how can we do it if we canttalk you have to change back to your human form to talk to me oh no dontdo that the dementors will sense you and come after you the cat squirmed out of hermione arms and suddenly changed into a brightly coloured lorikeet which fluttered down and landed in hermione lap its chest was red yellow and purple and its back was bright green hermione gasped is surprise she was even more surprised when it began talking to her is this better squawked the lorikeet my said hermione somewhat stunned you can talk though it doesnt sound much like you rick it sounds more like a parrot asked rick when he d seen the form of a parrot in his mind he was wondering if it might be magical and able to talk properly like a person rather than a parrot fortunately it could it so good to see you hermione you have no idea how worried and distraught i ve been since you disappeared your summonses were so weak and then they stopped completely i was so afraid that i d lost you i just so relieved to find you alive rick is harry safe please tell me that he didntrush off like an idiot to save me and fall into voldemort trap he certainly tried voldemort knew exactly how to set him off he sent a message with a lock of your hair and a portkey telling him you d be killed if he didntcome but he didntgo cried hermione he tried but i blasted the portkey to bits before he could grab it said rick thank goodness said hermione with a sigh of relief apart from remembering being in that dungeon with malfoy the other horrible images that kept preying on my mind have been of harry rushing off blindly to my rescue and being captured by voldemort my mind has been full of the most gruesome images of voldemort torturing harry and killing him i didntknow if they were real or just some awful nightmares caused by the dementors i couldntbear having harry death on my conscience it was all so awful rick i so relieved to know he safe you have no idea said hermione gratefully but how are we going to get out of here it not going to be easy with all these dementors i going to fly you out on my back said rick well it wontwork if you re a lorikeet that for sure said hermione you ve got other animagus forms you can choose from i imagine apart from the cat and the lorikeet can you use any of the animagus forms of the great witches and wizards who blessed you with their powers then before rick could reply hermione continued so which one were you planning to use i dontlike flying on hippogriffs at all and thestrals arentmuch better actually squawked rick finally managing to get a word in i was thinking of something with a little more firepower hermione thought that the lorikeet seemed to be grinning but then again lorikeets always look like they re grinning so it was hard to tell you re not planning on turning into a dragon are you rick because there is no way i going to try holding onto the back of a dragon while flying through the air so you better come up with a better plan than that hermione was finding arguing with a lorikeet a little bizarre she knew it was really rick but it was still a lorikeet but the dragon will be perfect hermione just listen to my plan said rick no matter which animagus form i use we have to get down to the courtyard it the only place i can take off from no matter which form i use you re going to be on my back and the dementors will attack you before i can get away but a dragon should be able to hold them off with its fire that all very well said hermione to the lorikeet but how exactly am i going to manage to hold onto a dragon i ve never actually turned into my dragon animagus before but i can visualise it very distinctly in my mind it looks like a norwegian ridgebackand it got what looks to be a harness and riding saddle attached to its back so if you jump up on my back just before i transform you should find yourself pretty much in the saddle just strap yourself in and hang on for the ride of your life i really dontlike this idea said hermione fretfully but i suppose it our only option you could just apparate away i suppose i imagine that how you got here if you can get past the hogwarts wards azkaban wouldntbe a problem for you you cantapparate me past the wards though can you asked hermione hopefully desperate to avoid the prospect of becoming a dragon rider professor dumbledore said it wasntpossible replied rick so it the dragon i afraid now here the plan the only magic i can do in my animagus form is transform into something else in order to get you safely down to the courtyard i going to have to change back to my human form i ll blast the door and we ll make a run for it but what about the dementors they ll be on to us as soon as you transform said hermione beginning to worry about all the things that could go wrong the minute i see them before they have a chance to affect me too much i ll start blasting them with a patronus charm with you by my side i ll have no trouble thinking of happy thoughts i should be able to hold them off as soon as we re out in the open i ll give you the signal to jump on my back i ll hold on to you as if i giving you a piggy back and then i ll transform and start warming this place up a bit rick you have to promise me one thing said hermione very seriously if things go wrong if your patronus doesntmanage to hold off all those dementors i want you to apparate away before they overcome you if i die here it will only be the end of hermione granger but if you die it will be the end of all hope for the light ultimately it will be the end of harry ron and all his family albus dumbledore all the muggle born witches and wizards the squibs so many thousands of good people rick you cant risk all that for me i wontlet you god if only my mind had been clearer if only i d thought of it i never would have tried to summon you rick you must promise me otherwise i not coming with you i promise you my plan will work hermione now stop worrying it time to go sorry rick but unless you give me a wizard oath that you wontrisk your own life i staying here said hermione with rock solid determination rick could see he was not going to convince her he was also wondering if he as rick would be bound by a wizard oath sworn by his animagus lorikeet but he didnthave time to think about it it was time to go ok said rick reluctantly i swear it oh and by the way i am going to look like lucius malfoy i sure you can figure out why of course i can said hermione as if it was the most obvious thing in the world it a clever idea disguise yourself and confuse the enemy at the same time although i cantsay i going to enjoy having you looking like that arrogant creep so when exactly were you planning on telling me you re an animagus and a metamorphmagus she asked sounding somewhat vexed i sorry hermione i wasnttrying to hide it from you i just didnt think of telling you it didntseem important until now umm we really should get out of here you know are you ready i ready but you ll have to do something about these manacles said hermione holding up her wrists right said rick he changed back to his human form but then immediately morphed himself to look like lucius malfoy again he magicked away hermione manacles drew his wand and blasted away the door he figured that his patronus might be stronger if he used godric gryffindor wand he grabbed hermione hand and dashed out of the cell and down the corridor towards the stairs but before they even reached them dementors began swarming out from the top of the stairway rick immediately pointed his wand and bellowed expecto patronum the result was staggering around fifty silvery and very corporeal patronuses burst from the end of his wand and launched themselves at the dementors with fury there were bulls birds bison bats almost every animal imaginable but rick didnthave time to admire his handiwork because hermione had just pointed out another group of dementors that were bearing down upon them from the other end of the corridor rick turned his wand on them and yelled out expecto patronum again a host of patronuses erupted from the end of his wand and beat the dementors into a retreat they continued to the top of the stairs there were no dementors in sight but just to be sure rick sent forth another phalanx of patronuses ahead of them down the stairs to clear the way then hand in hand they raced down the stairs as fast as they could go the courtyard was packed with dementors the patronuses had driven them away from the stairway although the dementors could not approach rick and hermione they could still affect them rick started to feel their chill creep into him he felt himself begin to waver under the combined influence of the hundreds and hundreds of dementors packed into the courtyard hermione felt them too and sensing rick hesitation she said desperately it no good rick there are too many of them you have to go please apparate away now but rick didntgo he squeezed hermione hand to give him strength as he unleashed another volley of patronuses some of the dementors were driven out of the courtyard while others cowered in the corners rick felt the chill subside a little he dragged hermione to the centre of the courtyard handed her his wand and told her to jump up on his back he held her tightly as he closed his eyes and concentrated on transforming into a dragon one moment hermione was taking a piggy back ride on rick back the next she felt herself being heaved up into the air she flailed around desperately with her hands managing to grasp hold of something thick momentarily things stopped moving and she saw that she was holding on to some kind of strap that seemed to be part of the harness holding a large saddle in place on the dragon back everything started moving again with difficulty she dragged herself over the rough scales along the strap and finally seated herself in the saddle there was a kind of belt which she strapped across her lap it held her securely in the saddle the dragon was a norwegian ridgeback and it was immense over thirty feet long several very distinct black ridges ran down its back which was protected by thick black scales it had two huge yellow eyes with vertical pupils and its head was crowned by two large vicious looking bronze coloured horns it was a fearsome sight completely dominating the azkaban courtyard from her vantage point high on the dragon back hermione saw that the dementors were no longer cowering in the corners of the courtyard the patronuses were dissipating and were no longer able to keep them in check she felt a fearful chill oppressing her as they began closing in on her she pulled rick wand from her robes and pointed it at a dementor that was heading straight towards her desperately she searched for a happy thought but there was only fear and misery in her mind at that moment suddenly flames erupted from the dragon mouth sending the dementor fleeing it made a terrible screeching noise as it glided rapidly away the dragon turned in a circle breathing vast sheets of fire at the approaching dementors the flames repelled them almost as effectively as the patronuses while they were beating their retreat the dragon unfurled its gigantic black wings and began flapping them slowly it rose up into the air while blasting a solid wall of fire downwards to dissuade the dementors from following as the dragon gained altitude it began flying quickly to the east hermione looked behind them there was no sign of dementors giving chase the dragon flight was surprisingly smooth and hermione felt quite secure strapped into the saddle on its massive back it wasntquite as comfortable as a jumbo jet but it wasnttoo bad the main thing was that she was free of the dementors and the terrible misery she had been feeling during the past few hours at azkaban hermione realised they had not discussed where they would go once they got away from azkaban would rick risk being seen as a dragon by muggles what was he planning to do where would he go damn it she thought it a pity dragons canttalk but her questions were soon answered as they neared the coastline the dragon gained altitude so they would not be visible or at least recognisable from the ground hermione was getting very cold she used rick wand to cast a heating charm around the saddle she guessed that rick would head for hogwarts and she was right twenty minutes later she spotted the castle and the lake rick began to descend in a wide corkscrew spiral coming down behind hagrid hut he figured hagrid would be up at the castle with the other teachers and any students staying over enjoying his christmas meal the last thing he needed was to have hagrid start petting and pampering him and then being heartbroken when the dragon suddenly disappeared fortunately rick guess was correct no one spotted a large norwegian ridgeback making an unscheduled landing at hogwarts that christmas day hermione suddenly found herself sitting on rick back she had him pinned to the ground she quickly jumped off and helped him to his feet then she threw her arms around him and kissed him it was a long kiss neither of them noticed that it was in fact a very cold and wintry day hand in hand they trudged happily up the snow covered path to the castle and made their way directly to the headmaster office fickle fudge laughed rick at the headmaster sweet pun on the minister of magic as he gave the password to the stone gargoyle which jumped aside to reveal the moving stone staircase the door to the headmaster office was slightly ajar rick knocked and as there was no reply they entered professor snape was sprawled lost in thought in a comfortable armchair obviously waiting for the headmaster to return from the christmas dinner when he saw rick and hermione enter he jumped from his chair in complete shock miss granger what on earth however did you manage to he began with an expression of incredulity on his face but then he stopped himself escape from azkaban professor asked hermione finishing his question for him yes exactly said snape are you alright miss granger he asked more in disbelief than concern i am now professor thanks to but rick quickly nudged her and she stopped abruptly snape turned and stared hard at rick with a withering gaze mr godfry you are always so full of surprises perhaps you had something to do with miss granger inexplicable escape err no i err i just err offering her emotional support sir said rick weakly mr godfry allow me to give you a little advice whatever other abilities you may possess you are an utterly incompetent and unconvincing liar your attempts at deceit are totally transparent deception is an art an art which you do not possess please do not insult my intelligence by expecting me to believe such patent drivel said snape with his customary sarcasm err thank you sir replied rick what demanded snape thank you for the good advice sir replied rick innocently godfry that enough of your cheek but at that moment the headmaster entered his office his face lit up with a joyful smile and an expression of immense relief when he saw hermione and rick thank goodness you have been safely rescued from azkaban miss granger how are you feeling have you been harmed in any way he asked his voice full of concern no sir i a little tired but other than that i fine replied hermione excuse me headmaster said snape approaching dumbledore but how did you know that miss granger had been taken to azkaban i had just come to your office to give you that very news and how on earth did she manage to escape from that place it simply not possible no one has ever escaped from there no one except for black i am very curious as to how miss granger escaped in fact i was just asking her and mr godfry he added turning his questioning gaze once more upon rick that very question when you arrived they seem reluctant to tell me yes severus said dumbledore with a smile as he seated himself comfortably in the chair behind his huge desk i imagine they are but i am certain that you of all people understand the value of a well kept secret i must request that you do not press them further on this matter rest assured i will fully debrief them and pass on anything you need to know certainly headmaster said snape curtly much as his curiosity begged to be satisfied he understood very well the importance of secrets his situation as a double agent was a precarious one every time he went to the dark lord or to meet with fellow death eaters there was always the possibility of exposure which would result in him being subjected to torture or veritaserum most likely both the less he knew of dumbledore secrets the better snape nodded his head towards the headmaster then turned and left the office when the door closed behind snape dumbledore rose from his chair and approached hermione i am greatly relieved to see you alive and well miss granger are you quite certain that you are unharmed by your ordeal perhaps it would be wise to visit madam pomfrey in the hospital wing and let her at least check you over no honestly i fine professor dumbledore said hermione then smiling at him she added and just in case you were trying to get rid of me so that rick can give you the no holds barred details of how he rescued me i think you should know that i am aware of all his secrets including the origin of his amazing magical powers i am also aware of his ghostly nom de guerre well done miss granger well done said dumbledore much to hermione surprise he seemed delighted rather than annoyed i knew it was only a matter of time before you solved the enigma of rick godfry i am most impressed that you succeeded so quickly it only a pity that it all such a secret otherwise i would award house points to gryffindor for your brilliant sleuthing you have a remarkable mind however please understand he added in a more serious tone that you must keep your discoveries about mr godfry a secret from everyone including messrs potter and weasley yes sir i understand completely replied hermione you can rely upon it i promise not to tell a soul very good miss granger thank you now please be seated both of you he said summoning a comfortable couch for them before returning to his own chair and settling himself comfortably behind his desk i believe you have missed your christmas dinner so first of all let put that to rights he said picking up a small bell from his table and giving it a tinkle a moment later there was a pop and dobby the house elf appeared before the headmaster professor dumbledore sir dobby is wanting to wish headmaster dumbledore a merry christmas and how may dobby be of service to you professor sir thank you dobby and a merry christmas to you i was wondering if perhaps there was a little something left over from the excellent christmas feast if there is could you please bring some for miss granger and mr godfry here he said pointing to the couch behind the house elf dobby turned around and saw hermione and rick oh miss hermione granger dobby is not seeing you there squeaked the house elf in delight merry christmas to you and to master rick godfry dobby is wanting very much to thank you for all the beautiful socks and hats you is leaving for dobby under the house elves christmas tree miss hermione is too kind to dobby dobby is not worthy said the house elf bowing his head humbly before hermione whom he held in great awe and esteem but dobby said hermione the socks and hats under the tree were for all of the hogwarts house elves they werentall supposed to be for you remember you gave me a list of the names of all the hogwarts house elves i put a present under the tree for each one i i is very sorry miss granger said dobby awkwardly hanging his head and avoiding hermione eyes but the house elves are very suspecting when they see the presents under the christmas tree they is never getting christmas presents ever they is making dobby open his present first when they is seeing clothes inside they is getting very angry they isntwanting to open their presents they is saying dobby is having all the presents dobby is very sorry miss granger said the poor dejected elf there there dobby said dumbledore his eyes dancing with amusement i sure you did your very best despite miss granger great efforts at educating them your fellow house elves do not seem at all keen to follow your example and throw off the shackles of servitude i sure miss granger doesntblame you in the least however if we dontfind some food for her soon she may just die of hunger oh no sir dobby is not letting miss granger die of hunger squeaked the elf with concern and with a pop he was gone half a minute later he reappeared with another pop balancing a huge silver tray on one hand he snapped the fingers of his other hand and a low table appeared before hermione and rick he placed the tray down on the table bowed to them and then turning and bowing to professor dumbledore he vanished with a pop it was a veritable banquet and hermione was famished for once in her life she was more interested in eating than talking after telling the headmaster how she had been abducted by the portkey present and of her encounter with bellatrix lestrange at azkaban she fell upon the food with relish and let rick tell the headmaster the story of the rescue from azkaban you certainly made good use of your animagus forms said the headmaster to rick when he finished his account it is fortunate indeed that you were able to perform the animagus transformation into a mouse even in such a weakened state it sounds like you were only moments away from losing your soul professor dumbledore said hermione quickly swallowing a mouthful of roast turkey please dontthink me ungrateful but you really shouldnthave allowed rick to risk his life to save me it not just his life that was at stake countless other lives would have been lost if rick had died at azkaban the future of the wizarding world depends upon him how could you have allowed him to risk so much for one person rick meanwhile had become very interested in the food dumbledore sighed you are quite right miss granger it was an enormous risk i pointed this out most forcefully to mr godfry but i was unable to dissuade him from rushing to your rescue there is clearly a very strong magical bond between the two of you in the end that terrible decision was his to make not mine i must say in hindsight that i am very happy with his choice he added with a benevolent smile when you have finished your meal i suggest you go together to visit your parents miss granger they must be very worried about you by now it would be best if the two of you then proceed to the burrow for the remainder of the holidays added dumbledore i want rick close to harry but it is clear that you too are now a target miss granger perhaps rick will find an opportunity to begin some special training with both you and mr potter what special training is that asked hermione immediately curious ah said professor dumbledore smiling at her it appears that mr godfry has not yet told you about it professor mcgonagall informed me last term that she believes both you and mr potter are capable of mastering the animagus transformation really gasped hermione with excitement i ve wanted to be an animagus so much ever since our third year i read every book in the library about it but it was all rather discouraging firstly those with the innate ability to perform the transformation are very rare then you need a teacher who must be an animagus themselves you have to be at least seventeen years old before you can even apply for permission to begin training the special ministry committee you have to apply to only meets once a year and they take ages and ages to decide they haventapproved a single application in the past ten years it virtually impossible to do it legally said the headmaster his blue eyes twinkling with amusement he had waited patiently until hermione was forced to pause for a breath of air before interrupting her professor mcgonagall is you may have noticed a very proper witch who believes in following the rules no matter how absurd they may be she would of course teach you if i requested it of her as a special favour however she would feel most uncomfortable fortunately we have an alternative in mr godfry here given his special gifts i believe that he may be able to accelerate the process i have asked him to work with you both next term i hardly need tell you that it is completely illegal and must therefore remain a secret between the four of us enough of that for now said the headmaster your parents must be very worried miss granger if i may i would suggest that you explain your disappearance to them as a prank gone awry if they knew the truth it would only cause them unnecessary worry yes professor agreed hermione but what shall we tell everyone at the burrow they ll want to know where i was held and how i escaped i canttell them the truth without exposing rick quite right agreed dumbledore after musing for a few moments he said i would not advise you to lie to your friends miss granger however neither can you tell them the truth you may tell them that i expressly requested both of you not to divulge what happened because it would risk revealing things which i consider advantageous to our side to remain secret for now i am in fact asking you to do just that so it will be perfectly true now it time to say goodbye he said rising from his chair i hope you both enjoy what is left of your holiday said the headmaster smiling at them fondly please take a few moments to leave a review chapter 16 back to the burrow fortunately for rick he and hermione spent only an hour with hermione parents but it was more than enough for rick the grangers were both very nice but after they got over their joy and relief that hermione was safe and sound they became very interested in rick much too interested for rick liking it was obvious that either hermione had told her parents about their relationship or else they had guessed but guessed what rick was feeling very embarrassed and awkward it didnthelp that they wanted to know all about him where he was from his family and everything his fabricated answers didntseem to satisfy them if they didnt suspect him of lying to them they certainly suspected him of concealing things which of course he was very significant things rick managed to get mrs granger on side fairly quickly the old charm never failed him with females of all ages but mr granger was another matter there was no chance of charming him hermione did her best to deflect her father attention away from rick it was obvious that he was extremely fond of his daughter and also very protective rick had to withstand a fierce interrogation from mr granger while hermione was packing her trunk he was greatly relieved when she returned all packed and ready to go hermione explained that they were going to apparate to the burrow however it was clear that hermione had previously told her parents all about the age and licence requirements not to mention the dangers of improper apparition but you donthave a licence and you haventlearned how to apparate yet dear said mrs granger to her daughter with concern it ok said rick i ve been doing it for years the apparition age is much lower in new zealand and it perfectly safe for me to apparate another person with me that how we got here be very careful with my daughter young man said mr granger in an almost threatening tone if any harm comes to her or if she is hurt in any way you ll have me to answer to remember that err yes sir replied rick nervously it was not lost on him that mr granger was talking about more than apparition he quickly took out his wand and waved it at hermione trunk transforming it into a pretty bracelet this surprised and impressed hermione parents and had the desired effect of defusing the tense situation hermione allowed her father to put the bracelet around her left wrist and then hugged and kissed her parents goodbye err goodbye mr and mrs granger said rick awkwardly it been a real pleasure meeting you he then took hermione hand in his and with great relief apparated to the burrow they apparated to just outside the ward line rick removed hermione bracelet from her wrist and transformed it back into a trunk oh said hermione disappointed at losing her lovely bracelet i really liked it rick it the first thing you ever gave me sorry said rick he picked up a stone and transformed it into an identical bracelet merry christmas he said placing it around her wrist he was just about to kiss her when he heard the sound of excited voices approaching them hermione hermione yelled ron running towards them you re safe you re alive stop boomed a gruff voice from behind ron dontgo any closer anyone especially you harry wait for me everyone stay well back from the fence this could be a trap ron stopped harry caught up with him and then came ginny the twins and the dark haired witch griselda mr and mrs weasley joined them and finally mad eye moody hobbled up on his wooden leg positioning himself protectively in front of everyone they were about thirty yards away from hermione and rick draw your wands everyone barked mad eye have you never heard of polyjuice potion merlin knows i have they could be anyone masquerading as your friends nice as it might be to believe that your friend hermione has gotten away from voldemort it would be a bloody miracle the odds are dead against it they re a damn sight longer than the odds of those two being a couple of death eaters disguised as your friends come to attack or abduct harry right you two yelled moody to hermione and rick dontmove as much as one inch closer or i ll hex you to hades stay right where you are until we ve positively identified you ron harry ask them some questions that no one but your friends would be able to answer ordered the paranoid ex auror ron thought for a minute then said hermione what potion ingredient did we steal in second year what was it for and how did we get it we were in potions harry threw a filibuster fireworks into goyle cauldron said hermione laughing as she remembered it the swelling solution potion exploded splattering most of the class malfoy got it in the face his nose swelled up like a balloon while snape was distracted by the chaos i ducked into his private stores and nicked a whole lot of his boomslang skin we needed it to make polyjuice potion which you and harry used to disguise yourselves as crabbe and goyle so you could infiltrate the slytherin common room spot on said ron no one knew that but the three of us ronald weasley began a furious mrs weasley how could you involve yourself in such a flagrant breach of i dontknow how many school rules stealing from professor snape hey good one said fred in admiration who would have thought that ickle ronniekins had it in him george right fred replied his twin i think our little ron earned the right to call us his brothers nicking stuff from snape private stores our very own establishment of preference for purloining quality pranking ingredients mrs weasley was looking outraged and was about to launch into another tirade but mr weasley was having trouble hiding his amusement and delight at the trio accomplishments especially in getting one over on snape that enough barked moody at the twins stop fooling around it seems that the girl must be hermione granger he conceded somewhat unwillingly but we still dontknow if the other one is really godfry go on ask him something what the colour and design of your favourite boxers asked harry laughing quite certain now that these were his friends that a bit of a personal question replied rick also laughing actually i think i wearing them so why donti just pull down my no dontdo that there are young witches present interrupted a scandalised mrs weasley that wontbe necessary a description will be fine rick dear rick could barely stop laughing well my very favourites the ones that you were admiring when i was unpacking my trunk are bright red they have all different kinds of dragons on them flying about do they breathe fire asked ginny giggling that will be enough from you young lady said her mother trying to sound severe but spoiling the effect by snorting alastor i think they ve proved themselves please let them come in who knows what they ve been through they may be hurt alright said mad eye grudgingly but he didntput his wand away harry and ron rushed over to hermione and hugged her they were so happy to have her back alive although neither of them had said it aloud to anyone they had both feared that they would never see their best friend alive again this had been the most terrible christmas day of their lives the mood at the burrow had been sombre and serious no one had been able to think of anything hopeful to say so they had remained silent then mad eye moody arrived with griselda dumbledore had sent them to help guard harry in rick absence although the reason he had given them was to make sure that harry stayed at the burrow and did not try dashing off to rescue hermione the presence of the paranoid ex auror did absolutely nothing to lift their spirits he would have been a great success in the undertaking trade tell us the whole story said ginny eagerly after hugging and kissing hermione now everyone just wait a minute said mrs weasley lifting up hermione arms to make a quick inspection they ve just been through a terrible experience they may be hurt everyone please be quite for a moment hermione dear are you hurt or injured no i fine mrs weasley honestly i am hermione replied are you sure my dear you werentharmed in any way asked mrs weasley with motherly concern my only injury is the loss of a lock of my hair said hermione apart from that i absolutely fine honestly mrs weasley how about you rick dear asked mrs weasley turning her attention to him i just fine thank you mrs weasley really i am rick assured her well come on then said ron impatiently tell us what happened to you we want to know how you escaped i sorry said hermione awkwardly but i can t professor dumbledore asked us not to talk about what happened he said if we did it would risk revealing things that were best kept secret for now i d really like to tell you but for the moment i can t but why not complained ginny cantyou at least tell us how you were captured and where you were taken i guess i can tell you how i was captured said hermione somehow voldemort placed a present under our christmas tree with my name on it it was some kind of book but when i unwrapped it and touched it i was pulled away it was a portkey please dontask me any more questions i really cantanswer them i have to respect professor dumbledore wishes hermione right said mr weasley if dumbledore said not to talk about it he has his reasons and we should all respect them he knows a lot of things that no one else knows that right agreed mad eye the best way to make sure your enemy doesntlearn your secrets is not to tell anyone except those who absolutely need to know not even your closest friends people can be captured as we ve all just seen they can be tortured given veritaserum or tricked into divulging secrets but what they dontknow they cantsay it the golden rule in the auror division only tell people what they need to know now everyone leave them alone no more questions he said gruffly come on everyone let go inside said mrs weasley it time for christmas tea and afterwards we can have a party to celebrate hermione safe return we haventhad anything to celebrate yet today but now we do yeah great idea said fred george my lad maybe we should enter into the festive spirit by donating some of weasleys wizard wheezes finest confectionary capital idea said george agreed griselda my dear have you ever had the pleasure of indulging yourself in weasleys wizard wheezes fabulous fruity frogs come on guys laughed griselda you dontthink i that gullible to you sorry but to get through auror training you need to have a very well developed sense of scepticism plus i ve been working with mad eye for the past year i constant vigilance personified go find yourselves another bunny you could always try mad eye she suggested with a wicked grin everyone laughed there was no way the paranoid moody would ever touch any of the twins creations but still the image of mad eye turned into a tangelo toad hopping about with a wooden leg was most amusing boy talk about a hard case sighed fred well sod the fruity frogs then allow us to show you the wonderful christmas decorations in the lounge they re most impressive said george putting an arm through griselda s yes agreed fred we have some highly unusual ornaments allow us to give you the guided tour he added enthusiastically taking the attractive young witch other arm ginny almost collapsed giggling as her brothers whisked griselda back to the house what so funny asked hermione enchanted mistletoe giggled ginny fred and george put some up in the lounge what does it do asked harry well it sort of started ginny then she had a better idea umm it kind of hard to explain harry come on i ll show you she said grinning enthusiastically ginny dontyou dare said mrs weasley but ginny was already dragging a curious harry off to the house rick smiled at hermione and whispered in her ear this enchanted mistletoe sounds interesting maybe we should go investigate as they approached the lounge griselda came storming out very red faced she was followed by fred and george who were both looking sore and sorry for themselves each was rubbing a very red cheek entering the lounge they found harry and ginny in a passionate embrace but the pair jumped apart when they finally noticed rick and hermione harry was most embarrassed but ginny was looking extremely happy and pleased with herself so umm how does enchanted mistletoe work then asked hermione getting more curious by the moment i ll show you said ginny with a wicked grin she grabbed rick arm and before he realised what she was up to she had dragged him under the clump of enchanted mistletoe rick suddenly felt the irresistible urge to kiss ginny but as they began to kiss he felt himself being dragged away by a very irate hermione rick how could you demanded hermione furious with him for kissing ginny oops my mistake i didntrealise that rick was your exclusive property but i do now and it was such a nice way to find out said ginny smirking well rick certainly knew didntyou rick demanded hermione turning angrily on him how could you kiss ginny and right in front of me too err hermione said rick guiltily you haventcome across enchanted mistletoe in your reading then have you of course not she replied irritably why would i be asking ginny what it is if i already knew it s err it kind of hard to explain how it works you really need to err to experience it said rick walking back under the enchanted mistletoe come on hermione come over here i ll show you not bloody likely not after you ve just been snogging ginny and would probably still be snogging if i hadntdragged you away what gall to think i would want to kiss you after that you you well if you dontwant to kiss rick i wouldntmind going another round with him under the enchanted mistletoe said ginny with a big grin as she walked back towards rick ginny weasley dontyou dare kiss rick again or i ll never ever speak to you again yelled hermione in desperation she rushed over to push ginny away from rick but rick managed to grab hermione and pulled her under the enchanted mistletoe suddenly hermione found that she wasntangry with rick anymore she didnt want to yell at him she just wanted to kiss him very very much they kissed for a long time and it might have been a lot longer if they hadntfinally been interrupted by loud applause from ginny ron harry and the twins where did you all come from gasped hermione turning bright red with embarrassment oh my err so err so that what enchanted mistletoe does she stammered it kind of makes you really want to kiss doesntit she said as if she d never wanted to kiss rick before in her life or ever kissed him for that matter err i think i better get away from here she squeaked as she noticed fred and george coming towards her with big grins on their faces they had a great party that night everyone was in high spirits especially after mad eye moody was called away to another assignment by dumbledore he really was a bit of a party pooper unfortunately for fred and george griselda went with him but they amused themselves and everyone else with their tricks and by doing summoning charms on the enchanted mistletoe they caught hermione with rick a couple of times and also ginny with harry but only when their parents werentpresent after breakfast the next morning mrs weasley sent ron and ginny out to de gnome the garden the twins had returned their own digs she absolutely forbade harry hermione and rick to help they were guests after all the three of them were sitting drinking hot chocolate at the kitchen table maybe we can get started with our special training said hermione looking up from her book it was her christmas present from rick a theoretical appreciation of the animagus transformation she d been deeply engrossed in it since getting up that morning ok said rick let go up to my room we dontwant anyone to know about it come on harry what special training is this asked harry wait till we get upstairs and i ll tell you all about it said hermione when they got to rick room hermione told harry what dumbledore had said about the two of them becoming animagi and rick helping them wow exclaimed harry looking a little stunned ever since third year when i found out that my dad was one i ve wanted to be an animagus but i never really thought i d be able to so i kind of stopped thinking about it so you re also an animagus rick i should have guessed your powers seem to be limitless what your animagus form err well actually i can change into quite a few different animals said rick a little uneasily i didntknow that was possible i ve never heard of that before have you ever read of anyone who could do that hermione asked harry err no said hermione but it true during my rescue rick turned into quite a few different animals go on rick show him but not the dragon not in here dragon asked harry incredulously you can turn into a dragon err yeah said rick a norwegian ridgeback actually just the thing when you need a bit of firepower squeak squeak rick had just turned into a tiny brown mouse oh how adorable said hermione picking it up and scratching it affectionately behind the ears she hadntseen rick mouse animagus before and she was captivated suddenly she found herself holding a large grey tabby cat mmm you re lovely too she said hugging it rick purred contentedly and then suddenly squawked as he changed into a brightly coloured lorikeet and began flying around the room that what i want to be said harry wistfully some kind of bird i want to fly rick came down and landed on harry shoulder ok the show over time for you two to get to work harry almost fell off the bed you can talk of course listen said rick polly want a cracker while harry and hermione were laughing rick transformed back into his human form it says in my animagus book that the most difficult part of becoming an animagus is discovering your true animagus form your inner animal normal animagi only have one said hermione looking pointedly at rick it says that one of the main roles of the teacher is to help the student discover their true form do you have any idea how to do that rick umm i not sure said rick maybe if you come over here and sit in my lap for a bit it might help help what laughed harry grinning slyly shall i go get the enchanted mistletoe no really i serious said rick feeling a bit embarrassed i want to see if i can visualise hermione animagus form well i game said hermione with a smirk but i cantwait until it your turn harry she went over to rick who was sitting in an old armchair in the corner of the room and sat in his lap rick pulled her close and pressed his forehead against hers he sat like that concentrating hard for several minutes finally he released her saying i think i ve got it what is it asked hermione feeling excited but also unexpectedly anxious wait donttell me the teacher is only supposed to help the student but the student must discover their animagus form themselves ok close your eyes said rick imagine that you re in a forest it sunset and you ve just woken up feel yourself stretching out sniffing the evening air for scents feel yourself pushing through the undergrowth your senses all alert you re thirsty so you make your way down to a to rock pool you put one paw in the water and as you lean over to drink you catch sight of your reflection you see a fox i a fox squealed hermione jumping about the room in delight why didnti guess laughed harry that you d turn out to be something wise and cunning it so obvious right harry your turn now err let see if we can do this without having you sitting in my lap agreed said harry with obvious relief let try standing facing each other said rick getting up from the armchair he put his hands on harry shoulders and pressed his forehead against harry s try to relax said rick this was a lot more difficult than with hermione because their special link had made it easy for him they stayed standing that way for almost a quarter of an hour finally rick pulled back his forehead but kept hold of harry shoulders keep your eyes closed harry said rick feel yourself high up in the air above the forbidden forest feel the wind ruffling your feathers now you feel the air becoming warmer you ve found a thermal you stretch your wings wide holding them still as the thermal pushes you higher suddenly far down below by a rock pool you spot something moving you pull in your wings and dive straight down at an incredible speed but as you pull out of the dive you see that your quarry has spotted you it disappears into the bushes so you flap your powerful wings to regain altitude and fly towards the hogwarts castle as you cross the lake you descend a little to admire your reflection on the water it an eagle said harry solemnly a golden eagle to be precise added rick wow said hermione in awe i did a project on them at school before i came to hogwarts their wingspan can reach up to nine feet they fly at around thirty miles an hour but they can reach speeds approaching two hundred miles an hour when diving wow said harry feeling slightly stunned golden eagles have no natural predators said hermione continuing her lecture they feed upon rabbits hares squirrels and birds such as grouse and partridge they also occasionally take fish snakes insects and larger mammals such as young deer umm what about foxes asked harry with a grin yes foxes too said hermione goodness do you think that was a fox you were diving for in your imagination perhaps it not safe for us to train together dont worry rick reassured her in your animagus form although you ll feel the natural animal instincts you will still be yourself you will always know who you are and you ll be in control so what do we do next asked harry enthusiastically it says in the book that you need to spend several months visualizing your animagus form said hermione you should try to think of it frequently throughout the day and concentrate on it when you go to bed at night before falling asleep but perhaps with rick helping us it wonttake that long yeah i think i ll be able to speed things up said rick just do the visualising for now when we get back to hogwarts we can start working on transforming ok come on harry how about we have another duelling session you ve been making really good progress i think we should keep it up great idea let do it said harry happily the rest of the holiday was pleasant but uneventful they returned to king cross station the same way they had come by secure floo and then enchanted taxi with a guard detail courtesy of the order harry ron hermione and rick shared a compartment on the hogwarts express they were joined at various times by different friends coming to say hello padma patil spent quite a lot of time with them it was pretty obvious that she fancied ron even ron couldntfail to notice rick grinned to himself as he noticed ron letting padma beat him at a game of wizard chess she was good very good but no match for ron with the way he had improved over christmas as they pulled into hogsmeade station and everyone began leaving the compartment rick grabbed hermione hand and pulled her back when the compartment was empty he said to her hermione we ve hardly had any time alone the last few days how about a quick kiss before we get off the train yes privacy a little hard to come by at the weasley s said hermione grinning and embracing rick but it wasnta quick kiss it went on and on the two of them were in a world of their own oblivious to whatever else might be happening and something was most definitely happening the platform at hogsmeade station was a simple affair the station consisted of a long narrow building running parallel to the tracks it was possible to enter or leave the platform through several doorways in the station building or at either end which were completely open or at least used to be completely open today however when the students had disembarked from the train and walked towards the hogwarts end of the platform to board the horseless carriages a sheet of flames flew up in front of them blocking their path there were gasps and screams some students tried rushing down to the other end of the platform to escape but another sheet of flames was blocking that end also they tried the doorways in the station building but they were all locked shut and couldntbe opened by alohomora or any other unlocking charm finally they tried to re board the train but all the doors had closed and were also securely locked they were trapped i dontlike this at all said harry to ron where the hell is rick about thirty or forty masked black robed figures suddenly materialised on the platform death eaters students of hogwarts said a cold female voice amplified by a sonorus charm do not reach for your wands and you will not be harmed the dark lord wishes you no ill on the contrary some of the purebloods among you will be invited to join the hallowed ranks of his death eaters when you have finished your schooling then your education will begin in earnest we are here today for two students only harry potter and hermione granger the dark lord has issued a special invitation to them one which he insists they accept the cold voice added cruelly no one else has anything to fear unless they get in our way be warned draw your wand and you become a target dont expect that fool of a headmaster dumbledore or anyone else from hogwarts to come to your rescue they wont we ve taken care of them she added cackling gleefully bellatrix lestrange spat harry i d recognise that hag cackling anywhere he drew his wand and cast a reflecting shield around himself put up a deflecting shield mate he said to ron who was also standing wand drawn in fact most of the students had drawn their wands they werentabout to let harry potter and hermione granger be taken without putting up a fight stupid little children said bellatrix lestrange derisively dont say you werentwarned the students fought valiantly but most of them were no match for trained death eaters the da members from last year however put up stiff resistance eventually the death eaters located harry it was obvious that their orders were to take him alive because they werentusing anything lethal on him from behind his shield harry was letting loose with a variety of hexes he had already disarmed three death eaters with stupify and two others were lying flat on the platform after he hit them with the petrificus totalus spell however that was nothing compared to what they had done to themselves seven or eight death eaters had been hit by their own hexes rebounding with double strength from harry reflecting shield but in the confusion they hadntrealised what was happening and continued flinging hexes at harry ron had taken out two death eaters before his shield collapsed and he was knocked out by a nasty expelliarmus spell by the time the death eaters had managed to subdue the students over half of them were down clearly they had not expected the students to put up such a valiant defence well well if it isntlittle baby potter said bellatrix in her mock baby voice as she approached harry with the remaining death eaters it looks like someone has been teaching you but she was cut off as harry yelled stupify she had to dive for the platform to avoid his curse harry had never held his reflecting shield for so long it was beginning to drain him he didntknow how much longer he could keep it up what the hell has happened to rick he asked himself bellatrix lestrange was back on her feet and dusting herself off so little baby potter wants to play does he she cackled insanely where your little mudblood friend potter the dark lord was highly offended at the insolent little brat refusal of his gracious hospitality she needs to be taught some manners he extending his hospitality to her again and he insists she accept it along with you she cackled in fact i going to make sure that you both accept my master hospitality come on little boy the time for games is over well i dontthink so yelled harry you horrible hag you killed sirius and i going to avenge his death if it the last thing i do ha ha cackled bellatrix have you forgotten what i told you in the department of mysteries little harry you donthave what it takes to use an unforgivable curse you re too much of a goody goody ha ha harry struggled to hold up his reflecting shield he wouldntbe able to hold it much longer he had an idea he concentrated all his energy on holding his shield and pointed his wand at her as if he was about to hex her let me show you how it done crucio she yelled gleefully ahhhhhhhhh she screamed as her cruciatus curse flew back and hit her sending her writhing to the platform in utter agony fortunately for her the spell was broken as she fell several of the death eaters helped her to her feet she was shaking and twitching violently and looking even crazier than usual well well the little potter boy has learned how to hate that was quite a cruciatus curse my compliments what a pity my master wants you dead potter you ve got what it takes to be a great death eater my master would have preferred me to bring you to him alive but dead is preferable to allowing you to evade your fate yet again it looks like i going to be the one who gets the pleasure and the glory of turning the boy who lived into the boy who died she cackled raising her wand harry knew what was coming if only he could hold his reflecting shield for a few moments more he tried desperately to hold it but his energy was slowly draining away avada kedavra screamed bellatrix please take a few moments to leave a review chapter 17 the foxy lady rick suddenly released hermione from their passionate embrace sensing that something was wrong he opened the door of the train compartment and rushed over to the windows along the corridor the sight that greeted him was horrific students were sprawled everywhere he could see the backs of the group of death eaters who had surrounded harry but he couldntsee beyond them he couldnt see harry anywhere a terrible fear gripped his heart harry must be dead unless he d been taken to voldemort i ve failed him thought rick i ve failed the great witches and wizards of the light i ve failed dumbledore i ve failed everyone all because of my damn selfishness my god cried hermione looking through the windows and seeing the chaos and the death eaters on the platform stay here hermione get down and stay out of sight rick said vanishing he had made himself invisible before apparating to the death eaters on the platform the first thing he saw was harry lying on the platform rick immediately threw up a reflecting shield to protect him he was incredibly relieved to discover that harry was still alive he looked like he had collapsed from exhaustion there were about fifteen death eaters pointing their wands at harry rick disarmed them levitating their wands to dance high above their heads he then put an impediment jinx on the astonished death eaters to prevent them escaping he found the rest of the death eaters lying scattered around the platform and levitated them over to join the others he ennervated the ones who were stunned having already given their wands the same treatment as those of their fellow death eaters then he put an impediment jinx on them as well looking around rick could see that some of the students were hurt he needed to get help rick apparated to the other side of the sheet of flames at one end of the platform there were two death eaters maintaining it with some kind of spell rick levitated their wands and the flames immediately vanished he levitated them over to join the other death eaters again using an impediment jinx to immobilise them he did the same with the pair maintaining the sheet of flames at the other end of the platform after a quick scan to make sure all the death eaters were incapacitated he apparated to the hogwarts gates where he found four more death eaters maintaining another sheet of flames across the gateway it was effectively trapping the hogwarts staff within the ward line of the school which was very cunning because the hogwarts anti apparition wards were preventing the teachers from apparating out to help the students rick disarmed the death eaters and immediately put an impediment jinx on them the sheet of flames vanished to reveal hagrid along with professors dumbledore mcgonagall flitwick and sprout looking bewildered since rick was invisible they could not understand at first how the death eaters had been stunned the situation is under control headmaster said rick in the ethereal voice of the ghost of godric gryffindor but some of the students have been hurt and are in need of assistance i suggest you apparate to hogsmeade station at once it will be my pleasure to deal with these death eaters rick apparated the four death eaters back to the station to add to his collection then he rushed over to see if harry was ok professor dumbledore had already found him and was helping a shaky and exhausted looking harry to his feet rick breathed a huge sigh of relief then remembering that hermione was still locked in the train he apparated the door of her compartment and unlocked it calling out to her in his normal voice it safe now hermione you can get off the train hermione immediately rushed over to harry and hugged him in relief harry i was so worried she cried are you alright then she saw the prone body of bellatrix lestrange she wore no mask her face was frozen in fear eyes wide open harry she looks like she been hit by the killing curse what happened in her anxiety about harry hermione hadntnoticed the headmaster it was obvious that he d been talking to harry excuse me professor dumbledore she said i didntsee you i sorry if i interrupted not at all miss granger he said smiling indulgently at her harry was just telling me how he held off the death eaters with the reflecting shield that he mastered over the holidays a most impressive feat please continue harry i must have held it for five minutes at least said harry but towards the end it was a real struggle the funny thing is not one of the death eaters twigged to the fact that it was their own curses hitting them they thought all the curses were coming from me bellatrix lestrange got quite a shock when her own cruciatus curse hit her she thought it was mine but by then i was barely able to hold the reflecting shield it takes so much energy when she finally threw the killing curse at me i really didntthink i had the energy to stop it i only just managed before collapsing well done harry said dumbledore this reflecting shield that rick taught you is the only thing i have ever known to stop a killing curse except of course for the protection that your mother used to save you as a baby it is a formidable weapon harry i suggest we keep quiet about it let people think what they will about how bellatrix lestrange died if you had in fact used a killing curse in self defence there would be no blame attached sirius death is avenged said harry solemnly staring sadly at the lifeless form of bellatrix lestrange but harry was not rejoicing inwardly he felt shaken at having caused the death of another person even a totally evil one like bellatrix lestrange it is poetic justice said dumbledore she died by her own evil curse yet you can feel that you contributed without feeling that you are a killer you have avenged his death without having to kill i think sirius would be very happy on both counts by your leave headmaster said the voice of the ghost emanating eerily without warning i think these death eaters deserve a good squibbing to ensure that they do not attack innocent students again by all means please proceed agreed dumbledore it a most appropriate and efficacious punishment he added leaving harry and hermione and making his way over to the jinxed death eaters hermione do you know what happened to rick asked harry i didntsee him anywhere during the fight with the death eaters i was desperate for him to come and help me especially when i felt my reflecting shield starting to fail i really thought i was a goner umm i think he must have apparated to get the ghost of godric gryffindor lied hermione well it wasnta complete lie she thought to herself it was true in a way you mean rick can summon the ghost of godric gryffindor asked harry incredulously err yes said hermione he told me one time that he can channel him well that at least is true she thought to herself he did say it after all even if he was lying well that lucky said harry the ghost got here just in the nick of time i collapsed just after bellatrix lestrange avada kedavra ed herself holding the reflecting shield for so long and seeing off two unforgivables it drained me completely there were still over a dozen death eaters waiting to finish me off or take me to voldemort it seems like the ghost of godric gryffindor has saved the day again just as harry said that the rasping voice of the ghost itself rang out loud and intimidating along the length of the station death eaters you shall now be punished for this attack let this be a warning to every death eater that they can no longer attack the innocent with impunity i the ghost of godric gryffindor shall exact a terrible punishment upon them i shall squib them as i now squib you squibbus the death eaters wands drifted down to them but they couldntcatch them in fact they couldntmove they were still under the impediment jinx oops how silly of me chortled the ghost finite incantatem sorry chaps but that just to end the impediment jinx it won t of course end the squibbus curse that spell is permanent the death eaters immediately grabbed their wands and tried to apparate away but without success they tried all kinds of spells finally giving up utterly dejected yes it is rather nasty isntit said the ghost sounding extremely satisfied with itself do be sure to let your death eater friends know the terrible fate that awaits them if they do not repent and mend their ways luckily for you you re at a train station and if i not mistaken the hogwarts express is about to depart so you ll get home at least please be kind enough to take the body of your former colleague with you said professor dumbledore pointing to the prone black robed figure of bellatrix lestrange lying on the platform he then turned his attention to the students the hogwarts professors had ennervated all the stunned students who were unsteadily getting to their feet only three students were unable to walk to the horseless carriages professor flitwick had cast a mobilicorpus spell on them and was levitating all three of them to the nearest carriage rick waited until the platform was almost empty before making himself visible the hogwarts express had departed with the death eaters aboard only professor dumbledore remained waiting to have words with him rick guessed grimly he was feeling completely ashamed of himself and was really not looking forward to facing the headmaster but he would have to do it sooner or later i might as well get it over with he thought err professor dumbledore said rick apologetically i really sorry i let you down like that i feel terribly ashamed of myself but what happened rick where on earth were you when the death eaters attacked err on the train sir said rick looking sheepishly at his feet and wishing that a hole would open up and swallow him yes but why didntyou apparate onto the platform in your ghost of godric gryffindor guise and deal with the death eaters immediately asked the headmaster baffled err because i didntactually notice them sir i didntrealise there was an attack for quite a while said rick quietly hanging his head but why not asked dumbledore completely mystified now how on earth could you not have noticed well sir you see err started rick you see sir i was a little distracted at the time yes asked dumbledore waiting expectantly i was err i was well you see i was kissing hermione sir he finally managed to blurt out i know it sounds stupid he continued quickly trying to explain himself but when we kiss something very strange happens it like i no longer there like i go somewhere else i have no idea at all what is happening around me there is something most unusual about your link with miss granger it seems that your feelings for her somehow connect you with something greater than the both of you it is most interesting do you think i should end our relationship professor asked rick determinedly it seems to be distracting me from the work i was sent here to do it happened before but never with such drastic and potentially disastrous consequences as today my feelings for hermione impelled me to risk my life and so much more when i went to rescue her at azkaban i just dontknow what to do rick i do not believe that you need to end your relationship with miss granger a link has been forged between the two of you which cannot easily be broken if you were to attempt to end the relationship you would still be distracted perhaps even more so you would still feel compelled to rescue her if she was in danger i doubt it would help he said smiling at rick but then what can i do asked rick desperately harry nearly lost his life today because of me he held off all those death eaters with his reflecting shield for five minutes or more it completely exhausted his energy i arrived just in time he had collapsed completely vulnerable at the mercy of a dozen or more death eaters it was such a close call yes it certainly was a near thing agreed dumbledore but whether it was luck or who knows what it turned out well in the end there were no lasting injuries harry proved to himself that he has the power to face his enemies and win you deserve some of the credit for that not only for teaching him to deploy the reflecting shield but also if i am not mistaken for somehow increasing his magical power it is quite extraordinary that he could hold a shield like that for so long and that he stopped the killing curse also harry has i believe finally laid to rest the painful feelings that have been tormenting him since the death of sirius black all in all it has worked out rather well thank you professor said rick that makes me feel a lot better but i going to have to learn to stay focused that two attacks by voldemort in the past couple of weeks it seems like he going on the offensive yes i believe you are correct although we were lucky today you are going to have to stay focused on what you are here for rick said the headmaster looking at him seriously since you have discovered just how distracting miss granger can be may i suggest that you take care to only engage in distracting activities when harry is safe and all is secure perhaps i should arrange to have alastor moody give you some private tutoring in the art of constant vigilance suggested dumbledore his blue eyes twinkling mischievously err thank you very much sir said rick quickly but i dont think that will be necessary i think i ve learned my lesson today i going to try very hard to keep my mind focused from now on yes i sure you will rick said dumbledore smiling at him with the start of the new term harry and hermione began their animagus training with rick in earnest they met almost every other evening in the room of requirement which was doing a very convincing imitation of a forest for them it reminded harry of the classroom where he d had his divination lessons with firenze the previous year the room seemed unbelievably immense the floor was grassy with trees growing everywhere looking upwards all you could see were tree branches and leaves there were several small clearings connected by dirt paths one led to a small waterfall cascading down into a beautiful rock pool which was surrounded by boulders ideal for sitting on and gazing into the tranquil waters they spent most of their time around the pool it was an enchanted place the soothing sound of the water somehow seemed to draw them closer to nature and perhaps to their inner animal although rick was supposed to be doing the training it was in fact hermione who having read every book on the subject determined how they should proceed most of the books recommend starting with exercises involving altering the body through visualisation she said you need to start with something simple like lengthening and shortening a finger rick guided them through the visualisation process harry mastered it quickly rick wondered whether harry was a metamorphmagus like himself and made a note to investigate the possibility with harry later harry was a natural soon he was able to make all his fingers and toes grow and shrink at will hermione was alarmed that harry was getting ahead of her she was determined not to let him beat her at mastering the animagus transformation she felt disgraced every time rick got a better mark than her in class there was no way she was going to let harry beat her at this her competitive nature spurred her on and very soon hermione caught up with harry they went on to changing the length of their arms and legs they looked so ridiculous at times that it was hard to remain serious when they started on their faces and necks it became impossible they would collapse in hysterics at harry with ears as large as an african elephant s or hermione with a four foot long neck looking like a giraffe having a bad day we re making really good progress said hermione happily one evening we just need to be able to do these body transformation exercises a bit more quickly and we ll be finished with that part of the training so what next asked harry developing an empathy with our animal answered hermione the books talk about bonding with it i mean if your animal was a cat for instance you d get yourself a pet cat and spend lots of time with it trying to understand it how it thinks and feels hermione said harry where am i going to find a pet golden eagle i might be able to help you there said rick closing his eyes and trying to visualise the animagus forms of some of the great spirits to whom he was linked i cantdo an eagle but i can do you a peregrine falcon with that rick transformed into one he spread his wings and began to fly about beneath the tree tops harry tentatively held out his right arm the falcon glided down and landed gently on his wrist it was a powerful fierce looking bird and although harry knew that it was really rick he found its proximity to his face quite intimidating harry observed closely as the falcon slowly spread its wings and stretched them he studied how it took off how it moved its wings to gain height how it held them out rigidly as it glided and how it moved them to stall itself as it landed on his arm harry found it easy to let his mind become absorbed in the falcon it fascinated him he examined every part of its body minutely from the cruel beak to the powerful claws it was a very impressive bird and it filled him with awe and longing longing to transform into a golden eagle what about me hermione asked rick the two of them were sitting alone in the common room after returning to gryffindor tower just before the night time curfew hermione was concerned that harry was going to beat her she felt rick had given him an unfair advantage i ll come visit you in your dormitory tonight he said with a grin what squeaked hermione dontyou dare of course i was planning on turning into a fox first laughed rick you mean you can turn into a fox just like my animagus form asked hermione excitedly i haventtried yet but i ve seen it in my mind so i sure i can dont you think it might look just a little odd rick i mean a fox coming out of your dormitory and going into mine asked hermione sarcastically no no that not what i had in mind said rick i was planning to apparate from my dormitory to yours invisibly of course then i ll hop on your bed and transform into a fox rick godfry said hermione outraged dontyou dare apparate into my dormitory ever one of us might be getting undressed hermione turned on rick and stared at him hard rick have you ever apparated into my dormitory no said rick never i promise what about other girls dormitories asked hermione suspiciously look hermione whispered rick i ve been spying for dumbledore all year ok i ve been in the dormitories of the senior slytherin girls sometimes but not often and i certainly dontstay around if they re undressing believe me most of my spying has been on draco malfoy although since his father got squibbed he been keeping his nose clean the only time i accidentally came across a female undressing was one time when i apparated into umbridge room but believe me i was out of there like greased lightning umbridge in her knickers it should be classified as an unforgivable hermione laughed at the image of rick encounter with umbridge what i thought we could do said rick becoming serious is for you to summon me once your dorm mates are asleep i may not be able to come immediately i ll have to wait until the guys in my dormitory are asleep as well i ll apparate directly to your bed and immediately turn into a fox i can sleep on your bed just make sure you draw the hangings umm rick said hermione i not sure if this is such a good idea boys arentallowed in the girls dormitories i mean you could get expelled if you were caught hermione they dontexpel foxes now stop worrying i dontknow rick i dontlike breaking the rules i a prefect after all and umm i d feel a bit guilty about having you spend the night in my bed umm are you a male fox do you know umm i dontknow actually does it matter hey i know laughed rick you can check tonight rick giggled hermione swatting him on the arm you re terrible i pretty sure your animagus form is the same gender as you err unless you re gay in which case it can be either well i pretty sure i not gay said rick grinning at hermione but some of my animagus forms are from the spirits of great witches so some of them are likely to be female for all you know i might be a cute little vixen the perfect mascot for a girls dormitory just think of me as a fur toy to cuddle up to when you go to sleep you know with the link between us it bound to accelerate your progress rick final comment did it hermione was desperate to succeed in becoming an animagus this was more important than school rules and maybe she d still beat harry ok she finally agreed but make sure you dontcome until i summon you and transform immediately ok hermione lay nervously in her bed waiting for rick to appear she had just summoned him suddenly she felt something heavy at the end of her bed she quickly pulled her legs up lumos she whispered hermione was surprised at the size of the fox she hadnt realised that it would be so large tentatively the fox crawled on its belly up towards the head of the bed hermione found it a little frightening she knew it was rick but it was still a fox a wild animal a cunning predator not some docile house pet but the beauty of the animal captivated her it looked a bit like a dog with a pointed muzzle and a bushy white tipped tail its thick coat was an attractive reddish brown colour and the light of her wand reflected the curiosity in both of their eyes hermione timidly reached out a hand and ran it gently along the fox side it snuggled closer to her obviously it like being petted hermione loved the feel of its thick fur she loved patting it and caressing it and it was clear that the fox was enjoying the attention hermione felt a strong attraction to the animal is it because it really rick and because of our link or is it my inner animal feeling attracted to one of its own kind she wondered whatever it was hermione really loved the fox and felt deeply drawn to it she could feel it gently pulling her enticing her into its world extinguishing her wand light hermione wrapped an arm around the fox and drifted contentedly off to sleep dreaming she was a fox running wild through the forest hermione felt something warm and wet against her cheek her eyes flew open and she found herself staring into the eyes of the fox only inches away from her own the fox was licking her face it felt nice it almost morning she thought this must be how foxes say goodbye rick momentarily reverted to his human form before disapparating from her bed hermione nervously checked that the hangings around her bed were completely closed the last thing she needed was for parvati or lavender to see rick in her bed much as hermione loved having rick the fox in her bed it made her feel nervous and guilty fortunately he only needed to spend two more nights snuggled up to her in his fox form on friday evening harry and hermione were again working on their animagus transformations with rick in the room of requirement when hermione suddenly turned into a fox harry gasped in surprise he was the only one able to gasp as hermione and rick were both foxes harry had no trouble telling the foxes apart hermione was noticeably smaller than rick harry guessed that female foxes were smaller than the males and that rick was a male fox after all but there was an easier way of distinguishing hermione foxes normally had quite a bit of fur on their faces but hermione head was positively bushy especially between her eyes and ears rick and hermione seemed to be having a great time playing in the underbrush one minute rick was chasing after hermione then the next hermione was giving chase and rick was fleeing before her eventually the male fox changed back into an exhausted puffing rick hey mate he said with difficulty to harry as he tried to catch his breath so what do you think of our cute little vixen there no doubt at all that it hermione laughed harry did you notice all the bushy fur on her head but harry stopped laughing because the fox had just sunk its teeth into his ankle ouch yelled harry cut it out hermione those teeth are razor sharp go take your carnivorous cravings elsewhere or it ll be payback time when i transform into an eagle hermione transformed back into herself she was so excited she couldnt stay still oh harry i so sorry i just got a bit carried away when you said my face was furry i didntrealize how sharp my teeth were or that i was hurting you let me see that leg oh my it really bleeding badly that a very deep wound harry i so sorry come on we ll have to get you to madam pomfrey before you bleed to death calm down hermione said rick i err i think i may be able to fix harry leg rick remembered to use his wand there d be fewer questions from harry that way he waved it at harry leg and it was instantly healed without so much as a scratch on it there harry all better we ll just have to hope that hermione doesnthave rabies he added with a snide grin hoping to distract harry from what he d just done yeah laughed harry thanks rick nice work madam pomfrey couldnt have done it any better so you can heal as well is there any magic that you cantdo i dontsuppose there much point in me asking you again where all your magical knowledge and power comes from you wonttell me will you asked harry in frustration rick just shook his head smiling apologetically hermione meanwhile had just turned back into a fox excited as she was at finally attaining her animagus form and beating harry she still had work to do the books advised practicing the transformation until one could do it instantly hermione as always was aiming for perfection who would have guessed that beneath the prim and proper exterior of hogwarts alpha bookworm there been a foxy lady just waiting to burst out laughed rick making sure that hermione was out of earshot he didntwant to have his leg gnawed off so what about me rick asked harry grinning at rick joke do you think i ll need much longer no you re close mate said rick i ve got an idea to help you along what if i transform into a peregrine falcon sometime while you hop on your broom we can go flying together i ll stay just in front of you that way you ll be able to watch me fly and maybe absorb the feeling i think that what helped hermione so much she was able to pick up on my feelings when i was a fox so is that where you ve been the past few nights asked harry with a grin i noticed you werentin your bed so whose bed were you in then hermione perhaps err yeah no err what i mean is that i was in her bed no not in her bed on her bed but i was a fox the whole time honest harry and it was just to help her with her animagus transformation of course of course grinned harry relax rick i believe you and anyway i not a prefect like ron luckily for you i dont think ron noticed you missing he sleeps like a log please donttell him mate begged rick he might not understand and it might be best not to let on to hermione that you know either she d be really embarrassed no worries mate i ll keep quiet laughed harry but you do realise that you donthave any excuses to be out of your bed at night anymore dontyou please take a few moments to leave a review chapter 19 hogwarts destroyed on a crisp sunny saturday morning in february harry and rick walked down to the edge of the forbidden forest ducking behind a large oak rick transformed into a majestic peregrine falcon and immediately took flight it was the first time he d flown outside the room of requirement and he loved it the feel of the wind enveloping him and lifting him cushioning him and supporting him was amazing the sense of freedom was breathtaking of course he d flown in his dragon form but flying as a falcon was completely different it was unbelievably exhilarating in fact rick became so carried away with the excitement of flying that he forgot all about harry when he finally remembered he looked down to see harry speeding towards him on his firebolt rick circled for a while waiting for harry when he eventually caught up rick came down gently on the end of harry broom wow said harry in admiration it amazing watching you fly i cantwait to fly like that ok so the plan was that you re going to fly a bit ahead of me and i ll concentrate on observing you and try to absorb some of the feeling i ll tell you what this isntjust going to be good animagus training it ll also double as quidditch practice having to turn and dive and try to keep up with you on my broom the falcon lifted off from harry broom and went into a steep dive it took all of harry prodigious flying skills to keep up as it twisted and turned this way and that it was easy enough staying up with the falcon when it was gaining altitude or flying level but there was no way harry could stay with it in a dive rick had decided to keep roughly to the boundary of the forbidden forest as he didntwant to risk taking harry beyond the hogwarts wards they were far enough away from the castle that only harry would be visible it would look to an observer in the castle like harry was out for an early saturday morning workout on his broom coming out of a particularly steep dive and levelling out only a few feet from the ground rick looked about for harry but there was no sign of him anywhere rick looked all along the edge of the forest as he beat his wings hard quickly gaining altitude but still he couldnt see harry anywhere rick was starting to worry he was right behind me when i went into that dive why would he fly off rather than follow me where can he possibly be rick wished he had an empathetic magic link with harry so he could sense the direction he d taken he d have to take a gamble and choose a likely direction if this was some hostile abduction attempt then they would try to take harry beyond the ward line but how could anyone have gotten over the ward line in the first place rick wondered as he flew quickly out over the forbidden forest what that down there he asked himself as he spotted something moving low over the tree tops rick dived towards it gaining speed as he drew closer he recognised harry on his firebolt it had been hard to spot him because he was flying so close to the trees but what on earth does he think he up to rick wondered flying straight towards harry rick finally caught up with harry and came down on the end of his broom handle harry face was filled with fear something pulling me rick it not just the broom it me as well i ve got no control at all one minute i was diving after you the next i was being pulled out over the forbidden forest skimming the tree tops i feel like i being pulled by some bloody gigantic magnet what can we do asked harry sounding worried and frightened rick wondered if he should try transforming into a dragon would he be able to stop harry movement if he grabbed him with his claws would he harm him if he tried rick thoughts were interrupted by harry yelling at him look rick in front of us what that ahead of them was a foreboding black cloud and they were heading straight into its menacing centre get off the broom rick quick yelled harry desperately that cloud means death i sure of it i dontwant you to die with me please rick let go of my broom you donthave to die with me there was no time to transform but rick was determined not to abandon harry to whatever fate lay before him he gripped harry broom tighter as they plunged into the depths of the black cloud everything went black for a brief moment and then they were out of it still flying above the tree tops why didntyou let go like i told you demanded harry he looked about warily taking in the surroundings they were still flying over the forest but it looked different somehow greener and the air seemed warmer i dontknow what that cloud was all about but i still cantcontrol myself or my broom he said hey what happening i turning around we re heading back towards hogwarts what the hell is going on rick was feeling very apprehensive he clung tightly to harry broom he wasntgoing to risk separation again he too had noticed that the forest seemed greener and the air warmer but he couldnt understand why as they continued hurtling above the tree tops rick was relieved to see the castle on the horizon but as they drew closer he noticed that it didntlook quite right something was different he wondered whether it was just his falcon eyes perceiving things differently from his human eyes harry didnt appear to have noticed the castle yet of course even his keen seeker eyes were no match for a falcon rick realised harry finally spotted the castle hey rick i can see the lake and hogwarts we re nearly there but then he too noticed that the castle looked different but what was it as they drew nearer he realised rick look at the castle it all in ruins it looks like it been destroyed he cried despairingly what could have happened we ve only been gone twenty minutes how could it have been destroyed in that time the falcon just shook its head from side to side obviously rick had no idea either rick asked harry do you think maybe that black cloud back there put the squibbus curse on us no not that what i mean said harry uncertainly is that maybe it turned us into muggles squibs like filch can see the castle but muggles can t to them it just looks like a ruin exactly the way it looks to me right now rick does it look like a ruin to you too the falcon gave a distinct nod then that probably means you ve turned into a real peregrine falcon and you ll never be able to change back voldemort has eliminated both of us what other explanation can there be asked harry feeling utterly dejected hey we re starting to go down we seem to be heading for the other side of the lake the whole place looks deserted at first harry couldntsee any sign of life but as they came closer to the ground harry noticed a solitary figure by the lake tall thin and dressed in a black robe voldemort they came down no more than ten feet away from the evil black hooded wizard who was standing with arms crossed as he struggled to stay on his feet harry looked into that terrible snakelike face a face he had hoped never to see again a violent chill passed through his body but strangely his scar caused him no pain at all the scarlet slit pupilled eyes were glaring hatefully from that gaunt white skeletal face but they werentglaring at him dumbledore sneered the black robed magician contemptuously so you re an animagus who would have thought you would be a falcon animagus a dodo would be more appropriate for a senile old fool like you said voldemort derisively in a high cold voice harry tried to conceal his surprise at what appeared to be albus dumbledore standing beside him he knew it was rick obviously he was attempting to disguise himself and it was a very convincing disguise had he not been so overwhelmed with fear and hatred harry might have marvelled at rick outstanding metamorphmagus abilities of which he had been completely unaware until then you werentinvited to this party dumbledore it was intended only for harry potter however i very happy to have you here you can die together with potter how fitting but first i ll give you the opportunity to admire my handiwork said voldemort with a wicked laugh as he gestured towards the ruins of what was once hogwarts castle avada kedavra yelled harry pointing his wand at voldemort chest a green flash shot from harry wand towards voldemort he didntattempt to evade it he just stood there with his arms still crossed grinning smugly as the green light hit his chest and dissipated harry was stunned he had never used the killing curse before but he was certain he could cast it successfully against voldemort his parents murderer whom he hated passionately stupefy he yelled at voldemort but the spell seemed to have no effect upon him at all ha ha gloated voldemort you are powerless before me potter you too dumbledore i may even let you in on the secret of my immortality before i kill you both but first dumbledore take a good look at your beloved hogwarts and see how i have triumphed over you your pitiful life work was all for naught i have obliterated it completely voldemort hideously thin lips curled into a horrid malevolent grin ah you look confused you are wondering how and when this happened perhaps it happened over three years ago welcome to the year 2000 what asked harry confused how can that be the black cloud said voldemort smugly it temporal magic which i have only recently perfected it a time portal i cast it back to early 1997 i ve been waiting for you to get close enough to it for me to draw you through it was a one way portal by the way and i removed it as soon as you had passed through it there is absolutely no way for you to return to your own time you re stuck here although it wontbe for long he added maliciously why would you want to bring harry into the future asked dumbledore you died when i destroyed hogwarts dumbledore along with all of your professors and students my death eaters had already pulled their children from the school they knew what was coming potter however managed to elude me yet again i suppose you had an emergency portkey or something like that to spirit him away but everyone else died that day including the great hope of the light my other great nemesis rick godfry i didntknow about godfry until that day that when i realised it was him who had turned so many of my once valuable death eaters into worthless detestable squibs i knew the ghost of godric gryffindor was just a cover but i didntknow whose i suspected it was you dumbledore until godfry revealed himself that day and i discovered what he was of course i didntsend any death eaters to attack hogwarts i knew what would happen to them i had already lost too many supporters to godfry blasted squibbus curse no i attacked hogwarts with dark creatures and beasts i opened up a spatial portal that completely by passed your wards he said with a conceited grin i sent through my dark hordes to attack you i made the mistake of sending my dementors in last by the time they arrived that accursed godfry had transformed most of my dark creatures and beasts into harmless pets i was watching from the other side of the portal i was furious but although he was invisible pretending to be that blasted ghost my dementors could sense him godfry managed to hold them off for quite some time with his blasted patronuses but he couldntdestroy them nor could he transform them eventually they got close enough to affect him that when godfry revealed himself then it was all over my dementors had a wonderful feast that day all those souls including yours dumbledore and godfry s he added chuckling evilly after that all resistance crumbled i have been in complete control of the magical world since that day i killed all those who had been foolish enough to oppose me all the squibs and mudbloods were exterminated like the vermin they are the half castes were all enslaved and placed under the imperius curse they ve been sterilized too so they ll soon die out but first i ll use them in my final battle the destruction of the muggle world you are mad tom said dumbledore how dare you exploded voldemort crucio he screamed pointing his wand at dumbledore the curse hit dumbledore reflecting shield voldemort reflexes were excellent he saw his curse returning and quickly threw up a shield to protect himself from it damn you dumbledore i knew godfry had taught potter to cast that blasted reflecting shield of his it seems that you too have mastered it spat voldemort angrily your protection doesntappear to work against your own curses observed dumbledore serenely no it does not snarled voldemort how do you think i almost died that night when i tried to kill blasted potter here when he was a baby his mother somehow put some protection on him that sent my killing curse back at me to this day i have not been able to discover what it was or how she did it i was already protected by the cloak of salazar slytherin on that fateful night i d had the cloak since my fifth year at hogwarts i found it in the chamber of secrets where salazar slytherin had left it for his heir me but it took me many years to find the spells that would allow me to wear it it was only weeks before i killed potter parents that i finally succeeded didnt you notice dumbledore when we duelled at the ministry of magic that you couldnttouch me your spells all just dissolved i immortal or at least i will be when i finally kill harry potter i determined to kill him and lay that blasted prophecy to rest before i embark on my greatest battle the conquest and destruction of the muggles i haventheard anything at all from that damned potter since the day i destroyed hogwarts my death eaters have been searching for him everywhere but he continues to elude me said voldemort angrily he been a constant thorn in my side the final threat to my immortality i must destroy him it was because i ve been unable find him in the present time that i decided to abduct him from a time when i could locate him before the destruction of hogwarts when he disappeared once i ve killed this potter here from 1997 the one in the present time will simply cease to exist my immortality will be guaranteed you are playing with fire tom warned dumbledore sternly no one knows the consequences of changing the past you may end up killing yourself you may simply cease to exist the whole world might cease to exist dontyou realise how immensely dangerous it is to try changing the past dont lecture me like you re still my professor you doddery old fool i not interested in all your goody goody rules and holier than thou morality snarled voldemort in your time you are about to die in a few weeks anyway potter has done nothing since he disappeared but plague my mind removing you two from your time and killing you now will have no effect at all you cannot know that tom responded dumbledore shaking his head time is very complicated and subtle just one word one gesture can change the whole of history you have no idea what you are doing shut up screamed voldemort i am the lord of this world everyone fears and obeys me you are no one here you are already dead you do not seem to be having much success with killing us tom said dumbledore defiantly you two canthold those shields for much longer it must require huge amounts of energy once you weaken and drop them i ll dispose of you both it quite a bonus for me dumbledore getting to kill you twice laughed voldemort callously i ve waited a long time to finally finish off potter i can wait a little longer voldemort made an elaborate movement with his wand uttering a long incantation within a minute he was surrounded by hundreds of death eaters who had immediately responded to his summons by apparating to him at hogwarts death eaters commanded voldemort encircle these two and keep up a constant barrage of curses and hexes dontuse anything too nasty they are protected by reflecting shields so your curses and hexes will rebound upon you try to maintain a defecting shield if you are able to keep cursing them until they can no longer hold their shields then it will be my pleasure to torture them before finally finishing them off as the death eaters raised their wands to begin dumbledore yelled out squibbus what are you playing at dumbledore barked voldemort only that blasted godfry was able perform that spell i know all about your precious godfry i have recently developed great necromancy powers that allow me to communicate with the spirits of dark wizards they told me how those busy bodies those interfering spirits of the witches and wizards of the light gave godfry all sorts of powers to defeat me but it didntwork as you can see he said gesturing towards the ruins of hogwarts they didntgive him the power to destroy dementors but of course they couldn t because there is no power that can destroy dementors however if you keep them well fed dementors are the most obedient of servants and i keep my dementors very well fed you may be sure death eaters yelled voldemort casting a withering gaze upon his servants i ordered you to curse them why arentyou doing it because they are all squibs said dumbledore smiling happily voldemort observed his death eaters futile attempts at cursing dumbledore and harry and realised it was true he was absolutely furious the death eaters suddenly realising they were squibs and knowing the fate of their kind turned and ran for their lives but they neednt have worried voldemort attention was otherwise engaged you re not dumbledore at all spat voldemort as the realisation sank in you re that accursed godfry rick responded by morphing to his true form pleased to meet you too said rick then grinning at voldemort he continued i think you may have overlooked something voldy you re so smug and conceited and sure of yourself so certain of your own infallibility arrogant fools like you who think they can make no mistakes usually do in fact they usually make very stupid mistakes like you just did what are you talking about you impertinent brat snarled voldemort furious at rick insolence well you seem awfully worried about harry potter you know that he out there somewhere ready to fulfil his destiny as foretold in the prophecy by killing you just one mortal enemy has you totally rattled you re so obsessed with your precious immortality that your mind will torment you you will never have a moment peace while a mortal enemy stalks you cant you see what a stupid fool you ve been voldy taunted rick mockingly you only had one mortal enemy one harry potter to fear but you ve just brought a second harry potter into your world along with me rick godfry whose mission as you know is to destroy you you thought you d disposed of me three years ago but now you ve brought me back to life you used to have only one powerful mortal enemy to fear in your world now you have three of us harry pick up your broom and give me your hand we re going to apparate away from here what but you can t screamed voldemort more in fear than rage oh but we can and there nothing you can do to stop us although you re more than welcome to try a killing curse stay on your toes voldy keep looking over your shoulder because there are three of us out there now if you have really found out all about me then you ll know that my powers are greater even than yours rest assured we ll find a way of overcoming your protective cloak and when we do we ll come after you sooner or later we ll get you rick grasped harry hand in the moment just before they vanished rick looked up high up in the sky circling overhead was a golden eagle rick smiled to himself please take a few moments to leave a review chapter 2 attempted murder on the hogwarts express rick apparated invisibly to diagon alley as instructed by professor dumbledore he ducked into a narrow alleyway and after checking that it was empty focused his mind on making himself visible he enjoyed his afternoon it was to say the least magical he decided to keep a low profile the intention to pass unnoticed seemed to have created a disillusionment charm because no one paid him any attention after that unless he addressed them directly rick thought of it as his wizard repelling charm because it seemed to work much the same way as a muggle repelling charm except on witches and wizards instead of muggles he went to madam malkin for his clothes they even had silk boxers with flying magical creatures zooming around but luckily you couldntfeel them when you had them on that might have been a bit ticklish he found that the cauldron shop opposite the apothecary sold trunks and boxes of all sizes and shapes not just cases for cauldrons he bought a large trunk to store all his new acquisitions he threw in the bags from madam malkin along with the cauldron he had just purchased the witch at the cauldron shop was very obliging noticing his long list of purchases she invited him to leave his trunk with her while he got the rest of his things thanks said rick politely wondering why she was blushing and being so friendly next he went to flourish and blotts for his books which he carried back and placed in his trunk then it was on to slug jiggers apothecary for his potions supplies and the stationary shop for ink quills and parchment when he had everything on the list he decided to drop his trunk off at the leaky cauldron thanking the obliging witch at the cauldron shop rick dragged his heavy trunk out into diagon alley he knew that as an underage wizard he wasntallowed to do magic so he couldntlevitate it luckily the leaky cauldron was very close by tom the innkeeper had a room reserved for him just as dumbledore had promised and showed him up risk decided to change into some of his new wizarding clothes although he had not been the only one dressed in muggle clothes in diagon alley he had felt conspicuous and had kept his eyes down despite the disillusionment charm he had cast upon himself now all dressed up as a wizard he removed the disillusionment charm and smiled at himself in the mirror it suddenly started speaking to him in a husky female voice oh my oh my what a handsome wizard gilderoy lockhart eat your heart out no more witch weekly most charming smile awards for you gildy dear if you smile like that my young prince charming you are going to have every witch in diagon alley falling at your feet rick stepped back in surprise it was rather nice being coo ed over even if it was only a talking mirror although he wasntsure that he liked being compared to gilderoy lockhart the thought of witches being attracted to him was quite appealing to a teenage boy well maybe not all witches but certainly one particular witch rick sighed he began to wonder if casanova had been a wizard and was maybe amongst the ones who had bestowed their gifts upon him there must be some explanation for this he thought then he remembered reading about helga hufflepuff in hogwarts a history and how she was so charming that everyone loved her maybe if i try not to smile he thought assuming a more serious expression and looking in the mirror again do you still find me so charming he asked well you are still a most handsome wizard but if you hold back the charm like that you might have a quieter life rick spent the next ten minutes standing in front of the bemused mirror using its reactions to learn how to control his gift of charm as much as it might be fun to have witches falling at his feet it would hinder his mission he was just going to have to be careful to resist the temptation there might be times when he could use his charm in the line of duty but other than that he was going to have to keep it under tight control rick stepped back into diagon alley and made his way to florean fortescue ice cream parlour and sat down in a quiet corner he was dying to try one of florean fabled sundaes he ordered a chocolate and raspberry with chopped nut sundae which definitely lived up to expectations after that he decided to head back to flourish and blotts for a little speed reading as the headmaster had suggested it didnttake him long to work his way through all the hogwarts curriculum books starting at first year on the bottom shelf he quickly made his way up to year seven on the top shelf he found that all he had to do was concentrate and run a finger along the spine of each book on the shelf after that he decided to do the defence against the dark arts section which was quite large could be useful he thought to himself and it was definitely more interesting than the standard book of spells grades 1 to 7 by miranda goshawk it was so interesting in fact that he forgot to look around to check that no one was watching his peculiar behaviour someone was watching and becoming more curious by the minute but it wasnt until rick had almost tripped over the unseen witch that she yelled out excuse me would you please pay attention to where you are going you almost stepped on me rick quickly pulled back his hand from the books turned and on seeing the witch who had startled him blurted out in surprise hermione before catching himself and blushing fiercely who are you demanded the witch with hands on hips and how do you know my name i ve never seen you before in my life umm know your name said rick recovering his poise quickly why do you say that i have no idea who you are because said the witch you just said it hermione now stop playing games and tell me how you knew my name hermione no i didntknow that was your name no i just said err oh my oh me and why would you utter such silly gibberish asked hermione raising her eyebrows in an attitude of deep scepticism umm err because you are a most beautiful witch replied rick smiling sweetly attempting to charm his way out of the mess he d gotten himself into rick was pleased with the result hermione expression was no longer aggressive and confrontational she looked a little embarrassed but was clearly flattered by rick comment or more likely his magical charm allow me to introduce myself my name is rick godfry i ll be starting as a sixth year student at hogwarts tomorrow he said trying with great difficulty to tone down the charm pleased to meet you i sure i hermione granger and i am a sixth year gryffindor prefect rick was having real trouble holding back the charm now he knew that it wasntright to use his gifts like this he should only use them to fight for the light but standing before him was the witch he had dreamt about so often he could not stop staring at her and she too seemed unable to break their eye contact luckily or perhaps unluckily a large redhead came upon them like that their eyes locked upon each other who the hell are you he said pushing himself between them and towering over rick in a threatening stance ron said hermione awkwardly she seemed to have recovered from her encounter with rick now that the contact was broken she carried on more assertively you and harry were supposed to meet me here forty five minutes ago have you two been in quality quidditch supplies for the last hour and a half ron turned around to face hermione trying to look innocent are you sure it been that long well i never heard you complain about having to wait in a book shop before he smiled winningly humph said hermione as they walked away from rick forgetting about him completely where harry we better find him and get back to the burrow your mother will have dinner ready and be wondering where we are by now the wizard repelling charm that rick had cast upon them had worked a treat they walked away without so much as a backward glance at him he thought back to what had happened when he had first seen hermione and how his attraction to her had resulted in the unintentional charm which he had found so hard to break that must be what godric gryffindor had meant when he said to professor dumbledore that the temptation to abuse such great power will be strong he was really going to need constant vigilance as moody would say to stop himself from doing things like that the following morning rick apparated to platform nine and three quarters at king cross station he got there early so he was immediately able to become visible he knew that it was important to make the right impression on his fellow students and teachers if his mission was going to be a success he has already decided that he needed to be in gryffindor so that he could stay close to harry and hermione no that would just be an incidental bonus he tried to convince himself now all i have to do is persuade the hogwart sorting hat from his booklist it looked like professor dumbledore had given him the same subjects as harry the real difficulty was going to be to win harry trust without revealing who he was and why he had come and then there were his feelings for hermione which were just going to make it much more complicated rick boarded the hogwarts express which was almost empty as it was not due to leave for another forty minutes he found an empty compartment and put his trunk up into the overhead rack then he sat by the window staring out at the platform as it slowly filled up with students and their families it was fun trying to put names to all the faces the weasleys were impossible to miss harry and hermione were with them apart from ron and ginny fred and george who had departed hogwarts in style the year before were also there for the occasion but fred and george were looking around alertly and not joking about as he would have expected maybe they have joined the order of the phoenix thought rick looking around he noticed a woman who just had to be nymphadora tonks the purple hair was a dead giveaway the order was clearly out in force which meant that they were worried about a death eater attack perhaps an attempt to kill harry before he reached the safety of hogwarts rick thoughts were interrupted when the door to his compartment opened two slytherin witches entered well hello i pansy parkinson said the blonde witch batting her eyelids coquettishly at rick and who may i ask are you rick godfry i new at hogwarts i ll be in sixth year mmmm purred pansy charmed to meet you i sure i do hope that the sorting hat puts you in slytherin we could do with some handsome wizards not that draco isnthandsome of course but then there are those great lumps crabbe and goyle well you wonthave to worry about that pair this year i hear that they failed their owls so abysmally that they wonteven be back said the big boned dark haired witch pushing her trunk up onto the rack and sitting down i millicent bulstrode she said to rick with a coy smile that didntbecome her but i ve have heard nothing about any new wizards in sixth year my aunt is on the hogwarts board you know and she tells me everything well it was all arranged at the last moment said rick noticing that the train had started moving so i guess the news hasntgot around yet where are you from asked pansy are your people purebloods you wontget into slytherin if they re not you know rick was saved from having to answer her the door opened to reveal draco malfoy with blaise zabini standing behind him who are you and what are you doing in our compartment draco demanded arrogantly of rick swinging an immaculately polished mahogany trunk onto the rack and plopping himself down on a seat as if he owned the compartment if not the whole train blaise took the seat beside him pleased to meet you too said rick trying to maintain a friendly tone wondering if his charm worked on wizards as well but i was actually the first one in this compartment and i didntnotice any reserved signs oh draco dear gushed pansy it so nice to see you again but please dontstart a fight with rick he seems like such a dear anyway we have to go up to the front in a few minutes for the prefects meeting i know drawled draco but before we go i have something to tell you three just you three he said looking pointedly at rick as their eyes met rick probed draco mind for what he was going to say in about ten minutes the train will be stopped by servants of the dark lord we have to get potter off the train so they can kill him apparently dumbledore has placed some protection on the train which may stop the dark lord servants from getting on to do the job stupid hero potter will probably be the first one off anyway but if he not we re to throw off some little firsties for them to attack which will be sure to draw potter out draco hadntnoticed rick probe rick just shrugged and was about to get up to leave when the door slid open once more this time to reveal ron weasley and hermione granger their glance rested on rick for a moment before turning to draco and pansy we are all waiting for you two to grace us with your presence at the prefects meeting said hermione in an annoyed tone although i dontthink those who were part of umbridge little inquisitorial squad deserve to keep their prefect badges well no one cares what you think granger things are going to be different this year my father is on the best of terms with the minister of magic did you know that he has a great deal of influence the days of mudblood filth at hogwarts will soon be over you mark my words now why dontyou and your pet weasel just run along ron tried to push past hermione with the obvious intention of pouncing on draco but hermione grabbed his arm trying to drag him out but without success here let me help said rick jumping up and pushing ron back till they were all out of the carriage get off of me you slytherin git ron bellowed at rick his face red with fury after i ve finished off that slimy little ferret you ll be next but before he could force his way back in to the compartment the door was shut and locked behind them hermione turned on ron ronald weasley how can you be so stupid cant you see that malfoy is just trying to provoke you if his father has so much influence what do you think will happen if you beat up his precious little draco you ll lose you prefect badge for starters and probably get expelled as well you are just going to have to learn to control your temper and ignore his taunts now let get to that prefects meeting if those slytherins dont want to come that fine we ll start without them ron glared one last time at rick before following hermione towards the front of the train right thought rick i better find harry fast he shut his eyes for a moment and tried to conjure up an image of the train amazing he thought to himself it was just like a marauders map of the train right in his head he noticed kingsley shacklebolt from the order in the guards van and harry potter alone in a compartment two carriages back he quickly made his way to harry compartment which he d been sharing with ron and hermione he took a deep breath and slid the door open harry looked up with a guarded expression on his face as rick entered he knew all too well that his life was in danger and his suspicion was immediately raised by this unknown wizard entering his compartment he whipped out his wand and pointed it at rick chest ok just stop right there he demanded and tell me who you are and what you re doing in this compartment rick tried to smile reassuringly at harry he raised his hands in the air like in a cowboy movie ok sheriff please dontshoot i ll go peaceably he joked pleased to see the hint of a smile on harry face would you mind if i sat down for the interrogation ok said harry but dontmake any sudden moves or go for your wand i not joking rick smiled and sat down carefully my name is rick godfry and i new to hogwarts this year i ll be in sixth year so who are you apart from the fasted wand in the west harry did a double take he couldntremember anyone in the wizarding world ever asking him that question everyone seemed to know who he was if not his whole life history harry potter he said the wizard showed not the slightest reaction or recognition of his name maybe he d just arrived from mars though harry unless of course it was all some kind of act where are you from asked harry new zealand there arentany schools for young witches and wizards over there which is why i going to hogwarts i guess there cantbe a lot of witches and wizards in new zealand if there are no schools observed harry well to tell you the truth i dontreally know i only found out that i was a wizard a couple of years ago are your parents muggles well actually i dontknow i an orphan and i dontknow anything at all about my real parents they might have been magical but i just dontknow the people who raised me were muggles but they had a friend who was a wizard although they didntknow that until he discovered that i was magical too and told us all about how witches and wizards are real and not just make believe he a very powerful wizard he works with the magical creatures that live up in the mountains he taught me all the magic i know suddenly the train began rapidly slowing harry looked nervously out the window trying to see what was out there when he turned back rick had gone harry saw the compartment door sliding shut behind him but rick did more than just shut the door he focussed his mind on locking it and making it an impenetrable barrier until he lifted the lock he then made himself invisible and cast a sonorus charm on himself and began making an announcement in the voice of professor dumbledore this is professor dumbledore this train is under attack from death eaters i have placed a protection spell upon the train which will prevent them from boarding it or casting spells through the sides everyone without exception is to stay in their compartment and lock the door under no circumstances should anyone leave the train would a guard please apparate immediately for reinforcements everyone is to stay calm rick made himself invisible and then apparated to the corridor outside his original compartment pansy and millicent were sitting there alone shutting his eyes and conjuring up a map of the train once more rick spotted draco malfoy and blaise zabini near the front of the train with someone named matilda martyn he apparated to them immediately and found the two slytherins dragging a terrified little first year girl with brown plaits along the corridor towards the carriage door rick pointed his wand towards them focusing his mind on draco and blaise he said stupefy the pair fell unconscious to the floor allowing their small captive to escape the little girl ran back to her compartment only to find the door locked from the inside rick flicked his wand at the door saying alohomora the little girl ran inside shutting and locking the door behind her rick did a quick scan of the train no one else was out in the corridors right time to deal with the death eaters he thought steeling himself for his first battle still invisible he apparated outside it was bright and sunny and he had no trouble spotting the death eaters there were about twenty of them all bunched together flinging curses in the same direction harry compartment thought rick i hope dumbledore protection is strong enough to block twenty combined avada kedavra curses rick waved his wand at the death eaters and boomed expelliarmus he was using a hoarse ghostly accent for his spells he didnt want anyone to recognise his voice the astonished death eaters flew through the air and landed in an unconscious heap their wands flew up into the air and then descended in a graceful arc towards rick oops he though dontwant to give myself away just before they reached him he waved his wand at them saying incendio and they burst into flames rick then flicked his wand back over the pile of death eaters saying incarcerous each death eater was now bound from head to toe in thick ropes without their wands they would be unable to apparate away even if they regained consciousness before reinforcements arrived from the order to deal with them rick apparated back to the corridor outside harry compartment to find ron and hermione flinging every curse and charm they knew at the door in a frantic attempt to get it open while they were absorbed rick made himself visible and simply walked up to the door and after focusing his mind on removing the locking charm he had placed upon it turned the handle and slid the door open while ron and hermione were recovering from their surprise he entered the compartment greatly relieved to find harry very much alive where did you disappear to demanded harry suspiciously but before rick could reply ron grabbed hold of rick and shoved him down on a seat and pointed his wand at his chest just what did you do to that door you slytherin creep rick feigned innocence i dontknow what you re talking about i just turned the handle and it opened maybe one of you two unlocked it with your spells wait a minute said harry did you say he unlocked the door because he was in here with me when the death eaters attacked and the next moment he was gone and the door was locked i tried alohomora evanesco incendio and even a couple of blasting curses but nothing would move it what kind of spell did you use to lock me in here he demanded of rick look i dontknow what you are talking about i didntlock or unlock anything lied rick but secretly he was very glad he did draco malfoy was right harry would have been the first one off the train he would have walked right into the death eaters trap ron turned on him again as the train moved forward once more so what were you doing out and about while the death eaters were attacking then helping them perhaps i heard a little first year girl was dragged out of her compartment by a couple of slytherins who said they were going to throw her to the death eaters luckily she got away from them maybe that was you and your mate malfoy rick didntknow what to say he couldnttell them the truth but if he said nothing he would remain suspect look i new here i ve never met a single person who is on this train before today i wasnthelping any death eaters or draco malfoy he no friend of mine it just happened that him and his friends decided to sit in the same compartment as me rubbish said ron i know a slimy slytherin git when i see one rick was starting to get annoyed he stood up ron towered over him aggressively but rick calmly stood his ground and said why dontwe let the sorting hat decide if i a slytherin or not with that he left the compartment sliding the door shut behind him ron quickly checked that they hadntbeen locked in again before sitting down and looking at harry so what did that git have to say for himself when he was in here before harry repeated what rick had told him well i dontbelieve a word of it said ron if you ask me he working for you know who probably together with malfoy we better keep an eye on him yeah i donttrust him either said harry but then i guess i donttrust anyone very much any more he added despondently there were about twenty death eaters just outside this window all pointing their wands at me screaming death curses whatever protection dumbledore put on this train completely blocked them then suddenly the death eaters just flew up in the air as if they d all been hit by a collective expelliarmus spell it was weird their wands all flew up in the air and were converging on the same spot when they just burst into flames when i looked back to the death eaters they were all tied up i wonder who was out there maybe it was a whole bunch of operatives from the order under invisibility cloaks suggested ron dumbledore instructed the guard to go for reinforcements remember it was obviously dumbledore himself said hermione he made the announcement so he must be on the train or at least he was he probably the only wizard powerful enough to take on twenty death eaters and dispose of them all like that yeah i guess you re right it must have been him i guess he was expecting trouble oh well it looks like i ve survived voldemort first attempt on my life for this year i wonder how many tries it will take till he finally succeeds oh please harry dontbe so defeatist it wonthelp said hermione with deep concern yeah come on mate cheer up said ron anyone would feel down after spending the summer holidays with those miserable muggles who call themselves your relatives i just cantunderstand why dumbledore insisted on you staying there the whole holidays and only letting you come to the burrow the last night my mum is really angry with him about it i dontunderstand either said harry but i wouldnthave wanted to spend the holidays at the burrow and endanger all of your family i wouldnthave come even if dumbledore had allowed it if voldemort going to blow up the place where i living and kill everyone i cantthink of anywhere i d rather be than with the dursleys he said grimacing ironically oh harry dontbe so negative and despairing said hermione we re going back to hogwarts where you will be safe under dumbledore protection for how much longer two more years and what then sooner or later i going to have to face voldemort it not dumbledore that has to kill him it me what on earth are you talking about asked hermione what gives you that idea the prophecy replied harry the one that voldemort was after in the department of mysteries i dontunderstand said hermione the prophecy was lost when the ball smashed no one knows what it said ah but they do said harry and he proceeded to tell them everything he had heard in the headmaster office at the end of their fifth year including the prophecy which he repeated word for word ron and hermione sat shocked this was all new to them even though they knew that voldemort wanted to kill harry so in the end it just me and voldemort i going to have to stand up to him alone what really worries me is that i have no idea how to defeat him no harry said hermione with iron in her voice it may be you he after but you wontbe alone ron and i will be there with you you know that dontyou yeah mate affirmed ron we ll be with you no matter what you know you can count on us but i dont want to count on you i dont want the pair of you with me cantyou understand that i dontwant to see you die i ve seen enough people die because of me cedric sirius it enough dontyou understand the prophecy is about me and voldemort nobody else it my destiny and i going to have to face it alone no one else is going to die with me with that he shut his eyes and drew himself inwards trying to cut himself off from his friends and from a world which he found increasingly hostile and threatening hermione sighed trying to force her mind away from harry and his negativity how did that new wizard know about the sorting hat if he doesnt know anything about the wizarding world asked hermione after a few minutes thought harry wasntlistening but ron was all too eager to respond i dont believe a word that slimy git said of course he lying through his teeth but dontworry he wontfool the sorting hat it will see right through him and put him where he belongs in slytherin hermione didntanswer she was looking for an explanation because for some reason she could not understand she wanted to believe rick even though there were some unanswered questions about doors getting locked and unlocked someone he spoke with on the train could have told him about the sorting hat he might even have read about it in a book what like hogwarts a history scoffed ron get off of it hermione no one reads that book except for you a picture flashed through ron mind of rick and hermione as he had found them the previous day with eyes locked together at flourish and blotts she sure never looks at me that way he thought jealously harry was now asleep snoring gently hermione said ron softly in a more conciliatory tone have you though any more about what i asked you at the burrow hermione blushed and looked quickly in harry direction to make sure that he was really asleep she took out her wand and cast an imperturbable charm over their side of the compartment so that harry couldnthear them ron i have thought about it about you and me umm you know becoming closer like girlfriend and boyfriend and i really dontthink it a good idea i sorry ron i really love you as a friend just like i love harry but i just think the friendship between the three of us is too important to risk what are you saying hermione spell it out which is it you dontwant to be my girlfriend because you dontfeel that way about me or you re worried that it would leave harry out in the cold hermione pursed her lips trying the find the right words i sorry ron but i think it a bit of both really i dontthink i feel that way about you and i think that if we became a couple it would inevitably leave harry all alone and i so worried about him right now cantyou see that he needs us more now than ever well he doesntact like it sometimes and you dontseem so sure that you dontfeel that way about me maybe if we started getting well you know closer kissing and stuff said ron awkwardly you might discover that you do feel that way about me so why cantwe give it try no ron it just wouldntwork out you and harry are like brothers to me i dontwant to spoil that it too precious now please let just leave it and not talk about it any more but hermione that doesntmake sense if you have such strong feelings for me and harry then surely one of us should be your boyfriend not someone you hardly know like that git krum or someone else we both know that harry is not going to have any girlfriends any time soon he would be too scared that they would become targets of you know who or that they could be used to get at him so harry out that just leaves you and me what makes you think i want a boyfriend asked hermione raising her eyebrows in disdain i not lavender brown or parvati patil or one of those silly witches who can think and talk about nothing but wizards from morning to night i have two more years of serious studies ahead of me plus there harry and the battle against the dark side to worry about i just donthave time for a boyfriend and i dontfeel ready for one right now either well i ready i mean for a girlfriend that is fred and george had lots of girlfriends when they were at hogwarts in fact i think they may have shared them sometimes without letting the witches know perks of being a twin why even my little sister ginny is onto her second boyfriend first it was michael corner and now it dean thomas not that i happy about it look ron if you think you need a girlfriend i sure there are plenty of witches at hogwarts who would be delighted to oblige you but i not one of them so will you please just drop it with that she flicked her wand muttering finite incantatum to remove the imperturbable charm and make it clear to ron that the conversation was over they sat in uncomfortable silence for the remainder of the journey if you like this fic please review chapter 20 talking time gripping his broom tightly in his right hand and rick hand with his left harry felt as though his body had dissolved there was absolute silence there was nothing to see harry senses all strained but there was nothing for them to touch the world had vanished leaving him or his awareness at least behind it was a bizarre experience but oddly pleasant and comforting then suddenly the world materialised once more around him he found himself standing with rick by the lake with the hogwarts castle in front of him but this time it wasntdestroyed in fact it looked just the same as always rick what happened what did you do where are we asked harry feeling very confused exactly where we were a moment ago said rick smiling the question is when are we if i got it right this is the same saturday morning that we were out flying together when voldemort pulled us into the future we ve returned to when we came from i just wanted voldemort to think we were apparating away to put the wind up him did you catch that look of fear and loathing on his face as we were leaving oh and did you notice that golden eagle circling high above us err no said harry a golden eagle you dontthink that it was me i almost certain it was replied rick you must have mastered the animagus transformation before voldemort attacked hogwarts that how you escaped him after hogwarts fell you just flew away and that why he cantfind you in his time you re staying in your golden eagle form he hasntgot a hope in hell of finding you and it driving him slowly crazy rick is it true what voldemort said about you asked harry about the spirits of the witches and wizards of the light giving you all your powers and sending you here to defeat him yeah mate said rick something like that but in fact i discovered i cantkill anyone not even voldemort i here to help you but in the end it you not me who has to kill the evil sod just like the prophecy says murmured harry so you re the ghost of godric gryffindor you saved me from being dragged off to voldemort that night by lucius malfoy when you squibbed him gosh rick i owe you you ve saved me so many times just doing my job mate said rick smiling but rick what happened that day the death eaters attacked us at hogsmeade station asked harry hermione said that you d gone to get the ghost of godric gryffindor but you are the ghost so where were you really when i was fighting off all those death eaters rick sighed looking down at his feet err harry i really sorry about that but well you see i stayed behind on the train with err with hermione we were sort of err snogging asked harry rick nodded still looking at his feet boy that must have been some snog if you didntnotice a massive death eater attack yeah i seem to get rather absorbed said rick in embarrassment i really sorry about it mate i felt terrible when i realised there was an attack you have no idea how relieved i was to find you alive forget it said harry sighing it seems pretty unimportant when you think of the future we ve just seen even with all the powers you received you wontbe able to stop the dementors when voldemort attacks hogwarts it looks like all our efforts will be for nothing in the end voldemort is going to destroy hogwarts and soon i just cantget those images of the castle all in ruins out of my mind hogwarts this castle symbolises everything that is good and wonderful and magical in my life to see it in ruins like that to think of everyone kissed by the dementors and me escaping i wouldntwant to keep living with that on my mind but harry couldntcontinue it was too upsetting to think about harry we need to go talk with dumbledore right away said rick as they started for the castle maybe it doesntmean what we think it does maybe it not inevitable i not giving up yet that for sure hey there hermione it looks like she been searching for us harry rick where did you two get to i ve been looking for you since breakfast exclaimed hermione sounding concerned as she approached the two boys looks like i got us back to the right day at least quipped rick conspiratorially to harry what are you talking about rick demanded hermione her worry changing to annoyance she hated it when she didntunderstand something especially when it was rick behaving mysteriously harry ginny said she saw you flying by yourself along the edge of the forbidden forest about an hour ago but when i looked out there a few minutes later you were nowhere to be seen where on earth have you two been implored hermione we ve been right here by the hogwarts lake well for the past half hour at least said rick with one of his infuriating grins that a lie rick how can you lie to me like that she said angrily i ve been out here for almost an hour i must have passed this spot at least twice in the past half hour and neither of you were here unless you were under invisibility cloaks or something honest hermione we were by the lake and we werentinvisible said rick but when i say we were here i speaking spatially not temporally rick stop that teasing you know it drives me crazy cried hermione in exasperation i want to know what happened to you two right now then maybe you d better come with us to the headmaster office we were on our way there to tell him all about it there no way i going to start the story until then or we ll never get there alright said hermione in resignation but hurry up at least professor dumbledore and hermione listened spellbound as harry and rick gave a full account of where and when they had been and of everything that had happened when they d finished the three students looked expectantly at their headmaster eager for his reaction they were seated in great puffy armchairs which he had summoned for them in front of his large desk dumbledore sat silently in his chair behind the desk lost in thought lemon drop anyone asked dumbledore finally offering around his favourite sweet with a relaxed smile on his face only rick took one harry and hermione were stunned that professor dumbledore could react with such a lack of concern at the prospect of hogwarts imminent destruction professor dumbledore said hermione in a worried voice no longer able to contain herself if harry and rick actually witnessed the school in ruins then surely it means it inevitable that it will happen and nothing can be done to prevent it doesntit on the contrary miss granger replied dumbledore smiling calmly there are many things that can be done to avert the catastrophe witnessed by your friends in fact but err excuse me sir for interrupting you said hermione unable to restrain herself you warned me most emphatically in third year about the dangers of attempting to change time so how can we prevent one tragedy without risking perhaps an even greater one you are quite correct miss granger said dumbledore leaning back comfortably in his seat and smiling benignly i most certainly did warn you of the grave dangers involved in attempting to influence the future by changing the past however if one is very thoughtful and careful it is possible i believe that you and mr potter can attest to that from your own experience he added with a smile his eyes twinkling if one goes back no more than an hour or two and acts with the utmost caution it is possible to obtain a very limited and contained change which will have no serious side effects in time but if one goes back any further than that there are far too many unknowns too many permutations in the chain of cause and effect resulting from one actions it becomes impossible to know how the smallest most insignificant action even something as trivial for example as returning a book to one shelf rather than another will change the future i must compliment you mr godfry on the admonishment you delivered to voldemort in my name said dumbledore smiling at rick i think your impersonation did me justice i would indeed have said very much the same thing to voldemort myself and it was a master stroke to make him think that you and harry were merely apparating away in his own time rather than returning to your own i imagine that his obsessive fears for his immortality must be quite unbearable it will probably delay indefinitely his planned campaign against the muggles yes that what i was hoping sir said rick but there was another reason for the pretence i didntwant voldemort to know that we were returning to our own time i was afraid if he knew he might make another attempt at snatching harry back to the future as soon as i realised we d been pulled through to the future i became aware that i could go back to my own time and take harry with me i just needed to twist my wand and decide the exact date and time but since we were safely behind the reflecting shield i figured we should stay a while and see what useful information we could pick up it was an excellent idea mr godfry said dumbledore if i not mistaken you have the ability to move through time as easily as you apparate through space i recently discovered a secret journal written by godric gryffindor it appears that he possessed the power of time travel although he kept it secret he could move backwards and forwards in time at will without requiring a time turner or any other magical aids except for his wand it appears that there is something special about his wand because he was unable to do it with any other wand no one but gryffindor was able do it even using his wand except it seems for you mr godfry said dumbledore smiling at rick what you mean you have godric gryffindor wand asked harry incredulously rick just nodded and then looked back towards the headmaster i must warn you dumbledore continued looking rick very seriously that for all your special abilities you are in no way immune from the considerable dangers involved in time travel many witches and wizards have experimented with time travel using time turners and various other magical means some have been foolish enough to try changing the past the result has always been disastrous tempusilo viator the most famous time traveller of all vanished unaccountably and mysteriously at a very early age it is assumed that he changed something in the past which negated his own existence beware mr godfry professor dumbledore said harry feeling confused how are we going to prevent voldemort from destroying hogwarts i mean you keep talking about the dangers of changing time so how can we do it without creating some other catastrophe but dontyou see the irony of it asked dumbledore cheerfully voldemort has already done it for us when he pulled you and mr godfry into the future he changed the past he broke all the rules and now he must suffer the consequences he has told us exactly how and roughly when hogwarts will be attacked he even told mr godfry how to deal with the dark creatures that he will send by transforming them into something harmless he has also warned us that the one thing that can defeat us is dementors so now we know where to focus our attention we can act on the information voldemort unintentionally provided the cardinal sin of time travel is going back and changing the past voldemort has committed that sin however acting in the present moment with the intention of determining future events is perfectly safe we do it all day long the future you witnessed continued dumbledore has not yet happened and indeed may never happen it is simply a possibility it is at this moment only one of an infinite number of possible futures what has happened in the past is fixed unless someone is foolish enough to meddle with it as voldemort has done but the future is not yet cast so you re saying we are free to do what we like to avert the destruction of hogwarts said hermione fascinated what harry and rick saw was the future that would have been if voldemort hadnt played with time and pulled them into the future by doing that he changed the past from where he is in the year 2000 if we manage to prevent the destruction of hogwarts he might suddenly find himself in a very different world one in which he is not the undisputed lord exactly miss granger replied dumbledore smiling then there is the matter of the cloak of salazar slytherin i am not entirely convinced that it is impregnable if we can find a way to penetrate it voldemort in the year 2000 might simply disappear altogether because he was killed before that year ever arrived do you mean it may have an achilles heel professor asked hermione what makes you think that voldemort has been acting very cautiously for someone who believes himself to be immune from the magic of others it is true that my spells did not seem to harm him when we fought in the ministry of magic last year but if he was certain of his invincibility why did he apparate away as soon as the ministry aurors arrived why didnt he stay to finish off harry when he finally had the chance voldemort is not the most modest of men if this cloak makes him truly invincible he would be crowing about it it is not in his nature to keep quiet about something like that so our two priorities are to find a way of dealing with the dementors and trying to discover how to penetrate voldemort protective cloak said hermione it a pity that we cantchange the past rick could go back in time and remove the cloak of salazar slytherin from the chamber of secrets long before tom riddle was even born but we cantdo that can we sir asked hermione looking up at dumbledore hopefully the headmaster smiled at her shaking his head things that happened so long ago must be left to happen as they will i am afraid after a few moments of silent contemplation he continued it is most interesting that voldemort cloak does not protect him from his own charms salazar slytherin must have done it deliberately it was probably necessary so the wearer could do magic himself the wearer magic has to be able to pass through the cloak but it seems that it can pass in both directions of course salazar slytherin would not have thought about reflecting shields as they were unknown in the time of the founders in fact there are only a handful of wizards who have ever been able to effectively cast the reflecting shield and two of them are sitting in this room he added smiling at rick and harry if it a cloak would it protect his head asked harry would it be possible to get it off of him i dontthink it a cloak in the ordinary sense harry replied dumbledore it a spell cloak once voldemort had mastered the magic to wear it it would have become an invisible part of him protecting his entire body including his head only voldemort himself would be able to remove it salazar slytherin was a powerful magician and particularly gifted in the art of magical protection i doubt very much that there was any flaw in the cloak when he created it if there is one now then something must have caused it i wonder what it could have been professor said hermione thoughtfully if salazar slytherin hadnt considered the possibility of the wearer own spell rebounding and penetrating the cloak from the outside then he wouldnthave considered the possibility that it might damage the cloak very astute miss granger said the headmaster enthusiastically you re quite correct he would have paid no attention to that particular possibility when he created the cloak it is indeed conceivable that the wearer own spell penetrating the cloak could damage it and we know of an occasion when that happened said hermione excitedly the night voldemort killed harry parents and tried to kill harry but how does that help us asked harry sounding upset he felt hurt that hermione was trespassing on that event which for him was so charged with grief and pain i sorry harry i know you dontlike talking or thinking about that night said hermione sympathetically it must be terribly painful for you but we have to it could be really important yes indeed agreed dumbledore nodding his head it was clear that he and hermione were on the same track if the cloak of salazar slytherin has in fact been damaged as voldemort actions both in the past and the future suggest it was almost certainly the killing curse that not only failed to kill harry as a baby but rebounded upon voldemort with such disastrous consequences for himself hermione could no longer contain herself so if rick precisely miss granger said the headmaster smiling at her if mr godfry were to go back to that night and observe very carefully what happens when voldemort attempts to kill harry he might discover where the weakness in the cloak is located if he is able to pinpoint the exact location on voldemort body where the green flash of his own killing curse strikes him then we will have found voldemort achilles heel exactly said hermione excitedly her mind in overdrive is it true sir she asked the headmaster that the protection harry mother used to save him from voldemort that night is a great mystery even now as voldemort said yes indeed miss granger there are many forms of protective magic as you will know from your own studies of empathetic magic with professor mcgonagall there is a special magical relationship between a witch and her baby the magic which protected harry from voldemort when he tried to steal the sorcerer stone in your first year is very rare but not unknown even though voldemort was in the body of professor quirrell he was still unable to physically touch harry yet professor quirrell was able to curse harry and nearly kill him in his first quidditch match said hermione thoughtfully that curse didntrebound on him i was wondering sir if perhaps rick could go back a bit before voldemort attacks he may hear harry parents talking about the protection his mother used he may even witness her casting the spell it would be a very valuable spell to know about yes i agree miss granger said professor dumbledore at the time i questioned lily and james closest friends and more recently sirius black some of them recalled that lily was researching protection spells but none of them knew what she had found or had used to protect harry it has been a great mystery all these years and it could be a very valuable spell to have at our disposal after all it stopped voldemort it almost destroyed him in fact harry remained silent he was feeling very peculiar and uncomfortable about this whole conversation it was all about him and the night voldemort had murdered his parents the night voldemort had tried to kill him when he was a baby the night he became famous as the boy who lived harry loathed that label he shunned the undeserved fame but most of all he didntwant to think about the events of that night which had orphaned him and set his life course now they were talking about rick going back there actually being there when it all happened he was going to go back there like some time tourist and just watch it all happen without lifting a finger to prevent the great tragedy of his life a tragedy which had robbed him of his loving parents and left him to grow up unloved and unwanted with the beastly dursleys harry mind was filled with all the possibilities of averting the calamity of that halloween night there were so many ways the tragedy could be prevented rick could warn his parents not to trust peter pettigrew as their secret keeper or memory charm pettigrew so he couldntreveal the secret he could at least warn his parents that they d be betrayed so they could flee godric hollow for hogwarts or somewhere safer with all his powers rick could stop voldemort from killing his parents but no dumbledore would forbid him to change anything he wouldnteven be allowed to prevent pettigrew from committing mass murder and then pinning it on sirius who would rot for twelve years in azkaban harry wished he could shut off his mind he just didntwant to think about it anymore harry said dumbledore kindly drawing him out of these painful self enclosing thoughts i know this must be very unpleasant for you it will be stirring up very painful thoughts and emotions i wish we didntneed to do this to send mr godfry back to that fateful night but i believe we must this could provide us with the key to finally ridding our world of voldemort you have seen firsthand what the future holds not only for the magical world but for the muggle world also if voldemort is not stopped harry didntrespond he just continued staring down at the carpet i imagine that you are thinking about all the ways in which your parents lives might be saved am i correct dumbledore asked harry sympathetically harry nodded silently his sad eyes downcast unfortunately i cannot allow it if mr godfry attempts to change anything at all on that halloween night the result will almost certainly be totally disastrous in all documented cases the outcome has inevitably been calamitous for the one who changed the past the result is almost always the opposite of what was intended but that aside it should be quite obvious to you what the immediate consequence would be in this case if mr godfry attempted to save your parents you mean voldemort wouldntlose all his powers and disappear said harry blankly still looking down at the floor exactly said dumbledore you are perhaps unaware of how dire the situation was at that time you couldntknow voldemort power was growing daily the order of the phoenix was heavily outnumbered the ministry of magic was weak and riddled with death eaters in high places voldemort victory seemed a certainty it was only a matter of time many of the weaker witches and wizards who were not at all sympathetic to voldemort cause were nevertheless flocking to his ranks to save themselves like that traitor pettigrew spat harry exactly said dumbledore sighing he was silent for a few moments lost in memories of the horrors of those times things were even worse then than they were at the beginning of this year if voldemort had not killed your parents that night and then attempted to kill you and in so doing met his downfall he would undoubtedly have soon triumphed over the order and those who still opposed him your parents along with everyone else in the order would ultimately have perished along with the squibs the muggle born witches and wizards and many others i know you resent your fame harry said dumbledore smiling kindly at him but you have to understand the feeling of joy and deliverance from a great and impending doom that the wizarding world felt when they learned of voldemort demise that halloween night when he failed to kill you harry remained silent his eyes fixed steadfastly to the floor after a few moments dumbledore turned his attention back to rick you may not change anything at all you may only observe the painful events of that night as they unfold under no circumstances may you interfere with those events to do so would almost certainly mean that voldemort would not fall on that night i need hardly tell you what the terrible consequences would be i am certain that none of us want to find ourselves living in such a world rick nodded his agreement i will abide by your wishes to the letter professor dumbledore so when do i go he asked the sooner the better said dumbledore in fact i suggest you go right now you will have noticed that when you travel through time your location remains unchanged i suggest you make yourself invisible and apparate directly to godric hollow then go back to the 31st of october 1981 at around six o clock in the evening that should give you several hours before voldemort arrives we will wait for you here you should return to the exact moment in time that you departed to us it will seem like you were hardly gone at all regardless of how long you actually spend in the past good luck rick and remember the golden rule of time travel change nothing please take a few moments to leave a review chapter 21 halloween 1981 when rick arrived at godric hollow he found himself outside the potters cottage in what must have been the garden it was an unruly mass of weeds now the cottage itself lay in ruins the roof was gone and nothing remained of the doors or windows creepers and vines grew thickly over what remained of the walls it looked like it had been left untouched since that fateful halloween night sixteen years ago rick held up godric gryffindor wand twisting it slightly as he closed his eyes and concentrated on going back in time this time he paid attention to the process it was like stepping out of the present into no where or more accurately no time then stepping back into another time it was a bit like stepping out of one compartment on the hogwarts express into the corridor and then entering another compartment when he opened his eyes the cottage looked quite different it was no longer in ruins it looked very picturesque with creepers growing up the stone walls light shone from the windows on the autumn leaves scattered about outside rick was very much aware of dumbledore warning about not changing anything he had to make certain that no one noticed him when he had been spying on umbridge draco and the slytherins the previous term he had discovered that he could disapparate without having to immediately apparatesomewhere else it was like his body was nowhere at all but his mind and senses were wherever he wanted them to be it was much better than just being invisible because no one could trip over him hear him or smell him he decided to use the technique now he had to make sure that he wasntnoticed upon entering the house rick found himself in a large comfortable and homely lounge room there was a lively fire burning in the fireplace the room was a bit messy with toys spread over the sofa and spilling onto the floor rick couldntsee anyone but he heard voices coming from the next room following the voices he found himself in the kitchen where the potters were finishing their evening meal the first thing that struck rick was how young they looked only a few years older than himself yet here they were already married and with a baby rick tried to picture himself in a scene like this in a few years time with hermione of course it was quite appealing james was laughing at harry who was thumping the little table of his high chair amusing himself as his empty bowl and cup danced about there was no doubt at all that this was james potter rick had expected him to look a lot like harry but the resemblance was so striking that he had to tell himself no that not harry potter that james potter harry the baby the thick black tufts of hair standing out at all angles from the baby head and the bright green eyes were a dead giveaway that the baby was indeed harry potter james you re supposed to be cleaning up the baby not playing with him said lily sounding exasperated as she cleared the table she was an attractive witch slim and petite those green eyes and pale white face framed by masses of dark red hair made a striking combination sometimes i wonder which one of you is the baby honestly she flicked her wand at harry muttering a cleaning charm there i ve done it now all you have to do is take him to the lounge i sure you can manage if you put your mind to it james laughed at lily admonishment i sure can come on harry it time for your flying lessons oh do be careful with the baby said lily sounding concerned harry was making happy excited noises he obviously knew what flying lessons were lily knew he loved them but she always worried that james would get carried away and not be careful honestly sometimes it seems like he hardly changed since he was at hogwarts pulling all sorts of dangerous pranks with his friends when will he ever grow up she thought smiling to herself and shaking her head james meanwhile had cast a levitation charm on little harry who was gurgling happily as he rose up from his high chair and waved his arms and legs as he floated about the kitchen guided by his father wand he loved this game james would bring him close to things which he would try to grab hold of but not close enough for him to actually grasp them lily had her back to them as she tidied up james floated little harry right over her head he was delighted to be able to grab hold of his mother thick red hair with his tiny little hands she reached up above her head and pulled harry into a hug so you want to be a seeker my little man you think mummy your snitch do you she said holding him out in front of her and smiling lovingly at him harry waved his arms about saying snitch fly fly snitch smiling happily at his mother they were the only words he could say so far apart from mumum and dada lily laughed and gave him another cuddle and kiss before holding him up our little seeker wants more flying lessons james said lily as her baby gently floated up out of her hands james flew a happy little harry into the lounge snitch snitch demanded harry james reached into his pocket and with a grin pulled out a special snitch which he had enchanted to go wherever he pointed it was quite a bit smaller than a regulation quidditch snitch just the right size for his son tiny little hands he threw it up in the air and then with his left hand moved it so that it was flying just in front of harry harry gurgled happily stretching out a little hand towards it and calling to it snitch snitch this was harry favourite game and he was having a great time as his father flew him around the lounge room with the snitch ducking and diving in front of him its golden wings beating rapidly whenever the snitch came within arm reach harry grabbed it in his little hand much to his delight and that of his proud father you re going to be a great seeker some day little laddie said james smiling indulgently at his son i can hardly wait till you re old enough to fly on a broom then we ll have some serious fun james dontyou even think about it there no way i letting my little boy go off on a broom with you the minute you get on a broom you lose all your common sense although in your case all isnt all that much said lily grinning at him come on hand over that little man to his mummy you re getting him over excited again and it time for him to go to sleep come on lily said james bringing harry gently down into his mother waiting arms you know heaps of sleeping charms you never fail to send our little chappie off to dreamland bring him here so he can give his dada a big kiss goodnight lily smiled as she placed harry in james arms watch out called lily but it was too late quick as flash harry had pulled his father gold framed glasses from his face and was waving them around happily crying snitch snitch for heaven sake james laughed lily you never learn do you remember you re supposed to take your glasses off before you take harry in your arms before he takes them off for you here harry here padfoot she said handing him a large dog with shaggy fur and grabbing james glasses from him as he held out his little hands to take his favourite fur animal from her harry grabbed his fur dog padfook he exclaimed hugging it james and lily burst out laughing at his mispronunciation of sirius nickname padfoot said lily slowly to harry who was happily holding on to his dog as his father held him in his arms padfoot she said again pointing at the fur dog padfook said harry grinning happily lily sighed sirius will be over the moon when we tell him that his name was the fifth word spoken by his favourite little godson yeah laughed james even if he didntget it quite right i kind of like the way harry says it actually i think i ll start calling him padfook as well i wouldntrecommend it laughed lily he ll probably start calling you something nasty like pongs pongs said harry happily oh no said james aghast now look what you ve done i going to have to memory charm the little blighter dont you dare said lily in mock horror it time for bath and bed for this little man and with that she took harry from his father arms and disappeared up the stairs james sat down in a comfortable armchair near the fire he summoned a pouf to put his feet on and then summoned a book that was lying on a table it was a book on defensive spells which rick remembered speed reading at flourish and blotts rick turned his attention to a large bookshelf which covered half of one wall many of the books were unfamiliar to him he wondered if perhaps one of them might contain information about the magic lily had used to protect harry by the time lily returned rick had finished speed reading all the books that were new to him lily waved her wand at the mess of toys covering the sofa and the floor they rose up into the air like a hurricane before pouring into a large toy trunk against the wall honestly james she said as she closed the lid of the trunk with a flick of her wand you could at least have cleaned up the mess there were toys everywhere really what mess asked james puzzled looking up from his book i didntsee any mess you never do sighed lily you d be perfectly happy living in a pigsty as long as you were my sow i sure i would said james looking at lily affectionately i not sure whether to take that as a compliment or an insult laughed lily but i definitely dontwant to live in a pigsty even with such an intelligent charming and handsome pig as you james laughed lily sat down in the other armchair in front of the fire opened a large cloth bag and pulled out her knitting she was making a cute little cardigan and pants outfit to keep harry nice and warm as the days grew colder with the approach of winter she waved her wand at the knitting needles and they rose up a little way in the air and started knitting quietly so how was the order meeting this afternoon asked lily pretty depressing actually things are going from bad to worse the death eaters seem to be able to attack with impunity and the ministry of magic isntmaking any serious effort at stopping them the ministry lousy with death eaters all the ministry does is issue reassuring press releases which are nothing but lies about how everyone should stay calm and that the situation is under control dumbledore took me aside after the meeting said james it seems he got a very well placed spy in voldemort camp snape thought rick according to dumbledore spy continued james someone close to us is spying for voldemort although he doesntknow who it is who could it be asked lily sounding worried i cantthink of any of our friends who would go over to voldemort can you james just shook his head during the meeting sirius said something about how voldemort had been recruiting all the dark creatures james you dontthink remus would no i dontthink so i never would have imagined it but i just dontknow anymore so many people are going over to the dark side maybe voldemort has some special power over dark creatures it so hard to know who you can trust these days said james sighing i just glad dumbledore came up with that fidelus charm to protect us but what if it peter what then we ll be defenceless said lily sounding worried maybe we should have stuck to the original plan and made sirius our secret keeper yeah sirius was the obvious choice i trust him absolutely but it was his idea to switch to peter i mean sirius is such an obvious choice and like he said himself who would think it would be peter no peter ok he been my friend since we were eleven he d never betray us said james but he didntsound completely certain it was hard to be certain of anything these days i hope you re right james i worry so much for harry said lily fearfully did you ask dumbledore for more information about this prophecy i wish he wouldntalways be so secretive about everything i mean if it affects us we have a right to know dont we yeah i asked but he just said the same as before according to this prophecy there are two babies who could grow up to be the one who defeats voldemort and harry is definitely one of them he wont tell me who the other one is only that voldemort has heard the prophecy and should be able to figure out who the two of them are according to dumbledore voldemort is obsessed with his immortality and he ll attempt to eliminate anyone that threatens it god why does it have to be harry my beautiful baby cried lily tears running down her face it just not fair i know love said james getting up and sitting on the side of lily armchair putting a comforting arm around her but just think maybe our little harry will grow up to be a powerful wizard he might be the one who finally kills voldemort and rids the world of all this evil just think of that i dontcare about that sobbed lily all i care about is my baby i want him to be safe i want him to be happy i dont want harry to be the one who has to face voldemort let someone else save the world and leave my little boy in peace god i wish we could find a way to protect him from that monster she cried you haventfound any new protection charms asked james no sighed lily i ve read every book and research paper on the subject the only one that might be useful is the sanguis contego charm that the one i cast on harry last week lily i dontwant you to activate that charm we ve already talked about it you d have to sacrifice your own life to make it work wouldntyou so do you think i d just hand my baby over to voldemort to kill what kind of mother do you think i am but lily love if we knew for sure that the charm would protect harry it might make some sense but you told me yourself that it won t all it will do is stop voldemort from touching him physically and maybe give him some kind of protection if he living with your blood relatives which means your horrible sister petunia that charm wontstop a killing curse you know it you told me so yourself so what do you want me to do james just hand my baby over to that monster is that what you would do she cried out tears running down her face her bright green eyes filled with fear and anxiety james tried to comfort her if voldemort comes i ll fight him he said defiantly he wonttouch a hair on harry head while i alive maybe i can defeat the evil bastard but if i can t there no way you can if voldemort kills me there is no way you can save harry and you know it voldemort will kill him you wontbe able to stop him either with curses or the sanguis contego charm lily please promise me that you ll apparate away if i killed you cantapparate harry with you so you ll have to go alone it bad enough if harry and i die i dont want you to die as well please lily love he pleaded lily shook her head determinedly james what the point of talking about it i could never leave my baby it not just about protection i just couldntdo it please let stop talking about it she said drying her eyes it just makes me so sad what will come will come and who knows maybe it won t let just be happy together while we ve got each other and not think of all the horrible things that might happen some day yeah i guess you re right said james pulling her closer and kissing her affectionately rick was becoming confused what the hell is going on he thought its not some day it today voldemort will be here soon and they donthave a spell to stop him killing harry this cantbe right can they find the spell before he gets here they dontseem to be trying very hard it looks like they ve given up searching apart from being confused about how voldemort would be stopped rick was feeling terribly sad they were a wonderful couple you could see how much in love they were with each other how comfortable they were together then there was little harry rick didnthave much experience with babies well none that he could remember but little harry looked like such a happy little fellow it was obvious his parents loved him dearly they were such a happy loving family it was just unbearable to think that this idyllic little family was about to be shattered and destroyed rick felt like his heart was breaking it was just too awful to contemplate rick knew what was about to happen and there was nothing he could do to prevent it well no actually there was that was the problem there were lots of things he could do to prevent it and save them all but he knew he mustn t it was so hard will i be able to hold myself back when voldemort arrives he asked himself he was seriously beginning to wonder if he would lily had taken a book and was reading trying to distract her mind from all the fears she held for her baby james had returned to his armchair and his book it was a lovely homely scene thought rick he occupied his time imagining that it was him and hermione living in this lovely little cottage with their own baby but this happy image was not enough to keep the thoughts of impending doom from his mind rick didntknow exactly when voldemort would come but come he would as the minutes ticked by rick became more and more tense the waiting was unbearable when voldemort finally appeared it all was a bit anti climatic no doors bursting in roofs lifting off just a small pop as voldemort apparated alone into the living room lily turned and gasped in horror but james was out of his chair wand at the ready poised for action in an instant voldemort looked quite different from when rick had seen him last he was twenty years younger of course but also this was his real body before it had been destroyed not the one that had been magically created that night in the graveyard at little hangleton he looked more human thought rick less like a reptile yet still he did not look completely human there was something undeniably evil about him it was palpable you picked the wrong side potter he said carelessly not bothering to take up a defensive stance did you really think that old fool dumbledore would be able to stop me he impotent against me do you know why he gloated he doesntunderstand power and how to use it all his goody goody morality prevents him from attaining real power he afraid of it well i not afraid of power and i have attained it i have more power than dumbledore more power than any wizard on earth he boasted james said nothing he just crouched like a panther ready to pounce it a pity you threw your lot in with him potter continued voldemort calmly you re from an ancient pureblood family you would have been an asset to the winning side not only did you pick the wrong side you also picked the wrong secret keeper i imagine you ve realised that by now he chuckled evilly your little friend pettigrew isntas foolish as you he knew which side was the right side and he was very eager to ingratiate himself to me so eager in fact that he told me everything not just where to find you but also about your futile attempts to find a spell to protect your son from me lily apparate now screamed james before turning his wand on voldemort yelling flatus fortis voldemort just stood there laughing in james face you ll have to do better than that pathetic blasting curse potter if you want to stop me james hit voldemort with every powerful curse he knew but voldemort just continued standing there laughing evilly you re wasting your time potter i wearing the cloak of salazar slytherin it protects me from all spells you canttouch me james leapt bodily at voldemort attempting to attack him physically but somehow he seemed to slide right past him falling to the floor oh and it also protects me from physical attacks as well i invincible you ve wasted enough of my time i still have to visit the longbottoms tonight to dispose of their son after i ve taken care of yours goodbye potter avada kedavra he said pointing his wand at james who was struggling to get up from the floor just before the curse hit him james noticed with satisfaction that lily had apparated away i hope she safe was his last mortal thought rick saw the deadly flash of green light hit james he fell back motionless to the floor eyes frozen open but lily had only apparated to harry room she grabbed him from his cot opened the window and levitated him carefully to the ground before apparating down to join him but before she could get away voldemort was there standing right in front of her pointing his wand at baby harry he had a wicked self satisfied grin on his face so this is the one who would deign to destroy me lord voldemort the immortal the most powerful wizard on earth he crowed lily was clutching her baby desperately she turned her back on voldemort to shield harry with her body not harry not harry please not harry she begged tearfully stand aside you silly girl stand aside now said voldemort trying to get a clear shot at harry not harry please no take me kill me instead lily implored him get out of my way and give me the baby now said voldemort becoming impatient as lily kept twisting and turning to prevent him from getting a clear shot at harry not harry please have mercy have mercy were her last hopeless words before she screamed as the killing curse hit her rick felt numb as he watched her fall to the ground dead it had been the most difficult moment of his life restraining himself when he wanted so desperately to intervene he was glad he had no physical presence voldemort may not have been able to see him but he would have heard him howling in despair rick was overcome with grief from the two deaths he had just witnessed it was hard to believe that there was goodness and justice in the world when such good people as these could be struck down in cold blood by so cruel and heartless a monster rick tried to console himself with the thought that no more innocent lives would be lost that night harry and neville at least would survive it was time for voldemort to experience the evil of his own curse mamam said baby harry pulling at his mothers hair not understanding what had happened as he crouched over her face looking into those unblinking lifeless green eyes suddenly there was a loud bang harry looked around uncomprehendingly the house was in flames voldemort smiled seemingly pleased with his handiwork ha ha my little potter laughed voldemort cruelly your parents are dead your house is in flames you re defenceless before me mamam maman cried harry plaintively turning back to his lifeless mother he knew something was wrong with her he was becoming more and more upset as she continued to lie there unmoving why wasnt she talking to him in her sweet comforting voice why wasntshe taking him in her arms and hugging him like she always did when he was upset why was she just lying there like that harry started crying over his dead mother rick was overcome with grief as he watched the heart breaking scene before him why didnti do something to save them he asked himself how could i have been so cold hearted to let this terrible tragedy happen but deep down despite the over powering feelings of guilt he knew there had been no choice but to let these gruesome events unfold but something else other than his emotions was troubling rick what would protect harry when voldemort turned his killing curse upon him he wondered everything he had heard earlier that night made him doubt that the curse would rebound upon voldemort the way it was meant to the way it had actually happened that night was it possible that harry was not protected was it possible that voldemort would succeed in killing him and retain all his powers rick felt increasingly confused and uneasy your mother cantprotect you now said voldemort staring with cold unfeeling eyes at the distraught baby it time for you to join her now according to pettigrew she used some blood magic on you so perhaps i had better be careful she wanted me to kill her that much is obvious probably she needed me to kill her to activate the protection but what does it do i wonder pettigrew said that i would not be able to touch you but there no need to touch you to kill you with a curse my little enemy he said thoughtfully more to himself than to harry i know i ll try putting my mark on you first little potter if i can do that then i ll certainly be able to kill you he said in a cold heartless calculating voice harry was looking up at voldemort as he spoke to him voldemort pointed his wand at harry head and said signum ego concateno harry recoiled writhing on the ground and screaming in agony from the excruciating pain when he was still for a moment rick recognised the famous zigzag lightning bolt shape on his forehead for now it was a bleeding wound not yet a scar but what does this mean rick asked himself if harry was protected voldemort wouldnt have been able to mark him like that surely it means he wontbe protected from the killing curse either voldemort is going to kill him unless i do something rick knew he could cast a reflecting shield over harry which would not only protect him but also send voldemort curse back at him dumbledore kept warning me over and over again to do nothing to change the past he reminded himself but what if i was always here on this night what if it was always my reflecting shield that saved harry not a protection from his mother as everyone has always thought then it would be ok for me to cast it in fact i have to because i ll be changing the past if i don t it so damn confusing thought rick maybe lily really did succeed in putting a protection spell on harry without realising it maybe it not meant to protect him from voldemort mark maybe it only meant to protect him from mortal danger or maybe his mother protection will only work after voldemort mark has been put on him maybe that helps to activate it did voldemort made a fatal mistake in putting his mark on harry could it be that the mark itself will protect him there are just too many possibilities thought rick desperately time was running out if i place a reflecting shield on harry it going to double the strength of voldemort curse it might end up killing him rather than just destroying his body that would really be changing the past what am i going to do voldemort drew himself up triumphantly to cast the killing curse while rick was still frantically trying to decide what to do yes i have to protect him with a reflecting shield he finally decided but just as he was about to cast it he hesitated no wait what if i dontcast it what if i just watch to see what happens if voldemort curse kills harry instead of rebounding back on him i can go back in time a bit to just before he does the curse and then cast the reflecting shield that should work shouldntit voldemort pointed his wand down at little harry who was lying curled up crying in pain in the foetal position his little hands clutching at his forehead avada kedavra cried voldemort victoriously please take a few moments to leave a review chapter 22 welcome to my nightmare rick mind went blank except for the sound of two words that reverberated painfully through his consciousness avada kedavra spoken in the cold harsh gloating voice of voldemort it seemed to go on forever but probably it was only a few moments as the last echo of those terrible words died away rick senses began to function once more discerning the world around him he found himself alone in the potters garden at godric hollow but how can this be rick asked himself it was no longer an autumn night the garden was no longer tidy and well kept the potters house was no longer in flames the midday sun was low in a wintry sky the garden was an untended unruly mass of weeds and the cottage was in ruins both house and garden looked like they had been untouched for years in fact everything looked exactly the same to rick as it had when he apparated here from hogwarts rick searched his mind but could not remember having deliberately tried to travel forward again in time yet it really seemed as though he had the last thing he could remember was voldemort killing curse everything after that was a total blank it not like i not used to living with huge blanks in my past thought rick uneasily i just wish i knew what happened after voldemort cursed harry that was the whole point of my being there i better get back to hogwarts and tell dumbledore what happened i wonder what he ll make of it rick apparated back to the headmaster study and immediately made himself visible but the headmaster wasntthere nor was harry or hermione professor snape was the only one in the room he was standing with his back to rick lost in thought looking out the window err professor snape said rick where professor dumbledore and but rick stopped snape spun around reflexively drawing his wand as he moved into a defensive posture the expression on his face a mixture of surprise incredulity wariness and hostility who the hell are you where in hades did you come from demanded snape dangerously how on earth did you manage to get into this locked and warded office stay perfectly still move as much as a muscle and you ll be dead before you hit the ground err professor snape began rick what going i already know my own name said snape glaring intently at rick what i wish to know is your name and exactly what you are doing in my office he said threateningly your office rick blurted out but this is professor dumbledore office where is he i ll ask the questions barked snape he appeared to be a little unsettled by rick question tell me your name and how you got into my office now rick was about to ask snape why he was asking him his name when he knew it perfectly well but a quick probe of snape mind told rick that snape was completely mystified as to who he was rick was starting to feel very uneasy my name is rick godfry sir said rick err what the date today snape ignored rick question how did you get into my office he demanded i apparated sir answered rick dont lie to me snarled snape no one can apparate at hogwarts tell me how you got into my office now since snape was refusing to answer him rick decided to get his answers straight from snape mind it was exactly the same day that he had apparated from this office to godric hollow but it was no longer dumbledore office professor severus snape seemed to firmly believe that he and not professor dumbledore was the headmaster of hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry what have i done rick asked himself fearfully have i somehow changed everything snape was becoming furious he raised his wand apparently intending to hex rick but suddenly rick disappeared you see i was telling you the truth about apparating said rick from behind snape he had decided it would be easier just to demonstrate than argue snape spun around astonished pointing his wand at rick but before he could curse him rick was back in front of the desk impedimenta yelled snape after turning around again rick didntbother to apparate this time he simply cast a reflecting shield which turned snape curse back on him snape stood frozen rick took the opportunity to try and sort out his confused thoughts he sank into a comfortable armchair and tried to figure out what had happened it was obvious now that somehow he had changed time and almost certainly not for the better but he had done nothing he followed dumbledore instructions to the letter in the end he changed nothing he didntcast his reflecting shield over harry had harry been killed did voldemort get away unscathed he had to find out but snape didntseem to be in any mood to answer questions rick was certain snape had changed sides and joined dumbledore before that fateful halloween night he was just going to have to trust him well a little at least err professor snape if you wouldntmind just err standing there quietly for a bit i d like to take the opportunity to err explain where i ve come from you probably wontbelieve me at first so it might be best if you just err stay that way till i finished rick decided to be selective about what he told snape just in case he had changed sides again i a hogwarts student sir a gryffindor as you can see from my uniform i was in this very office this morning but you see you werenthere in fact you werenteven the headmaster you were the potions master professor albus dumbledore was the headmaster and i was sitting in this room with him and two friends of mine hermione granger and harry potter i have some rather unusual abilities as you ve just seen for yourself one of them is the ability to travel in time professor dumbledore had asked me to go back in time to observe something he told me most emphatically not to change anything i did exactly as he said and was very careful not to change a thing but somehow it seems i have because when i apparated back to his office professor dumbledore harry and hermione were gone and you were here apparently the headmaster of hogwarts something has gone dreadfully wrong err by the way sir i didntcurse you err just in case you were thinking i did i rather good at putting up a reflecting shield which turns your own curse back on you you were hit by your own impedimenta curse i ll lift it now but i suggest you donttry cursing me again finite incantatem snape remained frozen for a few moments as he stared wide eyed at rick in disbelief finally he shook his head violently and rushed to his desk pulled open a drawer and took out a bottle of firewhisky he didntbother with a glass he just threw back his head taking two large gulps to steady his nerves then he collapsed into his chair and closed his eyes pressing a thumb and forefinger to them after a minute or two he opened his eyes and took a small glass from the open drawer he filled it with firewhisky and downed it in a single gulp finally he looked up at rick incredulously did i hear you correctly did you say that one of the people in this office was harry potter yes sir replied rick harry potter the son of james potter and lily evans i think you went to school but harry potter died along with his parents fifteen years ago said snape emphatically rick gulped his worst fears had been realised in this reality perhaps he did but in the one i came from he didn t voldemort tried to kill him but his curse rebounded almost killing him but not quite it destroyed his body and he disappeared for fourteen years his followers were defeated most of them ended up in azkaban harry potter became famous for causing voldemort downfall he became known as the boy who lived but surely this is just some fantastic story you ve invented it cantbe true said snape shaking his head as he poured himself another firewhisky but rick could see the doubt and uncertainty in snape mind he had to find a way of proving it to him i dontknow what is and isntcommon knowledge in this reality sir but since you re headmaster here you probably wouldnt expect me to know that you were once a death eater but that you changed sides and were spying for dumbledore you warned him that one of the potters friends was spying for voldemort it was peter pettigrew i doubt very much many people in this reality would know that snape turned ashen faced there was not a person alive who knew his deepest darkest most dangerous secret at least not until now snape quickly downed the glass of firewhisky he certainly wasnt going to confirm the allegation if it got out he was worse than dead for a moment he considered killing godfry no he d killed enough in his death eater days he d turned his back on that that aside this godfry or whoever he was had a lot of power it might not be so easy if harry died that night in this reality then what about voldemort what happened to him asked rick uneasily in this reality replied snape in a flat emotionless voice he is called the eternal emperor he is the absolute ruler of the magical world and has plans to one day be ruler of the whole world what happened to professor dumbledore and sirius black remus lupin hagrid and all the other members of rick stopped himself short he knew nothing of snape present loyalties if he had any apart from to his bottle of firewhisky he didntwant to give away the name of anyone that snape didntknow about they might still be alive the order of the phoenix asked snape all dead and many more besides everyone who opposed the dark lord was ruthlessly murdered after the dementors had devoured their souls all the squibs muggle born and half blood witches and wizards were exterminated fifteen years ago when the dark lord came to power welcome to my nightmare mr godfry said snape in a dull lifeless voice pouring himself another firewhisky and quickly downing it actually professor snape i think it my nightmare said rick feeling unbearably guilty i think i may have created it you know how i told you that professor dumbledore sent me back in time well he sent me back to the night that voldemort killed the potters like i said in my reality voldemort curse rebounded on him i was supposed to observe where it struck him he has a protective cloak it called the cloak of yes yes i know all about the cloak of salazar slytherin he goes on about it ad nauseam as if it some blasted sacred relic spat snape impatiently since his rebounding curse destroyed his body continued rick professor dumbledore thought it may have also damaged the cloak i was just supposed to watch and see where the curse hit him but you didntjust watch did you said snape accusingly you broke the golden rule of time travel you changed something you blasted fool you changed something which resulted in voldemort surviving and creating this hell on earth you are to blame for this nightmare he said angrily rick hung his head yes i am to blame he sighed not because i did something but because i did nothing you see everyone believed that lily potter had found some ancient magic to protect harry she sacrificed her own life to save harry and everyone believed that her sacrifice protected harry from voldemort killing curse and sent it back on him but i was listening to the potters talking before voldemort arrived and it was clear she hadnt found a spell powerful enough to do that i began to wonder if maybe it was my reflecting shield that had protected harry i mean that i had always been there because i had always gone back in time and done it if you see what i mean but i kept remembering what professor dumbledore said about not changing time in the end i didntknow whether not changing time meant doing nothing or doing something casting the reflecting shield now i know i see said snape stroking his chin and contemplating rick dilemma and the terrible but fascinating complexities of time travel in the end said rick i figured that if i did nothing and it turned out that i should have acted then i could always go back again to before voldemort cursed harry and cast the reflecting shield but something unexpected happened when voldemort cast his killing curse i was somehow thrown back to the present time that why i apparated back here sir i wanted to ask the headmaster advice on what i should do well since i am now the headmaster i am more than willing to give you my advice said snape go back cast your reflecting shield this reality which it seems you have created is an abomination this he said pointing to the half empty bottle of firewhisky is the only thing that makes life remotely tolerable this once proud school is a mere shadow of what it was like the wizarding world at large it has been decimated achievement and excellence count for naught all that matters is blood and where it places one in the social pecking order ability and intelligence are shunned nepotism and cronyism determine success he said bitterly after his glorious victory our great immortal emperor found himself presiding over a very small empire indeed when the blood letting was over and only the purebloods were left surprise surprise he discovered there was a demographic problem having killed most of the population he was surprised to find that there were not enough people left to do the work and run things there are less than half the number of students at this school now than there were in my student days and even then it is almost impossible to find qualified teachers all the old ones were killed purebloods included their only crime was to have been appointed by professor dumbledore all of them asked rick alarmed yes except for myself binns who was already dead trelawney whom the immortal one regards as a great seer and of course madam hooch or should i say ex headmistress hooch said snape scornfully what you mean madam hooch the flying instructor asked rick puzzled how did she get to be headmistress i wouldnthave thought that she was qualified oh but you re mistaken said snape sarcastically she was eminently qualified to succeed dumbledore as headmistress after all she had unbeknownst to myself been the dark lord longest serving spy at hogwarts not to mention being part of the magistocracy a second cousin of minister of magic parkinson no less what better qualification could there be for headmistress of hogwarts in three short years she almost totally destroyed this school when her shortcomings became so glaringly obvious that even the minister of magic noticed she was elevated to minister of magical games and sports it has been my unhappy task to be headmaster of this declining school ever since the only compensation in my appointment was that it allowed me to give up active death eater service when the penny finally dropped and our esteemed emperor in his infinite wisdom realised there was a demographic problem he decreed that there would be a breeding program dontget me started on that insanity it wasntthe obvious problems in the running the mundane affairs of the wizarding world which troubled him such practical considerations never seem to cross his evil twisted mind no what alarmed him was the realisation that the wizarding population was too small to carry out his cherished dream of exterminating the muggles this world is not only evil and cruel it is also totally irrational and insane snape shook his head in disgust before downing another glass of firewhisky out of the corner of his eye rick noticed a sudden movement over by one of the bookshelves was that a mouse disappearing behind it he asked himself could it be yes it was rick projected his magical map and immediately identified the spy he jumped to his feet and used a summoning charm to pull it out from behind the bookcase and bring it squeaking and clawing into his outstretched hand he managed to get a good grip around its back to prevent it from biting and scratching him in its frantic attempts to escape where on earth did that rat come from asked snape somewhat surprised it no rat sir replied rick it a spy an animagus by the name of peter pettigrew pettigrew an animagus surely not said snape in disbelief how could such an inept bootlicking little sycophant as pettigrew have mastered such advanced magic however if it true and he been listening to my less than devotional ranting about the eternal emperor i ll have to do something about him rick cast a spell on the rat forcing it to transform he had to release it as it started spinning around as it hit the floor a head began shooting upwards followed by arms and legs when the transformation was complete standing before them was a short little man with a pointed nose and small watery eyes he immediately drew his wand only to find it disappear from his hand and end up in rick s rick flicked it at pettigrew feet pettigrew found he couldntmove they were stuck fast to the floor so pettigrew barked snape rising unsteadily to his feet and coming around to the front of his desk who ordered you to spy on me s s spy me s spy on you s s severus he stuttered lamely i i wasnts spying on you i i i you were what asked snape menacingly i know you were just looking for cheese you thought my office was a cheese shop and you d just pop in for a little gruyere is that right ratty y yes i mean n no i mean spluttered pettigrew in fear who sent you demanded snape levelling his wand at the little wizard you have two seconds before i hit you with a restricted curse n no p please begged pettigrew pathetically i ll tell you anything you want to know it was lucius malfoy who sent me to s spy on you but it wasntjust you it was all the hogwarts staff it was j just a r routine surveillance mission he mumbled apologetically my my pettigrew so you ve joined malfoy secret security service you certainly have come up in the world or perhaps it the world that gone down to your miserable level said snape derisively i going to have to dispose of you little rodent it would never do to have you report my treasonous remarks about our evil emperor to his head of secret security now would it s s severus begged the fearful pettigrew i i d n never do that to you p p please d dontk kill me i k know why d dontyou m memory charm me s so i c cantremember w what you said p please have m mercy pettigrew pleaded pathetically i have no mercy said snape coldly even if i memory charm you malfoy will send you back again i dontwant any of malfoy ratty little spies sneaking about informing him of everything i say and do anyway pettigrew you deserve to die for what you did betraying your friends to the dark lord they were no friends of mine but a secret keeper who betrays his secret to the enemy of those he has sworn to protect is the lowest of the low and deserves to die said snape harshly advancing threateningly on pettigrew wait professor snape said rick as much as he hated the miserable traitor he did not want to see him killed i know the perfect way to deal with him squibbus finite incantatum there now you can move again but you re a squib i wouldntgo rushing off to malfoy if i were you i understand that squibs get exterminated here take your wand try a spell or two said rick to the disbelieving pettigrew how about something simple like wingardium leviosa wingardium leviosa said pettigrew pointing his wand at a scroll on a small table but nothing happened frantically he tried several other simple spells but they didntwork either p please take off this terrible curse p please i ll do anything you say he begged pitifully it cantbe taken off it irreversible and permanent even if i could take it off i wouldn t you wretched traitor spat rick it your just deserts for what you did to your friends james lily and their baby harry are all dead because of you and as a result of your treachery voldemort triumphed and many many more died including your friends sirius and remus it hard to believe that one miserable little rat like you could cause so much pain suffering and death as a result of your actions squibs are ruthlessly murdered well now you re a squib you can experience first hand the consequences of your own cowardly actions snape meanwhile was leaning back on his desk for support the excessive amount of firewhisky he had imbibed made him unsteady on his feet but more than that he was stunned at rick squibbus curse he knew how hard the dark lord and others had searched unsuccessfully for such a spell it was clear this rick godfry was no ordinary wizard he had unheard of powers p please begged pettigrew miserably d dontleave me as a s squib the secret security service has special squib detectors they still check them even though all the squibs have been killed because new ones are born and immediately killed they ll d detect me and k kill me p please do something he pleaded the squibbus curse is irreversible said rick of course i could turn you back into a rat but you would remain a rat till the day you die as much as he abhorred pettigrew treachery he couldntcondemn him to death oh yes p please merciful boy please turn me into a rat begged pettigrew pathetically i know how to survive as a rat i d rather live as rat than die as a man snape snorted mockingly at pettigrew rick gestured to pettigrew with his hand transforming him permanently into a rat which quickly scurried away i must remember to get myself a cat said snape smirking wickedly as he made his way unsteadily back to his chair he started reaching for his bottle of firewhisky but then drew back his hand perhaps he d enough that a most impressive curse you used on pettigrew said snape you appear to have extraordinary powers how exactly did you acquire them rick was by now fairly sure that snape was not serving voldemort it was likely that he wasntopposing him either but in all likelihood neither was anyone else in this world opposing voldemort meant certain death snape just seemed to be trying to survive he couldntsave the world so he was just trying to save himself with the help of his firewhisky rick noticed how subdued and fatalistic snape had become compared to the snape he remembered that fire which often burned so maliciously and malevolently seemed to have been extinguished perhaps it had been drowned by the firewhisky in any case snape was already aware that he had extraordinary powers so there seemed little harm in explaining how they came about rick was not intending to hang around in this nightmare reality for much longer anyway he was planning to go back in time and set things right extraordinary said snape when rick finished his story you are uniquely equipped to help those opposed to the dark lord in your reality overcome him and prevent a nightmare world like this one from coming into being i suggest you return to the time just prior to when harry potter was killed from what you have said it seems certain that it was your reflecting shield that sent the dark lord curse back on him penetrating his protective cloak and destroying his body by going back to that night and not casting the shield you changed time and brought this terrible reality into being i know that now it was really stupid of me said rick voldemort actually did a test before he used the killing curse to check whether harry was protected from his curses he was able to put his mark on harry i should have known then beyond doubt that nothing would stop voldemort killing curse but me you say he put his mark on the potter baby how did he do it what did this mark look like asked snape curiously he just pointed his wand at harry forehead and said signum ego concateno said rick a zigzag shaped wound appeared on the baby forehead harry potter has a very distinctive scar of that shape on his forehead to this day it looks like a lightening bolt explained rick yes i know what it looks like said snape to rick surprise harry potter must have been the first one the dark lord marked in that way it can only be put on infants it is quite different from the dark mark he puts on his adult death eaters although its purpose is somewhat similar to bind the recipient to the one who made it a year or two after his victory the dark lord made a very interesting discovery about that particular mark if one who is marked should kill the one who made the mark then they will also die rick gasped for a couple of years after this discovery the dark lord put his mark on every infant on its first birthday continued snape ignoring rick shocked reaction being obsessed with his own immortality he saw it as a way to deter attempts upon his life for a while it looked like the wizarding world would be populated by wizards and witches with lightening bolt zigzags on their foreheads eventually however the dark lord discovered a rather unfortunate side effect those with the mark appeared to have some kind of mental link with him he became fearful that it would give them access to his thoughts so he had them all killed every single child whom he had marked consequently there is not a single third or fourth year student at hogwarts they were all killed said snape shaking his head morosely this is truly a grotesque nightmare reality said snape bitterly knocking back another firewhisky yes agreed rick this terrible reality should never have come into existence i need to go back and set things right as he spoke rick reached for his wand he was surprised to discover it was not in the special thin wand pocket where he always kept it he was sure he had returned it to the pocket after going back in time at godric hollow he had not used it since he searched every pocket twice becoming more and more frantic my wand i cantfind it anywhere it gone he cried desperately sinking down into a nearby chair what gone asked snape but you seem to be capable of wandless magic what do you need a wand for anyway there always pettigrew wand you could use that he said pointing to where pettigrew had dropped it when he was transformed into a rat i can do wandless magic i only need a wand for one thing time travel but not just any wand it needs to be my wand the wand of godric gryffindor said rick dejectedly without it i cantgo back in time i stuck here in this nightmare reality that i created and i cantgo back and fix it he said forlornly you had the wand of godric gryffindor asked snape incredulously yes professor dumbledore gave it to me wait said rick jumping up and dashing across the room to the founders cabinet it was empty where are all the things that used to be in here asked rick turning to face snape it used to have the sword of godric gryffindor and the sorting hat in it along with the wand of godric gryffindor snape shrugged his shoulders looted by death eaters i imagine when they defeated dumbledore and seized hogwarts such valuable and powerful magical objects as those would have been handed over to the dark lord in fact as i recall it was almost exactly at the time hogwarts fell that the dark lord began using a different wand it an unusual colour a very dark brown and it has something etched at one end that it said rick voldemort got the wand of godric gryffindor but why would he want to use gryffindor wand i mean gryffindor and slytherin were enemies and voldemort believes that he the heir of salazar slytherin true agreed snape however that wand must be one of the most ancient in existence and possibly the most powerful the dark lord is obsessed with power and objects of power he wouldntcare whose wand it had been of course he hasntannounced that he using gryffindor wand he wouldntwant that to get out he hates godric gryffindor with a passion so that why my wand disappeared mused rick when i didnt stop voldemort curse reality changed in this reality i dont have gryffindor wand because voldemort got it and since i donthave that wand in this reality i wouldnthave been able to travel back to the past to that halloween night that why i inexplicably found myself back in the present time i ve got to get that wand back said rick determinedly i have no idea how you re going to do that said snape you seem to know about the cloak of salazar slytherin but that not all the dark lord has protecting him he has become completely obsessed with his own immortality that and exterminating the muggles he has a permanent guard of his most trusted death eaters protecting him day and night he has in the past few years become even more paranoid and reclusive he very rarely appears in public apart from the odd increasingly irrational decree he pretty much leaves the running of the wizarding world to his two hand picked lieutenants cecil parkinson the minister of magic and lucius malfoy commander of the death eaters the secret security service and other unknown secretive and evil organs of oppression i have to get close to him there must be a way do you know where he is i can apparate right to him magical wards wontstop me said rick keen to get on with it no one knows where voldemort is said snape his whereabouts are a closely guarded secret he is rumoured to have several residences which he moves between as i said he is totally paranoid about his immortality in order to go to him you must be issued with a special portkey there is only one way you can get close to him you must become a death eater no gasped rick in horror he still presides over the initiation ceremonies and personally burns the dark mark into the arm of every new death eater in order for the mark to bind his death eaters to himself he must make the dark mark himself there is no other way for you to get close to him of that i am quite certain said snape rick gulped so how do i become a death eater then asked rick shuddering at the thought like almost everything else in this corrupt world it depends on who you know without patronage it could take you years that how everything works here he said bitterly however in the case of joining the death eaters since you re not in the magistocracy you will also need to demonstrate exceptional magical power that shouldntbe a problem for you wait a moment said snape he pulled open a drawer and took out a small vial containing a purple liquid he uncorked it and downed it in a single gulp sobriety potion he explained i dont have much use for it these days it tends to defeat the whole purpose of the firewhisky however i need to give some careful thought to how we are going to get you close enough to the dark lord to get that wand back and end this nightmare you will have to pose as an exchange student i think i can fabricate the necessary papers we will say that you are from new zealand as you did in your reality and because there are no magical schools there your parents instructed you at home but decided to send you to hogwarts to complete your education i presume that with all your gifts you will do well academically in fact you will probably find your studies ridiculously easy sixth year is probably the academic equivalent of fourth year in my student days so we should be able to get away with putting you in ravenclaw but what about the sorting hat asked rick doesntit decide my house i was hoping to be in gryffindor said rick quickly that wontbe possible replied snape the dark lord abolished gryffindor house when he came to power along with the sorting ceremony students are allocated a house based upon two ridiculous rules if their family is classified as belonging to the magistocracy in parkinson pureblood genealogy they automatically go into slytherin otherwise they sit a test of magical and academic ability those above a certain threshold go into ravenclaw those who fail to attain the threshold the majority go into to hufflepuff the house to which you are assigned determines your prospects and your future in the wizarding world however i do not wish to go into all of that now it is far too depressing especially when i sober but wouldnti need to be in slytherin to become a death eater asked rick no not at all said snape by and large the magistocracy do very little except strut about like a bunch of prize peacocks admiring themselves they contribute very little to the wizarding world in real terms of course they are the heads of all the ministry departments and form the top echelons of the various security services many join the death eaters mainly for the prestige it brings naturally they fill all the top positions in short they are the political and managerial elite they do virtually nothing the real work is done by those from ravenclaw and hufflepuff hufflepuffs leave school after fifth year and do all the menial jobs ravenclaws make up the bulk of the security services although not the highest ranks they also fill the middle management positions at the ministry run businesses and so on if they are magically powerful they may also be invited to become death eaters you were saying something about needing patronage before said rick yes only a few students each year are invited to become death eaters explained snape due to its association with the dark lord it is very prestigious and competition is fierce in order to receive an invitation you will need to impress the dark arts and duelling professor barty crouch with your magical abilities barty crouch junior asked rick remembering how he had impersonated mad eye moody in his reality yes said snape distastefully it was obvious that he loathed barty crouch however crouch recommendation will not be enough we live in a magistocracy not a meritocracy it who you know not what you know that counts in this world you have the son and daughter of the two highest ranking families in the magistocracy in your year draco malfoy and pansy parkinson you will need to cultivate one or the other otherwise you might have to wait years to receive your invitation rick groaned i suppose you must know them said snape you would have gone to school with them in your reality i doubt you will find that the depraved values and the pampering and privilege they have experienced all their lives in this reality have improved them on the contrary but you will need to get one of them on side to ask their father to give you the nod that how it works how soon could i be initiated as a death eater sir asked rick the more he heard about this terrible world which he had created the more desperate he became to get out of it by returning the world to the way it was supposed to be there are two induction ceremonies each year at the equinoxes the march equinox is in four weeks you should be old enough in fact if i am not mistaken both draco malfoy and pansy parkinson are to be inducted at that time if you move quickly you may be able to join them four weeks you mean i going to have to live in this horrible nightmare for four weeks muttered rick dejectedly i have lived in this nightmare for fifteen years spat snape bitterly i shall do everything in my power to help you end it but it will have to be done surreptitiously behind the scenes i do not wish to have my part in assisting you to obtain the dark lord wand exposed after all you may fail to get the wand or you may obtain it but not succeed in your attempt to turn this terrible reality back to the one from which you came should you fail i shall be condemned to live out my life in this nightmare unless you have urgent need of my assistance it will be safer for us both if you do not visit my office again as you have seen for yourself there are spies everywhere snape pointed his wand at rick please remove your reflecting shield mr godfry it is you who needs to become a ravenclaw not i he muttered a spell and rick tie and other gryffindor insignia changed to those of ravenclaw house i ll dig up some clothes and books for you from the lost property dungeon there probably even a trunk down there to put them in i ll have a house elf bring it to your dormitory take pettigrew wand you ll need to pretend you re using it i ll introduce you to your head of house and have him show you to ravenclaw tower do try to make a good impression on him rick couldnthelp but reflect on the irony of the situation in this reality he and snape trusted each other as allies and confidants they were each in possession of the other darkest secrets they had the power to destroy the other but instead they were protecting each other and working together for a common cause snape rose to his feet and strode across to the fireplace taking a handful of powder from a porcelain dish on the mantelpiece he threw it in the fire and as the flames flared up he called barty crouch please take a few moments to leave a review chapter 23 the breeding mad magistocracy as professor barty crouch junior accompanied him from the headmaster office to ravenclaw tower rick found himself instinctively disliking him although he was careful to hide it crouch was a wiry pale skinned wizard with a hard cold freckly face and fair hair there was an air of malice and ruthlessness about him rick wondered how much of it was his natural pre disposition and how much was the result of all the evil deeds he had done as one of voldemort death eaters as they walked through the corridors crouch conducted an impromptu interrogation first he tested rick suitability to be in ravenclaw satisfied with rick magical knowledge he asked about his background having probed crouch mind rick realised that crouch knew nothing about the magical community in new zealand so he was able to invent plausible answers to his questions neatly avoiding the cunning traps he saw crouch setting for him crouch asked him what he planned to do when he finished school rick said he wasntsure yet he said he was thinking about further studies and perhaps eventually teaching he didntwant to appear eager to become a death eater he decided to adopt a bookish guise someone more interested in knowledge than power and politics he hoped it might make people view him with less suspicion and not as potentially dangerous he d let couch come up with the idea of him becoming a death eater he d allow himself to be persuaded nagini said crouch stopping before a huge oak door the door swung outwards and crouch entered a large room motioning rick to follow him the ravenclaw common room looked more like a library with large bookshelves covering two of the walls there were several comfortable looking couches and armchairs around a blazing fire but most of the room was given over to study tables adding to the library like atmosphere weasley called crouch to a redheaded boy pouring over a book at one of the desks come here rick had to struggle to suppress a smile and his great happiness as he recognised the familiar face of ron weasley weasley this is godfry said crouch he a new sixth year student he ll be in your dormitory take him up and show him around will you yes professor certainly said ron in a dull obedient voice crouch turned and left without another word follow me said ron in a neutral tone there were quite a few students in the common room as it was a saturday afternoon most of them seemed to be studying while crouch was present they had ignored rick but now he had left some of them looked up at him briefly with guarded looks that gave nothing away there was an atmosphere of wariness and suspicion which you could almost cut with a knife rick noted that the layout of ravenclaw tower was quite similar to gryffindor tower as ron led him to the sixth year boys dormitory there were six beds in the dormitory but only three of them looked occupied so who are the others in the dormitory besides you asked rick trying to engage ron in friendly conversation terry boot and theodore nott replied ron dully those are ours he said flatly indicating three of the beds take your pick from the rest he added turning to leave err r weasley said rick he almost said ron first name before catching himself crouch hadntsaid it and he wasnt supposed to know it so which subjects are you taking he asked trying to be friendly just the standard ones like everyone else replied ron quickly without turning before he exited the dormitory rick picked a bed and lay down despondently he contrasted his present depressed emotions with those of the happiness and euphoria he had felt just a few months earlier when he lay down for the first time on his bed in the gryffindor sixth year boys dormitory but it wasntjust a different dormitory it was an entirely different world he was shocked at how different ron was in this world his legilimency abilities had revealed the true depth of the differences ron was full of fear and suspicion he wasntabout to trust rick or anyone else for that matter they could be spies working for one of the wizarding state secret surveillance organisations or they might just be stupid and careless wanting to mouth off about all the terrible things that were wrong in their world ron knew as well as anyone all the things that were wrong but he knew better than to talk about it if he wanted to survive there were spies everywhere not to mention other magical surveillance devices if you wanted to survive in this world you kept your head down and your mouth shut and you trusted no one rick decided to take a walk around the lake he could pretend for a while at least that this was the wonderful hogwarts of his own world maybe that would lift his spirits a little students he passed looked up at him curiously but then immediately averted their eyes no one was taking any risks he recognised quite a few people like theodore nott and daphne greengrass both sixth year slytherins in his old reality from her slytherin uniform rick could tell that daphne family were part the magistocracy but nott family obviously weren t as he was a ravenclaw rick wondered how many slytherins from his old reality had missed the cut in this one and been relegated to ravenclaw or hufflepuff then he began wondering about the gryffindors he thought about his dorm mates ron of course was in ravenclaw harry and neville had been killed when they were a year old seamus was from a mixed blood family so he probably suffered the same fate along with his family thought rick shaking his head sadly dean thomas he recalled was from a muggle family rick wondered what this evil wizarding world did about muggle born witches and wizards do they seek them out and kill them or are they left alone to occasionally perform accidental magic he wondered rick thoughts gravitated to hermione was she alive in this world if she was what would she be doing what would she be like with all that had happened over the past few hours rick hadntthought about hermione but now he did and his heart ached for her not the hermione of this world if there was one but the hermione of his world his hermione despite his plans to get his wand back and end this loathsome reality it was all becoming more and more distant the present terrible reality was becoming more real and solid in his mind his old reality seemed so far away and so too did his hermione how was he going to find out what happened to the muggle born witches and wizards if everyone was too frightened to talk how was he going to find out anything lost in his unhappy thoughts rick left the path which ran around the lake and headed for the forbidden forest as he entered it he spotted some red hair protruding from behind a large tree walking around the tree he found ginny weasley leaning against the trunk her head in her arms crying excuse me he said softly what the matter why are you crying ginny looked up at rick startled she thought she was well hidden she hadntexpected anyone to come upon her she stayed silent looking down at the ground err allow me to introduce myself i rick godfry i a new sixth year ravenclaw student but ginny remained silent rick decided to use his charm perhaps he could get her to trust him if she told him what was troubling her he might even be able to help and he might be able to learn something about this strange cruel world you can trust me he said to her gently when she looked up at him he managed to hold her gaze i from new zealand there no real wizarding community over there so all of this is new to me i just want to find out how things work around here but no one seems to want to talk or be friendly so err what your name ginny weasley she said in a subdued voice as she quickly wiped away her tears judging from your name and red hair you must be related to ron we re in the same dormitory is he your brother asked rick yes said ginny sadly looking away she wasntvery talkative i see you re in ravenclaw as well which year are you in asked rick my fifth and final year blurted ginny starting to cry once more ginny what the matter why is it your final year at hogwarts why are you crying asked rick sending comforting feelings towards her ginny wiped her eyes again and looked up at rick she seemed to be weighing things up in her mind rick realised that she wanted to confide in him but she had been brought up to trust no one hogwarts she knew was full of spies and you never knew who might report something you said back to the secret security service but she really liked rick and felt she could trust him finally she said i dontknow why i talking to you my mother warned me never to trust anyone outside of the family she said trailing off i so depressed right now i really dont care what happens to me maybe a quick painful death would be better than a long painful life she added bitterly ginny i give you a wizard oath that i wontbetray your trust said rick a fat lot of good that will do said ginny they have ways of breaking a wizard oath and everything else that is decent and honourable you really have no idea what it like here do you rick shook his head slowly no none whatsoever i was hoping that you might tell me but i do know a lot of magic drawing his wand he cast an imperturbable charm and a wizard repelling charm around them that was so we cantbe overheard or noticed just in case anyone should come this way ginny realised that rick must be a very powerful wizard and it made her uneasy powerful wizards usually ended up becoming death eaters or members of the secret security service but deep inside she felt there was something honest and trustworthy about this wizard he seemed so unlike all those evil dark wizards do you know anything about the wizarding breeding and purification program asked ginny spitting out the words with loathing rick shook his head ginny took a deep breath to steady herself and continued it all began about thirteen years ago back in 1984 a few years earlier when the war was over all the enemies of the eternal emperor were killed the squibs muggle borns and all of the mixed blood witches and wizards they were all put to death in the most gruesome ways imaginable she added with a shudder all the purebloods who had opposed the eternal emperor were also killed she added as a tear ran down her cheek i sorry ginny if it painful to talk many pureblood witches and wizards died in the fighting on both sides my father was one of them ginny continued sobbing as she spoke i was less than a year old at the time i donteven remember him i just know how hard it been for my poor mother she was heartbroken when my father died and she had to raise seven of us all by herself ginny dried her eyes determined not to cry anymore when all the killing was over the population of the wizarding world was only a fraction of what it had been before the war there werent enough witches and wizards to do the work and keep things running or to conquer the muggles which is the eternal emperor great plan so they decided they needed a breeding program not just to restore the wizarding world to its previous numbers but to greatly exceed them the eternal emperor great plan is to kill all the muggles and have witches and wizards populate the entire world the aim of the breeding program is to ultimately increase the wizarding population by a thousand fold what gasped rick but surely that will take thousands of years the longer the better muttered ginny under her breath the idea isntjust to increase the population though it to purify it she said darkly purify it asked rick how do you mean well according to what they teach us it in social conformity and obedience classes few if any of the present day pureblood families have one hundred percent pure wizarding blood they went back through all the ancient records and created a complete genealogy of the surviving wizarding families ranking them according to the purity of their bloodlines it all documented in a book called parkinson pureblood genealogy the ten percent of families with the purest blood are called the magistocracy of course families like mine who fought against the eternal emperor are excluded from the magistocracy even if their blood is pure enough there are also rumours that some wealthy families bought their way into the magistocracy and that the rankings have more to do with gold than purity of blood gold is more important here than truth said ginny with disgust coming from an impoverished background it was something she understood all too well when they turn eleven and come to hogwarts the children of the magistocracy automatically go into slytherin continued ginny only males of the magistocracy are allowed to breed all other wizards are magically sterilized rick gulped are they planning on sterilizing me he wondered but hang on he said how is that going to help the population to increase wizards of the magistocracy must marry a witch from the magistocracy as soon as they finish school neither witch nor wizard has any choice in who they marry it all decided by their families based upon how pure their blood is they have to have at least five children but preferably twice that number in addition the wizards have to keep a minimum of ten concubines for breeding some of the very wealthy ones like lucius malfoy have over a hundred the concubines are kept continuously producing children said ginny her voice trembling what that appalling said rick horrified do the witches have any choice in the matter of course not spat ginny most of the new students who come to hogwarts each year get put in hufflepuff the brightest and most magical go to ravenclaw slytherin witches and wizards all stay at hogwarts until seventh year no matter how thick they are hufflepuffs leave after fifth year the wizards are put to work in menial jobs the witches are all forced to become concubines and start having babies immediately that terrible gasped rick shocked at the cruelty and inhumanity of this world what about the ravenclaws the wizards stay until seventh year and then they either join the secret security service work for the ministry of magic or work in trade and commerce most of the witches are forced to leave school after fifth year to become concubines like the hufflepuff witches but those who do especially well in their exams are allowed to remain at school until seventh year then they become concubines said ginny despondently what the point of the extra two years of school then asked rick feeling disgusted at the callous evil of this world after ten or fifteen years when they are too old or unable to bear more children or no longer attractive the wizards throw out their old concubines and replace them with young ones just out of school the ex concubines are forbidden to contact their children or have anything to do with them the children belong to the wizards they re not raised by their natural mothers or even allowed to know who they are so the ex concubines need to work in order to survive if you were a top ravenclaw witch who did sixth and seventh year you might be able to get a better job such as teaching or working at the ministry of magic otherwise only menial jobs such as raising the broods of the wizards of the magistocracy are available to you rick was aghast he expected a world ruled by voldemort to be brutal and cruel but never could he have imagined anything as completely callous and inhumane as this it too horrible to contemplate he said shuddering in disgust i know moaned ginny the reason i was crying when you found me is because i afraid that i not going to do well enough in my exams to stay on at hogwarts next year in the end it doesnt make much difference it just forestalls the inevitable by two years just think this time next year i ll probably be the concubine of some horrible old wizard who beats me and treats me like his slave the only sunshine in my life will be when my babies are born but as soon as they re a few weeks old they ll be taken away from me and i ll never see them again despite her best intentions ginny began crying again rick got up from where he was sitting and sat down next to ginny gently putting his arm around her and sending her comforting feelings he had no idea what to say to ginny he had no words to console her he was now even more determined than ever to end this obscene reality but he couldnttell ginny that so he just comforted her until she stopped crying so do the children of the concubines become part of the magistocracy asked rick no only the children of their pureblood wives are part of the magistocracy the children of concubines go into ravenclaw or hufflepuff and the young witches will themselves become concubines when they leave school after seven generations the blood of those who are not in the magistocracy will be ninety nine percent magistocracy blood they will never be allowed to join the magistocracy but their blood will be purified there is also a hierarchy in the magistocracy said ginny disdainfully those at the top like the malfoys and parkinsons are considered the elite they get first pick of the witches leaving hogwarts each year they prefer ravenclaw witches so that their offspring will be more intelligent and magically powerful when i leave hogwarts i will probably be chosen as the concubine of lucius malfoy or cecil parkinson i dontknow which one of them i loathe the most she said cringing with revulsion what about vol err the eternal emperor asked rick how many concubines does he have surely he must want to produce heirs heirs why on earth would he want heirs asked ginny he supposed to be immortal as far as i know he has no wife concubines or children no i guess not said rick musing if he believes that he immortal he wouldntwant any heirs they would only be a threat to his imperial throne and his precious immortality rick began thinking out loud about the mathematics of the breeding program wizards can sire children to well past the age of one hundred with the aid of potions and spells they might be able to breed for a hundred years after leaving school that means the elite ones who can afford a hundred concubines could father ten thousand children in their lifetime it staggering half the wizarding world will be malfoys and parkinsons said rick appalled at the thought of it that right said ginny in fact that exactly what intended except that the children born to their concubines do not take their name exactly they are called sib whatever sib stands for sired by when you are in the great hall at mealtimes you will notice that most of the students are first years they are the first wave of the children of concubines to enter hogwarts all the first years except for a handful of slytherins are sibs since all other wizards were sterilized thirteen years ago there are heaps of sib malfoys and sib parkinsons and they all look so alike it eerie they re a miserable bunch as well just observe the ones in ravenclaw some time they never knew their mothers and their fathers have absolutely nothing to do with them they ve never known what it feels like to be loved they re raised in special institutions with the children of other wizards i suppose it something like the worst kind of muggle orphanage she said sighing sadly and shaking her head err ginny said rick i heard that squibs are killed as soon as they re born but what about magical children who are born to muggles do you know what happens to them you re right about the squibs answered ginny you wouldntexpect many squibs to be born now given that their fathers are from the magistocracy and have the purest blood but i ve heard that the percentage of squibs has actually gone up not down there have also been more than a few witches of the magistocracy giving birth to squibs although it all hushed up of course it makes you wonder how pure the magistocracy really is but i dontthink they bother about magical children born to muggles they donthave the manpower to find them and deal with them and anyway they pose no threat they ll eventually be killed along with all the other muggles i suppose when the eternal emperor finally carries out his great plan said ginny shuddering at the thought rick couldntthink of anything comforting to say to ginny this world was a nightmare just as snape had said the only thing to do was to put an end to it as quickly as possible there wasntmuch he could do for the miserable ginny in this terrible reality his heart went out to her but all he could do was send her comforting feelings ginny meanwhile was beginning to develop a rather large crush on rick the strange and unfamiliar emotions were wonderful but also unsettling romance was a luxury in this world the prerogative of the magistocracy it was something she had never experienced nor expected to experience she found herself inexplicably attracted to this charming wizard he had somehow penetrated the protective shell she had learned to hide behind and touched her heart with his warmth and sincerity ginny looked up at rick who noticing the strange look she was giving him quickly probed her mind ginny romantic feelings towards him became immediately obvious rick had been using his charm liberally to gain her confidence but clearly there were some unexpected side effects which he should have foreseen rick began thinking frantically of a way out of the situation he had got himself into without hurting ginny she already had more than enough pain and suffering in her life err ginny said rick err i really like you you re a really lovely witch but err the thing is you see err i have a girlfriend back home and well i sorry but i d really like to be your friend if you d let me ginny gave a sad disappointed smile and looked downwards she was all too used to life disappointing her she knew better than to expect happiness from this world it ok i understand she sighed sadly i d like to be your friend rick but it wouldntbe a good idea to be open about it there are spies everywhere and the authorities discourage friendship our allegiance is supposed to be exclusively to the eternal emperor and the magistocracy friendship between witches who will become someone concubine and wizards is particularly discouraged so please be discrete ginny sombrely rose to her feet brushing some leaves and twigs from her robes i should really get going i have heaps of homework to do please wait a few minutes before coming out of the forest someone may be watching you really have to be very careful around here she said smiling sadly at him before walking off towards the castle rick felt terribly sad for ginny just like the ginny his old reality she was a lovely person but in this world she had no hope of happiness she had nothing to look forward to but suffering and misery rick sat lost in thought trying to process all the terrible information he had learnt from ginny the more he got to know this world the more he hated it rick contrasted this world with the little he knew of the future world of the year 2000 which he had visited with harry voldemort was the undisputed master of both worlds his enemies plus all the squibs and muggle born witches and wizards had been killed in both but in this world the mixed blood witches and wizards had also been killed not just enslaved this world seemed better organised and more insidious with its magistocracy and its wizarding breeding and purification program although rick didntknow as much about the future world of the year 2000 on the face of it the two regimes were quite different he wondered why that was maybe it was because voldemort had ruled this world for fifteen years whereas he had only ruled the future world of 2000 for three perhaps it was because this voldemort had not suffered the dissolution of his body and the years of suffering before the creation of a new one in the graveyard at little hangleton perhaps it was because this voldemort had destroyed harry potter as a baby and laid the prophecy to rest whereas the prophecy still hung over the voldemort of the future who seemed obsessed with fear that harry potter would one day rob him of his precious immortality rick musing was interrupted by something moving on the ground a large beetle crawled out from under the leaves at the base of the tree ginny had been leaning against and took flight could it be another animagus spy rick asked himself he closed his eyes and projected a magical map of the vicinity a name jumped out at him rita skeeter it was obvious from her trajectory that she was heading for hogsmeade to transform and apparate and almost certainly to report on rick conversation with ginny she had been well within the area enclosed by his imperturbable charm she would have heard everything she was already too far away for him to catch with a summoning charm what could he do he had to stop her if she made it back to her handlers in the secret security service with her scoop rick plans for getting his wand back from voldemort and ending this awful reality would be dashed and ginny weasley was as good as dead rick transformed into a peregrine falcon and headed off at top speed in the direction rita had taken with his powerful falcon eyesight he soon spotted her he pulled in his wings and dived neatly plucking the beetle out of the air with his powerful beak immediately he soared up into the air to discourage rita from trying to escape from him by transforming if she did she would plummet fifty metres to her death rick flew with the beetle in his beak into the forbidden forest coming down in a small clearing hopping onto one foot he gripped the beetle in the claws of his other foot before transforming then he lifted his foot and cast a spell on the beetle forcing it to transform immediately hitting the witch who appeared before him with an immobulus jinx standing before rick like a gaudy statue was a furious blonde witch dressed in garish purple robes and wearing jewelled spectacles she was heavy jawed with thickly pencilled eyebrows her hard face caked in thick make up she looked decidedly out of place amongst the subdued harmony of greens and browns of the forest rick plucked the wand from her hand which was adorned with lethal crimson painted two inch long fingernails and probed her mind as he had expected she was spying for lucius malfoy it seemed that voldemort had no use for a free press or reporters rita flamboyant writing style wasntat all suited to state propaganda which was the total content of the tightly controlled wizarding media so she had drawn on her animagus skills to launch a successful career as a spy for the secret security service rick probed her mind for anything she might know about other spies operating at hogwarts but it seemed that she knew very little apart from the names of a few informers which he carefully noted rick decided to deal with her the same way as he had dealt with peter pettigrew squibbus finite incantatum he said throwing her wand back to her crucio she screamed viciously rick just grinned at her crucio she snarled again squibs cantcast spells rita said rick you re wasting your time i just turned you into squib permanently go on try casting some more spells or transforming back into a beetle i think you ll find you can t rita tried every nasty spell she could think of but nothing worked and she couldnttransform either she glared at rick hatefully then she lunged at him with her deadly fingernails rick threw up a barrier which she hit so hard she was knocked to the ground as she lay red faced and winded amongst the fallen leaves on the forest floor she glared up at rick with an expression or unmitigated malevolence rick was surprised that she was keeping silent it didntseem her style he had expected a torrent of abuse he probed her mind again she was furious at what rick had done to her turning her into a detestable squib she was seething with anger and hatred and determined at all costs to get even with him that was why she was keeping quiet if she spoke she would betray her vengeful intentions and she believed be killed before she could take her revenge unlike others whom rick had squibbed rita immediate reaction was not one of fear depression and despair it was one of unfettered fury and vindictiveness all she could think about for the moment was vengeance she was planning to go to lucius malfoy and report the conversation she had overheard between rick and ginny she was going to tell him about all of rick dangerous powers she knew she d be put death as a squib but she didntcare she didntwant to live as a loathsome squib anyway but most of all she wanted to destroy this beastly wizard who had reduced her to this so you re planning to go to malfoy even though you know it means certain death for you asked rick i sorry rita but i cantallow it i ll have to turn you into a beetle permanently i think you ll find this forest a rather pleasant place to live goodbye rita you bloody little but she never finished her curse because rick had transformed her into a beetle it was a perfectly normal beetle it knew nothing about having been a witch named rita skeeter it didnttry to attack rick or to bite him it just opened its wings and flew off apparently quite content with its lot chapter 24 social conformity and obedience when rick entered the great hall the first thing he noticed was that there were only three tables the gryffindor table was gone he made his way to the ravenclaw table and sat down for the evening meal the slytherin table he noticed had been shortened as it needed to accommodate fewer than twenty students there were about forty students at the ravenclaw table and it was obvious that over half of them were first years the hufflepuff table was the most crowded with at least a hundred students the majority of whom also looked to be first years rick noticed that the slytherin table was quite different from the others it was covered with an elegant tablecloth and lit with ornate candelabra it was laid out with a silver service and crystal ware rather than appearing magically the food was served by a host of obsequious house elves the children of the magistocracy appeared to be enjoying a feast while the rest of the students and the teachers at the staff table were eating a rather mundane meal rick had learned the names of some of the student informants from his probe of rita skeeter vitriolic mind theodore nott sitting opposite him and sharing his dormitory was one of them rick was going to have to be very careful as the meal was finishing barty crouch tapped rick on the shoulder come with me godfry he said it was obvious that he didnt intend waiting for rick to finish his lumpy tapioca pudding jumping up rick followed his head of house ominously crouch led rick to the same room where lucius malfoy had ambushed harry a few months ago and a reality away rick was apprehensive and on his guard have i been found out already he worried he closed his eyes for a moment as he walked projecting a magical map of the room there was just one person in the room by the name of evan rosier when they reached the door crouch indicated with a nod of his head that rick should enter the room but did not follow rick cast his reflecting shield just in case as he closed the door behind him rosier was a large balding middle aged wizard with a chubby reddish face he had a grey moustache and goatee beard he didntrise from his armchair as rick entered but gestured to rick to stand in front of him as rick stood uncomfortably before him he was addressed in an arrogant and condescending tone i rosier from the eugenics enforcement agency you re rick godfry from new zealand he said consulting a parchment in his left hand is that correct err yes said rick nervously new zealand is a bit far out of the way and the wizarding community is too sparse for the provisions of the wizarding breeding and purification program to have reached there yet however rest assured we will be extending the program to even the remotest corner of the world in the very near future continued rosier officiously now under the regulations which came into force when the program began in 1984 only we wizards who are classified as belonging to the magistocracy are permitted to breed all other wizards such as yourself must be magically sterilized it wont hurt you wontfeel a thing he pointed his wand at rick and muttered a spell that all he said it done you may go now rick wasntsure if he was expected to thank rosier for sterilizing him or not he just muttered ok and left the room well he was right about one thing thought rick to himself it is painless that pompous pureblood git didntseem to feel a thing when the spell rebounded off my shield and sterilized him his breeding days are over i hope he wontbe too hard on his concubines and blame them when they suddenly stop producing children rick had taken the opportunity to probe rosier mind he picked up some interesting information about the wizarding breeding and purification program apparently it had been opposed at the start by a small group of highly knowledgeable witches and wizards who were familiar with the muggle science known as genetics they had warned that the inevitable result would be serious inbreeding and a lack of genetic diversity the magistocracy itself as well as the offspring of concubines would be affected they predicted an alarming rise in the numbers of squibs and a significant reduction in the overall intelligence and magical ability of the wizarding world these views were very unpopular with the eternal emperor and the magistocracy since none of the witches and wizards raising objections belonged to the magistocracy the problem was neatly resolved to rosier mind by killing the lot of them rick also picked up some of the more interesting spells which were rosier stock in trade rick quickly learned to keep his head down and his face expressionless just like everyone else with his excellent legilimency skills he managed to stay out of trouble and avoid suspicion he had no difficulty identifying the many spies amongst the teachers and his fellow students who reported to lucius malfoy secret security service snape had been right about the standard of the classes most of them seemed well behind the sixth year ones in his old reality mostly the classes were just plain boring but there was one class that rick hated and loathed with passion it was social conformity and obedience it was taught most appropriately it seemed to rick by professor dolores umbridge she was right in her element trotting out the vile state propaganda the object of the class was indoctrination there was no discussion debate or evaluation of the racist elitist ideology they were taught parrot fashion all that was expected of them was to memorize the content of their textbooks and believe it rick had no problem with the first part and umbridge considered him a model student because he was able to regurgitate verbatim in their frequent tests the evil doctrines with which they were relentlessly brainwashed the eternal emperor they were taught was a deity an immortal god of the wizarding world his early life as tom riddle who had been a student at hogwarts was totally obscured his origin as the orphaned son of a muggle father was completely concealed even the name lord voldemort was never mentioned it seemed that tom riddle had re invented himself and the truth yet again according to the official mythology the eternal emperor was sent by the spirits of the great wizards of antiquity led by salazar slytherin this was supposed to have happened around 1980 he was sent to save the wizarding world from destruction by the apostates who were led by the deluded one albus dumbledore the apostates they were taught were working secretly with the muggles to destroy the wizarding world no explanation was ever offered as to their motivation for wanting to destroy their own world and rick knew better than to ask umbridge for one the evil deluded apostates had allowed the blood of the wizarding race to become dangerously diluted and polluted with muggle blood they allowed loathsome squibs not only to survive but to breed there was no respect for or subservience to the noble families who had scrupulously guarded the purity of their blood they were accorded no honour or preference whatsoever in fact they were treated no better than the vile muggle born witches and wizards who were actively encouraged to join and pollute the wizarding world they were taught about the hierarchy which must be observed and respected at all times the eternal emperor was not part of the hierarchy he was far far above it at the top of the hierarchy was the magistocracy the magistocracy itself was divided into castes there were seven of them the highest caste was known as the noblest families although it consisted of two families only the malfoys and the parkinsons umbridge made them memorize the names of all the noble families of the magistocracy and to which caste they belonged beneath the magistocracy came the children of concubines who were sired by wizards of the magistocracy they were ranked into castes according to the proportion and caste of their magistocracy blood they were collectively known as the serving castes finally came the rest of the pureblood witches and wizards however since the males were sterilized they would soon die out babies were tested for magical ability at birth and squibs were immediately killed the ultimate step in theeternal emperor great scheme for the salvation of the wizarding world was the extermination of the muggles every single last one of them this was called the great salvation because it would never again be possible for the blood of the wizarding race to be diluted or polluted with muggle blood everyone would be purebloods except for the eternal emperor himself thought rick ironically umbridge also extolled the virtues of the wizarding breeding and purification program over many generations it would purify wizarding blood in a century and a half all wizards and witches would have a minimum of ninety nine percent magistocracy blood which was the only blood deemed sufficiently pure but more than that the breeding program would greatly increase the population of the wizarding world in a single generation it would overcome the current manpower shortage in a few more generations it would produce the manpower necessary to finally destroy the muggles the wizarding world led by the eternal emperor and the revered magistocracy would possess the entire world since blood was everything they were taught the importance of respecting and showing subservience to those of purer blood the magistocracy held a position of great privilege there were a number of spells known as the restricted curses which could only be used by the magistocracy and then only by those of a higher caste upon those of a lower caste or of course upon anyone beneath the magistocracy in the hierarchy the restricted curses included the three unforgivables from rick reality along with a number of equally nasty curses that were completely new to him voldemort must have created them since coming to power in this reality rick guessed now he understood why everyone teachers included treated the slytherins with such obsequiousness and deference although they were not supposed to use the restricted curses until they came of age which was when they left school and married they were a law unto themselves and seemed to do pretty much as they pleased rick tried to keep well away from the slytherins despite the fact that snape had told him he would need to cultivate draco malfoy or pansy parkinson if he wanted to be initiated as a death eater it soon became obvious that it was going to have to be pansy because draco very quickly took a distinct dislike to him it all began in their dark arts and duelling classes draco was the star dueller in the school mainly due to the special tutoring his father had provided for him since childhood draco of course believed it was due to the purity of his blood in this world magical power was believed to derive from the purity of one blood if rick had thought that the draco malfoy in his reality was an arrogant conceited git the one in this world was far worse everyone teachers included treated him like a little god rick knew he had to impress barty crouch their dark arts and duelling professor with his ability after only a few classes crouch was impressed very impressed so impressed in fact that he decided to pair rick up with draco whenever they were practicing with partners rick wasntsure whether respecting and showing subservience to those of purer blood as they were taught by umbridge required him to let malfoy beat him rick really didnt like draco and he was damned if he was going to take a dive and let him win besides he needed to impress crouch rick was careful to maintain a subservient and respectful demeanour towards draco but nevertheless he beat him every time draco became furious he began cheating using charms and curses they werentsupposed to be practicing or even know about rick could read draco mind which made it easy to block or neutralise whatever means draco was using to cheat he was careful however not to use his reflecting shield he wanted to keep it a secret finally in one class draco became so furious at his inability to defeat rick by fair means or foul that he stormed out of the class in a huff that was the last time barty crouch paired draco with rick obviously draco had made it clear to crouch that he would not have rick as his practice partner again despite the fact that rick disliked crouch the dark arts and duelling professor took a shine to him one monday afternoon he asked rick to stay behind after class take a seat godfry he said you re the best dueller i ve ever encountered at your age i was most impressed with the way you bested young malfoy what did you say you wanted to do after you finished school err i was thinking about studying some more sir and perhaps becoming a teacher said rick in an uncertain voice well you re bright enough replied crouch i understand you re top in all your classes not that they re very difficult these days when i was a student here the standard was much higher but the point is i ve already made a mandatory recommendation for you to the secret security service mandatory recommendations are rare but in your case i feel it warranted it means that not only can you join the secret security service you must join a wizard with your power is too valuable an asset not to be used for the benefit of state security also we dontlike having wizards as powerful as you out there somewhere where we cantkeep an eye on them we like to know what they re up to when you join the secret security service after you finish school they ll be able to keep tabs on you err thank you sir said rick i d never thought about working in the secret security service but i think i might like it of course you ll like it said crouch gruffly what we teach here at school is all watered down kids stuff we dontteach the really powerful nasty magic because we dontwant anyone but the secret security service to know how to use it you understand with your ability you ll really lap up what they teach you there i d also like to put in a recommendation for you to become a death eater what do you think of that asked crouch as if he d just offered rick his most cherished dream i didntknow it was possible said rick err what does it involve well it not like a job some are even fortunate enough to join while they are still at school most death eaters are members of the secret security service but not all i a death eater he said proudly pushing up the sleeve of his left arm to reveal the dark mark burned into the skin just below the elbow becoming a death eater is joining a very elite and exclusive club it the only prestigious position that the likes of you and me who arent in the magistocracy can ever hope to achieve you see the death eaters are the eternal emperor personal guard to serve our eternal emperor the saviour of the wizarding world is the greatest privilege we donttake our orders from the ministry of magic or even the secret security service we are answerable only to the eternal emperor himself i going to owl through my recommendation today i one of a small number of death eaters who are qualified to make recommendations once your name is lodged you wait to receive your invitation only a handful of nominees get inducted each year so it just a matter of waiting for your name to come up it can take anything from a few months to a few years if you know the right people of course you can speed things up you re at a bit of a disadvantage there godfry thank you for your recommendation sir i really appreciate it said rick he found it easy to appear grateful because in fact he was he desperately wanted to be initiated as a death eater although not for any of the reasons that crouch might have imagined yes i imagine you are replied crouch with an evil grin it a lot of fun being a death eater wizards like you and me who arent in the magistocracy get the opportunity to use the restricted curses i bet professor umbridge didntteach you that she wouldntknow never having been a death eater or a member of the secret security service yeah we re having a bit of a rumble this weekend we re going to kill ourselves a whole bunch of muggles i cantreally tell you anything about it it all hush hush of course we re going to make it look like an accident until the wizarding breeding and purification program really starts to kick in and we have the numbers to take on the muggles we dont want them to know anything about us in fact that what the operation this weekend is about it a bunch of hippies and whatnots playing at being witches and wizards although who knows some of them might have some magical power occasionally you get a muggle without a drop of magical blood in them that can do magic when i was a student here they were allowed to come to hogwarts the disgusting mudbloods you dontknow how lucky you are being spared all of that having to associate with that kind of filth rick just nodded in agreement he had been probing crouch mind to find out more about the death eater operation there was some group called the stonehenge wiccans who were having a meeting on the coming sunday afternoon the death eaters were going to wait until the meeting had begun and then apparate to the meeting hall they were planning to torture the muggles for fun using the cruciatus curse and other restricted curses then they would blow up the hall killing everyone inside the muggle authorities would think it was the work of the ira or some other terrorist group as he made his way back to ravenclaw tower rick wondered whether he should try to intervene to stop the terrible attack that was planned upon the innocent muggles on the one hand it seemed like the right thing to do but on the other there was so much evil in this wicked world that he feared he would become side tracked putting on band aids here and there no he had to focus on his key task which was to bring this whole hideous reality to an end getting side tracked only risked exposing himself and jeopardising his key mission there was no point in trying to re arrange the deck chairs on this titanic the only thing to do was to sink it and fast as he walked along rick projected his magical map it had become a habit in this reality there were spies everywhere he was also worried that draco malfoy might be planning to ambush and attack him to pay him back for constantly besting him in their dark arts and duelling classes as he passed a disused classroom he saw the name ginny weasley all alone inside on his magical map that strange thought rick i wonder if she ok he easily overcame the locking charm on the door and entered ginny was sitting huddled in a corner of the classroom crying her eyes out she was so absorbed in her misery that she didnteven notice rick until he sat down beside her he put his own locking charm on the door and cast an imperturbable charm on the room he put his arm around ginny shoulder and gave her a gentle hug sending comforting feelings towards her she was so distraught that she didnteven ask him how he d found her or managed to get into the classroom ginny what wrong asked rick gently why are you crying without saying a word she thrust a tear soaked parchment towards him rick opened it and began reading silently weasley you are required in my chambers on saturday night be waiting at the entrance to the apartments of the noblest at 8pm it will be my pleasure to prepare you for your future vocation as a concubine of the magistocracy draco malfoy rick didntknow what to say to ginny the intent of the message was all too obvious what happens if you dontgo asked rick he ll send a couple of his thugs to find me she cried they ll stun me and drag me off to malfoy then he ll put me under the imperius curse and do exactly as he wants with me it happens all too often to the older more attractive hufflepuff and ravenclaw witches she sobbed the wizards of the magistocracy can do exactly as they like with us no one dares to challenge them no matter what evil they do and draco malfoy is the worst of them by far ginny broke down sobbing uncontrollably despite his best intentions not to get involved in the affairs of this world rick couldnthelp himself dontworry ginny he said i ll sort out draco bloody malfoy he wontbe bothering you i ll see to it no gasped ginny dontbe crazy you dontunderstand how it is here you ll just get yourself killed please rick just leave it it my fate there nothing that you or anyone can do to save me from it i just hoped to have a bit more time a few more years before i had to face the inevitable she said bursting into tears again ginny it will be ok i promise you you ll be getting another message from malfoy soon telling you not to bother coming i canttell you how i going to do it but i know a way i wontbe putting myself in any danger at all just promise me that you wont mention this conversation ok dont worry said ginny with a sad sigh i know better than to talk to anyone about anything in this place but please be careful rick donttake any chances please after leaving the classroom rick ducked into an alcove and made himself invisible before apparating to the apartments of the noblest it was in fact the old gryffindor common room which had been divided down the middle into two luxurious apartments for the heirs of the wizarding world noblest families rick was standing in draco malfoy apartment it oozed opulence and luxury but rick wasntinterested in finding out how the magistocracy lived draco was sprawled comfortably in an enormous throne like chair he was idly thumbing through a book and sipping occasionally from a golden goblet when rick probed evan rosier mind on the night that rosier had attempted to sterilize him rick had discovered some very interesting and very secret spells spells which were known only to a handful of wizards in the eugenics enforcement agency one was the sterilization spell with which rosier had inadvertently sterilized himself the sterilization spell did not stop a wizard from being attracted to witches but it made him infertile so he could not produce children there was another spell which rick discovered in evan rosier mind called the impotence spell it worked quite differently any wizard upon whom it was cast would not only lose all interest in witches but he would also lose the ability to mate permanently this was the spell which rick cast on draco ginny weasley and all the other hogwarts witches were now safe from draco malfoy rick had considered using the squibbus curse on draco but the consequence of that would have been evident to all and would have caused a furore rick might have been interrogated by the secret security service simply because he was new at hogwarts they might have investigated his purported origins in new zealand no the impotence spell would solve the immediate threat to ginny without precipitating an investigation rick was certain that draco would keep very quiet about his impotence problem it was his destiny and his duty under the wizarding breeding and purification program to sire thousands of children an impotent wizard in the magistocracy was like a fire fighter without a hose utterly useless no draco will keep very quiet about his problem thought rick he still has a year and a half before he begins breeding at first he ll hope it just something temporary then he ll start secretly researching potency spells and potions hoping to find a cure before crunch time comes he ll be too scared to tell his father or anyone else the shame would be unbearable rick had briefly entertained the idea of casting the impotence spell on all the slytherin wizards draco wasntthe only one abusing the hufflepuff and ravenclaw witches although he was the worst but much as he wanted to rick knew it would be too risky one or other of the wizards might mention something casually or notice that his friends had also lost interest in witches if they started talking among themselves they would soon realise they all had the same problem and guess that someone had done something to them it would very quickly be out in the open and cause an enormous scandal there would be a massive investigation rick couldntrisk it so he had to content himself with saving ginny from draco there was just too much evil in this world he had to get to the root of it and destroy the whole evil reality on thursday evening as rick was sitting in the ravenclaw common room ginny sat down opposite him at the table when he looked up she quickly smiled at him and mouthed the word thanks rick checked that they werentbeing observed and gave ginny a quick smile obviously draco had informed her that she was no longer required to visit him this saturday evening after all but it wasntsaturday evening that had been occupying rick thoughts of late it was sunday afternoon rick had been having an ongoing argument with himself since monday when crouch had told him about the intended attack on the stonehenge wiccans rick knew that his one and only goal had to be getting initiated as a death eater so he could get his wand back from voldemort and end this whole evil reality but somehow when he thought about innocent people suffering he couldnthelp himself but is that really the only reason i want to go to that meeting he asked himself is it just to save those innocent people or is there something more to it like the possibility that there might be some muggle born witches and wizards there or more to the point a certain muggle born witch by the name of hermione granger rick thoughts were interrupted by a large silvery owl which landed on the desk in front of him it gave him a haughty look and extended a leg arrogantly towards him as rick took the parchment he noticed a look of alarm on ginny face she obviously knew whose owl it was rick had no idea but it seemed likely that others in the common room would know as well and be secretly watching for his reaction when he read the parchment knowing he wasntvery good at hiding his emotions rick decided to take it up to his dormitory and read it there he drew the hangings around his four poster bed before removing the silver grey ribbon from the parchment and opening it a small brooch fell out landing on his bed rick inspected it carefully without touching it the motif on the brooch was two intertwined serpents one silver the other green very slytherin he thought to himself he read the message to mr rick godfry your attendance is requested in my apartment this evening at nine o clock for reasons which i will explain no one must know of your visit or of this invitation the enclosed brooch is a portkey which will be activated at exactly nine o clock pansy parkinson when he had finished reading it the parchment burst into flames rick smiled to himself he had been surreptitiously giving pansy the charm treatment for the past couple of weeks ever since it became evident that there was no chance of cultivating draco he had no idea how to cultivate pansy in this hierarchical caste ridden society the magistocracy treated wizards like him with utter disdain as something far beneath them he knew there was no way a wizard in his position could ever approach a witch of the magistocracy particularly pansy all he could do was keep up the charm and hope she would make the first move it looked like it might just have worked at exactly nine o clock rick picked up the brooch and felt himself being whisked away from his dormitory a moment later he arrived unsteadily in pansy apartment it was the other half of the gryffindor common room from the one he had invisibly visited a few days earlier to cast the impotence spell on draco pansy was reclining elegantly on a chaise lounge she was dressed exquisitely in pale pink robes and wore enough diamonds and gold to stock a small jeweller shop would you care for a sherry she asked waving her hand casually towards a table where rick found a crystal sherry decanter and two crystal glasses on a polished silver tray he poured them each a sherry handing a glass to pansy before sitting down on a nearby chair he was well aware that he was expected to wait subserviently for pansy to invite him to sit but he wasntgoing to play her games with his legilimency skills he was well aware of pansy feelings towards him he waited patiently for her to speak she took a slow languid sip from her sherry before setting it down on a small table to her right you may be wondering she began why i wanted to talk with you well i not going to beat about the bush i imagine by now you have a good understanding of our wizarding society and how things work i imagine it all seems a little strange to you coming from overseas it certainly does said rick with a faint smile continuing to use his charm well i dontknow what you think about our wizarding breeding and purification program but i think it stinks she said angrily rick was completely taken aback it was the last thing he would have expected pansy to say oh dontworry said pansy reassuringly there are no hidden spies or listening spells in my apartment daddy makes sure of that if there were i wouldnthave invited you here she said with a sly grin that blasted breeding program it so outrageously unfair she continued passionately we witches in the magistocracy absolutely loathe it it not hard to tell that the whole contemptible thing was cooked up by the wizards without us witches even knowing what it was all about until it was too late and it had already been enacted it completely unjust to the witches of the magistocracy complained pansy bitterly i suppose you know that i betrothed to draco malfoy in a year and a half when we finish school i shall have to marry him because my father and his father decided it they didntask me if i wanted to marry that self centred pretentious little poseur then i expected to become a bloody baby factory for him damned draco expects me to bear him at least eight children can you imagine what that will do to my beautiful figure she asked woefully not that draco will care he ll have his blasted concubines he planning on keeping a hundred and twenty of them when i old and worn out at fifty he ll be picking out pretty young sixteen year old witches to replace his old concubines hell he ll still be doing it when i a hundred is that fair to me i ask you she demanded in outrage rick really felt like saying that it was a lot more unfair to the concubines than it was to pansy but she didntseem interested in anyone else misfortunes even though they were far greater than her own rick just nodded sympathetically although it was for ginny and all the other witches in her situation that he felt sympathy not pansy and the pampered witches of the magistocracy i guess there not much you can do about it said rick trying to sound sympathetic it the law after all no there nothing i can do about that blasted law it true said pansy angrily even the magistocracy have to abide by all these stupid laws or at least make sure they re not caught breaking them she said with a smirk no i ll have to marry draco and have his beastly babies i resigned to that but while he off playing with his concubines i intend having some fun of my own what good for the goose is good for the gander or more to the point what good for the gander is good for the goose said pansy with smug grin on her face err what do you mean asked rick what i mean said pansy defiantly is that if bloody draco can have his concubines then i can have my gigolos she was looking at rick with a very self satisfied grin on her face err is it err permitted asked rick nervously of course not laughed pansy but that hasntstopped a good many witches of the magistocracy from taking lovers narcissa malfoy is rumoured to have a steady stream of young handsome beaux and who could blame her when you look at that slimy creepy husband of hers doesnt lucius malfoy know that she err making a prize cuckold of him asked pansy laughing wickedly as long as it doesntget out he probably couldntcare less do you think he cares about his old wife when he has so many young beautiful concubines at his beck and call come off it obviously the witches of the magistocracy know exactly what going on what do you think they talk about all day long each other dalliances of course as long as it kept quiet and doesnt get any further there no problem at all appearances are what count here not realities but where are the beaux from the magistocracy asked rick confused of course not said pansy snorting derisively the wizards of the magistocracy are all a bunch of prize peacocks anyway they have their hands full with their concubines and they re not sterilized so it wouldntbe safe breeding and bloodlines are taken extremely seriously here newborn babies are very scrupulously checked their paternity is easily established by magical means it wouldntdo at all for a magistocracy witch to bear the child of the wrong wizard then all of these beaux who arent magistocracy must also know what going on said rick well of course they do laughed pansy but they d be the last ones to talk about it i mean if an indiscretion were to get out it would be far worse for the wizard than the witch err how bad asked rick nervously would he be killed i dontknow said pansy shrugging her shoulders carelessly obviously it was of no concern to her i suppose it might depend upon how well connected he was anyway she said looking rick directly in the eye no one is going to discover us us exclaimed rick gulping yes us she said smiling seductively at rick why do you think i invited you to visit me i hadntplanned on beginning my career as a seductress of handsome young wizards until after i was married for one thing there arentany here at hogwarts that appeal to me or at least there werent until you turned up from what i ve been hearing lately draco been having his way with some of the hufflepuff and ravenclaw witches i damned if i going to let that little git get one up on me so i ve decided to begin my career in the boudoir a little sooner than planned and i cantthink of a nicer way to start than with you she added with another seductive smirk rick mind was whirring away desperately searching for a way to avoid pansy amorous plans he couldnttell her that she had nothing to worry about that draco wouldntbe getting one up on her or anyone that draco would not be having his way with any hufflepuff or ravenclaw witches or any other witches for that matter ever again eventually rick hit upon a way to use the situation to promote his own plans he smiled at pansy using a liberal amount of charm it a great privilege pansy to be chosen by you you re a devastatingly beautiful witch but well the idea of us err you know err kind of scares me i mean it not that i dontwant to i do but i new here and i dontknow anyone i donthave any connections if we were found out it would be the end of me for sure draco already hates me he certainly does laughed pansy you have no idea how unbearable he was when you kept beating him in dark arts and duelling although now he just pretends it never happened and that he the greatest dueller at hogwarts i just go along with his little self delusions i find it best to just humour him but he been in an unbearably foul mood the last few days i have no idea what the matter with him but rick did dont worry so much said pansy getting back to the main topic on her agenda no one will find out about us and if they do daddy got loads of influence he the minister of magic you know he ll be able to pull some strings err pansy said rick sounding worried if we get discovered i probably have more to fear from your father than from draco or anyone else the only strings your father is likely to pull are ones that are tied firmly around my neck oh dear how silly of me i hadntthought of that giggled pansy it was obvious to rick that she wasntconsidering his safety at all it didntreally concern her after all he was just an expendable commodity i have an idea said rick professor crouch has put in a recommendation for me to become a death eater wonderful cried pansy if you were a death eater you d have plenty of protection even if we were discovered no one would be able to touch you neither my father nor draco the eternal emperor protects his own yeah that right said rick that what i was thinking once i a death eater i ll be safe then we can you know but i want to wait till then it will be too risky for me until i initiated unfortunately professor crouch thinks it could take a long time for my name to come up years perhaps because i donthave any connections you know people in high places who could speed things up for me oh but you do now said pansy smugly you ve got me and i can get daddy dear to do whatever i want draco and i are both being initiated as death eaters in a couple of weeks we re not really going to be proper death eaters mind you we wonthave to do all the study and training they do it really just an honorary initiation once we re married we ll be the royal family of the wizarding world you know so naturally we need to be death eaters she said haughtily our initiation is going to be a huge event everyone who anyone in the wizarding world will be there i sure if i asked daddy to speed up your invitation so you can be initiated at the same time he ll be more than happy to oblige his darling daughter said pansy smiling with self satisfaction that would be wonderful pansy said rick turning on the charm to further encourage her after i initiated i ll be able to come and visit you in your boudoir whenever you like he said smiling charmingly i ll send daddy an owl right away said pansy i can hardly wait please take a few moments to leave a review chapter 25 the stonehenge wiccans sunday afternoon found rick taking a walk in the forbidden forest or at least that was his alibi in case anyone asked where he had been despite all his best intentions not to get involved in the affairs of this world but rather stay focussed on bringing it to an end he was going to the meeting which the death eaters were planning to turn into a torture session and a bloodbath rick had considered apparating to the headmaster office and seeking his advice on what he should do but professor snape had kept his distance from rick since that first eventful day when he had apparated to the headmaster office only to discover that snape and not dumbledore was hogwarts headmaster snape knew a good deal more than rick about this world and obviously thought it safer for them to ignore each other there were spies everywhere even in the headmaster office so rick was left to make the decision by himself as soon as he was well into the forest he used his metamorphmagus skills to disguise himself as neville longbottom who had been killed as a baby in this world and wouldntbe recognised then he apparated invisibly to the london street where the meeting hall was located rick found a toilet where he made himself visible before entering the small hall he found a seat towards the back from where he was fairly inconspicuous and could observe what was happening the meeting had not yet begun there were eighty to ninety people mostly standing about in groups laughing and chatting many of them wore strange clothes and looked like they were out of some medieval painting a few even wore robes and pointy hats most of them were in their thirties forties and fifties rick noticed a few younger ones closer to his own age and even some small children who were running excitedly up and down the aisles he spent several minutes carefully scrutinising everyone in the hall but he didnt recognise a soul he d had a hunch well a desperate hope really if he was being honest with himself that hermione would be here she wasn t and he was bitterly disappointed people began sitting down as the meeting was about to begin out of the corner of his eye rick saw someone enter and sit down towards the back on the other side of the hall it was someone who looked very familiar someone who looked like hermione thought rick his heart began beating furiously it was less than a month since he had seen her but he missed her terribly he had to remind himself that although it was hermione she didntknow him she probably didnteven know she was a witch she wasntdressed up in weird clothes like most of the others she didntappear to know any of them she sat by herself looking about curiously at all the strange people righty ho then said a tall man dressed up in medieval garb jumping athletically up onto the stage it bout time we got started i robbie for those of you who dontknow me and i chief wicca of the stonehenge wiccans now what we re here for today is to finalise the plans for our annual spring equinox festival which will be happening at stonehenge in a couple of weeks we want to make it bigger and better than ever this year the key strategy which we re going to sort out this afternoon is how to get the tv cameras there we want to get the festival covered on prime time news so we can get our message across to as many people as possible that magic really does exist now what i propose but they never found out what he was going to propose because at that moment eight black robed masked death eaters appeared on the stage from nowhere there was a collective gasp from the audience who had no idea what was happening the death eaters flicked their wands at the four exits slamming the doors shut and locking them one of them flicked his wand at robbie sending him flying from the stage onto the people sitting in the front row sonorus said one of the death eaters stepping forward it was barty crouch rick recognised his cruel cold voice there been a change of plan you re not going to be getting any messages across there certainly is magic but none of you lot have a clue about it real magic comes from magical blood and those of us who have it intend to keep it secret since you re all so interested in magic we re going to give you a taste of real magic before we kill the lot of you he sneered a gasp of horror rose from the audience those near the aisles made a desperate dash for the exits only to find them firmly locked the eight death eaters now pointed their wands threateningly at the audience cruc they began but before they could finish a loud voice boomed out squibbus the surprised death eaters looked about frantically for the source of the booming voice and the sudden chill that permeated the hall the audience already utterly confused and terrified had no idea what was happening unfortunately for you death eaters there has been yet another change of plan said the ethereal voice which seemed to fill the hall and yet come from nowhere in particular i suggest you stop pointing your wands around and attempting to curse these good people you re wasting your time you know i ve just squibbed the lot of you yes squibbed as in turned you ex death eaters into squibs i sure you know what squibs are and what happens to them you had better leave now and hide not from these good folk but from your fellow death eaters and the secret security service goodbye squibs one of the doors suddenly opened and the dazed death eaters were unceremoniously bundled out of the hall the door slammed shut behind them the astonished people looked around fearfully what on earth was going on please relax everyone said the disembodied voice in a warm friendly tone you are all perfectly safe now i locked the doors again because i have a most important message for you one which i wish you all to hear before you leave who or what are you asked robbie nervously he was standing in front of the stage looking about wildly not knowing in which direction to address his question i am the spirit of a great wizard of yore i have come here today to prevent those evil wizards from torturing and killing you what they said however was partly correct there is magic as you folk apparently believe in fact there is a whole magical world of witches and wizards who keep themselves hidden from other people but it is unfortunately ruled at this time by a very wicked wizard who hates all non magical folk this evil wizard does not want ordinary people to know about magic he wants to keep the magical world secret your group has come to his attention because you want everyone to know about magic not only is he terribly evil he is also enormously powerful i cannot protect you from him again i can only advise you in the strongest terms to disband your group forthwith and forget all about magic if you do not you will surely be killed please take my sincere warning to heart adieu the doors suddenly sprang open and the strange chill was gone everyone was talking at once about the extraordinary visitation some of the people got up hurriedly and quickly left others stayed talking and arguing excitedly rick noticed hermione leaving and followed her out of the hall he knew he should just let her go and get back to school but he couldnt he had to talk to her rick followed her quietly in the weak sunshine of the chilly london afternoon err excuse me he said approaching her a couple of blocks away from the hall she turned and looked at him suspiciously for a moment before turning back and quickening her pace damn it he thought she thinks i trying to pick her up i i just wanted to ask you what you thought about what happened back there at that meeting said rick drawing alongside her and using his charm i donttalk to strangers especially ones that belong to crackpot groups like that one now please go away and leave me alone she said forcefully please wait said rick using all his charm to stop her running away hermione stopped and stared at him why are you following me she demanded are you some kind of stalker no said rick i not a stalker honest and i not a member of the stonehenge wiccans either i just wanted to ask you what you thought about that meeting all the time he was pouring on the charm and it was obviously starting to have an effect well if you really must know i thought the meeting was a load of nonsense said hermione disparagingly i ve never been to one of those meetings before i only went out of curiosity to find out what it was all about i thought all the theatrics with those men in black and the ghost were quite absurd i mean it was pretty obviously all part of some choreographed performance intended to convince the gullible that there is magic and ghosts and all the other ridiculous nonsense those wacky people believe in so you dontbelieve in magic asked rick of course not said hermione although she sounded a little less certain of herself what if i could prove to you that magic exists asked rick keeping up the charm but you can t protested hermione because it doesn t you dontsound so sure of yourself said rick probing her mind she was in fact extremely confused about magic as he suspected hermione had occasionally performed accidental magic when she was angry or experiencing other intense emotions magic was the only conceivable explanation for what she had herself witnessed firsthand but she simply refused to accept it it was diametrically opposed to her scientific world view nevertheless there was doubt in her mind it was that doubt which had drawn her to the meeting this afternoon could we just cross the road and sit down for a few minutes in that park over there asked rick indicating the large public park on the other side of the road if you just give me a few minutes i can prove to you empirically beyond doubt that magic does exist said rick ramping up the charm this is most unusual said hermione hesitantly i dontmake a habit of going to parks with strange boys her desire to know if rick could in deed prove the existence of magic overcame her scepticism rick probed her mind and could tell he had sparked her insatiable appetite for knowledge i suppose a public park should be safe enough she said finally for all her rational objections to magic she had experienced too many strange things in her life her scientific mind demanded an explanation which she was unable to find in her extensive research on the subject she doubted rick would be able to offer her empirical evidence of the existence of magic but she was so curious that she couldntpass up the opportunity and unaccountably she found herself strongly attracted to this stranger they sat down on a secluded bench at some distance from the many adults and children enjoying the park on a sunny winter sunday afternoon ok said hermione you have one minute starting now or i leave rick cast a muggle repelling charm as well as an imperturbable charm around them so they would neither be noticed nor overheard you re not giving me time to explain things first or to take things slowly i sorry but you may find this a little scary please dontpanic look at me said rick hermione was utterly stunned as rick transformed from neville longbottom into rick godfry please dontscream it just magic he said smiling at her hermione did scream but due to the imperturbable charm no one heard her but rick she leapt to her feet to run away but rick raised a hand and she was gently but firmly forced back down onto bench calm down said rick take a few deep breaths you are perfectly safe you are in no danger but it wasnther physical safety that hermione was afraid for it was her sanity she sat with one hand over her mouth her mind desperately attempting to re group into some semblance of a coherent world view after several minutes of stunned silence she asked in a shaky voice who or what are you i rick godfry and this is what i really look like i disguised myself for that meeting oh and i a wizard and you hermione are a witch me a witch what do you mean and how do you know my name asked hermione feeling very confused yes hermione you are a witch and a very powerful one said rick ignoring her interruption with a voice of calm certainty i sure strange things have sometimes happened when you ve been very angry or upset or perhaps very happy it called accidental magic what i said in that hall about the magical world being ruled by a wicked wizard is perfectly true you should what you said exclaimed hermione what are you talking about what you saw in that hall was no charade it was all deadly serious said rick looking at hermione gravely those people who suddenly appeared on the stage the ones dressed all in black are called death eaters they were about to torture the people in the hall and then blow it up killing everyone inside including you the one who spoke was one of my teachers from school a school of magic i found out what they were planning to do and decided to try to save the people at the meeting there was no ghost of course i used magic to pretend to be a ghost and i cast a spell on the death eaters which destroyed their magic to stop them torturing and murdering everyone but that just too far fetched said hermione incredulously i i cantbelieve it do some more magic i want to believe you but it all so unbelievable rick looked around to make sure his muggle repelling charm was working and that no one was watching then he made himself invisible do you believe me now hermione he said in his ghostly voice hermione put out her hand then gasped and instinctively pulled it away as she touched rick yes ok i suppose i have to please come back but when rick re appeared he was a grey tabby cat sitting purring on the bench as hermione reached out a tentative hand to pat it the cat turned back into rick oh said hermione pulling her hand away goodness yes i do believe you i mean unless i hallucinating it must be true magic is the only explanation hermione felt giddy as if someone had just turned her whole world upside down her mind was in turmoil so why canti do magic like you if i a witch like you say why canti turn into a cat she asked hesitantly because to do magic you need the innate ability which you have plus you need to learn how to use it when children with magical ability turn eleven they start going to a special school for magic but when voldemort that the name of the evil ruler of the magical world came to power just after you were born he brought in many terrible racist laws one of them was that only the children of so called pureblood magical families could go to the magical school and learn magic that terrible it so unfair said hermione angrily i feel like i ve been cheated of my birthright can you tell me all about the magical world she asked clearly fascinated by this whole new reality which rick had suddenly opened her eyes to rick told hermione about the magical world in this reality about the magistocracy and the wizarding breeding and purification program and about voldemort plan to exterminate the muggles hermione was shocked when he had finished she shivered and said i glad after all that i not a part of that whole wicked world why is the wizarding world so evil you seem very nice well actually sighed rick it my fault in a way why asked hermione rick didntseem at all evil to her she found herself liking him a lot it a long story said rick looking sadly down at his feet and sighing not knowing where to start of how to explain it to someone who had only just come to terms with the existence of magic you see fifteen years ago voldemort was supposed to have lost all his powers and to have almost died the world was supposed to have been completely different a much better world than this one but how can you know something like that asked hermione confused how can you say that something was supposed to have happened that the world was supposed to be different that makes no sense at all i know how the world was supposed to be hermione said rick sighing sadly you see i lived in that world until just a few weeks ago what on earth do you mean you re not making any sense at all said hermione completely mystified a few weeks ago began rick no wait that not best the place to start ok fifteen years ago this evil wizard voldemort tried to murder a one year old baby named harry potter he d just murdered the baby parents now at the point where he tries to murder the baby there are two possible things that could happen one is that he succeeds in killing him and then he goes on to become the tyrannical ruler of the wizarding world with all the horrible consequences i ve just told you about that this reality but there another possibility which is that he fails when he tries to kill harry potter his curse rebounds on him destroying his body and almost killing him he disappears from the wizarding world for many years until he finally gets his body back and though he trying to take over the wizarding world he hasntsucceeded yet that wizarding world that reality is a much better place than this one you talk about this other reality as if it was real as if it actually happened said hermione still perplexed it was real until a few weeks ago said rick dejectedly in that world muggle born witches and wizards those born to non wizarding families like you went to hogwarts the magic school when you were eleven you received a letter telling you that you were a witch and inviting you to come to hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry to learn how to use your magical abilities you were in the same year as harry potter the boy that voldemort failed to kill as a baby the two of you were best friends but how why asked hermione getting more and more confused unable to grasp this strange other world but then what happened to this other world how did it change into this one why did it change it all goes back to that night said rick when voldemort tried to kill harry potter in the world i lived in he failed like i said no one really knew why he failed people believed that harry mother put some magical protection on him and that when she sacrificed her own life to save him it became strong enough to protect him from voldemort killing curse the headmaster of my school sent me back in time to watch what happened when sent you back in time interrupted hermione astonished you mean witches and wizards can move about in time yes some can a few but it dangerous you travelled back through time in this other reality but i donthave time to go into that now i m err i an extremely powerful wizard i had the wand of an ancient wizard and with it i could move about in time at will that just amazing said hermione shaking her head from side to side utterly fascinated with the concept of time travel anyway said rick you and the headmaster had this idea me asked hermione intrigued yes you said rick smiling at her you had a lot of brilliant ideas you were the smartest witch in the whole school we had a problem you see we had to find a way of killing voldemort before he managed to take over the magical world and turn it into well into one like this awful reality the problem was that he had a magical cloak that repelled all magical spells and curses and made him invulnerable but you and the headmaster figured that the curse which had rebounded on him and destroyed his body when he tried to kill baby harry probably damaged his protective cloak so the headmaster sent me back to that night to observe exactly where on his body the rebounding curse struck him you mean the spot was some kind of achilles heel asked hermione exactly replied rick the headmaster repeated many times most emphatically that i must not change anything at all you see changing the past is the cardinal sin of time travel even if you try to change something for the better it will almost certainly have the opposite effect and you changed something guessed hermione you changed something which resulted in this voldemort killing harry potter and the good reality you had lived in changing into this nightmare reality is that what happened asked hermione anxiously no said rick shaking his head sadly i didntchange a thing that the whole damn problem i listened to harry parents talking before voldemort arrived and it really didntsound like they d found anything that was going to stop voldemort curse there a very powerful magical spell called the reflecting shield i realised that i could cast it and protect harry and that it would send voldemort curse rebounding back on him exactly as it was supposed to have happened in my reality i started wondering if maybe i was supposed to cast it but that would have been changing the past said hermione thoughtfully and your headmaster said you mustn t exactly said rick as it got closer and closer to the point where voldemort was going to curse harry i became more and more convinced that if i didntcast the reflecting shield harry would be killed and everything would change finally i decided to cast it but just before i did i had an idea i figured that if i did nothing just like the headmaster said and things didntwork out the way they were supposed to then i could always go back again and do it right cast the reflecting shield yes that very clever so what happened asked hermione totally absorbed chewing nervously on her bottom lip the last thing i saw was voldemort casting the killing curse then i was thrown out of the past and back to my own time but when i got back to hogwarts i discovered that everything was different that the reality i had come from had changed into this terrible one all because voldemort had killed harry and survived unscathed so why didntyou go back like you planned and cast the reflecting shield asked hermione because to travel in time i need my special wand and i discovered that in this reality i donthave it voldemort got it said rick dejectedly gosh yes that was the flaw in your plan if reality changed then there was no guarantee that in the new reality you d be able to travel back to that night as you were able to in your old reality you might even have been dead said hermione utterly fascinated by the complexities of time travel yes i can see that now said rick bitterly but in the heat of the moment when i had to make the decision it didntoccur to me but i have a plan to get my wand back from voldemort in a couple of weeks at the equinox if i succeed then i going to fix things because now i know for sure that i was meant to cast the reflecting shield hermione seemed lost in deep thought for a while before completely surprising rick actually i think your headmaster may have been right you really werentmeant to change anything what do you mean demanded rick of course i was in my reality harry had been protected by something it obvious now that it must have been my reflecting shield so i must have gone back in time and protected him if you see what i mean finished rick a bit lamely and unsure of himself yes i do see what you mean said hermione cocking her head thoughtfully to one side if time travel is possible and from what you say it certainly seems to be then if someone goes back in time and does something then that event has always happened just like every other event that has happened err yeah said rick not quite able to keep up with hermione but why did you say that i wasntmeant to cast the reflecting shield because you didnt obviously said hermione but it wasntat all obvious to rick but i must have or otherwise harry wouldnthave been alive in my reality and voldemort would have been ruling it but you did cast your reflecting shield explained hermione or at least you will have but not that time dontyou see you are going to get your wand back and go back to that night again explained hermione smiling confidently the second time you go back to that night when voldemort tried to kill harry you will cast a reflecting shield and you will save him everything will happen the way it was supposed to happen in your reality you ll see where the curse hits this evil wizard just like you planned and when you return to your own time everything will be the way it was when you left it nothing will have changed not only will it be true that you had always gone back to that night and saved harry but it will also be true that you went back twice and in between you lived a while in this other terrible reality you re a genius hermione you know that said rick shaking his head amazed at the brilliance of her mind it been really nice meeting you and all in this reality but to be honest i could have done without it err this reality i mean i understand said hermione smiling but you never know something might happen or you might learn something in this terrible reality which will be very useful to you when you get back to your own reality time and space have always fascinated me that why i studying physics at university i really interested in quantum mechanics but how could you be at university already asked rick amazed surely you re still at school oh i skipped a few years of school explained hermione nonchalantly i in my second year of university tell me what does it feels like to move through time does everything flash past you like a movie rewinding at high speed no not at all answered rick trying to think of how to explain it it kind of like going to no place where there are no sounds or light or dark or anything really i think of it as stepping out of time then i can step back into time at any point i want it a bit like the corridor of a railway carriage all the compartments connect to it but they re all in completely different times wow said hermione excitedly you know some physicists believe that there are a lot more than four dimensions time is usually considered to be the fourth they posit dozens of dimensions which we are unable to perceive these other dimensions are right here right now right where we are there could be anything in those dimensions vast energy mass or nothing at all a total void one characteristic of at least some of these dimensions is thought to be that they donthave time it like everything is always happening in fact it sounds a bit like your railway carriage corridor now it was rick who was struggling to wrap his mind around new and bizarre concepts do you think when i travel in time i actually move into some other dimension without time exactly said hermione enthusiastically a dimension without time which means that it connected to every point in time in the four dimensions we are familiar with hermione was fascinated by the idea of time travel and the possibility of going back in time and changing the whole thread of reality her mind moved from these abstract speculations to thinking about what it would mean if rick succeeded in his plan i wonder how it will feel to me if you succeed in getting back your wand and changing this reality back to your old one mused hermione you ll be a witch again hermione a very powerful witch said rick smiling at her hermione tried imagining herself as a witch doing magic and being part of a magical world which wasntevil like the present one with nice people like rick so that how you knew my name are you and i friends in your magical world err yeah said rick becoming embarrassed and looking away more than friends perhaps asked hermione with a smile you re my girlfriend hermione said rick letting out a long sigh in fact you re more than my girlfriend we have a special magical bond we re very close you have no idea how much i ve missed you well not you i suppose but her my hermione these past few weeks it it been really wonderful talking to you like this even though i know you re not really her although yeah i suppose you are it very confusing i really need to get back to my school now i dontwant to arouse suspicion i need to stay focussed on getting back my wand and fixing things yes you do said hermione smiling at him warmly she could imagine being rick girlfriend she really liked him in fact she d never met anyone half as charming she felt sad that he had to go that she d never see him again well not in this reality anyway could err would you mind if i i kissed you goodbye stammered rick shyly sitting close to hermione like this he had been fighting the impulse to hug her and kiss her for the past hour it hadntbeen easy hermione smiled at him well since you are my boyfriend i suppose it would be alright she said grinning it was just a quick kiss after all they were in a public park you can give me a longer kiss when you get back to your own reality said hermione smiling good luck i really hope you make it yeah me too said rick sighing he took her hand in his and squeezed it goodbye hermione i sure hope i see you soon hermione looked one last time into his face and then it was gone she could still feel his hand in hers then it too was gone she cautiously put her hand out to where rick had been sitting he was gone hermione sighed this had been without a doubt the strangest most amazing afternoon of her life well this life anyway she thought to herself please take a few moments to leave a review chapter 26 time and time again rick was beginning to worry with only a day to go until the spring equinox he had heard nothing about his forthcoming initiation as a death eater with barty crouch mysterious disappearance from school there was no one to ask finally a message arrived with pansy silver owl requesting rick to visit her that evening as before it included her portkey brooch when rick arrived in pansy apartment she was not in a good mood she was pacing back and forth with an ugly scowl on her face muttering obscenities under her breath blasted draco she railed do you know what that little bastard gone and done he got his slimy father to postpone your death eater initiation she growled what happened asked rick trying to hide his alarm well daddy got you on the list for the initiation but as head of the secret security service and also commander of the death eaters lucius malfoy naturally sees the list and has to approve it apparently when he saw your name on it he asked draco about you draco discovered it was daddy who pushed your initiation forward and realised it had been at my request does draco suspect there something going on between us asked rick becoming worried of course said pansy draco tried to get you removed permanently from the death eater candidate list but since daddy endorsed you lucius malfoy cantdo that but he was able to get your initiation postponed until the next ceremony in six months time pending an investigation investigation asked rick trying hard not to betray his growing anxiety as commander of the death eaters lucius malfoy was able to insist that since nothing is known about you the secret security service needs to investigate your background in new zealand and check your bloodlines and all that nonsense before you can be initiated i sure it will all be ok it just a delaying tactic by draco to spite me but rick knew perfectly well that it would not be ok if the secret security service investigated him as it seemed they would he was dead what on earth am i going to do now he asked himself beginning to panic draco was so unbearably pleased with himself when he told me i absolutely loathe and hate him that gloating malevolent little bastard swore pansy stomping her foot in fury she carried on her tantrum fuming and swearing for several minutes before finally bringing her anger under control she was determined not to let draco ruin her plans she placed her arms around rick waist drawing him close and gave him her most seductive smile rick darling i cant wait another six months no one will possibly find out about us why should we let that horrible nasty mean little prat spoil our pleasure err pansy said rick nervously as he extricated himself from pansy embrace if draco already suspects us there no way i going to risk it draco has the resources of his father secret security service at his disposal to spy on us if he manages to expose us i d have draco malfoy lucius malfoy plus your father all after my skin i sorry pansy but it way too risky the following day was the spring equinox just before midday pansy and draco set out from the castle for the hogwarts gates they were both dressed in exquisite ceremonial black robes made of the finest silk draco was swaggering with a smug grin on his face pansy was furious at him for blocking rick initiation and was attempting to ignore him while simultaneously throwing him dirty looks from time to time when they reached the gates two large black hawks alighted one on each gatepost extending a leg one to pansy the other to draco attached to their legs were portkeys to take them to the initiation ceremony the portkeys were in the shape of coiled up snakes they were jet black with blood red eyes glinting menacingly pansy stood in a huff with her back to draco waiting impatiently for their portkeys to be activated fortunately it happened quite quickly pansy and draco found themselves in a small valley which formed a natural amphitheatre the sides were packed with more than a hundred death eaters there were also members of the upper castes of the magistocracy who had been invited to witness the initiation of pansy and draco on one side of the valley was a specially raised platform seated upon it was the minister of magic cecil parkinson and his entourage which included his wife and other members of the parkinson family opposite them on the other side of the valley on another raised platform sat an arrogant and haughty lucius malfoy his wife narcissa and their entourage most death eater initiations were short ceremonies without large audiences usually they were witnessed only by a dozen or so death eaters the eternal emperor was not fond of pomp and ceremony in fact he did not enjoy public appearances at all but today the heirs of the two leading families of the magistocracy were to be inducted as his servants so a little show to reinforce the primacy of magistocracy in the scheme of things was unavoidable pansy and draco found themselves standing at the lower end of the valley with an escort guard of fifteen death eaters all standing stiffly to attention behind them opposite them at the head of the valley was an elaborate stage with a series of steps rising up to an enormous black throne fanned out on either side of the empty throne were a dozen death eaters standing motionless like statues pansy surreptitiously took out her wand and pointed it at her arm where the dark mark would be burnt she muttered a numbing charm what the matter parkinson sneered draco afraid of a little pain you know very well that it not a little pain it utterly excruciating said pansy glaring hatefully at draco i know death eaters are supposed to enjoy this kind of torture and are not allowed to block the pain but daddy got special dispensation for me to use a numbing charm he had to because i told him it was the only way i was going to be getting the dark mark it bad enough that i ll have that unsightly thing disfiguring my beautiful arm shut up pansy spat draco you re such a wimpy little daddy girl just wait till we re married i ll teach you the meaning of obedience he said smirking threateningly you wontbe able to wrap me around your little finger like you do with your precious daddy dear pansy glared hatefully at draco and was about to tell him exactly what she thought of him when a terrible wailing sound suddenly echoed through the valley a loud explosion shook the ground and an enormous dark mark appeared in the sky casting a shadow over the small valley the dark lord materialised upon his throne the death eater on his right who appeared to be the master of ceremonies cried out in an amplified voice fall to your knees ye faithful servants of the immortal one our great and fearsome eternal emperor everyone obediently went down on their knees and lowered their heads for over a minute they stayed motionless kneeling in submission the eternal emperor surveyed them all grovelling before him with a cruel self satisfied smile finally the death eater to the right of the throne cried out rise up faithful servants of the immortal one everyone quickly resumed their seats candidates approach the throne ordered the death eater pansy held out her arm regally to draco muttering to him under her breath try to carry this off with some semblance of style and dignity you little prat we re supposed to be putting on a show for the magistocracy you know the noble first family in waiting and all of that draco didntreply he dutifully took pansy arm assumed the appropriate facial expression of dignified superiority and smug self importance and led pansy along the path that led up the valley to the foot of the stage followed by their death eater escort when they reached the stage the master of ceremonies summoned pansy to come forward pansy obediently ascended the steps to the great throne and stopped as directed several feet in front of it pansy parkinson said the cold emotionless voice of the eternal emperor approach pansy stepped forward keeping her eyes lowered subserviently prostrate yourself before me swear your undying loyalty to me and beg to receive my initiation to become my faithful servant said the haughty imperial voice of the eternal emperor pansy obediently prostrated herself as ordered lying down flat on her front she raised her head up towards the eternal emperor and faultlessly repeated the ritual incantation swearing life long loyalty to the eternal emperor and begging him to make her one of his own elect death eaters rise commanded the eternal emperor coldly the master of ceremonies led pansy to stand directly in front of the throne he took her left wrist in a firm grip and pushing up the sleeve of her robe extended her arm towards his master the eternal emperor dispassionately touched the tip of his wand to the flesh of pansy arm and exclaimed in an imperious voice te connecto ego despite the numbing charm it hurt and the smell of her own burning flesh disgusted pansy s it took all of her breeding not to flinch and run she followed the ritual formula of going down on her knees and kissing the hem of the eternal emperor robe then she thanked him for the great honour he had bestowed upon her finally pansy again swore fealty to him before rising and keeping her head bowed low descended the steps backwards it was forbidden to turn one back upon the eternal emperor when she reached the bottom of the steps the master of ceremonies called draco to come forward draco ascended the steps to the great throne with dignity stopping several feet away from it as directed draco malfoy said the cold harsh voice of the eternal emperor approach draco stepped forward prostrate yourself before me swear your undying loyalty to me and beg to receive my initiation to become my obedient servant said the eternal emperor arrogantly there was an impatient note in his voice which indicated that he was becoming irritated with this ceremony and fed up with the pomp and self importance of the magistocracy a small gasp escaped the lips of some of the audience because draco did not prostrate himself as ordered instead he stood staring at the eternal emperor no i dontthink i will he said in a loud bold voice no one moved everyone was utterly stunned why should i the heir of one or the noblest families from the highest pureblood caste of the magistocracy prostrate myself before a half blood like you he yelled the stunned silence continued the audience sat transfixed holding their collective breath how dare you speak such libellous treason demanded the emperor in a fearsome fury but it not libel it perfectly true retorted draco confidently your father tom riddle was a mudblood you are the son of a mudblood your blood is filth members of the magistocracy purest of the purebloods why do you bow down to this filth why do to you take orders from one with polluted blood who should have been exterminated along with the rest of his filthy kind long ago the eternal emperor seemed to be having a fit as he sat silent his face red with fury everyone sat frozen shocked into silence by draco outrageous speech father minister of magic parkinson all of you of that generation why do you play this absurd charade demanded draco have you all been memory charmed or are you all too afraid to speak the truth surely you know that this person is no god this is tom riddle the half blood who was a student at hogwarts many years ago this is tom riddle the half blood who changed his name to lord voldemort and waged a war against the mudbloods the mixed bloods and those deluded purebloods who defended them yes it true he did us purebloods a great favour he got rid of the mudbloods and mixed bloods who were polluting the wizarding world but he didntquite finish the job today i ask you all to rise up with me and finish it let us rid our world of this last piece of pollution this last bit of filth finally the death eaters on the stage recovered from their shock and moved towards draco halt ordered the eternal emperor rising to his feet in an apoplectic fury he pointed his wand at draco and yelled avada kedavra it was hard to tell what happened next there was a flash of green and then a ball of fire and light engulfed the throne and draco it began spreading outwards forming a whirlwind which twisted around itself for a few moments before ascending into the sky and disappearing as it began to dissipate the stunned death eaters and members of the audience were able once more to see the throne it was empty there was no sign of the eternal emperor or of draco malfoy the first thing rick did when he arrived at godric hollow was morph back into his own form and transfigure draco elegant ceremonial robes into his old gryffindor uniform which he hoped desperately would turn out to be the appropriate attire for where he would eventually end up rick was shaking nervously from his encounter with voldemort the whole thing had been utterly nerve wracking from beginning to end it started when he apparated invisibly to draco apartment shortly before draco was due to start out for the hogwarts gates with pansy to await the arrival of the portkeys rick found out about the arrangements for getting to the initiation ceremony by scanning pansy mind the previous evening he had stunned draco and then morphed himself to look exactly like him having a model right in front of him had been very helpful he then dressed himself in draco elegant ceremonial robes before going to meet pansy at the entrance to their chambers rick was trembling inside the whole time afraid he wouldntbe able to carry off the pretence of being draco but he had to try it there was no other way to get close enough to voldemort to get his wand back before he was exposed pansy was so angry with him well draco that she hardly looked at him or paid him any attention rick was ready to memory charm her if necessary but fortunately his impersonation of draco was good enough not to rouse her suspicion rick plan required voldemort to cast the killing curse on him he knew that nothing else would work with slytherin cloak protecting voldemort rick wouldntbe able to touch him with any spells at all in this reality the cloak had not been damaged yet nothing would penetrate it not even a summoning charm on his wand before beginning his tirade against voldemort rick had put up shields to deflect both curses and physical attacks in case any of the death eater guard tried to attack him but he was careful not to deploy his reflecting shield until the last moment just as voldemort was about to curse him rick had considered squibbing everyone present bar voldemort whom he knew he couldntsquib on account of the cloak but in the end he decided against it he didntwant voldemort to suspect he was anyone other than draco malfoy who represented no serious threat to him whatsoever if voldemort discovered that everyone had been squibbed and that draco was not in fact draco but some other wizard with great and unknown powers he could have simply apparated or portkeyed away that was rick greatest worry he had to leave voldemort feeling physically and magically secure yet at the same time infuriate him to the point that he would want to personally kill draco rather than simply ordering one of his death eaters to do it it had worked out pretty much to plan his reflecting shield had sent voldemort killing curse back on him hidden by the resultant pyrotechnics rick had grabbed voldemort wand and apparated directly to godric hollow which was once more in ruins and overgrown with weeds as it had been when he last left it rick reverently inspected the wand there was no doubt it was his wand well godric gryffindor wand really rick made himself invisible then held up the wand twisting it slightly as he closed his eyes and concentrated on going back in time he decided to go back to just a few minutes before voldemort cast the killing curse on harry he definitely didntwant to witness the tragic death of james and lily potter all over again once was more than enough rick paid careful attention to the process he remembered hermione theory that he was in fact going into some timeless dimension and he wanted to see how that stacked up with his experience it felt like he had stepped out of the present time and place to somewhere that was no where and no place the analogy with stepping out of a compartment on the hogwarts express into the corridor and then entering another compartment was a good one the really interesting thing he discovered on this occasion was that if he wanted he could stay in the corridor he didnthave to enter another compartment in hermione terminology he was hanging out in the timeless dimension it was a very strange dimension because all he could perceive was his own mind there were no other sensations whatsoever he had no sense of having a body there were no sounds and there was nothing to see it was just his mind in a void interesting thought rick but i ve got a job to do a very important job it time to go the first thing rick saw was harry crying over the form of his dead mother voldemort was speaking to harry saying exactly the same words that rick remembered from the first time he had been here rick decided to disapparate without immediately apparating as he had done the first time he travelled back to this night he didnt want voldemort to trip over him or to hear him then he was struck by a very strange thought i must be here already from the first time i travelled back in time to this night how weird i have to make sure that not only voldemort doesntnotice me i also have to make sure that i from the first time dontnotice me but since i invisible and without a physical body there no chance of that rick mused the only way the me from the first time could know i am here is by projecting a magical map but i didn t so i suppose that means i won t thought rick bewildered but fascinated by the ramifications of being here twice anyway i not sure a magical map would even show me in this bodiless state i know i ll try it rick projected a magical map in his mind besides the names of harry potter and tom riddle he saw his own name twice in fact he jumped a bit to his left because he was almost standing on himself wow i glad i didntthink of projecting a magical map the first time i was here i would have seen myself on it twice and been even more confused than i was already about what was going on and what i was supposed to be doing thought rick shaking his head his thoughts were interrupted by voldemort who was talking to a distraught baby harry now according to pettigrew she used some blood magic on you so perhaps i had better be careful she wanted me to kill her that much is obvious probably she needed me to kill her to activate the protection but what does it do i wonder pettigrew said that i would not be able to touch you but there no need to touch you to kill you with a curse my little enemy i know i ll try putting my mark on you first if i can do that then i ll certainly be able to kill you harry was looking up at voldemort as he spoke to him voldemort pointed his wand at harry forehead and said signum ego concateno everything happened exactly like the first time harry recoiled writhing on the ground and screaming in agony from the pain a bleeding zigzag lightening bolt shaped wound appeared on harry forehead voldemort thin lips curled into a cruel self satisfied smile as he prepared to cast the killing curse with a sense of great destiny rick cast his reflecting shield around baby harry moments later voldemort pointed his wand at the baby lying curled up in the foetal position and crying in pain his little hands clutching at his forehead avada kedavra cried voldemort victoriously but the evil grin changed to an expression of horror and disbelief as his curse rebounded from baby harry and came rushing back towards him voldemort instinctively tried to turn but there was no time to dodge the curse rick saw the rebounding green light strike voldemort on the side of the chest four inches beneath his right armpit the effect of the rebounding curse was almost identical to the one that rick had just witnessed in the other reality when voldemort had tried to kill him thinking he was draco malfoy voldemort was engulfed in a ball of fire then a strange white light began spreading from where he had stood it formed itself into a whirlwind which twisted around for a few moments before disappearing into the sky rick breathed a huge sigh of relief finally i got it right i hope baby harry had been distracted from the painful wound on his forehead by voldemort impressive pyrotechnic display as he departed his mortal body for a long and unhappy exile from corporeal existence poor little harry looked terribly confused and unhappy apart from being in physical pain from the scar rick desperately wanted to pick him up and comfort him and tell him that everything was going work out alright eventually of course he still had ten unloved and unhappy years of childhood to endure with the dursleys until his eleventh birthday when he would finally discover the truth about who and what he really was well part of it at least thought rick sadly no i have to go rick told himself i ve done what i had to do i haventbeen thrown back to the future this time i ve still got my wand so everything should be just the way it was when i left it he thought apprehensively goodbye little harry hagrid should be here before long to take care of you see you soon i hope rick twisted his wand and travelled back to his own time he didnt linger along the way to observe the process of time travel he was anxious to get back and hopefully find the world just the way he d left it godric hollow was again in ruins and overgrown with weeds it looked just the way he remembered it from the first time he had apparated here from hogwarts so far so good thought rick before taking a deep breath and apparating to the headmaster office at hogwarts rick looked around and then breathed an enormous sigh of relief as he made himself visible professor dumbledore harry and hermione were all there looking exactly the same as they had when he d left them he had to fight hard to resist the urge to throw his arms around hermione and hug her he was so happy to see her he just grinned at her stupidly they all looked at him expectantly to them it was no more than a minute since he had gone you have no idea how happy i am to find you all here like this he said letting out another huge sigh it feels like i ve been gone for so long well it has been about five weeks for me he said by way of explanation but how is that possible mr godfry asked dumbledore gravely rising from his seat i do hope you heeded my very clear warnings and changed nothing but i had to professor said rick imploringly i didntchange anything the first time only the second time i had to it was the only way to put things back the way they were supposed to be and to get back to this reality the second time asked dumbledore severely what on earth have you done mr godfry please sit down and explain what happened everything said dumbledore resuming his seat and fixing his eyes piercingly upon rick rick explained what happened the first time he went back to godric hollow on that fateful halloween night he related the conversation between harry parents which revealed that they had not found a way of protecting their baby from voldemort when rick got to the point where voldemort arrived harry became visibly tense rick tried to stick to the bare facts and avoid describing the intense emotions he had witnessed and experienced himself as voldemort first killed harry father and then his mother when rick mentioned that voldemort had deliberately put the mark on harry dumbledore interrupted him what are you saying that voldemort put the mark on harry deliberately as a test asked dumbledore intrigued yes sir exactly replied rick pettigrew warned voldemort that harry mother had used some blood magic to protect him voldemort wanted to make sure that it wouldntstop him from cursing harry yes mused the headmaster with a gleam in his eye that is a far more plausible explanation than the scar mysteriously appearing on harry as a result of voldemort killing curse i wonder why that possibility never occurred to me before please continue harry was becoming increasingly tenser as rick drew closer in his account to the fateful moment when voldemort cast the killing curse upon him when he explained how he had been mysteriously thrown back to the present time just as voldemort cried out the lethal words the headmaster interrupted again so you didntactually see where voldemort was struck by the rebounding curse no not the first began rick but he was cut off by the headmaster you say you were thrown back to the present that can mean only one thing something changed it was the change that threw you back to the present and yet we are all sitting here fifteen years later and nothing is different how very curious professor said rick sighing everything changed i apparated back to this office and none of you were here professor snape was here or should i say headmaster snape there was a collective gasp from the headmaster harry and hermione before they could ask him any further questions rick quickly began to describe his conversation with headmaster snape they sat entranced for over an hour as he described the whole horrible inhumane world he had lived in for the past five weeks and how disguised as draco malfoy he had finally managed to get his wand back from voldemort and return to godric hollow to cast the reflecting shield when he had finished the three of them sat completely stunned attempting to assimilate and understand the meaning of what had happened to rick finally dumbledore snapped his fingers and a spread of sandwiches and pastries appeared on a low table before them along with large glasses of pumpkin juice i think we have missed lunch he said smiling perhaps we should all indulge in some refreshments while we chew over mr godfry amazing story tuck in hermione gulped down a couple of sandwiches but she couldntrestrain herself any longer professor do you think rick was somehow always there on that night i mean that it was always him who protected harry with his reflecting shield indubitably without a doubt miss granger said the headmaster smiling at her calmly his blue eyes twinkling in fact i think you or at least the hermione granger in the other reality explained it rather well can you please repeat exactly what she said to you mr godfry rick quickly swallowed his sandwich before speaking she said everything will happen the way it was supposed to in your reality you ll see where the curse hits this evil wizard just like you planned and when you return to your own time everything will be the way it was when you left it nothing will have changed not only will it be true that you had always gone back to that night and saved harry but it will be true that you went back twice and that in between you lived a while in this other terrible reality i couldnthave put it better myself said dumbledore smiling at hermione yes it was rick who saved harry it always was of course we didntknow back then that in fifteen years time the spirits of the great witches and wizards of the light would send us rick godfry to help fight voldemort and that he would go back in time to save harry we always thought it was his mother protection that had saved him but that simply mind boggling said hermione shaking her head in disbelief they sent rick to a world that would not be able to exist unless he appeared in it and then went back fifteen years to save harry how can that be possible she asked perplexed the trick my dear explained the headmaster is not to think of time as linear think of it as a road that you are walking along your experience is only of that part of the road you have walked along and of those parts even further back that others have walked upon and spoken of or written about although no one knows anything about the road ahead it already exists its nature is wholly determined by the past the part of the road that is known time magic allows one to move instantly between different points along the road but that still doesntexplain how the spirits of the great witches and wizards of the light could send rick to a reality that did not exist that could not exist until he had appeared in it and had gone back and done something fifteen years in the past argued hermione ah said professor dumbledore but the spirits who sent mr godfry are not in time as we mortals are to them time past present and future is all happening at once they perceive the entire road if you will their decision and action in sending mr godfry changed the road but it was independent of time it did not happen in 1996 any more than in 1981 now i understand why the spirit of godric gryffindor asked me to give his wand to mr godfry it was with the express intention that he should use it to go back in time and save harry from voldemort killing curse saving harry and averting the nightmare reality was i believe one of the primary reasons for which mr godfry was sent to our world the very act of sending him ensured that this reality rather than the nightmare reality would come to pass hence it was possible to send him into this reality even though its very existence depended upon him appearing in it and then going back in time to make it possible dumbledore smiled delightedly at the wonder of it all for a minute or two no one spoke as they tried to wrap their minds around what he had said finally harry broke the silence so despite your warnings to rick to change nothing he was supposed to change the past should he have cast the reflecting shield the first time no gasped hermione absolutely not rick didntchange the past he just did exactly what he had always done it just took him a while to find out what it was and he definitely shouldnthave cast the reflecting shield the first time precisely agreed dumbledore nodding his head approvingly at hermione mr godfry discovered that he had to protect harry with a reflecting shield for this reality to occur so casting the shield was not changing the past it was enacting it exactly as it had to occur although your sojourn in the nightmare reality was most unpleasant he continued looking at rick it has in fact provided us with crucial information firstly we have learned that voldemort has a secret spy in our midst madame hooch secondly we have discovered that harry cannot kill voldemort what do you mean demanded harry if i cantkill voldemort because of this scar he said pointing to his forehead that means voldemort will kill me one of us has to kill the other that what the prophecy says said harry sounding worried and confused ah but the prophecy is only that a prophecy said dumbledore it is not an immutable truth which must occur no matter what prophecies do not always prove to be correct but wait said harry according to what sna err the headmaster in the nightmare reality told rick this scar wont actually stop me killing voldemort it just means that if i do then i ll die as well if it the only way to rid the world of that monster then i ll just have to do it if i dontkill him he ll kill me so i dead no matter what i do if i going to die anyway then i going to do my damnedest to take him with me said harry with fatalistic determination no harry that utter nonsense said hermione passionately you re mixing everything up the prophecy could be completely wrong and considering who gave it it probably is you may not be the one who kills voldemort and it may not be true that neither of you can survive while the other lives in fact you have both been alive for sixteen years since the prophecy was given so how can it be correct yeah mate said rick just because voldemort believes it and is obsessed with it doesntmean it true exactly said hermione but harry what professor snape told rick about your scar almost certainly is true if you kill voldemort you ll die i know you ve come to believe that it you who has to kill him but apart from trelawney ridiculous prophecy who says it has to be you please harry donttry to be the hero let someone else get rid of voldemort turning to professor dumbledore she continued professor it seems as though voldemort in this reality is not aware of that particular side effect of harry scar yes miss granger said the headmaster staring off into the distance thinking it over if voldemort knew he would certainly have let harry and everyone else know he would be crowing over his coup this will of course have to remain a secret among the four of us umm professor dumbledore said harry slowly he was obviously still thinking over what he wanted to say this morning when voldemort pulled rick and me into the future and we were standing right in front him my scar didnthurt at all i couldnteven feel it it really surprised me because every other time i ve been anywhere near him it been unbearable do you think it might have something to do with time travel yes of course exclaimed hermione jumping in before the headmaster could speak your scar connects you to the voldemort in this time and this reality that future voldemort would have a connection to the harry of his time but not with you that must be the reason professor said hermione turning to the headmaster yes most probably agreed the headmaster although it is hard to be certain the scar which links harry to voldemort is quite unique there are no precedents to go by so said harry if i went back just a little way in time perhaps just fifteen or twenty minutes i might be able to kill voldemort without no harry said dumbledore calmly but forcefully that would be most foolhardy for two reasons firstly we do not know for certain that it would render you immune from that particular property of your scar you were not only in a different time this morning you were also in what i hope will transpire to be a different reality you might well die as a result of killing voldemort secondly you would be making a fundamental change to the past the consequences of which could be disastrous but you said yourself that if one goes back no more than an hour or two and acts cautiously it possible to make a change without causing any serious side effects protested harry harry said dumbledore looking at him sternly it is not just a matter of the length of time one goes back voldemort death whenever it should occur will be a pivotal event in the history of the wizarding world it is not some minor peripheral event such as when you and miss granger saved sirius and buckbeak lives too many chains of cause and effect in our world run through that critical point voldemort death to precipitate it by travelling back to the past even a short way would unquestionably be courting calamity in any case harry said hermione our priority from what you and rick learned this morning from voldemort is to find a way of dealing with the dementors if we cantsolve that problem then well you saw and heard yourself what will happen everyone was silent for a minute or two as they focussed on the spectre of the destruction of hogwarts we probably have a little time up our sleeves said dumbledore finally my guess is that death eaters with children at hogwarts will request that they be allowed to come home for the easter holidays and then prevent their subsequent return to hogwarts at the commencement of the final school term the attack will i believe come immediately after the easter holidays as the absence of the death eaters children will be a clear indication that an assault is imminent voldemort will want to strike quickly before we have time to take defensive measures umm professor dumbledore why do wizards celebrate easter asked harry curiously i know it nothing to do with what we ve been talking about but it always puzzled me i mean wizards arentchristians are they that a very good question harry answered the headmaster smiling witches and wizards do not believe in the bible or the god of christianity as revealed by it and of course only a minority of magical folk live in christian countries anyway however almost all magical folk do believe in a unifying energy or intelligence of some kind in the universe i like to think of it as the same thing that christians call god moslems call allah hindus call brahma and so on every religion has its own name for it and its own particular ideas regarding its nature probably none of them are completely correct in how they describe it nor for that matter completely incorrect everyone i believe both magical and non magical folk alike is able to experience it this cosmic presence to a greater or lesser degree however because it cannot be directly perceived it is depicted in so many different ways by the various religions of the world it never ceases to amaze me that so many muggles born in christian countries believe unquestioningly in jesus and the god they have been taught about while those born in muslim countries are equally unquestioning in their belief in the prophet mohammed and allah it never seems to occur to them that if they were born in a country of another faith they would believe in it just as fervently if only they didnthave to fight for their sectarian beliefs the world would be a far happier place but then why does the wizarding world celebrate easter professor if they dontbelieve in the bible asked hermione puzzled as she attempted to steer the headmaster back to the original question the sectarian religious beliefs of muggles and their disastrous consequences in history was a topic of particular fascination for him because jesus like moses mohammed zoroaster the buddha and many others who are revered as great prophets saints and the like by the world religions is considered by the wizarding world to have been a great wizard explained dumbledore of course exclaimed hermione as the penny dropped all the miracles he performed were magic walking on water the loaves and the fishes healing the sick my goodness perhaps it was jesus who blessed me with healing powers that is indeed very likely miss granger said dumbledore smiling wizards consider jesus to be the greatest healer in history his crucifixion is viewed as akin to witch burning the muggles were afraid of his magical powers and attempted to kill him but of course being a very powerful wizard he survived both crucifixion and entombment giving rise to the christian belief that he died and then rose from the dead what the wizarding world celebrates at easter is that jesus did not in fact die there are of course many stories from various parts of the world where jesus was reported to have lived at various times after his crucifixion including england it can be assumed that he lived a very long happy and magical life speaking of easter i would request the three of you to remain at hogwarts over the easter holiday this year until then said the headmaster looking first at rick and then hermione please focus your minds on how we might deal with the dementors i too shall be researching the subject harry i would like you to continue working hard on your animagus transformation it remains our plan of last resort to deny voldemort that which he desires above all else your death he said gravely then rising from his chair he added now if you would please excuse me i need to have a little chat with our ex flying mistress madame hooch as harry hermione and rick rose to leave harry asked who will referee tomorrow quidditch match between gryffindor and ravenclaw professor oh dear said dumbledore i believe i shall also have to have a chat with professor mcgonagall she was a very fine chaser in her day you know renowned for her speed and agility now what was it they used to call her on the quidditch pitch he asked himself stroking his bearded chin as he searched his memory oh yes now i remember nimble minnie although i would not suggest that you address her as such he added his blue eyes twinkling with amusement valued reader i have spoiled you posting 26 chapters in almost as many days alas all good things must come to and end we have now caught up with the betas who are a couple of chapters behind me so the remaining five or six chapters will be posted about once a week please take a few moments to leave a review you never know it may just spur me to go that little bit faster chapter 27 gryffindor versus ravenclaw rick and hermione seated themselves apart from the rest of the gryffindor supporters who had come to cheer their team on against ravenclaw they were in the back corner of the gryffindor stand where rick would not be too conspicuous if he had to act he was hoping there would be no repeat of the drama which had marked the match against slytherin it was another clear crisp sunny winter day perfect weather for quidditch a loud buzz rose from the stunned spectators when professor mcgonagall flew onto the pitch to referee the game the news that madam hooch had been dismissed had not yet got out from the severe tone in which she gave the pre match injunction about fair play and observing the rules it was obvious to all that professor mcgonagall was going to be very strict nobody gryffindors included would be getting away with any foul play or infringements of the rules today she blew her whistle shrilly throwing the quaffle high in the air to commence the game ginny immediately gained possession of the quaffle and streaked away towards the gryffindor goals she dodged a vicious bludger before reaching the goals where she feinted right brilliantly wrong footing the ravenclaw keeper before slamming the quaffle through the left most hoop ecstatic cheers rose from the gryffindor stand but ginny wasntfinished yet she was in great form and within three minutes of the start of the match had scored as many goals to put gryffindor well in the lead but the ravenclaw chasers were not going to let gryffindor have it all their own way after ginny third goal they got possession of the quaffle and began peppering their own goal they were good and ron had his work cut out protecting his hoops so far he had successfully beaten off their fierce attacks rick noticed harry employing his usual strategy of staying high up above the game he was darting about on his broom his eyes constantly scanning for the golden gleam of the snitch just like a hawk searching the ground for prey cho chang had also adopted her usual strategy when playing against harry she was shadowing him he had the keenest eyes of any seeker she had played against and was odds on to spot the snitch first she was ready to follow him and maybe get lucky the snitch often behaved erratically and it might just make a move that favoured her hermione wasntall that interested in quidditch just so long as gryffindor won she was quizzing rick in detail about his encounter with her in the nightmare reality naturally she was fascinated to know all about herself it was probably exactly how she would have been had she never received her hogwarts letter she was particularly interested to hear what she had said to rick about time travel and other dimensions it seemed to her that it might somehow be important with his photographic memory courtesy of rowena ravenclaw rick could repeat back to hermione word for word everything she had told him in the nightmare reality you said some physicists believe that there are a lot more than four dimensions time is usually considered to be the fourth they posit dozens of dimensions which we are unable to perceive these other dimensions are right here right now right where we are there could be anything in those dimensions vast energy mass or nothing at all a total void one of the characteristics of some of these dimensions is thought to be that they donthave time it as if everything is always happening in fact it sounds a bit like your railway carriage corridor then said rick i asked her err i mean you do you think when i travel in time i actually move into some other dimension without time you replied exactly a dimension without time which means that it connected to every point in time in the four dimensions we are familiar with hermione sat in silence lost deep in thought for several minutes the game meanwhile was progressing at a furious pace high above them ravenclaw had finally managed to score a couple of goals against ron but then ginny struck back adding four quick goals to put gryffindor fifty points clear the gryffindor supporters were singing enthusiastically ginny weasley quidditch queen greatest chaser ever seen ravenclaw dontstand a chance when she does her quaffle dance rick since you brought harry back from the future with you said hermione deep in thought and oblivious to what was happening on the quidditch pitch it means that you can take others with you when you travel in time just like you do when you apparate right umm yes i guess so answered rick what did you have in mind do you fancy paying circe a visit to get some tips on turning men into pigs and maybe some roast pork recipes too asked rick with a cheeky grin dont be silly scolded hermione she was onto something and in far too serious a mood for rick silly jokes i dontwant you to take me to the past or to the future but i d like to see what this dimension without time is like when i used the time turner in third year i never experienced anything like that at all there must be something fundamentally different about the way you travel in time and what happens with a time turner could you take me to this timeless dimension rick just for a little while please why sure answered rick anytime you like how about now then asked hermione eagerly yeah i guess it should be alright said rick if we return to the exact moment we left we wonteven appear to have been gone if anyone looking at us said rick just dontreturn us to before we left said hermione grinning i dontwant to find myself sitting in my own lap rick laughed as he took hermione hand in his took his wand from his robes and twisted it rick didntknow how long they were out of time or in the timeless dimension before he brought them back wow said hermione in wonderment that was absolutely amazing i ve never experienced anything like it before she was silent for a while as she searched for concepts to encapsulate the experience it felt like i was nowhere at all or like nothing existed at all it was just an empty void the only thing there was me well not even me really i had no sense of my body at all only my mind i wasntaware of anything else at all not even you were you aware of me rick no answered rick shaking his head it just like you described it there was just my mind and nothing else just this vast void yes answered hermione slowly thinking it over but vast isnt quite the right word is it a void has no dimensions at all a void is not just without time it also without space it a very strange contradiction this place out of time where you took me has no time yet it connected to all time it has no dimensions yet it infinite it sort of everything and nothing everywhere and nowhere all time and no time she said shaking her head in wonder i certainly never experienced anything remotely like it when i used the time turner yet it seems certain that all time travel involves passing through this timeless dimension probably i transited it too quickly to notice it because with a time turner you have no control over the process whereas with your wand you do you re able to linger in the timeless dimension if you want and to observe it hermione musings were interrupted by loud cheering looking up she saw harry streaking high above the quidditch field chasing the golden snitch cho was struggling to keep up with him as he pulled away from her with the superior speed of his firebolt the snitch was struggling too it wasntgiving harry an easy time today as it swerved this way and that one minute diving the next soaring but harry with his brilliant flying skills was staying with it and closing on it not letting it out of his sight for a moment go harry go go go go screamed the gryffindors and many others besides as harry reached out his gauntleted hand and plucked the struggling snitch out of the air as he watched rick was lost in memories of baby harry and his father flying him around the lounge room chasing after his own little snitch how proud of him james and lily would have been reflected rick shaking his head sadly but rick flashback was cut short by screams the sky seemed to have exploded around harry sending out billowing white clouds that were rapidly enveloping the whole quidditch field it was impossible to see anything rick felt a sense of panic if harry had been knocked from his broom it would be impossible to save him as he had in the match against slytherin without being able to see him there was no way he could cast a spell to catch him the scene was one of pandemonium with students screaming not knowing what to do as the white clouds spread out enveloping them before eventually thinning and finally dissipating as the clouds cleared all eyes looked up searching for harry nervously hermione scanned the sky for him she spotted cho and the other quidditch players flying cautiously back to land but harry was nowhere to be seen apprehensively she lowered her eyes to the quidditch pitch afraid of what they would find there she dreaded that it would be his broken body but mercifully there was just a solitary broom harry firebolt lying on the pitch rick where can he be screamed hermione frantically do you think he been abducted to the future by but then she stopped as she realised that she was talking to empty space rick wasnt there looking upwards she saw a falcon furiously beating its wings rising rapidly up into the sky hermione felt sick with fear if harry had been abducted again either to the future or to voldemort in the present time how could rick possibly find him it would be like looking for a needle in a haystack the headmaster magically amplified voice burst in on hermione frantic and fearful thoughts all students including quidditch players are requested to return immediately to their respective common rooms and to remain there until advised otherwise by their head of house hermione found ginny ron and padma walking sombrely back to the castle ron was in the middle with an arm around each girl hermione walked next to ginny who was still in her quidditch uniform looking tried and worried hermione put her arm around her hermione cried ginny what do you think can have happened to harry i so worried ginny was in tears and clearly distraught i dontknow said hermione fighting back her own tears he just disappeared into thin air i just so afraid that that voldemort has got him where else can he be she managed to blurt out before bursting into tears where rick asked ron in a husky voice thick with emotion i dontknow said hermione between sobs i suppose he looking for harry but where would he start ron just shook his head hopelessly staring at the ground as they walked back to the castle hermione was sure she saw a tear fall from his eye after making the animagus transformation into a peregrine falcon rick beat his wings furiously to gain altitude as quickly as possible until he gained a commanding view over the hogwarts grounds finding no sign of harry apart from his broomstick far below on the quidditch pitch he immediately headed out over the forbidden forest has voldemort pulled him through another time portal he asked himself instinctively he headed towards where harry had been pulled the previous morning he scanned the treetops as he flew but he couldntsee harry anywhere when he got to the place where the time portal had been he could see nothing there was no black cloud there was nothing at all rick was lost for what to do next was the snitch a portkey he wondered if it was then harry could be hundreds of miles away by now how am i going to find him rick asked himself desperately just then rick falcon instincts cut in as he saw out of the corner of his eye something approaching him fast rick dived and swerved before looking around to identify what had been closing on him then he saw it a golden eagle with distinctive green eyes in that instant rick understood how harry had saved himself from plummeting to his death on the quidditch pitch in front on the whole school he had succeeded just in the nick of time to master the animagus transformation if rick had been himself he would have whooped for joy instead he soared high following harry it was soon evident to rick that harry had shrugged off any lingering fear and worry about what had happened on the quidditch field and was revelling in the ecstasy of avian flight in fact he seemed to be having the time of his life as he rose on the wind soaring high above the forest with his massive wings stretched wide before dropping into a vertical dive then pulling out of it and using his momentum to shoot out horizontally at great speed banking and turning harry was totally lost in the joy and delight of flying rick had no trouble keeping up with harry because while a golden eagle was considerably larger and more powerful than a peregrine falcon it was not quite as fast rick was soon caught up in harry delight and the pair of them played aerobatic games together for at least a quarter of an hour before rick remembered that everyone at hogwarts must be thinking that harry had been abducted by voldemort and was probably dead by now he eventually managed to convince harry that they should head back to the castle they came down on the west tower and transformed harry was grinning from ear to ear like a cheshire cat that was the most wonderful experience of my life rick he said ecstatically even better than the first time i flew on a broom in my first year hey what happened to your hand asked rick with concern pointing at harry right hand the gauntlet had been blown away from the palm and harry hand was badly burnt ouch it hurts like hell said harry wincing and shaking his hand about just after i grabbed the snitch it exploded sending out all this white smoke or something i dontknow what kind of spell it was but somehow it ripped my broom out from under me i began falling downwards into this white cloud i realised that the only way to save myself was to transform into an eagle i concentrated with all my might and it just happened i did it i spread my wings to stop my fall and then began flapping them to gain altitude soon i was high above the white cloud and the quidditch pitch it was so amazing to fly like a bird at last i just forgot about everything but now i ve changed back my hand is hurting really badly is there anything you can do rick he asked grimacing with pain rick didntneed to bother hiding his magical powers from harry anymore now that voldemort had let the cat out of the bag he didnt even bother pretending to use his wand he pointed a finger at the gauntlet and it was gone rick took hold of harry wrist and carefully examined his hand the palm was very badly burnt he concentrated on harry hand for a moment and it was healed thanks said harry gratefully holding his hand up in front of his face and examining it appreciatively how am i going to explain my miraculous survival without giving away my animagus ability have you got any ideas well said rick after thinking it over for a few moments how about you claim that you ve just mastered an advanced hover charm you can say it really hard to control your motion and you ended up coming down somewhere in the forbidden forest and you only just got back to the castle err it sort of true in a way i mean you were hovering over the forbidden forest after all we better go to dumbledore right away to let him know you re ok rick closed his eyes for a minute to check the headmaster office unfortunately he not alone so just tell him the story for now he ll figure it out anyway how do you know he not alone rick asked harry mystified well you know your marauders map answered rick i can sort of err project one in my mind wow said harry that amazing can you do it in other places too err yeah said rick anywhere i guess while i was checking the map i spotted a secret passage which should get us to dumbledore office without being spotted come on let go they went through a doorway and then down a tightly spiralling stone staircase at the bottom they set out along a deserted corridor when they came to a heavy tapestry rick grabbed harry by the arm and pulled him behind it and into a dark narrow passageway which they illuminated with their wands rick led the way taking various connecting passages until they came out through a hidden doorway into the corridor that led to the headmaster office fickle fudge said rick when they reached the entrance the stone gargoyle jumped aside and harry and rick stepped onto the moving stone staircase harry knocked on the door to the headmaster office they heard footsteps approaching the door it swung open to reveal a very surprised severus snape potter he exclaimed then spotting rick standing behind harry he added in a suspicious tone now why am i not surprised to see you godfry whenever the unexpected occurs you can always be expected to turn up how very very predictable please show them severus came the delighted voice of the headmaster snape reluctantly stepped aside to allow harry and rick to enter the office harry exclaimed dumbledore with unconcealed joy he had risen from his chair and came around his desk to stand in front of harry his blue eyes were twinkling with happiness apart from snape the other three heads of house were also present professor mcgonagall jumped from her chair wiping her swollen red eyes with a tartan handkerchief before pocketing it she placed an affectionate hand on harry shoulder and smiled at him warmly my goodness potter you gave us all a dreadful fright she said sounding extremely relieved are you hurt what on earth happened out there on the quidditch pitch all five professors were now staring at harry expectantly err it was the snitch said harry it exploded in my hand and my broom was ripped out from under me and i started falling snape who had remained standing now moved closer to harry and how exactly did you manage to come back to earth in one piece from several hundred feet up in the air without a broom potter asked snape staring hard at harry before allowing his eyes to drift to the left and rest suspiciously upon rick err i used a hover charm sir answered harry a hover charm repeated snape with obvious disbelief i have never heard of a hover charm that one could cast upon oneself nor for that matter of any that do more than levitate an object a few feet have you filius he asked turning for confirmation to the diminutive charms master well answered professor flitwick pausing a moment to consider the question there are certain very advanced charms that can be employed in duelling which allow the caster to fly up in the air a short distance to dodge a curse but there is nothing i know of that would save someone falling from a broom several hundred feet up in the air snape rounded on harry again with a satisfied smile on his face i think you are going to have to do a little better than that potter if you now severus interjected the headmaster there are more things under the sun than either you or i or any of us in this room know about just because no one has heard of this charm does not mean that it does not exist i for one am more than happy to accept mr potter explanation he turned and resumed his seat behind his desk noting rick wink as he sank into his chair he nodded slightly back indicating that he understood perfectly how harry had saved himself perhaps potter would care to explain where he has been for the past half hour while the whole school has been in a panic and in mourning for him demanded snape choosing a different avenue of attack since he could not openly contradict the headmaster err it very difficult to control yourself with this hover charm sir answered harry trying to keep his voice steady i err ended up floating above the forbidden forest where i finally managed to come down it took me a while to find my way out and err get back to the castle snape was an expert at reading body language he was certain potter was lying hold out the hand with which you caught the snitch potter he demanded harry held out his right hand where is the gauntlet demanded snape suspiciously i i dontknow sir said harry i guess it was blown off when the snitch exploded and yet there is not a single scratch burn or mark of any kind on your hand extraordinary how would you explain that mr potter asked snape his eyes narrowing into a hard cold glare but before harry could answer professor mcgonagall stepped defensively in front of harry glaring at snape that quite enough severus you are behaving as if potter here was responsible for what happened today during the quidditch match it is obvious to any fair minded person that he was the victim not the perpetrator it was clearly not some silly schoolboy prank but rather an attempt upon his life i think mr potter has suffered enough trauma for one day without being subjected to your adversarial style of cross examination please leave him alone severus said mcgonagall in a voice that brooked no argument she stood her ground glaring at snape until he backed off and angrily resumed his seat dumbledore sat calmly behind his desk his blue eyes twinkling with amusement and the start of a smile tugging at the corners of his mouth he was obviously enjoying the sight of minerva mcgonagall in mother hen mode putting severus snape in his place i think we can all agree on one thing said the headmaster gaining everyone attention this was undoubtedly another thankfully unsuccessful attempt by voldemort on the life of harry potter as you know he continued madam hooch whom i dismissed yesterday has been spying for voldemort for many years after interrogating her i concluded that she had done no more than spy that she had not been involved in any overt activities this explains how she succeeded in remaining undetected at hogwarts for so long but due to a series of setbacks and failures voldemort has become desperate of late consequently it seems he pressed madam hooch into active service and had her substitute the tampered snitch for the one which was to be used in today match it was after all almost a forgone conclusion that mr potter would catch it he said smiling at harry snape could be heard muttering a disgusted humph under his breath minerva and filius he continued i would like you to check over all of the school quidditch equipment including the school brooms please check everything that madam hooch has had access to all quidditch matches practices and flying lessons are postponed until the task is complete but professor exclaimed harry there the slytherin ravenclaw match in three weeks and then gryffindor hufflepuff a couple of weeks after that dont worry potter said professor mcgonagall reassuringly it shouldnttake us more than a week or two i sure that the quidditch program will not be seriously disrupted oh and by the way congratulations on your win today what asked harry in surprise well you caught the snitch even if it did subsequently explode according to the rules of quidditch the match ends at the moment the seeker catches the snitch so the result stands the final score i believe was two hundred and fifty to thirty in gryffindor favour which puts gryffindor in the lead for the house cup she added grinning smugly at snape congratulations mr potter said dumbledore beaming at harry may i suggest that you and mr godfry return to your common room and let your friends and housemates know you are alive and well they will no doubt have all been very worried since your disappearance i am certain they will want to celebrate your safe return along with gryffindor victory today i am sure your head of house will permit you and your housemates a celebratory party he added with a smile glancing towards professor mcgonagall who nodded her agreement err thank you professor dumbledore said harry feeling relieved to escape any further interrogation by snape when harry entered the gryffindor common room all hell broke loose the students had been sitting around in small subdued groups speculating on harry fate the consensus was that this must surely be the end of the road for the boy who lived no other conclusion seemed possible the mood was one of gloom and despair without harry potter the future looked bleak indeed it felt as if the battle was already over and the dark lord had won ron hermione and ginny were sitting together none of them could think of anything positive to say so they just sat in silence hermione and ginny were both red eyed and tearful this was a moment they had all dreaded but hoped somehow would never arrive when the portrait hole swung open and harry walked in there was a moment of stunned silence then everyone was talking excitedly at once hermione and ginny both rushed at harry and embraced him so hard he could barely breathe when he smiled at ginny she lost all control and kissed him soundly on the lips much to the delight of the onlookers even ron who had rushed over to his best friend wasnt annoyed or trying to drag her away from him what the hell happened to you mate he asked in a relieved voice it was the question on everyone lips rick jumped up onto a table and remembering to use his wand performed the sonorous charm he knew harry didntwant to have to lie to the whole house and would be embarrassed having to address them all so he decided to spare him everyone harry just been through a pretty rough time so please give him a break and let him relax a bit i know you re all curious to know what happened out there on the quidditch pitch he just had to go over the whole story in the headmaster office i was there so i ll repeat what he said ok everyone yelled out their agreement prompting rick to continue i think we all saw harry catch the snitch said rick a few seconds later it exploded in his hand white stuff came out of it making that huge white cloud which spread out to cover the quidditch field and the spectator stands when the snitch exploded harry broom was ripped out from under him rick was cut off by a collective gasp from his listeners i guess you all saw his broom on the quidditch pitch and are wondering how harry managed to escape falling to his death which by the way was the plan the tampered snitch came courtesy of voldemort there was a collective gasp when rick said the dreaded name so how the hell did harry manage to save himself from falling asked dean thomas he used a very advanced hover charm to float back down answered rick his words were greeted by cries of surprise disbelief and admiration err harry has been working on this charm for quite a while continued rick raising his voice above the hubbub it very hard to control your direction apparently and harry ended up floating out over the forbidden forest where he finally landed it took him quite a while to find his way out and walk back to the castle everyone began talking at once about the amazing turn of events and how harry against all the odds had cheated death and he who must not be named once again there one more thing yelled rick ramping up his sonorous charm professor mcgonagall has given us permission to have a party to celebrate harry safe return and also gryffindor quidditch victory today since harry caught the snitch and the game was over before it exploded professor mcgonagall has declared gryffindor the winner two hundred and fifty points to ravenclaw thirty which puts us in the lead for the house cup the common room erupted into cheering and rejoicing the mood was in total contrast to that of five minutes earlier dean and seamus approached harry well done mate it good to see you in one piece err we were wondering if we could borrow your invisibility cloak so we can shoot off to the three broomsticks and get a couple of cases of butterbeer to celebrate yeah sure said harry it in my trunk just be careful with it do you need some money here said rick pulling a handful of galleons out of his pocket and handing them to dean take this we ll sort it out later harry asked ginny shyly do you want to come down to the kitchen with me and see if you we can talk dobby into giving us some party food sure good idea said harry glad of the excuse to get out of the common room for a while and escape all the attention and well meant congratulations of his housemates everyone was very curious about the hover charm and he was finding it awkward trying to answer questions about it music began blaring out as someone turned on a wizard wireless tables and chairs were quickly cleared away from the centre of the room to make a space for dancing it was soon crowded with couples moving energetically to the music hermione grabbed rick arm and dragged him over to an empty corner of the common room you are such a convincing liar rick said hermione with a smirk so harry finally got his wings i take it err yeah answered rick casting an imperturbable charm around them so they couldntbe overheard although it was hardly necessary with all the noise but the rest of the story was pretty much the way it happened about the snitch and harry broom being pulled out from under him he sure picked the right moment to master the animagus transformation it was then or never hermione shook her head harry sure was born under a lucky star well not for some things but when it comes to cheating death he sure was i ve lost count of the number of times he cheated death at voldemort hand but this time i really thought his luck had run out and voldemort had finally taken him either back into the future or in the present time ginny and i have been crying our eyes out for the past hour we were so worried and afraid but where has harry been all this time and you too for that matter err well i found harry or should i say a rather magnificent golden eagle with very distinctive green eyes flying over the forbidden forest actually it was harry who found me he nearly knocked me out of the air he was in a rather exuberant mood enjoying the experience of flying like a bird err he wanted to play it took me a while to convince him we needed to get back to the castle then we had to tell dumbledore that he was ok unfortunately all the heads of house were in his office and snape of course saw right through the hover charm story and was giving poor harry the third degree fortunately professor mcgonagall rose to his defence you should have seen her put snape in his place it was a pleasure to watch i almost felt sorry for the greasy git gosh i wish i d been there said hermione enviously i d loved to have seen that hermione sat deep in thought for a minute or two before speaking again rick i have an idea on how we might possibly get rid of the dementors i not really sure if it will work but i think we should consider it really asked rick in surprise i ve been thinking a lot lately about how to deal with them but so far i ve got nowhere i keep remembering what voldemort said there is no power that can destroy dementors was he wrong have you thought of a way to destroy them no not to destroy them answered hermione it true dementors cannot be killed destroyed or transformed into anything else at least not according to all the books about them in the library so what your idea then asked rick growing more curious we take them out of time to the timeless dimension and leave them there forever rick sat stunned for a moment as doubts and questions appeared in his mind but before he could verbalise them hermione did and provided answers she was miles ahead of him she had obviously been thinking about this a great deal as soon as you mentioned what i well the other hermione in the nightmare reality said about you passing through this timeless dimension when you travel through time i began to wonder if this might be the solution to the dementor problem but i couldntfigure out how we could get them there i mean you cantjust hold their hands like you did with me rick shuddered at the thought voldemort helped us there again said hermione smiling he created that black cloud the time portal which he pulled you and harry through yesterday we need to learn how to create one except ours will be slightly different his had two sides one side in 1997 and the other in 2000 the timeless dimension must have been sandwiched between them because as you discovered you pass through it when you travel through time our portal will have only one side the present time attached to the timeless dimension when the dementors go through it they wontcome out in any other time in fact they wontcome out at all they ll stay in the timeless dimension forever but umm doesntthat mean whenever anyone travels through time they ll have to run the gauntlet of several hundred soul starved dementors just hanging about waiting for someone to enter their dimension no not at all replied hermione confidently this timeless dimension has neither time nor space that means whenever someone travels through time and passes through the timeless dimension they can never be in the same place or in the same time as anyone else it impossible to encounter anyone or anything there that brilliant it might just work said rick with admiration taking hermione hand and giving it an affectionate squeeze oh by the way i already know how to create a time portal added rick really asked hermione in surprise how did you find out from voldemort he really been working overtime at being helpful of late said rick with a grin i read his mind while he was gloating about it i memorized the spell but we still have a couple of problems said rick hesitantly we need to figure out how to adapt voldemort time portal so that it just has a single side in the present time we ll probably need to modify the incantation what incantation did voldemort use asked hermione it was tempus iunctus nunc ad and then what sounded like a time probably the time in this year that he connected it to said rick perhaps if you put nihilum vaccus on the end instead of a time said hermione thoughtfully that means nothing a void ok i can try experimenting with that said rick but there another problem how the hell are we going to get all the dementors to go through the time portal that going to be very tricky and dangerous added hermione sounding worried we d need to set up the time portal somewhere and when the dementors attack and use patronuses to drive them through it yeah sighed rick it sounds risky but it may be the only way hey let stop talking and thinking about dementors look the butterbeer arrived it time to celebrate how about a dance since it not a witches prerogative i guess i allowed to ask you today right i noticed you waited for a nice slow number before asking said hermione teasingly as she allowed rick to lead her towards the space that had been cleared for dancing hmm so you noticed said rick contentedly as he wrapped his arms around hermione waist and drew her close hermione placed her arms around rick neck and rested her head dreamily on his shoulder just enjoying being close to him after several dances ron interrupted them err rick hermione have you got any idea what happened to harry and ginny they went to the kitchens to get food but they ve been gone an awfully long time rick closed his eyes for a few moments before replying i sure they re ok dontworry mate they ll be back soon you know what dobby like when harry around they re probably just having trouble getting away from him the food will be here soon dontworry ron nodded and moved on i dontthink it was the food that ron was worried about whispered hermione giggling as she continued dancing with rick i think he was more worried about what was really detaining harry and i dontmean dobby the house elf i mean ginny the witch i imagine you scanned your marauders map to check they were ok so where are they really asked hermione with a sly grin the room of requirement answered rick laughing oh my exclaimed hermione it seems like ginny has finally got her way with harry i wonder why he changed his mind though i mean it been obvious for ages that he likes ginny but he always keeps her at a distance i sure it because he afraid she d be targeted by voldemort if the two of them got too close i wonder what changed maybe it was the discussion we had in dumbledore office yesterday suggested rick harry been wearing that prophecy like a millstone around his neck all year it really been oppressing him but that mark voldemort put on his forehead tends to destroy the prophecy credibility i mean the prophecy says that harry cantlive while voldemort alive and that he the one that has to kill him but now he knows that he cantlive if he kills voldemort so the prophecy cantbe right that what you and dumbledore were saying yesterday isntit maybe you got through to him yes maybe said hermione a faster number blared out on the wizard wireless and she took rick hand and led him back to the corner where they had been sitting before you know rick said hermione as they sat down together it might also be that harry feeling more confident especially now that he mastered the animagus transformation yeah i dontthink i ve ever seen harry looking as happy as he did after we d been flying together he was in raptures mind you i dontthink we should discount ginny charms she had her heart set on harry for so long now and as time goes by she becoming more and more bold and determined still it could just be another case of quidditch victory and evading voldemort euphoria and tomorrow it will be business as usual and harry pushing ginny away i hope not said hermione earnestly she really loves him you know ginny was heartbroken today when it seemed that voldemort had finally got him harry has so much of the weight of the world on his shoulders it would really do him good to be able to share it with ginny and open up his heart to her he so alone yeah i couldntagree more said rick there is nothing quite as wonderful as love he said smiling fondly at hermione just at that moment the portrait hole swung open and ginny and harry staggered in laden with baskets of food from the house elves hey look here they are now and boy is ginny blushing she going to have to learn not to do that if she wants to keep what going on between her and harry a secret that for sure laughed hermione you can see how happy they both are rick i dontthink we should let on to anyone that we know something going on between them that includes ron and harry harry asked rick puzzled but he already knows obviously yes but if this isntjust quidditch euphoria and i hope it more than that then he ll want to keep it secret for ginny sake for her safety i want to encourage them rick this will be good for them both and the best way to encourage them is to pretend not to notice it obvious isntit asked hermione please take a few moments to leave a review chapter 28 birds of a feather professor dumbledore sent a message to hermione harry and rick requesting that they come to his office after dinner a few days after the gryffindor ravenclaw quidditch match the headmaster congratulated harry on his success with the animagus transformation and in particular his brilliant timing in pulling it off just when he needed it most but he cautioned harry not to fly alone for the time being and suggested that rick accompany him whenever he took to the wing dumbledore was well aware that it would be pointless forbidding harry to fly altogether he was clearly enraptured with it and nothing would hold him back hermione presented her idea for dealing with the dementors by parking them permanently in the timeless dimension dumbledore sat enthralled sucking on a lemon drop as he listened to hermione when she finished speaking he was silent for a minute or two as he stroked his beard looking off into space with unfocussed eyes hermione sat nervously awaiting the headmaster opinion finally he spoke brilliant miss granger simply brilliant it is fascinating is it not that the source of your ingenious idea is your own counterpart in the nightmare reality visited by mr godfry yes professor agreed hermione it would never have occurred to me that rick was transiting a timeless dimension or indeed that such a thing could even exist but then the other hermione did have the advantage of studying physics at university and obviously she d read heaps on quantum mechanics and the like rick had to suppress a laugh hermione was attempting to explain why the other hermione had thought of something which she herself had missed it was almost as if she was in competition with herself she had found another competitor besides rick who had an unfair advantage over her rick could tell from the twinkle in the headmaster eyes that he too was entertaining the same amusing thought hermione said rick smiling at her when i was talking to you i mean her the other hermione in the nightmare reality she was explaining how i was always supposed to have gone back twice to that halloween night when i told her i could have done without the month between in the nightmare reality she said but you never know something might happen or you might learn something in this terrible reality which will be very useful to you when you get back to your own reality how right she was observed dumbledore nodding his head and marvelling at the complexity and seeming intelligence of the universe they all sat silently for a few moments attempting to wrap their minds around the idea that events which occurred in the now non existent nightmare reality could profoundly affect events in this one i believe your adaptation of voldemort spell to create a time portal that leads to the timeless dimension rather than the past or future should work miss granger the problem is going to be getting the dementors to pass through the portal patronuses can be effective in repulsing the vile creatures however from my experience they would have great difficulty herding them in a particular direction particularly if there were hundreds of them attacking together we need to give further consideration to the matter harry and rick spent many happy hours during the following weekends flying together harry appetite for it was insatiable with the approach of spring the days were becoming slowly longer despite this it was still getting dark soon after the end of classes so they were forced to confine their flying to the weekends they would take the secret passages up to the west tower and transform into their respective animagus forms before flying off for hours of sheer joy with the imminent attack on hogwarts coming inexorably closer these shared outings provided a welcome respite from the growing tension they were feeling the flying expeditions also strengthened the bond between them in their animagus forms they quickly forged a means of communicating through movement and gesture and also language the range of noises they could each make was far more subtle and nuanced to their avian ears than it would seem to a human listener the freedom they experienced was indescribable sometimes they flew over the forbidden forest other times they would fly over farmlands lakes and mountains in the afternoons they could usually find a strong updraft over the mountains to lift them high thousands of feet above the earth one sunday afternoon late in march found them riding a thermal high above an unknown mountain in the scottish highlands they were circling together rising higher and higher the mountain top and the upper slopes were still white with snow but is quickly gave way to vast expanses of green forests and then fields which cloaked the earth far beneath in a patchwork quilt of browns yellows and greens suddenly without warning the eagle began tumbling downwards sometimes when one of them spotted prey far below they would dive for it although they never attempted making a kill it was just a game however they were far too high at the moment to spot anything so far below if harry was diving for the sheer joy of it as they sometimes did or to quench his thirst at a stream he would have first communicated his intention rick knew instinctively that something was wrong in a controlled dive harry was like a broad arrow with wings held close to the body and beak pointed downwards he was poetry in motion but now he was tumbling ungraciously earthwards what can i do he asked himself anxiously as he followed harry down i could change into a dragon and try to catch him with my claws no that wontwork i donthave the speed and manoeuvrability as a dragon he d get away from me rick noticed that harry had managed to pull his wings in and was now pretty much in a classic dive although it wasntas gracefulas usual a peregrine falcon can dive faster than a golden eagle so rick decided to get back to earth as quickly as possible and transform he should be able to catch harry the way he did in the quidditch match against slytherin he hoped after transforming rick looked up and spotted the eagle still plummeting downwards he was about to cast a charm to catch it when it slowly spread its wings pulling out of its dive it managed an untidy but satisfactory landing before transforming harry was lying on the ground grasping his forehead and screaming with pain instantly rick understood what had happened voldemort or his minions were attacking somewhere even as an eagle animagus harry connection to voldemort caused him pain where asked rick kneeling down beside his friend diagon alley at least a hundred using cruciatus blurted harry finding it difficult to speak coherently through the pain i ll go and sort them out said rick you stay here no rick i coming with you said harry resolutely taking deep breaths to steady himself this is a huge attack you might need some help harry had of late become increasingly powerful he certainly could look after himself it time to stop keeping him wrapped up in cotton wool thought rick the death eaters would probably have spread out by now up the side alleys and in the shops it would be hard to find them all but harry would draw them out like a magnet i going to make myself invisible before we apparate said rick i going in as the ghost of godric gryffindor but you ll be visible i ll cast a reflecting shield around you so you can save your energy for offence once the death eaters know that you re in diagon alley they ll come to you like bees to honey and i ll be able to squib the lot of them but if things dontgo our way and you re in danger we apparate straight out of there agreed yeah ok agreed harry rising shakily to his feet he took out his wand and with a look of utmost determination held out his hand to rick let go he said rick and harry apparated into diagon alley just in front of madam malkin s the scene that greeted their eyes was horrific witches wizards and even children were lying stunned all over the narrow alley the last few to resist the swarm of black robed masked death eaters were being easily overpowered harry noticed several death eaters using the cruciatus curse they were laughing malevolently as their victims writhed in agony stupefy stupefy cried harry stunning one then another of the death eaters who were using the cruciatus curse it didnttake long for them to notice him soon he was surrounded by an ugly mob of death eaters he was pleased to note that in turning their attention to him they had stopped torturing their victims at least a dozen death eaters immediately attempted to hex harry but were struck down by their own curses courtesy of rick reflecting shield several had used the killing curse they now lay dead on the ground their eyes frozen open in terror death eaters stop cursing potter cried out the magically amplified voice of peter pettigrew he protected by a reflecting shield your curses are rebounding on you it appeared that pettigrew was in charge of this attack he increased the intensity of his sonorous charm and ordered all the death eaters to return from wherever they were to the centre of diagon alley surround potter and start hitting him with non lethal curses try to protect yourselves with a shield if you can he wontbe able to hold that reflecting shield for much longer we ll soon wear him down pettigrew ended the sonorous charm and stepped closer to harry regarding him hungrily well well harry it looks like today is going to be my lucky day after i stun you and deliver you to my master his gratitude to me will be boundless i will be his undisputed favourite the envy of my fellow death eaters he said with a greedy grin he must be running low on death eaters if he has to resort to vermin like you to lead an attack spat harry defiantly the ghost of godric gryffindor must have wiped out every competent death eater if all he could scrape from the bottom of the barrel was a scummy little rat like you stupefy yelled harry pointing his wand at pettigrew pettigrew glared at harry his prosthetic silver hand momentarily glowed leaving a silvery curtain around him harry curse was harmlessly deflected away i have more power than you imagine potter he sneered you re just like your father and black and the rest of them they always underestimated me i used to spy on them at school in my animagus form do you know what they used to say behind my back poor weak little peter well they were wrong the law of the jungle is survival of the fittest and i ve survived them all you betrayed them all you filthy little coward screamed harry enraged you re the reason they re dead you betrayed your friends to save your own miserable skin you think you ve gotten away with your treachery dontyou well you re wrong i ll settle the debt for my parents and sirius you laughed pettigrew you had the chance to get rid of me three years ago in the shrieking shack but you didnthave the guts you couldntdo it you re just like your parents and black too soft to survive in this hard cruel world they all thought i was the weak one but surprise surprise i was the only one who turned out to be tough enough to make it gloated pettigrew no harry he sneered triumphantly you wontsurvive either nor will you be settling any debts because your luck just ran out on you oh and in case you re expecting the ghost of godric gryffindor to come to your rescue you can forget it my master knows there no ghost of godric gryffindor he realised some time ago that it was really dumbledore making himself invisible and pretending to be the ghost unfortunately for you dumbledore attending a meeting at the ministry of magic this afternoon even more unfortunately before we attacked diagon alley a group of death eaters surrounded the ministry they are currently warding it so that no one can leave dumbledore trapped inside he cant apparate floo or even portkey out clever isntit said pettigrew smirking at harry squibbus the ethereal voice of the ghost of godric gryffindor boomed out no pettigrew not so clever at all your evil demented master got it wrong again it seems dumbledore may indeed be at the ministry of magic but the ghost of godric gryffindor is certainly here in diagon alley and at your service oh yes and i just squibbed you along with the other now let me see it must be one hundred and twenty seven death eaters does that sound right to you there were thirty five in various shops and alleyways whom i squibbed while you were exchanging pleasantries with harry and there are ninety three here including yourself whom i ve just blessed with my favourite curse i hope i ve accounted for them all i d really hate to miss anyone as the ghost was speaking pettigrew and his fellow death eaters were attempting to apparate away but to no avail then they frantically tried various spells none of which worked of course it became painfully clear to them that they had indeed been transformed into detestable squibs they stood stunned looking stupidly at each other wondering what to do suddenly pettigrew began to wail d dementors help p please p please protect us from the d dementors they ll s suck out our s souls h help help he wailed woefully dementors what are you talking about pettigrew demanded the ghost d dementors are coming howled pettigrew shaking with fear his mousy little eyes darting hither and thither after we had s stunned everyone the d dementors were going to come and s suck out their s souls our m master w wanted to reward them for their l loyalty w we were s supposed to apparate away first but now we can t they ll s suck out our s souls as well cried pettigrew fearfully the sky grew suddenly darker and a bitter chill engulfed them around fifty dementors descended upon the alley they immediately started for the squibbed death eaters harry was surprised when they didnt go for the unfortunate people lying stunned on the ground they would have been easier prey but what dementors crave are feelings and emotions those who were still conscious the squibs were reeking of fear and immediately attracted the despicable dementors the stunned ones would keep for later the dementors lowered their hoods eager to begin their feeding frenzy expecto patronum yelledharry focussing on the joyful feeling of flying as an animagus eagle his stag patronus burst from his wand and lowering its antlers began charging the dementors harry spun around as he heard the words expecto patronum repeated from behind him harry was stunned at the menagerie of patronuses that erupted from rick invisible wand the dementors fled before them wow said harry in awe and i though my patronus was impressive i think most of the dementors have gone whispered rick but i saw about half a dozen fleeing up knockturn alley there no one up there for them to kiss so i want to leave them there for now and try a little experiment i going to try to create a single sided time portal across the entrance to knockturn alley then i ll apparate in behind the dementors and cast some patronuses to drive them down knockturn alley towards diagon alley and through the portal ok replied harry softly speaking out of the side of his mouth he didntwant people to notice him talking to himself if rita skeeter got wind of it she d have a field day he could already see the headlines harry potter the boy who lost it i ll check out the people stunned by the death eaters and make sure they re alright said harry softly rick concentrated hard on creating the time portal tempus iunctus nunc ad nihilum vaccus he intoned waving his wand atthe junction where knockturn alley joined onto diagon alley a shimmering fabric came from his wand it was transparent with a faint blue tinge initially it was only about a metre square but rick found it could easily be stretched to the required size and shape he had just attached the last corner when the terrible waves of coldness fear and misery hit him rick had been facing up knockturn alley keeping an eye out for the dementors in case they came before he was ready for them but what he didntknow was that there were another five dementors still in diagon alley they had been driven up the leaky cauldron end and had been hidden around the corner the fact that rick was invisible was immaterial to the dementors it was feelings and emotions that guided them to their prey it was fortunate for those lying stunned in the alley that rick emotional energy was much greater than theirs in their unconscious state the dementors bypassed them and glided straight towards rick coming up behind him as rick struggled to keep his feet the stench of rotting flesh assailed him the hideous rattling behind him grew louder and louder the cold was unbearable rick tried to turn to face the horrible creatures but he stumbled and fell to the ground he saw the evil dementors looming above him throwing back their hoods eager to begin their obscene feast rick knew his only hope now was to transform but he didnthave enough energy left even for that expecto patronum he heard harry bellowing from what seemed a long way away but it didnttake long for harry stag patronus to reach him it charged at the dementors and they fled up knockturn alley rick began to feel better as the terrible cold and misery left him he managed to struggle to his feet harry was running towards him rick said harry softly gasping to catch his breath are you here are you ok yeah i ok now replied rick there must have been more dementors down the end of diagon alley they came up behind me and caught me unawares they completely overpowered me if it hadnt been for your patronus they d have had my soul thanks mate you just save my life glad to return the favour said harry but i think i ve got a long way to go to catch up with you dont worry about it mate replied rick now that interesting when your patronus attacked those dementors they went right through the time portal but the wrong way nothing happened to them at all it as if it wasntthere they just kept on going up knockturn alley towards the other dementors umm what did you expect to happen asked harry i dontknow replied rick i ll have to ask hermione about it i sure she ll be able to explain it now let me just check that there are no other dementors around here apart from those ones up knockturn alley i dontwant any more surprises like that rick closed his eyes for a moment projecting a map before he spoke again yep that it there are just the eleven of them they re out the front of borgin and burkes i going to apparate to the other side of them and let some patronuses loose on them maybe you should position yourself a bit further away from here maybe outside gambol and japes just in case the time portal doesntwork that will give you plenty of time to hit them with a patronus ok but be careful mate said harry before heading off up diagon alley rick plan worked perfectly he apparated behind the dementors and cast his patronuses before they had a chance to detect him rick directed some of the patronuses to stay above the dementors to prevent them escaping upwards into the air he followed close behind as the dementors fled down knockturn alley and right through his time portal where they completely disappeared rick decided to follow them through to see if hermione was right as usual she was of course it was exactly like when he twisted his wand to travel through time he was in the timeless dimension and he was there completely alone there were no dementors there was just his mind and nothing else rick returned to the present time and destroyed the time portal he didntwant anyone walking through it he found harry outside gambol and japes and told him what happened that great rick said harry i was looking at the end of knockturn alley the whole time and no dementors came out you must have done it hermione going to be really happy when she hears but we have other problems while you were constructing the portal i was ennervating some of the stunned people the ones i revived began helping out i told them all to apparated away just in case any more dementors show up but there are some people that couldntbe revived maybe you ought to take a look at them rick rick and harry found two wizards three witches and four young children who couldntbe revived it the cruciatus curse said rick they look just the same as hermione parents did after they were attacked by death eaters that night thank goodness they haventbeen kissed by dementors he said sounding relieved you mean you can do something for them asked harry hopefully no said rick shaking his head i can t i dontknow how to reverse this but hermione does she developed amazing healing powers so that why her parents didntend up like neville s said harry hermione healed them didntshe yeah that right replied rick we need to get these people back to hogwarts so hermione can work her healing magic on them can you get them all laid out side by side with their hands touching i going to pay a quick visit to the ministry of magic i ll squib the death eaters who are maintaining the wards there and trapping everyone inside it shouldnttake too long rick was only gone a few minutes harry gave a start when rick voice suddenly began whispering that twelve more squibs to add to today tally i apparated inside the ministry of magic and had a quick word with dumbledore he said not to take these people to the hospital wing he doesntwant word to get out that hermione is able to heal people in this condition if the death eaters find out they ll realise that she healed her parents and go after them again also if they know people can recover from the prolonged use of the cruciatus curse they ll start killing them outright with the killing curse yeah makes sense replied harry and voldemort would try even harder to kill hermione so what are we going to do with them dumbledore already apparated to the shrieking shack he said he ll have the lounge looking like a hospital ward in no time so we re going to apparate them straight there said rick taking hold of harry hand harry was already holding on to the hand of one of their patients rick left harry to help professor dumbledore get the patients into the waiting beds at the shrieking shack he made himself invisible and apparated to the corridor outside the gryffindor common room projecting his magical map he was happy to find hermione inside after checking he was alone he made himself visible and entered hermione was packing away her books and about to head down for dinner rick where have you been all afternoon and where harry was he with you she asked in a rush you ve got to come with me immediately hermione i ll answer all your questions later ok whispered rick in her ear rick is harry alright she asked imploringly harry fine now come on we ve got to go but later said rick pulling hermione to her feet and giving her a quick kiss he knew how much she hated not knowing what was going on but there wasnttime now he took her hand and led her out of the common room and down to the entrance hall rick she snapped impatiently what is going on and where are you taking me we re going to the shrieking shack replied rick once they were out of the castle and heading across the grounds towards the whomping willow there was a death eater attack in diagon alley this afternoon nine people including four little children were held under the cruciatus curse for too long harry and dumbledore are with them now in the shrieking shack they look just like your parents did do you think you can heal them umm i should be able to i think i wouldntbe able to establish an empathetic magic link the way i could with my parents but i shouldntneed to now that i know what the problem is and how to fix it but why werentthey brought to the hospital wing oh i suppose dumbledore doesntwant madam pomfrey or anyone else to know that i can heal people who have been held under the cruciatus curse like that it would endanger my parents and death eaters would start killing people instead that what i love about you hermione said rick affectionately as he stopped the whomping willow from threshing about by flicking his finger towards the knot at its base i never have to explain things to you because you figure them out before i get the chance have i told you lately that you are one very smart witch said rick putting an arm around hermione and kissing her how very touching came a snide voice from right behind them as they were about to enter the tunnel beneath the whomping willow they spun around to find themselves face to face with professor snape and it was a very smug and self satisfied face i always find sunday evenings such a profitable time to patrol the hogwarts grounds he said in a casual tone his lips curled in a malevolent smile it always seems to encourage an abnormal amount of inappropriate behaviour but professor protested hermione we werentdoing anything inappropriate we werenteven snogging and it well before curfew we are perfectly entitled to be outside at this time of day but you are not entitled to leave the hogwarts grounds i do not know how you disabled the whomping willow he said glaring suspiciously at rick but it is obvious that you were about to enter the tunnel which you have known about since your third year miss granger it doesntrequire a great deal of imagination to guess that you were on your way to the shrieking shack for a lovers tryst do you deny it miss granger yes i do deny it yelled hermione glaring defiantly at snape dont raise your voice to me and dontlie to me either said snape in a slow menacing voice your lie will cost gryffindor an additional twenty points on top of the fifty points i am deducting for each of you for attempting to leave the hogwarts grounds without permission but we do have permission sir said rick oh really mr godfry said snape sarcastically kindly produce your note then if you have one i donthave a note sir but professor dumbledore asked me to bring hermione to the shrieking shack he waiting for her now and it urgent i dontthink he ll be very happy to hear that you prevented us from following his instructions what utter tripe snarled snape i ve had more than enough of your impertinence godfry you are both to return to the castle immediately in addition to the one hundred and twenty house points i have deducted from gryffindor you just lost another twenty for your insolence you will both be serving a four hour detention in my dungeon starting now i am sure i can find some suitably unsavoury tasks to occupy you both i sorry sir but we have to obey the headmaster orders said rick determinedly i sure he will be happy to verify that i am telling the truth if you ask him alright godfry said snape calling ricks bluff after you he said gesturing to the entrance of the tunnel his lips twisting into an ugly smirk err i wasntmeaning that you should ask him now stammered rick i meant i dontcare what you were meaning black err godfry right now will be perfect unless of course you think professor dumbledore is no longer at the shrieking shack he said his voice dripping with sarcasm it was clear to rick from snape slip of the tongue in calling him black that he was reliving his old enmity with sirius black this was in fact the very spot where snape had almost died as a result of the trick sirius had played upon him snape was once again projecting his hatred of sirius onto him err i dontthink professor dumbledore wants you to come to the shrieking shack right now sir said rick nervously and why not mr godfry snarled snape furiously rick realised that there was no way he could convince snape to let him and hermione go on alone hermione said rick quickly duck into the tunnel and get going i think i can to sort this out by myself but before she could move snape whipped out his wand donteither of you move or i ll expelliarmus said rick without drawing his wand or even moving snape flew several feet through the air landing unceremoniously on his backside he looked up at rick with an expression of stunned fury on his face go hermione now shouted rick get in the tunnel and out of sight hermione didntneed to be told a second time she already knew what rick had in mind she dived into the tunnel entrance while snape was struggling angrily to his feet rick positioned himself in the mouth of the tunnel here your wand sir he said throwing it back to snape but just as snape wrapped his fingers around it rick made himself invisible and said obliviate he reached out an invisible hand and pressed the knot to re activate the whomping willow snape expression of anger changed to one of bewilderment as he stood disoriented clutching his wand unfortunately he was standing a little too close to the whomping willow before he had time to realise this consider the likely consequences and take evasive action he received a massive whack from one of the tree wild branches which sent him sailing through the air to land in a heap some distance away rick you re terrible whispered hermione as snape struggled to his feet and began limping groggily back towards the castle i hope he not badly hurt yeah me too said rick i honestly didntintend to get him beaten up by the whomping willow it didntoccur to me i had to reactivate it before he recovered from the memory charm honestly rick said hermione as she followed him along the tunnel you really have to stop memory charming snape like that if he ever discovers what you ve done there ll be hell to pay yeah i know sighed rick but he so damn suspicious and he such a difficult git it really the only way to deal with him sometimes did you notice him calling me black back there he did it at the yule ball too i took a peek at what he was thinking at the time rick scolded hermione then after a moment her curiosity got the better of her well go on she said what was he thinking for some reason i remind him of sirius black snape hated sirius and james potter when he was at school with them it was partly because of the tricks they played on him but mainly because he was jealous of them the witches used to swoon over the pair of them but they never wanted to have anything to do with snape it got him really twisted up inside and probably contributed to his becoming a death eater and now he reliving his hatred of sirius black through me said rick sighing hmm yes i can see it now said hermione the witches certainly do swoon over you my prince charming she said smiling fondly at rick and of course the entrance to this tunnel is where snape was almost torn apart by a savage werewolf because of sirius black i guess it must bring back very unpleasant memories for him yeah and makes him very unpleasant to me said rick well here we are after you he said as they reached the end of the tunnel hermione climbed out of the hole in the floor and looked around in surprise the last time she had been in this room three years ago it had been disorderly and dusty with paper peeling off the walls and stains all over the floor the furniture had all been smashed but the sight that met her eyes today was very different in fact it looked suspiciously like one of the wards in the hogwarts hospital wing there were nine beds arranged in neat rows and everything was clean and tidy the room had obviously been magically enlarged the only clue that they were in the shrieking shack was the windows which remained boarded up ah miss granger very nice to see you said the headmaster warmly i believe we have found an urgent use for your newly acquired healing talents he said gesturing towards the unconscious patients as rick came out of the hole in the floor harry grinned at him what took you so long rick you said you d be back here with hermione in ten minutes did you get distracted along the way rick blushed as he noticed professor dumbledore raise his eyebrows and the corners of his mouth turn up as he tried to hide a smile which was betrayed by the amused twinkling of his eyes they must both think we ve been off snogging again just like that time at hogsmeade station thought rick as he noticed hermione blushing as well err yeah answered rick well not so much distracted as detained by snape err professor snape i mean he caught us just as we were about to enter the tunnel beneath the whomping willow he thought we were sneaking off for a err some inappropriate behaviour were the words he used i think how very awkward said dumbledore looking most amused i shall have to have a little chat with professor snape and request him not to deduct house points from gryffindor or have you serving detentions i sure i ll be able to straighten out any misunderstanding no err please don t said rick quickly i i mean there no need for you to talk with professor snape err about it i mean we err we sorted it out already i dont think he ll be deducting house points or anything like that sir i hope you didntdivulge your true purpose in leaving the school grounds to him said dumbledore feigning concern no sir replied rick nervously he has no idea what we were really up to it is most fortunate that he allowed you to proceed and leave the school grounds under the circumstances you must be very persuasive mr godfry added the headmaster with an inscrutable smile but now i believe we have serious work to do miss granger may i suggest that you start with the youngest ones hermione seated herself beside a little boy who looked to be no more than three years old a tear ran down her cheek as she looked at the small unconscious body what kind of monsters could do this to such a young child she asked in a shaking voice sadly miss granger this is the nature of evil said dumbledore his face darkening it has no heart no compassion nor any feeling for the suffering of others on the contrary voldemort and his followers view such emotions as a manifestation of weakness this is what we are fighting against make no mistake about it if voldemort should win our world would very soon be transformed into a nightmare world just like the one mr godfry witnessed firsthand the stakes in the battle between good and evil are enormous he said in a calm but sober voice rick stood next to hermione and placed an arm around her shoulder giving her a comforting hug right she said determinedly let get on with it she placed her hands on either side of the little boy head and concentrated hard after several minutes the little boy eyes suddenly opened they were wide with fear obliviate said rick quickly before stunning him what did you just do to him rick asked harry curiously as hermione moved on to the next child hermione discovered that what causes people to go into a coma like this is fear explained rick it not actually the pain of the cruciatus curse but the fear it creates fear that the pain will never end the mind tries to protect itself from the fear by switching itself off it hibernates hermione has learned how to force the mind out of its hibernation before the brain cells begin to die off yeah but why did you memory charm and stun the little boy asked harry we figured that when they regain consciousness they ll immediately remember the terrible pain of the cruciatus curse it will seem like it was happening just moments ago they ll be so full of fear and terror that their minds might hibernate again even if they don t they ll be traumatised take a look at their eyes when they first wake up i obliviate them immediately to make them forget about being under the cruciatus curse i just stunning them so they dontsee what we re doing they re probably related and it would be very upsetting to see their parents or other members of their family in a coma when we ve done them all we ll ennervate them together rick had been watching the little girl hermione was working on while he was talking to harry her eyes had just opened in terror rick quickly memory charmed and stunned her hermione had already turned her attention to the third child it took about half an hour for her to heal all nine please do not ennervate them just yet said professor dumbledore i think it would be best if the three of you were to return to school first i do not wish anyone to connect their recovery with miss granger or any of you for that matter i will ennervate them and explain that they were injured in the death eater attack at diagon alley and brought here to hogsmeade to receive medical attention i will not of course mention the nature of the curse they suffered as a result of mr godfry excellent memory charms they will not recall it either i will accompany them to the three broomsticks from where they will be able to floo to their homes you have a great gift miss granger said dumbledore looking at hermione with admiration when this war is finally over and it is no longer necessary to be so secretive you will i believe be honoured as one of the greatest healers in magical history but for now you will have to be content with my deepest gratitude thank you professor said hermione bashfully for once in her life she was at a loss for words and thank you mr godfry for your assistance he said turning to rick memory charms are notoriously difficult to get right they can be highly dangerous if not applied correctly you are indeed a master of the art i do hope however that you will always be judicious in their use and only employ them in appropriate situations he added his blue eyes twinkling mischievously please take a few moments to leave a review chapter 29 the great cover up when harry entered the great hall for breakfast on monday morning he immediately noticed it was much noisier than usual he was a bit late and the hall was already packed with students he hadnt gotten very far into the hall before he was spotted the noise level increased dramatically and almost every head turned towards him hundreds of pairs of eyes followed him as he made his way self consciously to the gryffindor table he sat down gratefully next to ron who had saved him a place ron grinned at harry oddly his head slightly cocked to one side as he pushed a copy of the daily prophet towards him quickly swallowing a mouthful of sausage he clapped harry on the shoulder hey mate why didntyou tell me about your run in with those death eaters and the dementors in diagon alley yesterday blimey if i want to know what you re up to these days i have to read about it in the daily prophet you might want take a look if even half of what it says here is true you were bloody brilliant although he was trying to hide it behind his rough manner harry could tell that ron was hurt he had been left out of things a lot lately i sorry mate but by the time i got back last night it was late and i was exhausted i went straight to bed it was a real struggle dragging myself out of bed this morning said harry piling a couple of pieces of toast some sausages and bacon onto his plate before looking at the paper the headline was huge death eater attack on diagon alley routed by harry potter and mystery ghost most of the article was wildly inaccurate hardly surprising thought harry considering who wrote it rita skeeter she had clearly changed her tack from last year when she had questioned his sanity at every opportunity now she couldntpile the superlatives high enough as she placed him on a hero pedestal harry sighed thinking i think i liked it better when she was calling me a loony halfway down the page was an old picture of harry taken at the wand weighing ceremony for the triwizard tournament in his fourth year the caption beneath it was vintage rita the boy who lived teams up with the ghost who squibbed harry groaned and pushed the paper away in disgust so were you really in diagon alley yesterday asked ron and did you really see off a hundred dementors single handedly come on ron you know better by now than to believe anything written by rita bloody skeeter said harry looking around and noticing everyone within earshot hanging on his words i ll tell you about it later somewhere a bit more private ok mate he said softly in ron ear after dinner that night harry hermione and rick were sitting together in a corner of the gryffindor common room of late their conversations seemed to revolve around a single topic dementors and how to get rid of them rick success in disposing of eleven dementors in diagon alley the previous day was very encouraging if they could just get the dementors to go through a time portal they would be rid of them but try as they might they were still no closer to coming up with a strategy for funnelling hundreds of the evil creatures through a portal harry noticed ron approaching them and then turn away when he saw them deep in conversation harry felt a pang of guilt at the way ron was becoming estranged from him hermione and rick it wasnt anything deliberate mainly it was because dumbledore always insisted on keeping everything secret harry understood the headmaster reasoning but he hated the way it was affecting his friendship with ron who he feared was beginning to take it personally we re really stumped on this one said harry what do you two think about letting ron in on what we re trying to do maybe he ll have some ideas hermione and rick both understood harry feelings about ron they felt the same way that a really good idea replied hermione ron really been left out a lot of late we ve always done things together it just doesntseem right without him plus he has a different way of seeing things which can be very useful sometimes do you think we should ask professor dumbledore if it ok we could ask dumbledore first said rick or we could just do it we seem to be going round and round in circles on this dementor disposal plan ron a very strategic thinker he might spot something we ve missed or find some new angle yeah why dontwe just do it said harry waving to ron to come and join them err hi said ron awkwardly sitting down next to harry across the table from rick and hermione so what exactly did happen in diagon alley yesterday he asked turning to harry you said at breakfast you d tell me about it how come you were in diagon alley anyway and how the hell did you get there harry looked away from ron and turned his gaze uncomfortably towards rick raising his eyebrows questioningly i took him there said rick i can apparate i apparated with harry to diagon alley yesterday but you re underage objected ron with a suspicious expression on his face you canthave an apparition licence yet and how come the ministry haventpicked you up for apparating without a licence and underage magic demanded ron err i ve found a way to stop them from detecting me said rick with a nervous smile he was glad that he d already cast an imperturbable charm around their corner of the common room ron only seemed to have two volumes loud and louder ron looked back at harry so let me get this straight your scar began hurting when the death eaters attacked diagon alley and you apparated there with rick right err yeah pretty much said harry not wanting to mention the fact that he and rick were flying in their animagus forms at the time he and hermione had told ron nothing about their animagus training and eventual success with the transformation since it was completely illegal dumbledore had insisted upon keeping it secret ron turned back towards rick i dontrecall reading anything in the prophet about you being there rick it only mentioned harry and the ghost of godric gryffindor so how is that err well because i used an invisibility charm to hide myself said rick attempting to avoid ron suspicious gaze ron sat deep in thought for several minutes occasionally looking at one or other of his companions but mainly staring hard at rick through narrowed eyes suddenly he sat up straight in his seat and whacked himself on the forehead with his right hand before pointing it accusingly across the table at rick you re the bleeding ghost of godric gryffindor arentyou rick thankful once more for the imperturbable charm he d cast rick confirmed ron assertion with a silent nod and an embarrassed smile he hated the way he had to hide things and deceive people especially his friends he felt particularly uncomfortable when he got caught out like this he was unable to look ron in the eye bloody hell exclaimed ron pounding a fist on the table what a great flaming fool i ve been it so bloody obvious now why didnti spot it sooner you ve never been there when the ghost was around i remember the first time when malfoy slimy git of a father got squibbed you claimed you d been asleep in your bed and you were nowhere around that night in the great hall when fudge turned up with that bloody traitor of a brother of mine percy and all his aurors when umbridge got it i sorry ron said rick apologetically but dumbledore told me to keep it secret i wanted to tell you no need to apologise mate said ron leaning over the table and slapping rick energetically on the back your ghost impersonation was fan bloody tastic it the most brilliant magic i ve ever seen and that squibbus curse it bloody amazing you have my eternal gratitude mate for the way you squibbed malfoy dad boy if ever there was a slimy git crying out to be squibbed it was him and that cow umbridge she desperately deserved it too well done mate i proud of you err thanks mate said rick modestly relieved that ron was taking it so well and the way you gave that twit trelawney a dressing down too you really put one over on her it was bloody hilarious what was the message the ghost had for her oh yeah i remember do not disturb and dontcall us we ll call you that was so funny mate fred and george were rolling around the floor when i told them about trelawney s ance it was bloody brilliant yeah i have to admit i really enjoyed myself that night said rick laughing so that explains how the ghost always knows when there a death eater attack said ron thinking it through harry scar starts hurting and he sees the attack then he tells you where it is and you apparate off as the ghost and squib all the death eaters you know who must be getting royally pissed off by now with all the death eaters he lost i sincerely hope so said rick grinning but what happened to you that day at hogsmeade station when we were attacked the ghost did show up eventually and take care of the death eaters but it wasntuntil five or ten minutes after the attack began we really had a fight on our hands we sure could have done with your help a lot sooner mate where the hell did you get to you were right there on the train with us just before the attack err i d really rather not go into that right now ron said rick blushing ron noticed that hermione was bushing even more than rick he looked at her enquiringly err ron stammered hermione awkwardly attempting to extricate rick and herself from the uncomfortable direction the conversation was taking and getting it back on track we ve got an urgent problem which has us all stumped we were wondering if you might be able to help solve it shoot said ron always ready to take on a perplexing puzzle or search for a solution to a difficult problem he completely missed how adroitly hermione had changed the subject on him by baiting him with a challenge well the problem is dementors said hermione they are going to attack hogwarts hundreds of them we think and soon how can you know that asked ron shivering at the thought of a massive dementor attack oh never mind i should know better by now than asking questions that dumbledore probably told you not to answer hmm so how about using patronuses to drive them off that just a short term solution replied rick we could probably hold them off with patronuses for a while but patronuses dont weaken dementors they ll keep coming back there probably going to be hundreds of the evil creatures and they can come at you from any direction they want it just takes one to sneak up on you and get close enough to affect you and you re finished you cantcast your patronus you re defenceless dead worse than dead so what hope is there asked ron glumly biting his bottom lip and shaking his head from side to side with worry hermione told ron about the time portal and explained her idea of using it to maroon the dementors permanently in the timeless dimension wow said ron now there an interesting idea but how do you know it will work because i ve already tried it on some of the dementors in diagon alley yesterday replied rick he described how he d placed the portal over the entrance to knockturn alley and then used patronuses to drive the dementors through it and they just disappeared asked ron incredulously yeah exactly confirmed harry i was watching from the other side of the portal not a single dementor came through it into diagon alley the problem mate is how to drive hundreds of them through a time portal the ones rick experimented on yesterday were trapped in knockturn alley there were patronuses behind them and above them as well they had nowhere to go but down the alley and through the portal but when they appear here at hogwarts they ll be able to go wherever they want dumbledore reckons that patronuses wontbe able to herd them not when there are hundreds of them and they can go off in any direction do you know how the dementors are going to get into hogwarts asked ron how can they get past the wards voldemort planning on opening some kind of spatial portal for them to come through said hermione by the way it wontjust be dementors there will be other dark creatures attacking as well bloody hell what kind of dark creatures asked ron nervously we dontreally know answered hermione probably whichever ones he has on his side like giants trolls acromantulas banshees manticores vampires that sort of thing blimey we re stuffed said ron turning white and letting out a dispirited sigh no we re not said rick firmly trust me i can take care of the dark creatures all of them except for the dementors they re the real problem the ones we need to focus on they fell into silence for a several minutes as they wracked their brains for ideas i dontsuppose you know where you know who is going to put this portal thing do you asked ron half heartedly hermione shook her head presumably it will be somewhere within the hogwarts ward line but that covers such a vast area it doesntreally narrow it down very much at all pity said ron if we knew exactly where it would be we could put the time portal right in front of it the dementors and all the other dark creatures would simply vanish we re not going to know where voldemort spatial portal is until his dark creatures start spewing out of it said harry yeah that right added rick and once we know where it is we wonthave time to shape our time portal to the right dimensions and position it especially if we re under a dementors attack he added with a shiver so can you make this time portal any shape you want asked ron yeah i think so answered rick it not something physical although you can see it just it a spell which occupies a two dimensional space once it created i can use a stretching spell to make it whatever size and shape i want and then use a binding spell to attach it could you make it a mile long and a mile wide asked ron half lost in thought i cantsee why not replied rick i think i can make it as big as i want what are you thinking ron asked hermione eagerly are you thinking of positioning a time portal over the hogwarts castle and grounds so the dementors will have to pass through it when they come to attack that might work you know although we d have to make sure voldemort spatial portal wasntwithin it or it would defeat the whole purpose that going to be difficult since we dontknow where his portal will be plus it would be extremely dangerous anyone accidentally passing through it would disappear forever no hermione said ron grinning hogwarts isntwhere i was thinking of placing it at all that would be the equivalent in chess of setting a trap within your own lines and waiting for the enemy to attack and fall into it it a good strategy but it can be dangerous if you miscalculate or make a mistake you usually end up losing my preferred strategy is to take the attack into the enemy territory that what i was thinking we could do take the time portal to azkaban and lower it right over the top of the island instead of trying to get the dementors to move through the portal we move the portal through them the other three were temporarily speechless as they absorbed ron extraordinary idea rick was the first to recover that absolutely brilliant mate that really might work azkaban is basically a gigantic rock sticking up out of the sea all the places where the dementors could be hanging out are well above sea level if we dropped the portal down onto azkaban with the timeless zone facing upwards and lower it down to sea level it would pass through every place where there were dementors they would all effectively pass through it that right said hermione excitedly in theory it should work wont the prison and the whole island vanish along with the dementors asked harry the boys all turned expectantly to hermione no i dontthink so she said as far as i know only living things can travel through time the dementors will vanish but inanimate objects like the prison buildings and the island itself shouldntbe affected do we know how big it will need to be asked harry if i remember the dimensions correctly from the wizarding world atlas the island is about half a mile long and almost as wide but how are we going to get the portal to azkaban and how will we position it over the island asked hermione four of us will fly it out there on brooms answered ron with a grin ron i am not going to fly all the way out to azkaban on a broom i a terrible flyer and you know it i d fall off before i got even half way there you can just forget that idea right now said hermione narrowing her eyes and glaring at him ron laughed hermione i said four of us not us four i didntthink for a moment that you would be one of the four i know you dontlike flying and nothing personal but we need four people with excellent broom skills we ll find someone else to fly with us to azkaban yeah like ginny said harry she a brilliant flyer and we can trust ginny to keep quiet about it yeah mate said ron turning on harry and giving him a penetrating look harry had inadvertently touched on something which was a very sore point with ron and he was instantly sidetracked from the serious matters under discussion like the way she keeps quiet about where she always disappearing to in the evenings for example she refuses point blank to tell me in fact she gets downright shirty with me whenever i ask her where she been funny thing is harry i just noticed lately that you seem to disappear as well at exactly the same time so how exactly would you explain that demanded ron belligerently err ron it began harry but he was cut off by an infuriated hermione you should learn to mind your own business ron and leave ginny to mind hers she old enough and quite capable of looking after herself without any help from an over protective mother hen of a big brother like you and anyway you sneak off in the evenings just as much as ginny i wonder if padma just happens to be sneaking off at the same time demanded hermione sarcastically that that different mumbled ron defensively withering under three pairs of accusing eyes because demanded hermione well because padma not my little sister for one thing said ron defensively i glad to hear that mate said rick laughing attempting to ease the tension err ron can we try to stay focussed on the dementors please ginny honour and your well intended if unsought efforts at defending it somehow pale into insignificance when one contemplates hogwarts over run by dementors wouldnt you agree yeah alright said ron giving harry a final glare so where were we then flying off to azkaban with rick time portal said hermione quickly before ron could get back to attacking harry i can see two distinct dangers with your plan ron firstly if anyone but rick should accidentally pass through the portal in the active direction which is from beneath they ll be lost forever in the timeless dimension with no way of getting back or any hope of rescue the other problem will be dementors the front pair will have to over fly the island or at least pass right along its sides that will be close enough for the dementors to sense them and come after them the four of them lapsed into a long silence which was finally broken by harry sirius said that when he was in his animagus dog form in azkaban he hardly felt the dementors and they didntsense him that how he escaped so rick what if you and i yeah i know exactly what you re thinking mate and you re dead right said rick when i rescued hermione from azkaban the dementors didntseem to sense me at all after i transformed of course said hermione hang on hang on the lot of you yelled ron holding up both hands what is all this about rescuing hermione from azkaban and animagus transformations he demanded looking intensely at rick well when voldemort abducted hermione at christmas she was being held at azkaban explained rick that where i went to rescue her err by the way i an animagus ron look mate dumbledore made us promise not to talk about the rescue so please dontpress me on it ok the point is that harry and i can fly in the lead in our animagus forms bloody hell are you an animagus too demanded ron turning towards harry in amazement err yeah mate replied harry turning away from ron intense gaze and feeling very uncomfortable at having hidden it from him a golden eagle but dumbledore insisted that i keep it secret it completely illegal i really wanted to tell you but of course it all so bleeding obvious now i always thought that story about you using a hover charm to come down after your broom got yanked out from under you in the quidditch match was a load of old cobblers you bloody well transformed into an eagle and flew off didntyou yeah that right said harry grinning at ron actually that was the very first time i ever succeeded with the transformation although i d been working on it for months the first time you re amazing mate replied ron shaking his head in disbelief they dontcall you the boy who lived for nothing i dontknow how many times you ve defied death just by the skin of your teeth it too many to count so that explains why you three were disappearing almost every evening after we came back from the christmas holidays was mcgonagall giving the three of you animagus training no replied rick mcgonagall told dumbledore she thought harry and hermione might be able to master the animagus transformation but they are below the legal age and anyway there so much red tape that it simply isntpossible to do it legally anymore dumbledore knew mcgonagall would feel uncomfortable about getting involved in anything illegal being such a prim and proper sort so he err asked me to teach them err i was already an animagus so have you mastered the transformation too asked ron turning to hermione well of course i have replied hermione sounding piqued as if ron was insinuating that she wasntup to it i a fox congratulations both of you that bloody impressive said ron but his voice betrayed mixed emotions he felt genuine happiness and admiration for his friends remarkable achievement but it was tempered by a deep sense of envy and a feeling of missing out yet again and not measuring up it was a recurring theme in ron life being the youngest of six brothers all of whom had excelled and succeeded in their chosen course in life even the twins with their joke shop and their weasley wizarding wheezes so err getting back to azkaban said rick breaking the awkward silence that followed as ron looked from harry to hermione with a forced grin if harry and i are in front in our bird animagus forms the dementors wontsense us or affect us as we fly along the sides of the island i can magically attach long ropes to each corner of the time portal that will allow us to keep our distance from it which should help to avoid any nasty accidents the other benefit is that ron and ginny wontneed to cross azkaban or come too close to the island and the dementors it still going to be risky but it might just work said hermione it the only plan we have with any chance of success so i think we re going to have to give it a try i ll ask ginny if she wants to be in on it said harry i ll only tell her as much as she needs to know ginny will be ok with that she trusts me ron glared at harry again but before he could make a comment rick rushed in i ll go talk to dumbledore and see what he thinks of the plan err ron i know there are lots of things bugging you right now and you ve been left out a lot lately but there something you need to know getting rid of the dementors is absolutely critical to winning the war if we cantget rid of them we ll lose it as simple as that this plan of yours if it works will be the difference between winning and losing it will be remembered as the strategy that won the war you can be very proud of yourself mate that absolutely right ron said hermione smiling at him encouragingly if we dontget rid of the dementors hogwarts will be destroyed everything will be lost yeah mate said harry we ve been going round and round in circles on this one we just couldntfigure out a way to get rid of the dementors and neither could dumbledore your plan is bloody brilliant ron blushed beneath the praise of his friends and looked down at the table silently for a while yeah he said finally looking up let just hope to hell it works yeah mate said harry smiling at him and holding up both hands with his fingers crossed keep your fingers crossed and hope for the best i hope you enjoyed this nice quiet chapter ron outbursts excepted this was the calm before the storm from here on it non stop action all the way to the final curse this fic is now complete there are 4 more chapters plus an epilogue which i will post as quickly as i get them back from my betas currently it taking the slowest of them about a week per chapter i f there are any experienced betas out there who would like to help with the last few chapters please click on author gogg at the very top of this page to go to my profile and then click on email to send me a message please take a few moments to leave a review chapter 3 sorted settled and snaped standing in the great hall behind the first years rick looked about in awe and wonder despite all his reading and everything he had learned about hogwarts to actually stand there in the great hall under the enchanted ceiling was a rapturous experience the magic was all around him he felt it flowing through him like a gentle current his whole being resonated with it it was as if he had become aware of some other dimension one that had been there all along but which he had never noticed zarina zabini said the deputy headmistress calling the last of the first years to be sorted slytherin the sorting hat decided almost immediately it touched her head rick godfry said professor mcgonagall then turning to the hall by way of explanation she said mr godfry is joining us as a sixth year student he has not attended a school of magic before as there are none in the remote part of new zealand where he lives i trust that his classmates and housemates will assist him in adjusting to hogwarts rick sat down on the stool it was a little small for a sixteen year old as soon as the sorting hat was placed on his head it started muttering in astonishment my goodness gracious me who in heaven can you be now how am i supposed to sort this lot into a single house why there are witches and wizards here who have been in each of the four hogwarts houses how can i sort them all correctly why we even have three of the founders who created me here surely i must sort each one into their own house oh what ever shall i do rick knew that no one but himself could hear the confused ramblings of the sorting hat but people were starting to become curious at the length of time it was taking he directed a thought at the hat please sort me into gryffindor that is what all these witches and wizards would like you to do surly you can sense that yes you are right i can feel it now however this is most irregular most irregular i ve never encountered anything like this in the thousand years that i have been sorting hogwarts students finally it yelled out for all to hear gryffindor rick got up in relief and found a seat at the top of the gryffindor table amongst the first year students he found himself sitting next to the little girl with the brown plaits whom he had rescued from draco malfoy and blaise zabini on the train hello she smiled at him i matilda martyn pleased to meet you rick took the small hand she extended in his and replied gallantly rick godfry the pleasure is all mine matilda giggled and turned red and rick realised that he had better tone down the charm before he started attracting attention glancing down along the gryffindor table he saw lavender brown and parvati patil giggling and staring at him admiringly he quickly shifted his gaze only to find his eyes locked with those of ron weasley who was glaring at him with anything but admiration he didntneed his legilimency skills to read ron thoughts he was making no secret of the fact that he thought rick had used some kind of dark magic to con the sorting hat and infiltrate his way into gryffindor in fact those were almost exactly the words he was saying to harry and hermione at that moment dont be silly ron said hermione the sorting hat knows its job and it been doing it for a thousand years now no one can fool it why it was created by the hogwarts founders themselves do you think a sixteen year old wizard is any match for their magic but ron wasntgoing to allow himself to be convinced by mere logic just remember that one of those founders was salazar slytherin he said darkly harry interrupted their argument by pointing to a young witch with long blonde hair sitting at the teachers table between the arithmacy teacher professor vector and professor snape who seemed to be ignoring her who do you think she is asked harry she looks somehow familiar but i cantthink where i ve seen her before she sure is beautiful though he added well obviously she must be the new defence against the dark arts teacher said hermione all the teachers from last year except for that unbearable umbridge are here even trelawney back but you re right she does look familiar i know i ve seen that face before somewhere she was interrupted by professor dumbledore who rose to welcome the students to hogwarts hermione was right of course the mysterious newcomer was the new defence against the dark arts teacher but the three friends got a surprise when dumbledore revealed her to be nymphadora tonks wow exclaimed harry can you believe that that tonks well of course said hermione trying to cover up her embarrassment at missing the obvious she a metamorphmagus after all she just changed her hair and nose to look a bit more umm respectable i mean she a professor now so she has to look the part professor dumbledore has probably asked her not to keep changing her appearance just imagine how confusing that would be for all the students do you think that what she really looks like asked ron i wonder why she doesntmake herself look like that all the time she really beautiful you know yeah said harry also staring at tonks with his mouth open i imagine it so she doesnthave hoards of teenage boys gawping at her constantly said hermione sharply but that was the end of the conversation because dumbledore had just uttered that magical words so beloved by generations of hogwarts students tuck in and ron and harry had more important matters on their minds food rick meanwhile was fielding questions from matilda and the other gryffindor first years with whom he was sitting about new zealand and the magical creatures that lived there high up in the alps the only one he had come across during his speed read at flourish and blotts was the antipodean opaleye dragon so he obliged their curiosity with a few of his own the monstrous mountain troll the flesheating fiordland flobberworm the abhorrent alpine acromantuala and the giant glacial goblin he only hoped that none of them asked hagrid for more information about any of them when the meal was over the headmaster despatched them to their dormitories it was time for ginny weasley and colin creevey to undertake their first duties as gryffindor prefects first years follow us please said colin we will show you the way to gryffindor tower ginny smiled at rick saying you can come with us too if you like rick smiled back at ginny she was really rather attractive with her mane of vivid red hair and warm brown eyes wow thought rick i didntthink ginny would be so pretty but then he had another thought which he found a little disturbing if dumbledore was right that he had in a sense created this whole world himself to be born well not born in his case but sent into then he was responsible in a way for how people were how they acted and what they looked like ginny was pretty and hermione was beautiful because that how they had been in his mind i better be happy in this world he thought to himself because if i not i ve really got no one but myself to blame coming called ginny for the third time breaking rick reverie oh sorry said rick realising that he had been staring at her all the while and from the look on her face he had been pouring on the charm as he jumped to his feet he saw that their exchange had not gone unnoticed her brother ron was giving him a death glare rick groaned inwardly as he followed ginny out of the great hall oh what i have i done now ginny meanwhile was making no attempt to catch up with colin and the first years but seemed too overcome by rick unintended charm to say anything to him rick asked her some questions about her background and family willing her to relax he knew the answers of course but feigned ignorance after a while ginny loosened up a bit and started talking about her parents and many brothers her father had left the ministry she said but did not elaborate on what he was doing now though rick guessed that he was probably working full time for the order she had mentioned percy in passing but had said nothing further about him rick was curious and asked ginny what percy was doing percy has parted ways with the rest of the family she said her face becoming red with anger he become the perfect yes wizard for cornelius fudge the minister of magic fudge has appointed him as minister of internal security and he also fudge deputy we dontmention his name in the weasley family anymore he a disgrace she finished with an expression of unmitigated disgust on her face rick tried to draw ginny out further with an innocent comment about how well percy had done for someone so recently out of school but she said that just thinking about percy upset her too much and she became silent once more well thought rick it looks like mentioning percy is the perfect antidote to too much charm where ginny weasley is concerned rick took the opportunity to take in the ancient corridors bedecked with moving pictures statues suits of armour and various enchanted objects the magic of it all was quite overwhelming he sensed the trick stairs even before ginny pointed them out it was as if he had walked these corridors many times before which in a sense he had or at least the spirits with whom he was connected had snidget said ginny at the portrait of the fat lady it swung open and she led rick into the gryffindor common room to join the first years who were sitting together nervously and looking around in awe at the grandeur colin proceeded to give them the standard firsties orientation speech and then handed them their class timetables he then led the boys up to their dormitory while ginny took the girls by now the older students were coming into the common room talking noisily about their holidays and prospects for the upcoming quidditch season rick spotted neville longbottom all alone and walked over to introduce himself neville didntseem to be so shy anymore the events of his fifth year had clearly matured him he began talking animatedly about his summer project of growing mandrake seedlings at his grandmother house for professor sprout who had provided the seeds arent mandrakes dangerous asked rick well yes but not at the seedling stage all you have to worry about is dugbogs but i learned a dugbog repelling spell which worked a treat i wonder why professor sprout needs so many mandrakes this year they re mainly used to make restorative drafts for people who have been transfigured or cursed you know it sounds like hogwarts is expecting trouble remarked rick sagely neville eyes widened as he took in the import of rick comment it made him feel a little nervous but also proud that he had been able to do something helpful over the holidays would you like me to show you up to the sixth year boys dormitory asked neville thinking that it was going to be a little cramped with six beds now of course it was the same dormitory they had slept in since their first year but when he opened the door neville noticed that it had magically expanded so there was plenty of space that must be your bed said neville pointing to the one closest to the door spotting the unfamiliar trunk thanks said rick as neville turned to descend back down to the common room rick kicked off his shoes and lay down on his four poster bed closing his eyes and trying to take stock of everything that had happened to him over the past two days it just seemed incredible that he was really here at hogwarts just as he had dreamed so often in his previous life for the moment he was not worrying about voldemort and whatever trials lay ahead but simply enjoying the magic of the moment his peace however was soon broken by the sound of an angry ron weasley and just what do you think you re doing in our dorm challenged ron rick decided that it was time to take the bull by the horns and try to sort things out with ron i in this dormitory because i a sixth year gryffindor the same as you said rick sitting up and facing ron and harry i ll be sleeping in the same dormitory as you eating at the same table attending the same classes sitting in the same common room life will be much more pleasant for us both and everyone else if you would just give me a chance instead of condemning me from the outset just because some slytherins chose to sit in the same compartment as me on the train do you know what that called it called prejudice you know nothing about me and yet you ve already made up your mind that i the enemy ron just stood there wordless but harry was moved by rick words and walked up and shook his hand welcome to gryffindor rick i prepared to keep an open mind and give you a chance although i still not sure what you were up to on the train come on ron let leave prejudice to malfoy and the slytherin bigots we dontneed it in gryffindor he added turning to ron but ron looked unconvinced and just walked away to his bed saying over his shoulder and you ll stay away from my sister if you know what good for you dean thomas and seamus finnegan came in shortly afterwards and introduced themselves to rick in a friendly manner well thought rick four out of five isnttoo bad he guessed that dumbledore had instructed that the new bed be placed by the door that put him next to harry who had ron on his other side along the same wall rick would be able to keep an eye on harry if he started sneaking out at night when rick arrived in the great hall for breakfast the following morning he found a seat opposite harry hermione and ron harry and hermione smiled at him and returned his friendly greetings but ron just ignored him continuing to stuff sausage in his mouth well thought rick being ignored is an improvement at least what subjects are you taking asked hermione rick dug out his timetable and showed it to her oh you re doing potions i see we ve got double potions straight after breakfast she said dejectedly how interesting you seem to have exactly the same subjects as harry i hope you brought your cauldron and potions ingredients with you said harry we have to be down in the snape dungeon in ten minutes and you wonthave time to go back to gryffindor tower to get them oops said rick guess i ll have to be quick about it yes said hermione snape hates all gryffindors and will take off house points or give you a detention if you re late but rick didntseem concerned and proceeded to enjoy a leisurely breakfast hermione disappeared behind a book and ron and harry started speculating on who would fill the vacancies on the gryffindor quidditch team as the three rose to leave hermione looked at rick with concern oh dear i warned you about being late for potions you re for it now however rick just shrugged and followed them out after leaving the great hall he ducked into an alcove and summoned his potions things he decided not to use the summoning charm accio as it would take too long and it might be dangerous having heavy objects flying at speed through the castle he just sort of disapparated them from his dormitory and apparated them to the alcove easy then he visualised a marauders map in his mind located the potions dungeon spotted an empty room nearby and apparated to it he entered the dungeon and took a seat he noticed draco malfoy blaise zabini pansy parkinson and millicent bulstrode sitting together pansy gave rick a coquettish smile batting her eyelids at him draco scowled at him and the other two slytherins ignored him dean thomas came in and sat next to rick then came harry and hermione who noting his cauldron asked in astonishment how on earth did you manage to get your things and get down here so fast rick grinned at her cheekily and said apparated how else dont be ridiculous scoffed hermione it states quite unequivocally in hogwarts a history that it is impossible to apparate into out of or anywhere within this castle or the surrounding grounds oh but you see i didntknow that said rick with an innocent grin as if it explained everything he just pulling your leg hermione laughed harry i ll bet he had his potions things with him all along but hermione wasntgoing to let it go so easily but he left the great hall after us and got here before us yeah but i didntknow the way i got lost and must have taken a shortcut by mistake said rick hermione looked far from satisfied but at that moment professor snape appeared and all talking immediately died as if so commanded by his brooding presence you will notice that our potions class is smaller this year he began in his silky insinuating voice only those with a satisfactory owl result are allowed to proceed to sixth year potions and beyond it no mystery of course why incompetents like longbottom and most of his fellow gryffindors are no longer with us he sneered much to the delight of the slytherins then turning on harry he continued but a far greater mystery is how you potter managed to make the grade or perhaps some special treatment for hogwart special hero was involved that impossible and you know it hermione blurted out angrily owl and newt examinations are conducted by a totally independent qualifications authority which is the reason why harry received a fair potions mark for once snape was furious but all he could do was spit out ten points from gryffindor for your unsolicited opinions miss granger because hermione was right on both counts and everyone knew it next snape turned on rick and as for you godfry let me place it clearly on the record that i have only accepted you into this class at the express request of the headmaster i have no idea how he expects someone like you with no wizarding background experience or prior tuition to speak of to be able take up magical studies of such an advanced level i have made it clear to the headmaster and other teaching staff that i consider it highly inappropriate and that your proper place is with the first year students if indeed you should be at hogwarts at all rick just sat there coolly letting it all flow past he was using the opportunity to probe snape mind he was determined to find out which side the potions master was really on rick had to admit a grudging admiration for snape occlumency skills it took a great deal of probing to penetrate his defences but then again he certainly had to be an expert having to hide his true thoughts from dumbledore or voldemort or both luckily for rick snape was enjoying himself so much after all it was his first opportunity at gryffindor bashing for almost three months that he didntnotice rick intrusion rick felt relieved there was no doubt at all that dumbledore was right in trusting snape loyalty rick now knew who had leaked the prophecy to voldemort snape was invaluable as a spy to dumbledore but yuck snape mind was not a pretty place to visit i have made it very clear to the headmaster concluded snape that if you fail to perform to my satisfaction you will be out of this class in a trice and that goes for the rest of you he said turning to harry and the other gryffindors i have been doing my best to catch up by reading all the course materials for the past five years sir said rick earnestly potions ability is not just something you can get out of a book scoffed snape glaring meaningfully at hermione it requires a certain disposition and an empathy for the subtle art of alchemy but let us see what you have learnt mr godfry what is polyjuice potion and how would you make it but that unfair sir protested hermione it not covered in the hogwarts syllabus and the only book in the library with that information is in the restricted ouch harry had stomped on her foot and she stopped abruptly when she realised what she was saying yes miss granger you were saying but rick quickly interrupted polyjuice potion is used to adopt the form of another person it is made from lacewing flies which must be stewed for 21 days leeches powdered bicorn horn knotgrass fluxweed that has been picked during the full moon and boomslang skin you need to mix in a sample such as hair from the person whose form you wish to assume it lasts for about an hour snape turned on rick and which professor gave you permission to visit the restricted section mr godfry err no one sir i think i must have read about it while i was looking through the potions section in flourish and blotts but snape wasntfinished with rick he started asking him a series of potions question which became increasingly more difficult the answers to some of them could only be found in obscure texts rick of course had no difficulty finding the answers because after all they were right there in snape mind ready for the taking snape was getting increasingly frustrated at his inability to find a question that rick couldntanswer but he was also getting suspicious at how he could know so much and began to wonder if rick could possibly possess legilimency abilities so he set a trap he asked him a question about a potion that he had recently developed himself and had not yet published in any of the apothecary journals unfortunately for him rick clearly saw what he was doing and simply said i have no idea sir i ve read nothing at all about that potion hermione meanwhile was aghast no outraged even she didntknow the answers to some of the questions which rick answered with ease how could he how dare he know so much there was definitely something very strange about rick and she was not going to rest until she got to the bottom of it snape was wise enough to know when he was beat and left rick alone after that confining his sadistic sport to harry and dean it was also too difficult to find that know it all granger wanting when it came to potions knowledge he was starting to miss neville longbottom sixth form was not going to be much fun at all with each new subject they shared hermione noticed that rick skill and knowledge very quickly matched her own she was facing the terrible prospect that for the first year since she had been at hogwarts that she might not finish top in all of her classes at least rick wasnttaking arithmacy ancient runes and muggles studies so she was safe in those three at least she felt a growing sense of rivalry with rick for the first time she could remember either at hogwarts or her muggle school before that there was someone who could match her intelligence although rick didntappear to be trying to compete with her at all he was just naturally good at everything he did it was just so annoying he always handed in his assignments often his parchments were as long as hers yet she hardly ever saw him studying or doing homework in fact he was often absent from the common room of an evening and he wasntin the library either hermione had no idea where he got to she couldntfigure him out and she was finding it very frustrating rick got along well with everyone in gryffindor he seemed to like everyone and everyone liked him although he was always very low key and never at the centre of things in fact he was quite self effacing and seemed to be trying to avoid attracting attention those efforts were totally wasted in the case of lavender and parvati who just could not stay away from him they were like bees around a honey pot whenever he was in the gryffindor common room draping themselves decoratively over the arms of any chair that rick sat in batting their eyelids at him endlessly hermione found their behaviour utterly nauseating in fact there were quite a few girls in gryffindor and the other houses too from first years up who seemed to have developed a crush on rick even professors mcgonagall and sprout seemed to have a soft spot for him and tonks was as bad as some of the younger girls bur rick popularity in gryffindor was not quite universal ron weasley was nothing if not stubborn he took his prejudices seriously and didntchange them easily rick never tried to intrude upon the dream team although he was sometimes the subject of their private conversations ron was convinced that if he was not working for you know who himself rick was certainly a closet slytherin spying for malfoy and co harry found himself liking rick it was hard not to but like hermione he had noticed how good rick was at everything and in particular how powerful he was when it came to magic in classes like transfiguration charms and defense against the dark arts harry didntshare ron prejudice concerning rick but he agreed with hermione that there was something peculiar about him and it worried him if rick did turn out to be hostile he would be a very dangerous adversary please review chapter 30 the flying squad ron and ginny weasley brought their brooms in to land on the barren headland they had been flying in tight formation with harry in his golden eagle animagus form in the lead followed by ginny ron and rick in his peregrine falcon form at the rear they had remained very watchful ever since leaving hogwarts in case their sortie was detected by voldemort death eaters but the long flight had been uneventful harry who had been scouting ahead for a large flat area on the scottish coast had led them to this desolate place the brisk sea breeze caused the clumps of grass and shrubs to wave about in the bright sunshine the air carried the sharp scent of the ocean upon landing harry and rick transformed you were magnificent harry gushed ginny admiringly she had spent most of the flight mere metres behind harry watching him fly in awe she had to resist the impulse to throw her arms around him and hug him knowing perfectly well that ron would probably explode they all needed to stay focussed on their dangerous mission today and teamwork was going to be crucial professor dumbledore had been very impressed with ron plan it was a dangerous gambit but it was their only hope of getting rid of the dementors dumbledore was well aware that unless the dementors were removed from the equation hogwarts would almost certainly be destroyed his backup plan was to send all the students home at the easter break and close hogwarts indefinitely he could not risk the lives of his students and professors although most students remained at hogwarts over easter they were allowed to return home for the break upon parental request just as dumbledore had anticipated such requests were received from all known death eaters with children at hogwarts the pretext obviously intended to hide the true intention was a gala garden party being hosted by the parkinsons for their pureblood acquaintances on the easter sunday the weekend before easter was chosen as the best time for the azkaban operation the weather had warmed up enough to make the long flight on broomsticks endurable it also gave them plenty of time for the meticulous planning required for a successful outcome rick asked the others to sit well away on some rocks while he got to work creating the time portal they were all very aware of the danger of accidentally passing through it tempus iunctus nunc ad nihilum vaccus he intoned a shimmering fabric emerged from his wand it was transparent with a light blue tinge making it almost invisible in the bright sunlight as it hovered horizontally about three feet from the ground rick mounted ginny broom and flying twenty feet above the ground he began stretching the portal to the required size he used a magical measure hermione had given him to ensure it was exactly right they had decided to make it one hundred metres longer and wider than the island to put some distance between themselves and azkaban deadly inhabitants rick conjured four ropes which he enchanted to be weightless like the portal they were twenty metres long he attached a rope to each corner of the portal the ropes would allow them to keep a safe distance from the portal and a little further away again from azkaban finally he used an attaching spell to bind one rope to ginny broom and another to ron s when the time came ginny and ron would use detaching spells to remove them ok so we re all ready said rick nervously as the four of them stood close together feeling excited and also extremely apprehensive now remember you two rick said to ron and ginny if things go wrong just let go of the portal and get the hell out of there fast ok ginny and ron nodded grimly there were so many things that could go wrong and most of them involved dementors although they were both proficient in casting a patronus thanks to coaching from harry and rick none of them wanted to contemplate dealing with hordes of dementors they all looked at each other with grim determination let do it said harry before transforming into a golden eagle and beating his large wings powerfully as he rose purposefully into the air rick transformed into a falcon and joined him circling around as they waited for ginny and ron to get to their brooms which were some distance away when they reached the brooms they mounted them and began rising up slowly harry and rick swooped down each grasping an end of the leading ropes with their claws before heading out across the ocean they rose upwards to around a thousand feet they didntwant any muggle fishermen spotting ginny and ron on brooms and they wanted to be high above azkaban when they arrived that would keep them well clear of the dementors until they began lowering the portal after a nervous but mercifully uneventful half hour of flying rick and harry with their keen eyesight spotted the dark shape of azkaban looming forebodingly before them as it jutted out from the sea as they drew closer the ugly grey prison buildings that sat atop the island became distinguishable they were at least seven hundred feet above the highest point of the island as they began passing over it one on each side from this height no movement or sign of life was visible on the island below rick felt a pang of fear and a sense of deep apprehension as terrible visions of the dementors of azkaban flooded unbidden into his mind he struggled hard to repress those dreadful memories of being surrounded by hundreds of dementors in that bleak stinking courtyard of their stench of the horrible rasping rattling noise they made and of the foul slimy lips of the dementor that tried to suck out his soul but the dementors would not be able to sense him today he and harry in their bird animagus forms were safe it was ginny and ron who were in danger no one knew at what distance dementors could sense their victims none of them had any idea if ginny and ron would be far enough from the island avoid detection finally they reached their intended position the time portal was now halfway across azkaban island the plan was to continue moving forward across the island as they slowly descended so that the portal completely covered the island when they reached ground level rick spread his wings to begin the slow descent this was the signal to the others to do likewise everything was going to plan they were now only a hundred metres above the prison and still there was no sign of dementors rick began to worry that the evil creatures might no longer be on the island could voldemort have moved them in preparation for the attack on hogwarts he asked himself as he swivelled his head from side to side to check on ginny and ron as they continued downwards suddenly he saw them twenty or more dementors charging upwards and straight towards ginny it was their worst nightmare rick let go of his rope and dived to gain speed and to get well beneath the portal as he sped in ginny direction ginny spotted the dementors coming towards her almost the moment they began rising up from the island in front of her she and ron were both on the lookout for them she used the detaching charm to free her broom from the rope attached to the portal and shot up in the air away from the dementors and azkaban ron who had been keeping an eye on his sister as well as looking out for dementors saw what was happening and freed his broom from the portal also since it was weightless it would just hover stationary in the air ron sped towards the dementors who were pursuing ginny firing his bull shaped patronus at them it lowered its horns as it charged driving them well away from ginny but ron relief at ginny escape was short lived suddenly he felt a terrible chill assail him twisting around on his broom he saw them thirty dementors closing on him fast but his fear of the dementors was replaced by an even greater terror as he gazed in horror upon an enormous dragon flying straight towards him bloody hell where did that monster come from thought ron what the hell am i supposed to do now in fact there was only one thing he could do go up and fast ron shot upwards almost vertically hunched desperately over his broom dreading the immanent terrifying chill of the dementors or the furnace of the dragon fire but when miraculously neither eventuated he cautiously he looked down he couldntbelieve what he was seeing the dragon was breathing great sheets of flame at the dementors who did not appear to be enjoying it at all ron saw them turn and flee back towards the island he flew over to ginny where the hell did that dragon come from he asked her when he reached her side and how come it attacking the dementors instead of us it rick said ginny i saw him transform straight from a falcon into that enormous dragon it a norwegian ridgeback i think bloody hell said ron he could have told us i almost fell off my broom when i saw that monster coming straight at me listen gin rick managed to get the dementors who were chasing us back to the island but look there are hundreds of them now swarming all over the place blood hell they re starting to rise up in the air there no way rick can herd that many back to the island hey i ve got an idea follow me quick ginny got the surprise of her life when ron headed at full speed straight back towards azkaban taking a deep breath she gripped her broom tightly and sped off after him he was too far ahead for her to ask what the hell he was doing she was just going to have to trust him soon they were flying about fifty feet above the portal with the island of azkaban beneath them when they were directly above the prison ron began circling slowly by now ginny had caught on to what ron was attempting to do he was deliberately trying to get the dementors to attack them from below and it was working brilliantly the dementors rising up from azkaban in their hundreds were attracted to them like bees to honey they flew straight up towards ron and ginny but when they reached the portal they simply disappeared they seemed to be completely oblivious to what was happening or why the dementors ahead of them were disappearing they were starved for human souls and seemed to be capable of one thought only get to the two humans and suck out their souls wave after wave of dementors continued flying towards them and disappearing as they hit the portal it went on for almost five minutes ron you re a genius said ginny joyfully that was the most brilliant trick i ve ever seen there dontseem to be any more dementors attacking us do you think there could be any more down there on the island i dontknow replied ron there could be hey ginny look here rick he turned back into a falcon again rick came down on the handle of ron broom and stared at him rick can you understand me asked ron rick gave a very distinct nod well err i think we ve gotten rid of all the dementors said ron feeling a bit silly talking to a bird but just to be sure i think we should complete the plan and lower the portal down to sea level just in case there are more dementors down there do you agree rick nodded again so when exactly were you going to tell us that you are also a bloody dragon animagus as well demanded ron reproachfully but realising that rick wasntable to reply and this was hardly the time or place to take issue with rick over his secrecy he quickly changed tack ok so let all grab our ropes then i guess you can communicate with harry right rick nodded he still holding onto his rope so if you let him know what happening we can get on with it afterwards fly down to the prison and check that all the dementors are gone like we planned and then destroy the portal ok rick nodded again before flying off towards harry ron and ginny returned to their positions and took hold of their ropes when all four of them were in place they slowly lowered the portal until it was at sea level ron and ginny let go of their ropes and flew back up to wait for rick they were soon joined by harry who was circling them happily rick came down and landed in the bleak cobblestone courtyard in the centre of the prison he changed into his own form shuddering as he took in his surroundings and remembered his previous time here surrounded by hundreds of horrible dementors pushing these unwanted thoughts away rick created a magical map of the island in his mind there was not a single dementor showing anywhere professor dumbledore had been certain that every single dementor in existence had been here at azkaban which meant that they all gone every last loathsome one of them rick transformed back into a falcon and flew down to the shoreline landing on a large boulder a few feet above the portal which was hovering an inch or two above the sea he changed back to his human form once more and cast the spell to destroy the time portal his happy feelings at finally ridding their world of the dreaded dementors were interrupted by harry diving towards him harry immediately transformed death eaters on brooms rick thirty or forty of them headed this way ron and ginny haventseen them yet we ve got to do something i ll transform into a dragon said rick you ll be more use with your wand on my back than as an eagle hop up on my back while i transform and then climb up into the saddle ok ok but be quick yelled harry urgently jumping up on rick back and immediately finding himself being thrown up into the air he grabbed hold of a harness strap and climbed over the dragon rough scales until he reached the saddle and strapped himself in finding what appeared to be a set of reigns harry pulled on them to let rick know he was ready to go rick unfurled his massive wings and flapped them powerfully rising slowly into the air damn it thought rick as he began flying towards ginny and ron with powerful beats of his enormous wings the death eaters must have created some kind of magical warning system which was activated when the dementors sensed ginny and ron after my rescue of hermione there probably been a bunch of them stationed across on the mainland ready to scramble and head for azkaban if intruders were detected again by now the death eaters had reached ginny and ron who although greatly outnumbered were using their superior broom skills to dart about and dodge the barrage of curses and hexes they were soon half a mile apart forcing the death eaters to split into two groups to pursue them the death eaters chasing ginny spread themselves around her and began flinging curses at her from different directions it was becoming increasingly difficult for her to dodge them all as rick approached harry saw ginny take a direct hit she had been badly hexed and was clinging desperately to her broom since it was hard to make a direct hit on a swiftly moving broom the death eaters now resorted to firing blasting curses in ginny direction these were buffeting her broom and making it very difficult for her to control in her weakened state it was zigzagging wildly about the sky as blasting curses exploded all around her ginny was in imminent danger of being thrown from her broom into the sea far below harry quickly released himself from the dragon saddle and transformed into an eagle flying off at top speed towards ginny her erratic movements made it very difficult for him to land on her broom as he closed in on her a blasting curse exploded only feet away knocking ginny from her broom desperately she grasped the broom with her hands dangling helplessly beneath it harry was knocked off course by the blasting curse but making full use of the skills he had honed in the many hours flying with rick he finally managed to catch hold of ginny wildly careening broom with his powerful claws he immediately transformed throwing his legs around the broom and casting a reflecting shield around himself and ginny who was hanging desperately beneath him harry quickly brought the broom under control and stopped its wild dance then he lay flat on the broom and grabbed hold of one of ginny arms harry tried to pull ginny up onto the broom but it was impossible ginny was barely conscious by now and unable to perform the standard quidditch manoeuvre of hefting herself up to lie across the broomstick harry had an idea if she cantpull herself up i ll just have to drop the broom down he sent the broom vertically downwards about a metre and a little to the left in a sudden movement as a result ginny suddenly bobbed up relative to the broom harry still grasping her arm pulled her over the handle and held her there securely in the broom rescue position while all of this was happening the death eaters were slowly recovering from the shock of seeing harry potter mysteriously appear on the injured girl broom some of them had noticed the eagle flying about but none had noticed it transform into their master greatest enemy they assumed that potter had been on the broom all along hidden beneath an invisibility cloak which had been blown away by a blasting curse the death eaters were even more surprised when having secured the girl across the broomstick rather than attempting to evade them potter turned to face them the twenty or so death eaters couldntbelieve their luck at having harry potter within wand range outnumbered twenty to one a sitting duck his hands full with keeping an unconscious girl on a broom they werentplanning on taking any prisoners today this was going to be too easy let potter have it yelled one of the death eaters avada kedavra screamed a dozen death eaters in unison letting loose a volley of killing curses the curses hit harry shield and rebounded back upon the death eaters who had cast them they died instantly their bodies plummeting along with their brooms into the sea far below when harry flew off to help ginny rick had decided to go help ron who was being pursued by the second group of death eaters before he could reach him he saw ron hit by a powerful hex rick could do nothing but look on helplessly as his friend plummeted thirty feet to the sea hitting it with a loud smack hoping desperately that ron was still alive rick swooped down and carefully lifted him out of the sea grasping him under the arms with his powerful claws rick then turned his attention to the death eaters who were stunned to find an enormous dragon in their midst belching flames rick was careful not to incinerate the death eaters instead he set the ends of their brooms on fire the death eaters fled back towards the mainland frantically casting extinguishing spells on their smouldering charred brooms rick flew over to where he could see harry holding ginny as she lay across her broomstick they were surrounded by eight death eaters who had just witnessed twelve of their companions plunge into the sea after being struck by their own rebounding killing curses they were arguing about how to proceed when they suddenly found themselves set upon by a fierce fire breathing dragon they needed no further encouragement to turn tail and flee spotting ron hanging limply from rick claws harry quickly flew up to the dragon saddle and carefully strapped ginny in then he flew around in front of the dragon head on ginny broom so rick could see what he was doing before flying down to ron harry positioned the broom so that it was against ron stomach and grasped hold of one of ron arms with his other hand he twisted the end of one of the dragon claws hoping rick would understand the signal he did and slowly released his grip on ron allowing harry to drag him across the broomstick harry flew ron up to the dragon saddle and after a bit of a struggle managed to squeeze ron in beside ginny and strap them both in securely he was relieved to find ron was still breathing albeit very shallowly there was an unhealthy bluish tinge to his face and lips and blood was trickling from his nose and mouth ron was also completely wet harry hadntseen what had happened to his friend but it was obvious that he had been in the chilly water and was freezing cold he cast a drying charm on ron clothes and then a heating charm around the saddle there wasntmuch more he could do for his friend right now they had to get ron and ginny back to the mainland as quickly as possible so rick could transform and check them over harry had a very bad feeling about ron if only he could hang on until they got him back to hogwarts he might have a chance harry gave a tug on the dragon reigns then transformed back into an eagle to lighten rick load rick got the message and began flying as fast as he could towards the mainland with harry flying beside his huge head as they crossed the coast harry used one of their common bird gestures to indicate that they should land they came down on the same barren headland where rick had constructed the time portal a few hours earlier rick first examined ginny he quickly healed the effects of the curse she d been hit with ginny regained consciousness although she was a little dazed at first however when she saw ron she became very quickly alert and worried rick was examining ron carefully moving his hand gently above his chest and abdomen harry stood behind ginny and wrapped his arms around her to comfort her as they both looked on anxiously he really in a bad way said rick finally i think i ve managed to stop the internal bleeding but i donthave enough experience to do much more we have to get him to hogwarts as quickly as possible it ll take too long to fly him there on your back said harry your dragon animagus is nowhere near as fast as the falcon how about you apparate the four of us back apparate us asked ginny surprised can you do that err yeah answered rick right everyone hold hands i ll apparate us to behind that clump of trees near the hogwarts gates then we ll conjure a stretcher and use the mobilicorpus spell to get ron to the hospital wing ok harry and ginny nodded ginny knelt down next ron and took his hand in hers holding harry hand with her other rick grasped harry other hand and they were gone madam pomfrey had been examining ron for over ten minutes moving her wand over various parts of his body and muttering spells which made her wand glow different colours but mostly an ominous blood red her face was very serious and as the examination progressed her expression showed increasing concern she exchanged the occasional whispered comment with professor snape who was standing nearby and looking even more sombre than usual professor dumbledore had requested the potion master assistance as soon as the seriousness of ron condition became evident rick had fetched hermione and they were standing close to harry and ginny in a corner of the room the four of them looked on with growing anxiety as madam pomfrey proceeded with the examination even from that distance it was clear that ron was barely alive he lay unconscious his face had an unhealthy white pallor and his breathing was shallow and irregular suddenly the door swung open and padma rushed in she immediately tried to rush to ron but harry stepped forward and caught her holding her firmly to prevent her interrupting madam pomfrey harry what happened to ron she cried distraughtly luna said she saw him being brought in on a stretcher and it looked like he was very badly injured he going to be alright isnthe she demanded frantically hermione and ginny each put an arm around padma who was extremely distressed and still puffing heavily from running all the way from ravenclaw tower we dontknow yet said hermione trying to sound more hopeful than she felt madam pomfrey is still examining him finally the nurse turned to professor dumbledore who was standing behind her i am very sorry headmaster she said letting out a long sad sigh but i afraid there is nothing more i can do for him i ve tried to make him as comfortable as possible he has suffered massive internal lacerations which are quite beyond my ability to heal i know of no healer or magic that can reverse such severe injuries i can only suggest that you contact his parents if they are very quick they may get here in time to see him before but she couldntcontinue she pulled out a large white handkerchief and dried her eyes before turning away professor dumbledore turned gravely towards snape his eyebrows raised questioningly i am afraid i must concur with madam pomfrey prognosis headmaster he said solemnly there is no potion or anything else i know of that can save him he has suffered enormous internal damage the best i can offer is a powerful analgesic concoction to dull the pain should he regain consciousness before he i shall brew it immediately he said turning and striding solemnly from the room thank you poppy said dumbledore comfortingly to the nurse you have done your very best for him i cannot ask for more the nurse nodded then left the room sobbing padma and ginny both began crying uncontrollably harry wrapped an arm around each of them as he fought back his own tears professor dumbledore said hermione quietly perhaps the headmaster held up his hand to silence her gently nodding his head and fixing her with an understanding glance miss patil miss weasley please accompany me to madam pomfrey office i shall ask her to give you both a tonic to help you cope with your distress as he escorted them from the room he turned back catching rick eye and glancing meaningfully towards the door the moment the door had closed rick placed a locking spell on it with a brief gesture hermione was already at ron side she placed a hand on either side of his head and closed her eyes she was soon lost in deep concentration what she doing rick whispered harry empathetic magic i think replied rick softly she trying to determine the exact nature of ron injuries she finding out which organs are injured and how they are damaged so she can repair them can she really do that asked harry hopefully i mean madam pomfrey is very skilled in magical healing believe me i know from experience and she said nothing could be done do you really think hermione can save him i sure as hell hope so said rick if anyone can hermione can hermione had opened her eyes now and was moving her hands in slow circular motions about an inch or two above ron abdomen her eyes were fixed upon her hands in intense concentration a soft white glow began to emanate from them it appeared to be some kind of energy and it was flowing from the palms of her hands into ron body after working on his abdomen for several minutes hermione gradually moved her hands up ron body continuing the circular motion she paused for a minute or two over his chest before finally bringing her hands up to his face all the while the strange soft glow came from them and flowed into ron two things happened almost simultaneously ron suddenly opened his eyes and began looking around in a daze and there was a loud banging on the door madam pomfrey why is this door locked demanded a very annoyed professor snape ah severus there you are said dumbledore calmly back with the potion already that was quick rick looked at ron and smiled broadly then he looked at hermione all done he asked can i let him in before he starts on the blasting curses hermione nodded happily she was holding ron hand and smiling like a cheshire cat rick flicked his hand at the door and it suddenly sprang open to reveal snape the headmaster and madam pomfrey they all entered the room closely followed by ginny and padma who seeing ron awake and very much alive immediately rushed over to him and flung her arms around him kissing him everyone was talking at once snape was demanding to know what the hell harry hermione and rick were doing in the room and what they had done to the door padma had thrown her arms around ron neck and was showering his face with kisses ginny was grasping one of ron hands and weeping with joy at seeing him alive and well after having given up all hope madam pomfrey meanwhile was trying to prise padma off her patient and get to him herself professor dumbledore stood calmly off to one side surveying the chaos with an amused smile on his face his blue eyes twinkling when they fell upon hermione he smiled at her warmly and nodded his head in a gesture of recognition of her miraculous achievement madam pomfrey had to resort to threatening padma and ginny with hexes to get them to step back from ron who was shaking his head from side to side in confusion at the bedlam surrounding him the nurse proceeded to repeat the diagnostic tests with her wand professor snape was once again standing beside her instead of his previous undertaker impersonation this time he was gaping in disbelief firstly at madam pomfrey wand which was now consistently glowing a soft blue colour and secondly at ron weasley who looked a picture of health i cannot understand it headmaster she finally declared shaking her head in wonder not five minutes ago all his internal organs were ruptured and damaged there had been massive internal haemorrhaging but now he completely healthy every organ is in perfect condition and functioning faultlessly in all my reading of the great magical healers i have never come across an account of so remarkable a recovery well at least not since the time of jesus christ himself she shook her head in disbelief before finally adding how is this possible how could he have been healed a very good question indeed madam pomfrey said snape fixing rick with a penetrating gaze most significantly this is not the first time that i have witnessed a remarkable recovery from an apparently irreversible condition something equally miraculous happened quite recently in the case of but snape trailed off as he remembered the need to keep the miraculous recovery of hermione parents secret i am sure there is a perfectly logical explanation he added after a few moments as he continued to stare hard at rick an eyebrow raised questioningly it was the ghost every eye in the room turned upon ron in shock these were the first word he had spoken and they caught everyone by surprise what what on earth are you talking about mr weasley demanded snape glaring down intimidatingly at ron lying in his bed err well when i woke up and opened my eyes just now i heard this rasping voice saying there we are lad you re all better now as good as new i canthave one of my own gryffindors dying on me now can i i recognised the voice from that time in the great hall when he squibbed umbridge and also from trelawn err professor trelawney s ance in the gryffindor common room i d know that voice anywhere it was the ghost of godric gryffindor i sure of it affirmed ron carefully avoiding snape withering gaze poppycock exclaimed snape your body may be recovered mr weasley but clearly you ve suffered irreparable brain damage either that or you are deliberately lying to both myself and the headmaster which is it mr weasley he demanded menacingly now now severus said dumbledore gently mr weasley explanation is in fact quite plausible while it appears to be entirely miraculous and beyond all known magic let me remind you that such extraordinary things have been happening all year both around hogwarts and beyond and their source has indeed been the ghost of godric gryffindor snape concealed a snort keeping his silence as he stared hard at rick who coincidentally had also been at hogwarts all year dumbledore no doubt had his reasons for encouraging the disinformation about gryffindor ghost being responsible for all the extraordinary events and snape was not about to contradict him on it publicly he was almost certain by now that rick godfry and not some absurd ghost was the true cause looking briefly towards the headmaster snape surreptitiously raised an eyebrow to indicate that he wasntfooled by this fabrication before turning and striding quickly from the room dumbledore blue eyes were twinkling merrily padma had taken the opportunity to move back to ron and was once again leaning over the bed hugging and kissing him she was so happy to have him alive and well she seemed oblivious to the others in the room that quite enough of that young lady growled madam pomfrey having regaining her composure and her usual stern demeanour this is the hospital wing not the astronomy tower mr weasley needs rest not excitement he will remain here under my observation for the remainder of the weekend now everyone out but why canti go too asked ron i ve never felt better in my life why do i have to twenty minutes ago we were about to arrange your funeral mr weasley said the nurse severely you may feel fit as a fiddle now but you will remain under my observation for the next twenty four hours minimum is that understood yes said ron sighing in resignation that better said madam pomfrey somewhat appeased if you behave yourself weasley you may receive visitors tomorrow after breakfast but please avoid engaging in any activities that are likely to excite him she said looking pointedly at padma now all of you out of here and let mr weasley get some rest please take a few moments to leave a review chapter 31 assault of the dark creatures high above hogwarts two birds circled in the early morning light the golden eagle began a graceful descent alighting on the parapet of the west tower which was bathed in morning sunshine jumping down from the parapet harry transformed ron who had been staring out towards the forbidden forest and the peregrine falcon which was flying along its edge turned and looked enquiringly at his friend nothing yet said harry it was the first day of the final school term just as dumbledore had predicted the children of suspected death eaters had not returned from the easter break draco malfoy was one of the few slytherins on the hogwarts express when it arrived in hogsmeade the previous evening evidently his mother had taken heed of the warning given by the ghost of godric gryffindor and cut all ties with her squibbed husband former associates and her other acquaintances on the dark side it appeared that in consequence she had not been warned of the impending attack harry and rick had been flying reconnaissance missions above the hogwarts grounds since first light dumbledore expected the attack of voldemort dark creatures to come in the first few days of the new term very possibly today and they did not want to be caught unawares if and when the attack came ron would notify the headmaster immediately dumbledore had professors mcgonagall snape flitwick plus a number of others on stand by ready to join him in defending hogwarts the remaining staff would gather all the students together and barricade them in the deepest dungeons until the attack was over each of the professors involved in the school defence had been assigned a tower or some other strategic location but none were assigned to the west tower where rick and harry were stationed dumbledore hoped to keep harry animagus ability and rick powers secret have hermione and ginny shown up with breakfast yet asked harry hopefully no not yet mate replied ron grumpily i ve been awake for at least two hours now and i haventeaten a thing i starving to death up here while the whole school down in the great hall eating breakfast he complained dont worry mate it ll be here soon just remember to leave some for me or i might have to catch my own joked harry before transforming back into an eagle and flying off towards the lake five minutes later the falcon came in to land and transformed into rick still no sign of any attackers he said to ron and there nothing to eat yet either grumbled ron i getting bloody hungry up here i could eat a what that exclaimed rick holding his hand up to silence ron and staring off into space it was hermione summoning him through their empathetic magic link hermione in trouble cried rick closing his eyes for a moment and projecting a magical map of the castle from her summons he already knew where she was but he wanted to find out who was with her draco malfoy he spat he must have jumped hermione and ginny on their way up here with the food come on said ron rushing to the stairway let go teach that slimy git a lesson he ll never calm down mate said rick raising both hands and stepping in front of ron i ll take care of malfoy dontworry you need to stay here if harry spots attackers he ll fly straight back here to tell you one of you come and get me i wontbe far away just go down these stairs and then carry on straight along the corridor about a hundred feet turn right at the end i ll be just around the corner ok ok but hurry yelled ron if that sneaky little ferret so much as but he stopped abruptly when he found himself talking to thin air rick had made himself invisible and apparated to hermione and ginny well well well sneered draco malevolently now what shall i do with filthy little miss mudblood and potty beloved muggle loving weaslet draco had ambushed them on their way to the west tower with breakfast for the boys the food lay scattered at their feet along with their wands they were pinned spreadeagled to the wall with their arms and legs clamped in heavy manacles it was the same spell draco had used on hermione in the dungeon many months before hermione was glaring at draco defiantly but ginny let out a gasp when he mentioned harry oh yes weasley i know all about you and your darling scarface said draco smugly if there one thing pansy good at it knowing whose doing what and with whom pansy has her uses she keeps her ear close to the ground hardly surprising since she lives in the gutter with rabid little ferrets like you spat hermione furiously that will cost you mudblood snarled draco pointing his wand at her we have some unfinished business from that night in the dungeon remember he said threateningly his face filled with hatred if i quick i might just have time for some fun before my master dark creatures arrive to kill you along with the rest of the school he gloated his hard grey eyes gleaming maliciously but it business before pleasure i going to give you exactly one chance before i demonstrate the effectiveness of the cruciatus curse where are potter and his stupid friends when i saw you two leaving the great hall with that food i checked the gryffindor table potter weasley and godfry werentthere you were taking that food to them now where are they hermione said nothing raising her chin defiantly ginny turned her head looking desperately down the corridor praying that someone would come hoping someone will come to rescue you little weaslet jeered draco well you better forget it you see that food he said pointing a finger at the food scattered on the ground is laced with a powerful drug i used a special form of the imperius curse that works on house elves i forced one of them to put a sleeping draft in the breakfast everyone but the three of us plus potter and his scummy little sidekicks will have fallen into a deep sleep by now a sleep from which they will never awaken he gloated evilly it just a little precaution my master decided upon to ensure there would be no resistance when his dark creatures come to destroy the school and kill everyone draco took a step closer to hermione pointing his wand at her chest then turning to ginny with an evil grin on his face he said i going to put your little mudblood friend under the cruciatus curse weasley and i going to keep her under it until it destroys her precious little mind and turns her into a vegetable just like her dear muggle mummy and daddy unless you tell me where potty and the other two are i can tell you where one of them is i right behind you said rick materialising out of thin air draco spun around to face rick cruc began draco but stopped when he realised that his wand hand was empty lose something malfoy asked rick holding draco wand in his left hand before pocketing it draco surprise turned to shock when rick pointed a finger in the direction of hermione and ginny making their manacles disappear he tried to turn and run but rick flicked his eyes towards draco feet and they were suddenly stuck fast to the floor of the corridor desperately he dug his hand into his robes but before he could reach the object of his frantic search rick pointed a finger at him and flicked it upwards there was a tearing sound and a shiny golden object was ripped from draco robes and flew up in the air hovering high above his head well out of reach a portkey so that how you were planning to escape before the slaughter begins said rick glancing at the golden ring and making it explode no gasped draco i i ve got to get out of here they ll be here any minute he said looking about wildly then turning fearfully to rick as if he was seeing him for the first time he asked w who are you w what are you how come you can do all of this magic without a wand i am your evil master nemesis and i also the one who gave you a chance once to mend your ways but unfortunately you didnttake it w what are you talking about stammered draco frightened and confused have you forgotten the warning i gave you the night i squibbed your father asked rick i told you that if you had any further dealings with voldemort or his death eaters i d squib you too the blood drained from draco face as the penny dropped i it you you re the g ghost of godric gryffindor said draco trembling with fear i i ll change sides p please let me join you anything begged draco pathetically you ve got a yellow streak a mile wide spat rick it too late now to switch sides anyway it just a trick i can read your evil twisted little mind malfoy you ll never change your spots p please p please dontsquib me i ll do anything you ask i promise p please i ll give you gold as much as you want just dontsquib me please beseeched draco pitifully you re wasting your time draco and mine said rick i can read your mind and believe me it not a good read i know you cantbe trusted you ll be back at your evil master side the first chance you get sorry but i cantallow that squibbus no gasped draco collapsing to the ground since the soles of his feet were still stuck to the floor he was forced to sit he pulled his knees up and wrapped his arms around them whimpering pitifully you ll have to memory charm him said hermione softly moving away from draco as she pocketed her wand he knows too much ginny was staring at rick in shock jaw hanging down she had been amazed at the remarkable powers rick had revealed during the azkaban operation but she d never suspected for a moment that he was the mysterious ghost i was planning on it said rick i ll make myself invisible memory charm him then apparate back to the west tower tell him the ghost of godric gryffindor came to rescue you and squibbed him leave him stuck to the floor for now that ll keep him out of our way the whole school will remain unconscious indefinitely according to what i could glean from his fetid little mind they ve been given the draught of the living death maybe you two should go down to the great hall and check that everyone alright i ll try to keep the attackers away from there ok ginny will you go to the great hall asked hermione urgently i going straight to the library i sure i ve read about an antidote to the draught of the living death yes i remember now wiggenweld potion i need to find out how to make it we ll have to break into snape stores to get the ingredients good idea said rick if you do succeed in brewing the antidote you should probably revive snape first you ll need his help to brew up enough of the antidote for the whole school and that way you can use him as a guinea pig said rick with grin hermione smiled nervously at rick then quickly threw her arms around his neck and kissed him thanks for rescuing me again and good luck rick smiled at her before vanishing although hermione could still feel him in her arms she let him go and heard him say obliviate malfoy suddenly lifted his head and stared about in confusion what happened he demanded glaring at ginny you and the mudblood were chained to that wall how did you get free and what have you done to my feet i cantmove them where my wand he demanded as he rose with difficulty to his feet and searched his pockets frantically you wontbe needing a wand malfoy ever again said hermione harshly approaching him what do you mean snarled draco becoming frustrated and angry dont you remember asked hermione cocking an eyebrow for dramatic effect the ghost of godric gryffindor came to rescue us and squibbed you he said he d warned you that if you associated with voldemort and his lackeys again he d squib you and he did squibbed me wailed draco no not that not a loathsome squib like my disgusting father no it too horrible i d rather be dead it too late malfoy said hermione unsympathetically but look on the bright side you may just get your death wish granted when your evil master dark creatures get here the dark creatures screamed draco in horror they ll be here any minute he began ransacking his robes frantically searching for the ring looking for your portkey ring asked ginny where is it begged draco staring anxiously at her i ll give you a thousand galleons for it ten thousand please give it to me too late malfoy said ginny harshly the ghost destroyed it you re stuck here with the rest of us in fact you re stuck right there to the floor she said laughing come on ginny said hermione let not waste any more time with this pathetic excuse for a squib we ve got work to do are hermione and ginny ok asked ron anxiously when rick reappeared on the west tower yeah fine said rick has harry spotted any attackers yet no he was just back a couple of minutes ago i told him where you d gone he told me not to worry that you d take care of malfoy so what did you do to the slimy git squibbed him said rick ron face lit up with an enormous grin i cantthink of a more deserving git than malfoy that curse was made for him rick proceeded to tell ron how everyone in the school but the five gryffindors and draco were in a drugged sleep first time in my life i glad i missed a meal said ron grimly hey here comes harry and it looks like he in a hurry harry approached the tower fast stalling at the last moment to drop on the parapet before jumping to the ground and transforming giants about fifty of them said harry hurriedly they re in the forbidden forest uprooting trees it looks like they re planning to use them as clubs or battering rams to smash their way into the castle yeah makes sense said ron they ll have been sent in first to breach the castle defences so the other dark creatures can get inside harry everyone but us three ginny and hermione have been drugged by malfoy they re all asleep down in the great hall hermione and ginny are trying to revive them dumbledore got filch to lock and barricade all the castle entrances last night but malfoy might have reopened some of them you should fly around the school and check that everything secured what about malfoy where he asked harry squibbed with his feet stuck to the floor said rick grinning harry after you ve checked everything locked up start flying reconnaissance again and let ron know if you spot anything i ll come back here when i get the chance for news from you ok right said harry look here come the giants it time for action said rick making himself invisible and apparating to the edge of the forbidden forest from where the giants were beginning to emerge harry transformed into an eagle and flew off leaving ron alone to watch the fearsome scene taking place at the edge of the forest the giants were at least twenty feet tall a truly awesome sight as they came out from the forest their enormous footsteps shaking the earth ron could feel the tremors in the tower they were wildly brandishing their enormous tree clubs and bellowing blood curdling cries as they stomped ponderously towards the castle bloody hell thought ron i sure hope rick can stop them if that lot make it to the castle they ll do more than break in they ll smash it to bits despite the gravity of the situation he couldnthelp but laugh at how utterly brainless the giants were several of them had managed to clout their comrades with their wildly swinging clubs three of them were struggling half dazed to their feet having been felled by their fellows upon rising unsteadily to his feet one of them began staggering in a stupor towards the lake instead of carrying on towards the castle as ron looked anxiously towards the approaching mob he noticed that one by one they were disappearing into thin air but upon closer inspection he discovered that they were not in fact disappearing but being transformed into tiny pixies no more than a few inches tall the pixies were alarmed to find themselves among the diminishing pack of giants who rather than puzzling over their dwindling numbers began swinging their enormous clubs at the tiny pixies fortunately pixies are fast and nimble and easily managed to pick their way through the giants enormous legs and dash off for the cover afforded by the forbidden forest ron was really enjoying the show now soon all the giants had been transformed to pixies well all but one the dazed giant who had stumbled off to the lake had just fallen in making an enormous splash but suddenly he was gone and there was a large dolphin swimming about in the lake apparently having a lot of fun as he leaped clear of the water before diving back in nice one rick thought ron the giant squid will probably appreciate the company after the last of the pixies had disappeared into the forest there was an eerie silence ron noticed that rick had once again resumed his falcon form and was flying along the edge of the forbidden forest he flew back and forth for several minutes before suddenly diving to the ground and vanishing ron stared nervously towards the edge of the forest whatever was about to emerge from its cover was not going to be pleasant of that he was sure he didnthave long to wait voldemort assuming the castle defences were now breached was sending in his terrifying creatures in waves with a small gap between each wave to prevent them attacking each other rather than their intended victims first to emerge from the trees were five fearsome nundu the gigantic leopard like creatures are among the most dangerous beasts in existence ron shivered as the huge nundu padded lithely like giant cats towards the castle they were enormous each one must have been at least fifteen feet long ron would have been even more terrified had he known they didnteven need to touch their prey to kill them their breath alone caused fatal diseases and death but they never got close enough to the castle to breathe on anyone suddenly they were gone and in their place were five frolicking kneazles looking back towards the forest ron saw thirty mountain trolls lumbering vaguely in the direction of the castle their progress was slowed by their enthusiasm for trying out their new clubs on each other ron briefly turned his mind back to his first year when he and harry had rescued hermione from a mountain troll this lot looked very similar about twelve feet tall with grey skin ugly lumpy bodies and flat horny feet and depressingly stupid recalled ron rick wontneed to worry too much about those morons most of them will have been brained by their mates before they get anywhere near the castle the next attackers to emerge from the forest were manticores there were seven of them and they were far more dangerous than the stupid pack of trolls ron gasped when he saw them they had a head like a human a body like a lion and the tail of a scorpion ron remembered from hagrid lessons that their tail was venomous and its sting instantly fatal he also remembered that their skin repels magical charms just like a dragon s rick going to have his work cut out transforming that lot though ron nervously they probably have a weak spot somewhere but it ll take him a while to find it and it could be difficult to get at rick suddenly became visible standing between the mountain trolls and the castle oi over here you idiots he yelled to attract their attention as they began chasing him with their awkward lumbering gait rick wheeled around in a wide arc back towards the forbidden forest and the manticores when the approaching groups were about fifty feet apart rick disappeared manticores are bad tempered beasts at the best of times and finding their direct path to the castle blocked by a bunch of imbecilic trolls heading in the wrong direction they began shouting at them with their very humanlike voices mountain trolls may be stupid but not so stupid that they dontknow when they are being insulted they set upon the manticores with gusto always up for a fight ron had a great view of the battle it looked like rick was staying out of it and letting them finish each other off the mountain trolls outnumbered the manticores four to one but the manticores were much more dangerous and far more intelligent than their huge foes when the dust had finally settled the trolls were all dead they d put up a ferocious struggle due to stupidity rather than valour it never occurred to them to turn tail and run as the manticores began killing them all off with their fatal stings the manticores however had not got off unscathed they had taken quite a battering from the troll enormous clubs three of them were dead their vulnerable skulls smashed in and the other four were stumbling about in a daze bleeding from head wounds rick took the opportunity to make his move he discovered their magical protection was weakest around the eyes and was especially weak in their injured state since they were badly wounded rick decided to try transforming them into some kind of lizard as lizards posses the ability to recover quickly from injuries it took quite a bit of effort but he eventually succeeded in transforming the four remaining manticores into mokes a harmless shrinking lizard while rick had been occupied with the manticores he had not been keeping an eye out for fresh attackers but luckily harry had he swooped down on rick to get his attention and then immediately headed off towards the castle rick looked up to see what appeared to be a black river flowing towards the castle but upon closer inspection he realised it was not a river at all but hundreds of acromantulas marching steadily towards the castle in fact the head of their orderly column had already reached it and they were beginning to scale the outer walls the enormous spiders were heading straight for the west tower and ron they were on the march for food it seemed and ron was the only food around rick apparated directly to the west tower where he found five acromantulas fighting over ron who was lying unconscious on the ground rick immediately transformed the gigantic spiders into lovely red and black ladybugs who immediately took flight he quickly leaned over the side of the tower and similarly transformed the acromantulas who were scaling the castle walls the others would keep a while he had to focus on ron while he was checking him over harry came in to land how is he asked harry with a worried voice did they get him yeah nodded rick sadly he alive but he been bitten in at least three places i donthave time to heal him now while we re under attack anyway hermione much better than me he closed his eyes for a moment and then opening them he looked at ron and said hibernatus that should stop the poison progressing any further hermione down in snape dungeon get him down to her as fast as you can dontforget to use a locking charm on the tower door and come straight back mate i need your help down in the potions dungeon hermione and ginny were working over five large cauldrons while snape was gathering additional ingredients you certainly made a mess of my stores miss granger he said acidly when you pillaged it for ingredients how an incompetent student such as yourself managed to get the wiggenweld potion correct the very first time is quite beyond me it is notoriously difficult to brew correctly and the slightest mistake renders it lethal yes sir i read that in the potions encyclopaedia in the library said hermione keeping her eyes fixed on the caldron she was stirring err that why we didntgive it to anyone else until we were sure err that it wasnt lethal queried snape cocking an eyebrow at hermione how touching that you should choose me as your guinea pig said snape sarcastically oh it seemed rather appropriate replied hermione with a touch of sarcasm as our potions master you deserve much of the credit for our success or otherwise in brewing the potion it seemed only fair that you should be the first to benefit from the fruits of labours professor snape snorted since the potion had worked he could hardly criticise the blasted know it all weasley he said there is enough of your original brew for several more doses since i am still alive we may safely conclude that it is not lethal go to the great hall and administer it to the headmaster you can also revive madam pomfrey and professor sprout i can use their assistance in brewing more of the potion lean their heads back and give them exactly thirteen drops each is that understood yes sir said ginny carefully grasping the small vial of turquoise coloured wiggenweld potion as she left the dungeon snape moved along the line of cauldrons on which hermione was working and finding no fault nodded his head approvingly i must congratulate you miss granger he said grudgingly it appears that you may have spent enough time in my classes actually paying attention to what i was saying to learn something he said caustically hermione was taken aback by snape backhanded compliment in fact she was stunned in almost six years he had never once made a positive comment either to her or about her but it was too good to last snape immediately regretting his words added mockingly and i always thought you spent my entire class trying to think up clever things to say to show off your book knowledge hermione fought to contain her anger she was sorely tempted to tell snape exactly what she thought of him with no holds barred but she kept her silence concentrating on the job at hand until she was distracted by a noise from the corridor suddenly a stretcher magically suspended by the mobilicorpus spell floated in through the open doorway ron was lying unconscious on the stretcher harry followed behind guiding it into the dungeon hermione gasped potter what is the meaning of this why are you and mr weasley not down in the great hall with the rest of the school in fact he added turning towards hermione how is it that both you and miss weasley also managed to avoid getting drugged with the rest of the school i ll explain it all in a minute sir said harry turning to hermione and ignoring snape he been bitten by acromantulas hermione rick put a hibernatus spell on him to temporarily stop the poison spreading can you heal him he asked in a worried voice hermione manoeuvred ron onto snape desk brushing aside several scrolls and a book which fell to the floor finite incantatum she said ron immediately began to groan and gasp for air although his eyes remained closed there were large bleeding puncture marks on an arm and leg where the giant spiders had bitten him what on earth do you think you are playing at miss she a healer said harry simply stepping in front of snape to prevent him interfering hermione healed ron a week ago in the hospital wing when everyone including you was sure he was going to die indeed said snape in stunned disbelief he was still completely mystified as to how weasley had recovered from what were undoubtedly fatal injuries on that occasion there was such a look of absolute certainty and conviction in potter eyes that completely against his instincts snape decided to give them the benefit of the doubt for now weasley situation was dire from what he had read on the subject of acromantula venom there was absolutely no hope of recovery anyway so there was nothing lost in humouring them apart from his dignity and a great many house points but that could wait until later this all sounds very far fetched said snape with undisguised incredulity but if you really believe you are able to heal him miss granger i suggest you start with the kidneys liver pancreas and brain those are the first organs to be destroyed by acromantula venom i will prepare a potion that will neutralise what venom remains in his blood although i doubt he will live long enough to benefit from it hermione began moving her hands in circles above the organs snape had mentioned a soft white light seemed to glow from her hands flowing from the palms into ron body when snape returned several minutes later with the anti venom potion he was utterly stunned at the sight of hermione her hands glowing as she moved them around ron head the strange light from her hands seemed to flow into him ron eyes slowly opened as he regained consciousness bloody hell bloody great spiders he wailed his face contorted in terror but before he could say anything further snape pointed his wand at ron bringing him up to a half sitting position and lifted a vial of bright purple liquid to his lips drink this weasley he ordered all of it it contains a mild tranquillizer which should help to ease the horror of the attack hermione meanwhile had waved her hands across the three vicious puncture marks where ron had been bitten on his arm and leg instantly healing them snape regarded her with a look which was an incongruous mixture of disbelief suspicion awe and apprehension lie still mr weasley he said magically lowering ron to a reclining position he proceeded to examine ron carefully for several minutes snape then turned towards hermione gazing intently at her with an inscrutable expression on his face which gave nothing away then turning back to ron he said you appear to be completely healed mr weasley i can find nothing wrong with you at all kindly remove yourself from my desk when ron had awkwardly up from his desk snape pointed his wand at it saying scourgify in a distasteful tone as if its sanctity had somehow been violated he waved his wand at the scrolls and other items which hermione had knocked to the floor in her haste to make room for ron they floated back onto the desk and with final flick of his wand snape restored the contents of his desk to their correct place turning on ron and hermione he glared at them with piercing eyes now miss granger and mr weasley perhaps one of you would care tell me what on earth is going on potter has sneaked away on me i see i believe he mentioned mr godfry name also that makes five gryffindors who alone out of the whole school managed to avoid being drugged with the draught of the living death it is very hard not to conclude that the five of you were responsible it was draco malfoy said hermione not us oh really said snape in patent disbelief this will of course mean immediate expulsion from hogwarts for all five of you regardless of what mysterious powers you and mr godfry may possess miss granger but it wasntus yelled ron angrily you slim ron no interrupted hermione before he could tell snape exactly what he thought of him err shouldntwe be working on the wiggenweld potion professor asked hermione moving back to one of the cauldrons i sure this can all be sorted out later if we dontstir these cauldrons the potion will be ruined snape glared at her through narrowed eyes i am quite capable of managing to brew wiggenweld potion without your instructions you insufferable know it all spat snape derisively however he quickly began checking the cauldrons and stirring them vigorously when he was satisfied with them he looked up to discover that ron had snuck away from the dungeon while his back was turned where has mr weasley gone demanded snape angrily hermione knew perfectly well that he d gone back to the west tower to help rick and harry but she just shrugged her shoulders silently until the headmaster formally expels you you are still a student at this school miss granger snape said in his haughtiest voice you are required to obey me now where are godfry potter and weasley and what are they up to at that very moment the headmaster walked into the dungeon smiling serenely ah severus do forgive me i ve been sleeping on the job again i fear he said with a playful smile but the excellent potion brewed by misses granger and weasley has revived me wonderfully am i correct in believing that wiggenweld potion is extremely difficult to brew i consider their success a testament to the outstanding teaching abilities of their potions master he added smiling warmly at snape thank you headmaster said snape emotionlessly indeed it is an exceptionally difficult potion to brew it is also highly dangerous the slightest mistake and it is absolutely lethal miss granger and miss weasley took the precaution of testing it on me first before administering it further dumbledore snorted as he suppressed a laugh but his blue eyes were twinkling merrily now now severus miss granger has i believe been top of your potions class and all her other classes for that matter for the past five years i am sure you were in no danger how many house points should we award to gryffindor for their excellent potion award hissed snape incredulously almost choking on the words but headmaster miss granger and miss weasley along with mr potter mr godfry and mr weasley are the only ones in the whole school who were not drugged surely it is obvious that it must have been they who perpetrated this extremely dangerous and foolhardy prank i would have expected you to deduct house points not award them and to expel all five of them immediately ah but it was not they who put the sleeping draft in the breakfast severus it was draco malfoy he was acting under orders from voldemort whose dark creatures are at this very moment attacking the school snape looked completely horrified but headmaster what is being done to repel the attackers and protect the school dumbledore smiled at snape now severus you know very well i have my reasons for keeping secrets from you you will just have to trust me when i say that our defenders have more than the measure of voldemort foul creatures you may rely upon it godfry potter and weasley asked snape in disbelief dumbledore just smiled silently heaven help us muttered snape under his breath i see you and miss granger are brewing up a large batch of the wiggenweld potion severus could you use any further assistance yes headmaster but only from madam pomfrey and professor sprout replied snape i certainly wouldnttrust any students with such a difficult and potentially deadly potion except for miss granger perhaps asked the headmaster innocently snape glared at hermione in view of the seriousness of the situation miss granger may continue to render her assistance muttered snape ungraciously please take a few moments to leave a review chapter 32 lady firebird and muldorion after sneaking away from the potions dungeon while professor snape was occupied with the cauldrons of wiggenweld potion ron rushed straight back to the west tower he was dreading finding more acromantulas there and breathed an enormous sigh of relief at finding the nightmare monsters from hell were gone rick had disposed of them all ron immediately scanned the edge of the forbidden forest from where the waves of attackers had come voldemort spatial portal must be somewhere in the forest thought ron as he searched unsuccessfully for rick and harry fortunately there was no sign of any dark creatures either ron walked slowly around the parapet scanning the horizon until he was facing in the opposite direction from the forbidden forest towards the quidditch field what he saw there made his blood run cold harry was flying over the quidditch stands on his firebolt which they had brought to the tower along with ron broom and another for rick just in case they were needed the source of ron fright was harry pursuers he was certain they were vampires hundreds of them all chasing after harry ron was puzzled why doesnthe fly faster harry can fly heaps faster than that he shouldnthave any trouble getting away from those vampires why isnthe using his quidditch skills to soar and dive and evade them hell why doesnthe just transform into an eagle i hope he hasntbeen bitten thought ron becoming worried but then he noticed something very strange the closest things to harry werentvampires at all they were bats then he noticed that the bats unlike the vampires didntseem to be interested in harry they were turning away from him and flying towards the castle bloody hell thought ron vampires can change into bats that what they re doing they re changing into bats and when they get to the castle they ll change back into vampires and attack what the hell am i supposed to do now he asked himself reaching for his broom in a panic but before he could fly off ron realised with great relief that the approaching bats were not making for the castle they were going to fly right past it in fact they kept going until they reached the forbidden forest ron looked back at harry there was still a constant stream of bats coming from his direction and heading for the forest ron scratched his head puzzled as he noticed that the number of vampires chasing harry was becoming smaller suddenly ron slapped himself hard on the forehead as he realised what was really happening bloody brilliant he muttered to himself rick made himself invisible and he riding on the back of harry broom vampires are intelligent creatures they know who harry potter is and they re going for him harry deliberately letting them keep up with him to allow rick to transform them into bats the bats having no interest in wizards on broomsticks were heading for the forest probably going off for a good day kip thought ron laughing the remaining vampires were puzzled no doubt as to why their fellows were changing themselves into bats but since it was something they did naturally it didntoccur to them that they were actually being transformed by rick permanently when the last vampire had been transformed harry flew back to the west tower on his firebolt rick who was also on the broom made himself visible and looked apologetically at ron i really sorry about those acromantulas mate i was so busy dealing with the manticores that i didntspot them until it was too late and they d climbed up here and got to you it must have been horrible bloody hell i never want to experience anything like that again as long as i live it was worse than the time we escaped from a whole herd of the bleeding monsters in dad ford anglia said ron turning to harry when i saw them coming up the tower i was petrified my brain stopped working it was my absolute worst nightmare come true instead of jumping on my broom and flying away or getting down from the tower and bolting the door behind me i just stood there frozen with fear you have no idea how bloody huge those things look when they re on top of you and grab you with those massive pincers of theirs and bite but ron couldnt go on he was shaking too much from the terrible memories his face had gone as white as a sheet his freckles standing out in stark contrast harry put an arm around ron shoulder you poor bugger he said sympathetically try not to think about it mate err so did hermione fix you up ok yeah she bloody amazing but you re right i have to stop thinking about those said ron determinedly then turning his mind back to what he had just witnessed he said hey that was a really neat trick you two pulled on those vampires it took me a while to figure out what was going on what the hell were those vampires doing out in daytime i always thought they only came out at night yeah met too said harry i suppose voldemort found some dark magic that allows them to get about in daylight well that lot will be strictly nocturnal from now on now that they re bats said rick right laughed ron so what else has attacked since those horrible bloody gigantic he said shuddering once again at the memory of the acromantulas quintapeds said rick quickly attempting to distract ron from the giant spiders there were about fifty of them but they werentmuch trouble i transformed them into bowtruckles they all rushed off to the forbidden forest to find themselves a tree after that came a whole bunch of banshees uh they were ghastly he said with a shudder while rick was talking harry had transformed into an eagle and flown off on another surveillance mission so what did you do about the banshees asked ron was their screaming as dreadful as they say harry had just come back up here from the potions dungeon answered rick i put a deafening spell on both of us to protect us from their screaming so i dontreally know what they sounded like i apparated over to where they d come out from the forest and transformed the lot of them into a lovely flock of jobberknolls good one said ron enthusiastically remind me not to go walking in the forbidden forest on the day any of those jobberknolls die their death screams arentlethal like banshees but they re meant to be bloody awful just the same i wonder if that it mused rick i sure hope so what else could voldemort have left to throw at us i cantthink of anything mate replied ron it not full moon so there wontbe werewolves fortunately since we ve disposed of the dementors what else could the evil bastard have left it looks like we re about to find out said rick pointing towards harry who was approaching fast yeah i think you re right replied ron his eyes fixed upon the fast moving eagle as it dived towards them something sure as hell has put the wind up harry harry transformed instantly dragons he exclaimed as he struggled to catch his breath they re still over the forbidden forest i didnthang about to count them after i realised what they were but there must be dozens of them hang on said rick dragons arent dark creatures are they no definitely not said ron but charlie said one time that there are spells a rider can use to control a dragon they ll have death eaters riding them bloody hell this is bad it wonttake long for a bunch of dragons to set the school ablaze and destroy it how about we do the same thing as we did with the vampires suggested harry you wontbe able to transform the dragons they re too well protected from magic but if i fly you about on the back of my broom you could squib their riders no said rick shaking his head we d both be incinerated before i could squib even a few of the death eaters so what can we do asked ron desperately look here they come i going to transform into my norwegian ridgeback animagus form said rick maybe i can convince the dragons to revolt against their riders you two better get down from here before you get barbequed go warn dumbledore and try to get everyone who been revived down to the dungeons in case i cantstop them harry and ron nodded and were quickly gone rick carefully balanced himself on the parapet before transforming into an enormous norwegian ridgeback he unfurled his gigantic wings and leaning forward pushed off with his feet he was soon airborne and flying directly towards the approaching dragons there were about thirty of the enormous beasts many of them appeared to be common welsh greens but there were also hungarian horntails romanian longhorns swedish short snouts and a handful of norwegian ridgebacks they were flying in v formation and the leader was a norwegian ridgeback somewhat smaller than rick as rick approached the lead dragon he made a conciliatory gesture with his head to demonstrate his peaceful intentions the lead dragon returned the gesture as rick turned to fly along side of it greetings oh mighty one said the dragon deferentially obviously impressed with rick superior size whom do i have the pleasure of addressing asked rick politely i am called lady firebird she said with great dignity and how may i ask are you called err i dontreally have a name said rick awkwardly how very curious replied lady firebird but you must have a name allow me to give you one she examined rick closely from his fiery snout to his formidable tail finally she spoke you shall be known henceforth as muldorion the magnificent because you are indeed a truly magnificent beast thank you madam said rick gallantly in what seemed intuitively to be the correct form of speech for the occasion do you have a nesting mate my magnificent one asked lady firebird as small wisps of flame escaped her mouth betraying her keen interest err no madam replied rick uneasily as he became aware of the amorous feelings lady firebird was developing towards him err you see i am not just a dragon lady firebird i am many other things a bird a wizard and many more things besides how remarkable she replied so really you are wizard who can change into many shapes including that of a magnificent dragon is that correct she asked with a trace of disappointment in her voice yes my lady replied rick it is correct after a few moments of awkward silence he decided to get to the point my noble lady firebird i have come to request your aid to help save my friends who are in the castle which lies before us i would gladly help you my splendid one but we dragons are not free to act as we choose each one of us has upon our back a rider they are wizards who use their magic to bend us to their will we do not wish to kill and destroy but we are forced to by these evil ones can you not resist them asked rick as lady firebird suddenly veered away from him her rider had been furiously flinging spells at rick for the past few minutes but they rebounded harmlessly from his thick magical scales rick turned to catch up with lady firebird that was my rider he forced me to fly away from you she said apologetically in answer to your question no it is not possible for us to disobey our rider the wicked magic they use causes us enormous pain if we do not obey i am struggling against such pain even now as we speak for my rider is trying to keep me away from you it cannot be resisted for long she said hastily before veering violently away from rick once more rick quickly caught her up again i entreat you please listen to me my lady i have an idea that will save my friends and also free you and you and your fellow dragons from the evil ones who enslave you i shall turn back into a wizard and destroy the magic of the evil one who rides upon your back i shall then take his place in your saddle i wish you to fly alongside each of your friends in turn so i may destroy the magic of their riders it may take some time to get all the riders so please ask your friends not to attack the castle while i am working even though their riders may cause them great pain when i am finished you will all be free i hope you will be merciful to your riders and not kill them they will be rendered harmless i shall do as you ask replied lady firebird if you can do all you promise you are well named my muldorion my magnificent one adieu rick changed into a falcon and dived beneath lady firebird coming up behind her and landing on her back a few feet behind her unsuspecting rider he then changed back to himself quickly grabbing hold of a harness strap to prevent being thrown off the dragon undulating back he made himself invisible before intoning squibbus the astonished death eater turned when he heard the dreaded word but he saw no one he found himself being lifted magically out of his saddle and the next moment he was tightly bound and securely strapped to the harness some feet behind the saddle lady firebird felt an exhilarating sense of freedom the moment rick squibbed her rider it was intoxicating and she wanted to soar through the sky in celebration but then she remembered her promise to muldorion who even now was riding on her back in his wizard form she commanded the other dragons not to attack the castle promising them they would soon be free to fly where they wished beginning with those closest to the castle she flew alongside her fellow dragons one by one she knew as soon as their riders had been neutralised because the beasts flew off in joyful abandon at their new found freedom when he had squibbed the last dragon rider rick freed himself from the dragon saddle and transformed into a falcon he flew to lady firebird head where he changed back into a dragon thank you lady firebird said rick you were wonderful you have helped me save the school and all my friends i shall be eternally grateful to you my lady but now i must go in case any further attackers should come there are no more replied lady firebird we were the last i am glad to have been able to help you my magnificent one but in truth there is no way to repay you for giving us our freedom perhaps one day you might come in your dragon form to visit me i can be found at the place known as the hanging valley of fire in the autumn during mating season fare thee well my muldorion my magnificent one she said with a large tear in her eye as she turned and flew away by the time the students and the remaining staff had been revived by the vast quantities of antidote brewed up by snape and his helpers the dragons were gone and the battle was over the only evidence left of the attack of the dark creatures were the bodies of the dead mountain trolls and manticores lying near the edge of the forbidden forest hagrid got together a party to dispose of them professor dumbledore considered it a stroke of luck that almost the entire school had been unconscious and had not witnessed the attack only professors snape and sprout plus madam pomfrey who had been revived by hermione and ginny potion knew that harry potter ron weasley and rick godfry were the ones who fought off the attackers professor sprout and madam pomfrey naturally assumed that harry potter had been the main actor in the school defence it was an assumption that dumbledore was happy to tacitly encourage he was well aware of snape suspicions regarding rick godfry but he could be trusted to remain silent none of them knew the particulars of how the attackers had been defeated and would be as surprised as everyone else when a variety of new and unusual species were discovered inhabiting the forbidden forest not to mention the giant squid new playmate a very large happy dolphin who had mysteriously taken up residence in the lake it was assumed that with the exception of the slain mountain trolls and manticores the attackers had simply fled dumbledore gave them no further information and asked them to keep what they knew about the attack to themselves he wanted to keep rick powers a secret if possible at the evening meal that night the headmaster gave a carefully abridged account of the day events draco malfoy who incidentally is no longer a student at this school forced one of the house elves to adulterate all the dishes and beverages of this morning breakfast with the draught of the living death rendering the whole school with the exception of five students unconscious we all owe a great debt to the bravery initiative and intelligence of those students they are harry potter hermione granger ronald weasley rick godfry and ginny weasley all heads turned to the gryffindor table and the five of them who were seated together this was an attempt and very nearly a successful one by voldemort to destroy hogwarts and kill all the students and staff said dumbledore most of the students gasped when he spoke the dreaded name and his last comment about killing everyone evoked a shocked buzz of chatter from the four long tables silencing the students with a wave of his hand dumbledore continued while the whole school was drugged voldemort sent in his legions of dark creatures however by great good fortune the previously mentioned students missed breakfast this morning they bravely fought off the attackers and succeeded in the extraordinarily difficult task of brewing an antidote to the draught of the living death this was used to revive myself and several colleagues including professor snape who supervised the production of a large enough quantity of the potion to awaken the entire school i have no doubt that you will all be most eager for further details of the attack and how it was thwarted but i must request you most forcefully not to prevail upon those who were involved for such information for anyone who was not already aware that we are involved in a deadly war against the forces of evil today events should leave you in no doubt whatsoever the exact manner in which today attack was repulsed involved magic which in the context of the war i wish to remain secret dumbledore continued in recognition of their great deed in saving the school and the lives of us all i award five hundred points to gryffindor the headmaster had to pause for a few moments to wait for the excited yells and loud cheering which erupted from the gryffindor table to subside i would ask the five students to stand and allow us to all acknowledge their great feat and to offer them our heartfelt thanks said dumbledore harry hermione ron rick and ginny rose self consciously to their feet looking up towards the head table and professor dumbledore who beaming at them began clapping enthusiastically the whole school joined in making an enormous din the likes of which had not been heard in the great hall for many years the final school term got under way and life at hogwarts resumed its normal rhythm the students who had not returned after the easter break were soon back at school their parents having provided them with notes claiming illness extenuating family circumstances of various sorts missing the train and a host of other lame excuses for why their children had not returned at the appointed time professor dumbledore welcomed them back without comment many of the students would not have known the real reason their parents had kept them back and the headmaster was not going to condemn the children for the sins of their parents one saturday afternoon late in may harry hermione rick and ron were sitting around a table in the gryffindor common room hermione as usual had books piled up all around her as she worked her way through her revision program for the final exams i dontknow why you re starting to study already hermione complained ron i mean the sixth year exams are ages away and they re no big deal anyway it not like the owls in fifth year or the newts next year said ron they dontreally count so why bother ron said hermione looking up clearly irritated at being distracted from her studies you have to pass every subject in sixth year that you want to study in seventh year for your newts remember really asked ron surprised i didntknow that yes really replied hermione in an exasperated tone i dontknow how many times i ve told you this year but you keep conveniently forgetting it the exams are only a weeks away i suggest you start on the revision program i drew up for you at the start of the term if you want to pass that is and the same goes for you harry she said sternly turning to harry who was thumbing casually through at an old quidditch magazine then turning to rick hermione narrowed her eyes and sounding distinctly annoyed added some of us actually have to study for our exams come on hermione loosen up a bit said rick in a conciliatory tone you know perfectly well you ll pass everything with flying colours well i want to do better than pass all my subjects replied hermione piqued i intend to but she stopped and glared at rick once more before quickly turning back to the book lying open on the table in front of her with cheeks burning bright red and muttering unfair and cheat under her breath as they drew closer to the exams hermione was getting more and more stressed at the prospect that she would not have the highest overall mark for their year she had always been dux of her year at hogwarts and her muggle primary school for that matter as well but hermione was growing increasingly fearful that rick was about to usurp her title without making the slightest effort she knew it wasnt his fault and she loved him dearly but it made her absolutely furious just the same it was all so unfair harry ron and rick moved down to the other end of the table leaving hermione to study in peace and hoping she would leave them to not study in peace you know the problem said harry softly is that i really find it hard to take my studies seriously and worry about them while voldemort still out there he may have lost his dark creatures and a lot of his death eaters but he still got plenty more not to mention all his evil powers i hate this waiting always waiting for him to strike waiting to see what he going to do next said harry tensely i wish we could find out where he is and take the fight to him said ron we re always on the bloody defensive waiting for him to call the shots and make the first move if we could find him we could attack him on our terms and finish the evil bastard off according to dumbledore the order doesnthave a clue where he is replied rick they think he keeps moving about when he summons his followers using their dark mark they have no idea where they re going they use some sort of apparition like spell which takes them to voldemort to wherever he is at that moment it a different place each time what about drawing him into a trap suggested ron i dontthink it d work mate replied harry he completely paranoid remember he d immediately suspect something he d never come the others nodded in agreement and the three boys fell into silence for a few minutes hey has any one seen ginny asked harry after scanning the common room for her distinctive fiery red head rick and ron shook their heads ginny herbology class is doing a project on the flutterby bush said harry they have to prune them every day ginny said she was going to prune hers after lunch i might just wander down to the greenhouses and see if she still there you sure you re not sneaking off for a snog demanded ron suspiciously ron mate said harry with an exasperated sigh i am not going off for a snog but if i was so what ginny my girlfriend and you know it so just get over it will you hey i know why dontyou go find padma and take her for a walk or whatever and leave me and ginny alone no chance there mate complained ron i should have known better than getting myself a girlfriend in ravenclaw padma almost as bad as hermione she damn well revising for the exams as well what is it with these witches harry laughed as he set off to find ginny you ought to get hermione to do padma one of her revision schedules said rick with a grin i ve got a half hour slot scheduled everyday in hermione timetable until the week before the exams start you poor bugger snorted ron with a smirk padma not quite as organised or stingy as hermione i get a bit more quality time than that boy hermione sure got you on thin rations mate laughed ron loudly what that asked hermione looking up quizzically from her work what all this about rations err nothing hermione said rick innocently bloody ron he can never keep his voice down he thought to himself hermione normally would have pursued the point she hated it when something was going on which she didntknow about but she had too much work to do to bother with rick and ron and their silly juvenile jokes today hermione returned to her work and the two boys continued chatting quietly at the other end of the table until harry returned ten minutes later find ginny asked ron err no replied harry sounding a little uneasy professor sprout was down at the greenhouses and said ginny hasntbeen down there today i wonder where she could have got to i know i ll check for her on the marauders map he said turning towards the stairs that led up to their dormitory wait up a bit mate said rick closing his eyes and projecting a map of the castle in his mind after scanning it carefully for a minute he opened his eyes and spoke in a worried tone i dontlike this at all i cantsee ginny anywhere she not at hogwarts are you certain asked hermione nervously rick serious tone had cut through her concentration and her studies were forgotten absolutely certain confirmed rick apprehensively voldemort got her said harry in a thick voice his face white with fear he taken her just like he took hermione at christmas to get me rick stood up and placed a reassuring hand on harry shoulder we dontknow for sure that he got her but if he has we ll get her back mate just like we got hermione back i going to dumbledore to tell him what happened then looking harry directly in the eye he added if it is voldemort who taken her we all know why we all know who he really after use your head this time harry and dontgo rushing off into the evil bastard traps and giving him what he wants it wontsave ginny but it will lose everything rick had cast an imperturbable charm around them as well as his wizard repelling charm as soon as he d realised ginny was missing he didntwant the whole common room to know about it he looked meaningfully at hermione and then ron distressed as they were they both understood his meaning keep an eye on harry dontlet him out of your sight checking that dumbledore was alone rick apparated directly to the headmaster office professor dumbledore sat back in his chair behind his immense desk his aged face was etched with lines of worry his blue eyes were not sparkling now they were clouded with concern rick who was standing anxiously before the headmaster desk had just informed him of ginny disappearance how do you think he could have got her asked rick nervously could one of the death eaters children have got a portkey into the school no sighed dumbledore it is not possible to get a portkey past the school wards in harry fourth year barty crouch junior created a portkey out of the triwizard cup but he was already within the wards when he did it creating a portkey is quite advanced magic draco malfoy apparently was capable of it as he made the portkey ring to escape the attack of the dark creatures mr malfoy was a powerful wizard but as he is no longer a wizard and no longer at hogwarts i think it unlikely that any of the remaining students who could conceivably have been party to miss weasley presumed abduction are capable of creating a portkey in retrospect it was perhaps unwise of me to have allowed the death eaters children to return after their failure to come back after the easter break he added with regret but that would have been unfair to the innocent ones sir offered rick yes indeed rick it would replied dumbledore shaking his head unhappily one must always be careful when attempting to thwart or punish the guilty not to harm the innocent or those who may be innocent the headmaster was lost in thought for a minute of two before speaking again the fifth year gryffindors take herbology with slytherin everyone in her class would have known miss weasley would be visiting the greenhouses she was probably ambushed and stunned before reaching them placed under an invisibility cloak and removed from the hogwarts grounds to where she could have been apparated or portkeyed away to anywhere said dumbledore gloomily pansy parkinson has an invisibility cloak or at least access to one said rick remembering how she had abducted hermione from her dormitory in the first term yes and she may well have played some part in this affair agreed dumbledore however now is not the time to concern ourselves with the minor accomplices i am certain they will not have the slightest idea as to where miss weasley has been taken voldemort has obviously been made aware of the secret relationship between ginny weasley and harry potter that he has taken her to lure harry to his death is certain we must prevent harry falling into his hands at all costs hermione and ron are keeping an eye on him sir they are both aware of the situation perhaps i should go join them yes indeed replied dumbledore harry will be in a very disturbed state and no doubt blaming himself for what has happened to miss weasley voldemort has in the past shown himself to be most adept at manipulating harry emotions i want you to stay as close to harry as possible dontlet him out of your sight it will be my sad duty to report miss weasley disappearance to her parents it is not something i am looking but he was cut off at that moment by the sound of someone yelling from outside the office ron said rick having closed his eyes for a moment dumbledore made a motion with his hand to push aside the stone gargoyle guarding the entrance to his office below allowing ron entry ron burst into the office gasping for breath he d obviously run flat out all the way from gryffindor tower harry gone he cried please take a few moments to leave a review coming up chapter 33 end game chapter 33 end game ron sat in the large chair in the headmaster office into which he had collapsed after his desperate sprint to deliver the terrible news that harry was gone he was bent forward holding his head in his hands struggling to catch his breath both professor dumbledore and rick stared at him as they waited impatiently with a sense of deep foreboding for further information about harry just as ron was about to speak hermione rushed into the room she had started out from the gryffindor common room at the same time as ron but not being so athletic it had taken her longer to reach the headmaster office she was crying and visibly distressed rick gently drew her down to a large black couch in front of dumbledore desk he put a comforting arm around her as she buried her head in his shoulder the tears continuing to stream from her eyes a few minutes after rick left the common room an owl flew in through the window with a message for harry said ron regaining his breath and sounding very distressed as soon as he read it he turned his face from us so we couldntsee his reaction and said i think i know where ginny is i going to check on the marauders map then he rushed up the stairs to the dormitory taking the message with him hermione having sufficiently recovered from her mad dash to the headmaster office continued the story we looked at each other for a second then rushed up the stairs after him but he slammed the dormitory door in our faces and locked it it took a minute or two to break his locking charm his magic has become very powerful and when we got into the room the window was open and he was gone we found this on the floor said hermione thrusting a crumpled piece of parchment across the headmaster desk towards him as she bit her lip sobbing dumbledore read the message aloud harry potter i am holding ginny weasley captive i believe that she is a friend of yours perhaps more than a friend i make you this offer her life for yours i swear a binding wizard oath that if you come immediately and alone her life will be spared and no harm will come to her i also swear that if you do not come as requested she will be tortured mercilessly and then killed to save her life you must go as quickly as possible to the hogwarts gates on passing through them look on the ground twenty feet to your right you will find a silver branch in a zigzag shape similar to that of your scar pick it up it will bring you to me decide quickly i shall not wait long which is it to be your life or hers lord voldemort harry must have transformed into an eagle and flown to the school gates and taken voldemort portkey said hermione sobbing again i thought of grabbing a broom said ron and trying to stop him but it would have taken too long he d have been gone before i got there you re right said rick having closed his eyes for a moment to search for harry you d never have caught him in time and if you had he d have hexed you if you d tried to stop him the damn fool he gone how on earth are we going to find him now he asked turning towards a very sombre looking professor dumbledore who was still holding voldemort note in one hand i have no idea replied dumbledore shaking his head sadly looking suddenly very very old the four of then sat forlornly and wordlessly in the headmaster office for what seemed a very long time although it was no more than five or ten minutes the only sound was hermione constant sobbing muffled by rick shoulder in which she had buried her face suddenly the door flew open rick hermione and ron turned around hopefully but it wasntharry or ginny it was professor snape and he looked terrible the four occupants of the room jumped to their feet as snape staggered to dumbledore desk leaning heavily on it for support his normally pale face was parchment white sweat was poring from his face and his eyes were rolling about in his head potter he finally managed to say he got potter and weasley barrow he managed to gasp before collapsing on the floor in front of the headmaster desk where he lay on his back writhing in agony grasping at his left arm with his right hand just below the elbow professor dumbledore moved around his desk with surprising speed for a man of his age and knelt down next to his potions master he held a small bottle of what appeared to be to firewhiskey to snape lips but snape pushed dumbledore hand away shaking his head violently dark mark he managed to get out between his clenched teeth ah i understand said dumbledore sympathetically voldemort has summoned his remaining death eaters to the place he is holding harry potter and ginny weasley you have apparated away but your dark mark is drawing you back is that it severus yes gasped snape nodding his head as he bit his lip in pain cant resist it he stammered in despair professor said rick i think i can remove the dark mark from professor snape arm can i try dumbledore looked towards snape who was staring at rick in disbelief while continuing to tremble with agony as he valiantly resisted voldemort unrelenting summons severus said the headmaster mr godfry has great powers greater even than the one who put his mark on you your days as a spy are over in deserting his gathering today you have unequivocally revealed your true loyalties the mark is of no further use to you it is only a source of torturous pain which will very soon drag you back to him and certain destruction please allow him to try snape nodded his head feebly he knew he could not resist the pull of his dark mark for very much longer and then his fate would be sealed dumbledore took a firm hold of snape left wrist and pushed the sleeve up revealing the dark mark just below the elbow it had turned an angry raw red and seemed to swell up and contract in a persistent throb there was a faint smell of burning flesh no wonder he in agony poor man thought rick as he pointed his wand at the dark mark and allowed the spirit he could feel helping him guide him in this difficult task a bolt of the pure white light streamed from the end of rick wand into snape arm and in a matter of seconds the dark mark was completely gone snape instantly ceased his manic trembling and grimacing as he stared at rick in disbelief dumbledore and rick helped snape to his feet and manoeuvred him into a nearby chair although his dark mark was gone he was exhausted from the battle he had waged against it thank you godfry said snape with uncharacteristic gratitude as he stared transfixed at the place where the dark mark had been thank you very much he took the small bottle of firewhiskey which the headmaster was once again proffering and knocked back a good slug before taking a deep breath and speaking again they are at haughtons heath headmaster on druids barrow miss weasley has not been harmed but potter i fear is lost no gasped hermione plaintively potter held his reflecting shield for a remarkably long time but in the end the dark lord servants wore him down by keeping up a barrage of curses and suffering the consequences when he was no longer able to maintain the shield the dark lord put potter under the cruciatus curse it was then that i finally managed to overcome the hold of my dark mark and apparate away i dontknow how long it took me to get to your office from the school gates but it is certain that potter is finished by now his mind will be gone and the dark lord will have finished him off with the killing curse i am very sorry headmaster but there was nothing i could do he said sincerely i understand severus said dumbledore kindly but perhaps it is not yet too late rick apparate to druids barrow immediately and protect harry if he is still alive i shall go immediately to the school gates and apparate from there what the stammered snape as rick disappeared he knew perfectly well that no one could apparate or disapparate within the hogwarts wards how was this possible his exclamation was cut short by hermione professor dumbledore please take me with you harry may need my help rick can protect me with a reflecting shield please very well miss granger he replied we may indeed have need of your extraordinary healing powers before this day is over he went quickly to a cupboard and removed two brooms handing one to hermione he threw open a large window and climbing up to the ledge straddled the broom severus he said turning back to his potions master i wish you to remain here at hogwarts please inform professor mcgonagall of events and should i fail to return please lend her all assistance required certainly headmaster he said nodding solemnly come miss granger said dumbledore leaping from the window on his broom ron sensing his friend nervousness not about voldemort but about leaping from a window on a broom stepped up behind her on the window ledge and threw a leg over her broom saying i ll fly you to the gates if you like hermione thanks ron she replied gratefully druids barrow was one of the largest of the ancient barrows to be found in this part of britain the inhabitants of old had constructed these raised mounds of earth usually on top of a hill as funeral mounds for their leaders long ago when the priests lit huge bonfires upon this barrow on the sacred nights to propitiate their gods the flames could be seen from much of haughtons heath the heath was little changed since those times a desolate uninhabited place covered in heather and clumps of rough reedy grass despite it being a sunny day the heath still managed to look bleak and unwelcoming when rick apparated invisibly to the barrow he first saw ginny who was bound to a pole which appeared to have been magically fixed upon the barrow although apparently unharmed she was weeping uncontrollably the reason for her distress was all too apparent lying on the ground no more than ten feet from her was the body of harry potter voldemort stood ten feet to the other side of the prone body at the centre point of the barrow gloating triumphantly circling the barrow in their black robes and masks were voldemort death eaters who had been summoned to witness the moment of their master crowning victory rick was surprised that voldemort still had so many followers there were at least two hundred of them he shuddered as he turned his eyes upon voldemort this was not his original body of course the one he had encountered in the nightmare reality and at godric hollow it was the terrible creation of the dark magic he used that night in the graveyard at little hangleton to which harry had been transported by the triwizard cup voldemort stood regally in an arrogant pose at the centre of the barrow with his arms crossed in front of him he was tall and thin his robes were black unlike his loyal death eaters who circled him he wore no mask rick wished he did voldemort white skeletal face was a ghastly sight it was like the head of an enormous snake with those terrible scarlet slit pupilled eyes he was utterly repulsive the very personification of evil regard the great harry potter the saviour of the light said voldemort derisively to his followers what fools they were to believe he could defeat me lord voldemort he crowed they said he was my nemesis the one prophesied to be my downfall the one who had the power to destroy me yes a prophecy was given he informed them a soft murmur ran through the circle of death eaters this was the first time their master had mentioned the prophecy the prophecy foretold that one of us would destroy the other i always knew it was correct but the fools of the light who even now still deign to oppose me overlooked one inescapable truth a truth of which i have made no secret but one which they in their stupidity refuse to acknowledge that i lord voldemort am immortal there was never any doubt about which one of us would be the destroyer and which one the destroyed this boy has thwarted me many times as a baby he was responsible for the destruction of my body he has caused me unending trouble but see now how he lies destroyed at my feet when the news reaches the wizarding world that the boy who lived is dead all resistance to my great cause will collapse our enemies will be demoralised we will kill them all dumbledore and his pathetic order of the phoenix and all those who support them will be the first to die followed by the mudblood vermin and squibs including those who were formerly death eaters i shall show no mercy to those who allowed themselves to be turned into foul loathsome squibs the half bloods will put under the imperious curse and enslaved they shall not be allowed to breed once the wizarding world has been purified we shall begin our campaign to conquer the muggles victory shall be ours he cried raising his arms upwards as his followers cheered enthusiastically when he had tired of their cheering voldemort raised a hand and the death eaters immediately fell silent the boy who lived ha spat voldemort scornfully and yet still he lives although he is now no more than a vegetable his mind is destroyed but i did not kill him yet in ancient times dark wizards used to burn their enemies alive right here on druids barrow said voldemort pointing to the barrow upon which he was standing this place has great magical energy it was known to those who where faithful to the powers of the dark that one who performed the live sacrifice of his mortal enemy upon this sacred mound would gain that enemy powers thus have i brought my mortal enemy harry potter to this place i intend to perform the ancient ritual i shall burn him alive as a sacrifice to the dark powers and demons when by this sacrifice i have added his considerable magical powers to my own i shall become the most powerful and feared wizard in history he boasted manically you said voldemort pointing a finger randomly at one of his death eaters step forward then turning to a large pile of branches and brush that had been prepared near the centre of the barrow he snapped his fingers and they burst into flames levitate potter onto the bonfire he ordered the death eater who had come forward the death eater pointed his wand at the unconscious body saying corpus leviosa but instead of the body being levitated the death eater rose in the air what is the meaning of this demanded voldemort angrily crucio he said pointing his wand at the death eater who fell to the ground screaming and writhing in pain you snapped voldemort pointing to another death eater come here and levitate potter onto the bonfire the second death eater tried but he too rose up in the air i it a reflecting shield master he stammered quickly before voldemort could turn the cruciatus curse on him as well nonsense screamed voldemort but his voice betrayed a hint of uncertainty use the cruciatus curse on him ordered voldemort b but master it will the death eater began protesting do as i tell you before i use the killing curse on you hurry up he snapped growing impatient at the delay to his carefully laid plans this ritual was to be his crowning glory not just the defeat of potter the last hope of the light but also the acquisition of potter powers voldemort was not going to let anyone or anything stand in the way of his moment of triumph crucio began the hapless death eater immediately collapsing and convulsing in pain impossible potter a vegetable totally incapable of casting a curse one of you must be responsible for this who is it demanded voldemort in a fury as he cast a withering glare around the circle of death eaters has any one of you seen another using their wand he demanded hurry up and find the culprit before i begin killing you one by one until this nonsense ends he screamed angrily a loud murmur rose up from the death eaters as they began to scrutinise their neighbours suspiciously and fearfully suddenly a loud rasping spectral voice boomed out it is i who said that who are you demanded voldemort feigning a calmness and control that he no longer felt the voice obviously did not belong to a death eater come come voldemort you can do better than that surely you know exactly who i am squibbus boomed the voice which seemed to emanate from everywhere and nowhere at the same time dont try that nonsense with me snarled voldemort angrily you cannot squib me or use any magic upon me at all observe he said haughtily pointing his wand at a bush which burst into flames yes yes i know all about your cloak of salazar slytherin but you see it wasntyou i was squibbing it was your death eaters or should i say ex death eaters i do believe i ve squibbed then all now every single last one voldemort looked on in absolute horror as his death eaters tried to use their wands to perform magic but to no avail voldemort had no further use for them and he hated squibs with a passion not two minutes earlier he had been promising to kill the foul loathsome creatures they were desperate to escape unable to apparate they turned and ran off in all directions across the heath hoping frantically to get away before voldemort cursed them but voldemort had other matters on his mind albus dumbledore and an unknown witch had just apparated to the barrow voldemort was furious at what had happened to his death eaters and at having his carefully laid plans to gain potter power through the ancient sacrificial ritual thwarted but he was also becoming alarmed he was certain the ghost of godric gryffindor was no ghost at all but a wizard and a very powerful one the squibbus curse was something fabled and sought after unsuccessfully by generations of dark wizards himself included satisfied that he had at least finally defeated his great nemesis harry potter voldemort decided to apparate away rather than risk a confrontation with a wizard with great and unknown power the tables were now turned and it was he who was outnumbered dumbledore may be an old fool but he was a very powerful one frantically he twisted his wand and gave the incantation but he couldntapparate he knew he couldnthave been squibbed because his cloak protected him from all forms of magic however he quickly tried a banishing charm on a nearby stone just to reassure himself it worked so why couldnthe apparate ah you are wondering why you cannot apparate away i suspect said the ghost i have just placed anti apparition wards around this barrow since they are not cast on you directly your protective cloak does not make you immune to them aperio revelato said voldemort waving his wand around in a complete circle above his head and since my revealing spell is cast upon the vicinity and not the person i can now see you he said glaring venomously at rick who was now plainly visible standing close to dumbledore and ginny who dumbledore had freed from the post to which she d been bound they were beside hermione who was bending over harry prone body tom said dumbledore calmly how remiss of me not to have introduced you to your other nemesis allow me to present rick godfry ha my nemesis spat voldemort contemptuously dontuse that word dumbledore you old fool nemesis suggests an antagonist of equal power there is no wizard alive with power to match mine not you not this fraudster godfry and not your great hope harry potter look at him dumbledore look what i have done to your champion the one they dared to call my nemesis i have destroyed him utterly you think you are clever you feeble old man he continued his harangue glaring hatefully at his old foe you think because you somehow destroyed my dark creatures and turned my loyal servants into despicable squibs that i am finished but you are wrong dumbledore very wrong i have powers and protections that you cannot imagine i am invincible i will soon recruit more death eaters they will flock to my side as they always do i can offer them powers and magic that make you and your kind tremble in your shoes i will soon dispose of this godfry nuisance now i know who it is that has been troubling me of late and there will be no further squibbing of my new followers brave words tom brave but foolish replied dumbledore evenly although you are correct in one thing rick godfry is certainly not your equal his powers are greater far greater than yours i am not in the least bit concerned that you have finally learned who it is who has decimated your ranks and left you completely alone you will not be leaving this place alive tom i promise you you promise ha ha what a joke laughed voldemort arrogantly i fear no one certainly not you you senile old fool now that i have disposed of potter and laid that infernal prophecy to rest there is no one and nothing that i fear disposed of who demanded harry glaring at voldemort his wand at the ready while voldemort and dumbledore had been exchanging barbs hermione had been working on harry she was now very experienced in reversing the effects of the cruciatus curse and it took her only a few minutes rick aware of what she was doing was ready he obliviated harry as soon as he regained consciousness harry knew he d been put under the cruciatus curse but mercifully he had no memory of the excruciating pain ginny however was not so lucky voldemort had taken sadistic pleasure in making her watch as he tortured the one she loved until he was nothing but a vegetable it had been the worst moment of her life even worse than being in the chamber of secrets she hugged harry desperately after he d been revived it was as if he d returned to her from the dead but harry had other business there would be time for hugging ginny later maybe if there was a later for him he stood facing his hated enemy with a sense of destiny potter hissed voldemort completely stunned for the first time that day he began to feel he was losing control of events how in hades did you recover after i held you under the cruciatus curse for so long it is simply not possible you must be losing your touch voldemort taunted harry the prophecy is not yet laid to rest after all perhaps you d like to try a killing curse dont try your childish tricks on me potter snarled voldemort you are all no doubt protected by a reflecting shield cast i presume by this mysterious godfry what are you godfry where did you come from he demanded turning his fury upon rick i am your nemesis voldemort replied rick i have come from the light for one purpose and one purpose only to destroy you i have followed you into the past and the future into other realities in which you were seemingly victorious but which i prevented from coming into existence rubbish you are talking complete nonsense prove your claim demanded voldemort alright said rick why dontyou try killing me with a killing curse stop this stupid game boy i have already had this inane conversation with potter i know all about your accursed reflecting shield i have no desire to be struck by my own killing curse but you re protected by the cloak of salazar slytherin so what do you have to fear asked rick innocently that none of your business snarled voldemort angrily afraid that it may penetrate your cloak like the curse you used on harry sixteen years ago taunted rick silence cease your insolent nonsense boy i have not the slightest notion of what you speak snapped voldemort desperate to conceal the vulnerability of his cloak yes you do replied rick calmly i was there sixteen years ago when it happened i went back in time you didntsee me in the potters garden at godric hollow that halloween night because i was invisible but i was there lies retorted voldemort lies asked rick what your memory like voldemort can you remember what you said to baby harry after you d killed lily potter i can pettigrew said that i would not be able to touch you but there no need to touch you to kill you with a curse my little enemy i know i ll try putting my mark on you first if i can do that then i ll certainly be able to kill you then you put that mark on harry forehead said rick staring at voldemort unwaveringly voldemort gaped at rick totally stunned as if he was some new unheard of species before suddenly narrowing his eyes and glaring at him malevolently as realisation dawned upon him so it was you it was you who stopped my killing curse that night you cast that infernal reflecting shield of yours i always knew there was no way potter mother could have been the source of his protection blood magic could never have stopped a killing curse nothing can except for that blasted reflecting shield so that why i was able to put that accursed mark on him you werentprotecting him then it is you who was responsible for the destruction of my body for the years and years of pain and suffering i endured i owe you a debt godfry and it will be repaid in full of that you may be sure you will rue the day you came to meddle in my affairs brave words voldemort said rick fearlessly not intimidated in the least do you remember where your killing curse struck you when it rebounded off harry probably not you were too busy trying to get away but i can tell you it was four inches beneath your right armpit voldemort immediately brought his right arm down to cover the spot as he continued to glare hatefully at rick that wonthelp you now voldemort it too late said rick you have realised no doubt that the rebounding killing curse damaged your cloak the place it struck is your point of vulnerability your achilles heel while you were busy chatting with professor dumbledore earlier i thought i might try a little experiment and see if there is a weakness there there is i was able to use a severing charm on that spot in fact i tore away the front of your cloak your front is completely exposed from your shoulders to your waist said rick grinning no gasped voldemort in horror frantically trying to cover his chest with his arms goodbye tom said dumbledore purposefully pointing his wand at voldemort ha sneered voldemort did you really think it would be so easy to kill me you hair brained old fool i have more protections than you know of some months ago i came across a very interesting spell which i cast upon myself you ll pardon me if i dontreveal the incantation it called the mirror of fate the effects of any spell cast upon me are instantly mirrored back to the caster so for example if you were to cast a killing curse on me and succeeded in killing me you would also die dumbledore doubtfully pointed his wand at voldemort chest performing a small levitation charm they both rose a few feet in the air before returning to the ground voldemort grinned smugly it is unfortunate tom said dumbledore solemnly that in order to rid the world of your evil i must give up my own life but i have had a long and fruitful life and i am prepared to make the sacrifice i cannot think of a more meaningful way to leave this realm than with no professor yelled harry dontdo it this is my fight and my fate because of the mirror of fate spell the special property of my scar becomes meaningless whoever kills this evil bastard is going to die hogwarts needs you not me this monster killed my parents in cold blood he tried to kill me it is my duty to my parents to avenge their deaths the prophecy says either must die at the hand of the other it is my fate to kill him and suffer the consequences no harry screamed ginny throwing her arms around him desperately please dontdo it harry please begged hermione tearfully the prophecy also says for neither can live while the other survives the mirror of fate spell like the special property of your scar proves that the prophecy is rubbish if you kill voldemort and die then the prophecy will be wrong and if someone else does it then it will still be wrong whatever happens it wrong please harry forget about that ridiculous prophecy and let professor dumbledore die asked harry looking accusingly at hermione and ginny who looked away in distress at the terrible dilemma harry i am an old man said dumbledore laying a hand gently on his shoulder i have lived more years than most and cannot expect to have a great many more before me i have lived a good life done what i believed was right fought my battles laughed and loved death does not frighten me if there is nothing beyond this life it will be a very pleasant and well earned rest free from pain and pleasure from hope and fear and if there is something beyond this life well then i am eager and curious to know what it might be but you harry are a young man of great promise continued dumbledore your parents did not lay down their lives for you to throw yours away avenging their sacrifice doing honour to their memory and their sacrifice does not require you to die like this on the contrary it requires you to live your life to the very best of your ability to live a good and happy life one which benefits others and brings them joy if i may be allowed to interrupt this tear jerking sentimental claptrap sneered voldemort contemptuously i am greatly flattered that you brave and brainless gryffindors should be fighting for the privilege of laying down your worthless lives for the sake of ending mine but there is something you imbeciles have completely over looked in your moronic heroism all eyes turned to voldemort did it ever cross your feeble minds to ask why i did not die sixteen years ago when i was struck by my own killing curse there was nothing wrong with the curse in fact the reflecting shield increased its strength i pride myself on my killing curses and believe me i have had plenty of practice with them on hundreds if not thousands of victims they have never failed never except for that one did you ever wonder why asked voldemort rhetorically a cruel grin touching the corners of his hideous mouth since you are all too obtuse to see the glaringly obvious i will tell you it is because i cannot be killed i spent many years researching immortality i eventually learned it was not possible to make the human body immortal however i discovered an elemental ritual extremely potent dark magic with which i succeeded in binding my spirit to the dark energy of the universe in so doing my spirit acquired the properties of that energy the magic which binds my spirit to the indestructible dark forces renders my spirit indestructible immortal that is why though my body was destroyed sixteen years ago my spirit survived living as a disembodied spirit was a torturous existence but eventually i acquired another body if you kill me continued voldemort darkly my body will die but not my spirit i will suffer again the pain of disembodied existence but in a few years i shall appear again in the world to continue my campaign it wonttake me so long next time now that i understand the dynamics of rebirth of one thing you may be absolutely certain i shall return and inevitably i shall triumph over you all in the end victory shall be mine i lord voldemort have nothing to fear from death but for the one who kills me death will be permanent the death of their body will be the final end for them now which one of you wants to throw your miserable life away now to inconvenience me for a few years taunted voldemort mockingly i do said dumbledore steadfastly even if it is only a temporary setback for you it will give the light a chance to grow strong again and be ready to resist you once more when you return no professor yelled harry to grow strong enough to resist his evil the light needs your leadership it is my destiny to kill him harry suddenly leapt up in the air using the somes leviosa charm rick had taught him at the burrow no harry don t screamed ginny and hermione together despite his apparent nonchalance and seeming lack of concern at the prospect of losing his body again voldemort had turned side on to the others on the barrow after dumbledore levitation charm had confirmed that his chest was completely unprotected harry intention was to get into a position where he had a clear shot at voldemort chest he either didntrealise or didntcare that in leaping away from the others he was no longer protected by rick reflecting shield but voldemort realised it four curses rang out in unison harry potter and voldemort with wands pointed at each other their eyes locked together in deadly hatred screamed avada kedavra voldemort had tried in vain to twist his chest away from harry but it was not far enough to hide it from him however in twisting away he again exposed it to professor dumbledore and rick avada kedavra cried albus dumbledore squibbus cried rick godfry please take a few moments to leave a review coming up chapter 34 a midsummer night dream the final chapter in which all shall be revealed chapter 34 a midsummer night dream the boy stood lost in thought staring out through the window at the hillside of yellow tussock grass waving gently in the breeze there was no glass in the window it was just a square hole in the rough stone wall of what used to be a shepherds summer shelter high up in the mountains he was a handsome boy with dark brown hair and warm affectionate brown eyes his height was about average he wore a faded yellow tee shirt a pair of khaki shorts and sandals it was a beautiful summer day small flocks of wrens and alpine finches chirped and twittered as they fed on the grass seed the breeze carried the subtle sweet scents of the mountain grasses and flowers but the beauty of the day was lost on the boy he did not delight in its sweet smells or the charming songs of the birds he was completely oblivious to the beauty all around him this was his special place where he could be alone with his fantasies the real world that lay far below could not intrude upon him up here he could pretend for a while that it didntexist that it wasntreal up here he lived in his fantasy world he could believe that it was the real world he had always had a vivid imagination but since the accident he lived more than ever in his fantasy world sometimes he found it hard to tell what was real and what was imaginary the accident their car had skidded on the icy mountain road and broken through the safety barrier it was a miracle that he and his parents had survived they had been certain they were about to die fortunately after a short plunge the car had landed in a thicket of dense bushes vines and small trees in which it became entangled preventing it from plummeting thousands of feet further down the mountainside after the accident he lay in a coma for weeks in hospital when he finally regained consciousness it was hard to believe at first that he was back here or still here in this world was the other world really just a dream a figment of his imagination it had seemed so real so fantastically real so utterly wonderful could it simply have been his imagination and the effect of the head injury and the medication he was fully recovered now in body at least when he awoke in hospital and found himself once more in this world he felt a sense of profound loss he was back in the same dull two dimensional monochrome existence that he had known in his imagination he had experienced a far richer world a world in which he felt truly alive a world for which he desperately cared where he had a great purpose and his life had meaning but most of all it was a world in which he found love how could it all be just a dream he asked himself over and over again he felt bereft he longed for that world his heart ached for her his reverie was broken as something on the hillside caught his eye a movement a colour which seemed somehow out of place in the sea of yellow rippling tussock grass there it was again a flash of brown disappearing for a few moments and then reappearing whatever it was it was coming up the hillside towards the shelter he stepped outside to try to catch a better view of it it was an animal of some sort but unlike any he had ever seen up here in the high country finally it left the cover of the tussock grass and unhesitatingly began to lope up the rough trodden path that led to the shelter it looks a bit like a fox he thought in surprise i ve never seen or heard of foxes around here a fox wouldntmove like that out in the open in broad daylight is it possible could it be no of course not that whole world isntreal it only exists in my imagination it was all just a dream i ve got to get a grip on myself i confusing the real world with my fantasy world the fox continued up the path until it reached the shelter it stopped a few feet from the boy and looked up at him fixing its gaze steadily upon his face the boy was stunned it was her there was no doubt about it right down to the bushy fur on its head but how can it be her she isntreal it was all just a dream wasntit he hesitantly reached his hand down to the fox it didntflinch or try move away it just continued to regard him with those intense brown eyes gently he patted it on the head hermione be whispered unbelievingly he jerked back his hand as the fox seemed to twirl around first a head appeared followed by arms and legs when the transformation was complete standing before him was hermione granger smiling joyfully hermione b but how how can this be he asked in a shaking voice which betrayed extreme emotional turmoil and mental confusion is it really you hermione or have i finally gone over the edge rick asked himself fearfully rick it me she said staring at him rapturously and i ve missed you so much part of him wanted to throw his arms around her and never let her go but another part of him recoiled from her in disbelief and fear fear for his own sanity b but you re not real stammered rick you re a character out of a book how can you come to life like this it not possible hermione resisted the impulse to throw herself into rick arms and kiss him as she had dreamt of doing endlessly since he disappeared that day on druids barrow she could see that he was in psychological turmoil not knowing what to believe had he lost all memory of his time in her world when he returned to his own rick do you remember being at hogwarts for nine months do you remember squibbing voldemort do you remember that we were she asked blushing as she spoke the last words my name isntrick it s he said his voice trailing off as he sorted through all the thoughts memories and dreams which were swirling wildly around in his mind he was trying desperately to distil what was real from what was not finally he continued speaking but after the accident while i was in a coma i dreamed that i was rick rick godfry i dreamed i was a student at hogwarts and that you and i the dream ended abruptly when i squibbed voldemort when i regained consciousness i found i was still here in this world the real world the one in which i grew up then i knew it had all been a dream just a wonderful beautiful amazing dream it wasnta dream rick it was real it all happened but when you squibbed voldemort you vanished but it was a dream it must have been a dream otherwise otherwise i ve gone completely crazy he sighed and how do you explain the fact that i standing here right before you having just transformed from a fox asked hermione smiling gently i must still be dreaming you re not real he said shaking his head from side to side desperately wanting to believe she was real but afraid that to do so would be a leap into madness well i think i can prove just how real i am said hermione with a grin she threw her arms around rick neck and kissed him passionately he responded immediately embracing her desperately as if his very life depended upon it oh hermione he gasped as he released her it felt so good kissing her so real but was it real or was he crazy in that moment he decided the only thing to do was to act as if it was real if it wasn t it would soon become painfully obvious they d be dragging him off to an asylum he wanted desperately to believe it was real i ve missed you so much hermione life has been unbearable without you he said his voice thick with emotion it been unbearable for me too said hermione tearfully that why i came how long can you stay asked rick realising with a sudden pang that they were almost certainly doomed to separation again the gateway of reality through which i came is open for two hours only she replied then looking at her watch she added i ve got another hour and forty minutes rick felt as if a knife had been thrust through his heart he struggled to force back the tears he had less that two hours with hermione he was determined not to allow himself be miserable there would be plenty of time for that later they sat down beside each other on the wide step in front of the doorway staring out over the yellow tussock grass waving about on the hillside hermione how did you manage to get here how is it possible asked rick we ll get to that later rick said hermione sounding like she had a clearly ordered agenda for their short time together first i want to ask you about that day on druids barrow why did you use the squibbus curse on voldemort what were you thinking rick closed his eyes casting his mind back to that day he had thought over the events of that fateful day so many times but he had been accustomed to thinking of it as a fragment of a dream now he had to alter his perspective and treat it as if it were real perhaps it was there would be time to decide on that later what happened to harry he asked urgently is he ok harry fine replied hermione with a reassuring smile he and ginny are the happiest pair of lovebirds you ever saw but rick please answer my question why did you use the squibbus curse well although it all happened rather quickly when harry voldemort and dumbledore all screamed the killing curse together things had been moving in that direction for a while which gave me time to think over the possible scenarios because of his mirror of fate spell whoever killed voldemort was certain to die as well if harry got his curse in first then voldemort and harry would die if dumbledore beat harry to it then voldemort and dumbledore would die but when harry used the somes leviosa charm and started jumping about unprotected by a reflecting shield there was a third possibility voldemort killing curse would win killing harry in fact given his experience with the killing curse it seemed the most likely outcome dumbledore curse would then kill voldemort and all three of them would die so you cast the squibbus curse to save harry or dumbledore probably both of them asked hermione yeah that right said rick i had to the squibbus curse is instantaneous so although i cast it at the same time as the three of them began their killing curses i knew i could squib voldemort before he finished his killing curse or harry or dumbledore curse got to him but there was another reason as well regardless of whether harry or dumbledore killed voldemort it wasntgoing to be permanent voldemort was certain to return some day yes i know replied hermione after the four of us got back to hogwarts from druids barrow we had a long talk about it in dumbledore office trying to piece together what had happened ron and snape were there as well dumbledore pretty much figured out your motives just as you ve explained squibbing voldemort and destroying his magic had three significant consequences firstly it stopped him killing harry secondly it neutralised his mirror of fate spell so that neither harry nor dumbledore would be killed when their curse killed voldemort and thirdly it destroyed voldemort bond to the dark energies which made his spirit immortal so when the killing curse struck him he died utterly never to return that was your plan wasntit rick rick laughed you can read me like a book hermione so whose curse did actually reach voldemort first harry s replied hermione there were no pyrotechnics or drama as you described from the time at godric hollow when voldemort tried to kill harry as a baby or in the nightmare reality when he tried to kill you thinking you were draco malfoy voldemort just dropped down dead like a squib how ironic the great lord voldemort died as the thing he most despised a squib in that same instant you disappeared so although the prophecy was wrong it many ways it right about one of them killing the other it was harry who killed voldemort in the end reflected rick yes said hermione her mind clearly occupied with more important things than trelawney ridiculous prophecy rick when you were thinking over all those scenarios didntit occur to you that if you squibbed voldemort that you too would be squibbed she asked in a shaky voice yeah answered rick slowly sighing heavily i knew i d be squibbed by voldemort mirror of fate spell because it would act instantly before his magic had been destroyed but what was the alternative let harry or dumbledore or both of them die allow voldemort to come back again and again until he succeeded in turning the world into that nightmare reality how could i allow all of that to happen just for the sake of keeping my magic voldemort death eaters and dark creatures were already destroyed once he was dead permanently the task i d been sent for was completed so it didntmatter if i lost my magic oh rick cried hermione how can you say that what did you think would happen after you squibbed voldemort i not suggesting even for a minute that you shouldnthave done it it was the right thing to do it was terribly brave and i enormously proud of you but what did you think your life would be like after sacrificing your magic i didntexpect to just disappear and end up here back in my old reality he replied i realised that as a squib i d have to leave hogwarts but there wasnttime to think any further ahead if i hadntdisappeared if i d stayed in your world i guess i would have lived a quiet life as a squib somewhere maybe in that little village of stournmouth where i squibbed all those death eaters it a real mixture wizards witches squibs and muggles i wouldnthave wanted to leave the magical world entirely and what about me asked hermione hesitantly i dontknow hermione answered rick sadly i would have felt the same way about you i still do but would you have felt the same way about me if i was just a squib oh rick how can ask such a question it you i love not your magic or the magic you had i would have wanted to be with you in stornmouth or anywhere else after i d finished school i mean if you wanted to be with me hermione said rick pulling her close i want to be with you more than anything in the but he stopped as he remembered that he couldnt soon she would have to go pushing away that dreadful thought he asked did you ever talk to dumbledore about why i disappeared when i first came to hogwarts he said after the war was over and my purpose was fulfilled i d remain in your world do you understand why i didn t asked rick sadly we talked about it a lot dumbledore was quite certain it wasnt because voldemort was dead and your mission was over he said it was almost certainly because you were a squib but why asked rick puzzled why didnti remain in your world as a squib it difficult to explain said hermione focussing her eyes on a distant clump of tussock grass what allowed you to appear in our world was magic the magic was bestowed upon your spirit by the great witches and wizards of the light before you appeared at hogwarts you were only able to appear in our world because of that magic once it was gone you couldntremain but how did you find me asked rick how did you even know i was alive it strange rick replied hermione you know i not one for extra sensory phenomena and all that nonsense like parvati and lavender but well it was as though i could still feel your presence somehow it just felt to me like you were still alive somewhere dumbledore said that if the magic which brought you to our world had been suddenly voided by the squibbus curse then perhaps you had not died in your world after all but dumbledore told me i had died before i appeared in your world said rick confused yes that what he thought but there another possibility it sometimes referred to as a near death experience your heart stops the body is clinically dead and your spirit is temporarily freed but then the heart begins beating again your spirit is pulled back and you live or maybe it the other way around maybe your spirit decides to go back and so your heart starts beating again perhaps that happened to you when your spirit left your body the witches and wizards of the light chose it for their mission and you rick godfry appeared in our world but when you lost your magic it was as if all of that was undone your spirit returned to your body in this world and it started functioning again well actually something like that did happen just after they got me to the hospital i did die clinically but they revived me and my heart began beating again afterwards i was in a coma for weeks but it still doesntmake sense hermione i was clinically dead for less than a minute yet i was in your world for nine months that because they are completely different realities there is no correspondence between them in any way including time in fact the only common thread between them is you your spirit said hermione once i realised that you might be alive somewhere in some other reality i was determined to try to find you it became an obsession what about your revision schedule and the exams asked rick with a smile i threw away my revision schedule how could i think of studying i sat the exams of course and still came top in all your subjects i ll bet said rick with a smile err yes i did replied hermione modestly but only because you werentthere rick i would have preferred to have come second to you and not be the sixth year dux you have no idea how miserable and lonely it been for me she said a tear rolling down her cheek rick put his arm around hermione as they sat together on the step she wiped her eyes lifting her chin and continued i went to the forbidden forest and had a long and rather confusing conversation with firenze it notoriously difficult getting a straight answer from a centaur he said that the reflection of all realities and all times could be seen in the heavens if one knew how to look when i asked him about you he said something like his light still shineth when i asked him if there was any way for me to get to your reality he just looked up at the sky and said this forest hides many secrets and doorways from you humans i shall consult the stars professor dumbledore allowed me to miss classes and arranged special access to the ministry of magic reference library i spent weeks there doing research research into what asked rick my first topic was to identify where magic actually resides in a witch or wizard replied hermione what was the point of that asked rick curiously i was trying to discover if magic was located in the body the mind or the spirit it not a subject that has ever been seriously researched i searched through hundreds and hundreds of books finally i found some clues in a very ancient text that goes back almost to the time of merlin but hermione why were you doing that i dontunderstand said rick becoming more and more perplexed my second topic of research continued hermione ignoring rick question was into how charms curses and hexes act on a person it really fascinating some of them like the immobulus impedimenta and cruciatus curses work on the body others like the cheering and confundus charms as well as the imperius curse work on the mind in all my research i could find only two spells that work on the spirit the avada kedavra curse is one it severs the spirit from the body causing instant death without any apparent physical damage what the other asked rick the squibbus curse replied hermione looking at rick significantly but how can you know that asked rick because it destroys the magic of the witch or wizard answered hermione that means it must act on wherever it is that magic resides the conclusion of my first research topic was that magic very probably resides within the spirit but the most conclusive evidence in fact is you me asked rick the magic you received from the great witches and wizards of the light was bestowed upon your spirit said hermione smiling at rick yeah i guess that true agreed rick but what does it mean i dontquite follow the point of all your research what were you trying to achieve well isntit obvious asked hermione i was trying to find out how to reverse the effects of the squibbus curse what asked rick completely stunned but it irreversible isnt it if the squibbus curse affects the body said hermione unable to contain her excitement it wouldntbe possible to reverse it because your present body is not the one that appeared in our world although it looks identical but my research suggests that the squibbus curse acts on the spirit my other research points to the spirit as the place where magic resides the spirit that is within you now is the same spirit which was blessed with all the magic of the great witches and wizards it appeared in our world and it was damaged by the squibbus curse dontyou see rick i may be able to heal you and heal me what do you mean heal me asked rick a ray of hope suddenly bursting through the cloud of gloom which had become his constant companion many curses work by causing injury of some kind if the squibbus curse works by injuring the spirit i may be able to heal it and what asked rick incredulously you mean i d get my magic back i d become a wizard again but what would i do in this world as a wizard he asked hermione laughed dontbe silly rick i not leaving you here you re coming back with me i ve come here to get you rick was stunned he turned with his mouth agape in disbelief staring wordlessly at hermione err maybe i should explain the whole plan continued hermione as rick seemed temporarily incapable of speech after i d completed my research and concluded that it might be possible to heal the injury to your spirit caused by the squibbus curse i had another conversation with firenze about getting to your reality he said at the solstice full moon which is the rare conjunction of midsummer eve with the full moon the two realities will briefly intersect for an hour on either side of the cusp of night there is a primordial chasm sequestered deep within this forest known as the gateway of reality it is unreachable to humans witches and wizards included come to this spot as a fox fifteen minutes before the crucial time and i will lead you there i asked firenze how i would find you when i reached your reality he said when you descend into the chasm which is known as the gateway of reality you will come to a labyrinth of tunnels if you focus your mind unwaveringly on that which you seek your animal instincts will guide you unwaveringly it was just like he said i knew exactly which way to go as i threaded my way through the maze of tunnels until i came out just down there she said pointing to a spot a few hundred feet further down the hillside that amazing said rick shaking his head in wonder but how can you take me back with you i going to try to reverse the squibbus curse and restore your magic then we ll both transform into foxes and return the way i came you ll be magical again so you ll be able to live in our world she added betraying more than a trace of anxiety rick continued to stare at her the idea that he might return to the world he loved with the one he loved was tantalising beyond belief it seemed somehow too good to be true a lot of things could go wrong couldntthey hermione i sure you ve already figured out all the possibilities so you better tell me hermione let out a long nervous sigh as she stared up at the sky nothing like this has ever been done before there is no way of knowing what the chances are of success the first thing that could go wrong is that you ll die from snape potion snape potion what potion is snape in on this too err yes it was mainly professor dumbledore who helped me with the plan but firenze and snape helped too snape brewed two very rare and difficult potions the first one the draft of dissolution will err kill you but kill me gulped rick err yes just for a while though you need to be clinically dead again for me to work on your spirit i will heal your spirit and then snape second potion will kick in it an ancient potion used by necromancers which will nullify the first potion and then revive you err it dark magic but dumbledore agreed to let snape brew it err hermione i hate to state the obvious said rick but how am i going to drink snape second potion if i dead oh but you drink the second potion first explained hermione immediately before the draft of dissolution snape added something that delays its effects for three minutes to give you time to err die and for me to heal your spirit it risky i know and if you dontwant to take the risk i ll understand i ll just stay here with you if you ll let me she added shyly looking down at her feet but of course i ll take the risk said rick emphatically this life without magic without you it so empty and pointless i d risk anything to go back with you but why are you talking about staying here well said hermione looking down shyly i identified a number of scenarios which would prevent you from returning with me you might not have wanted to risk taking the draft of dissolution and i wouldnthave blamed you if you didn t or snape potions may work perfectly but i may not succeed in healing the injury to your spirit that would leave you without magic which means you couldntreturn with me either i decided that if either of those scenarios eventuated then i wouldntreturn i d stay here with you in your world err if you wanted me to i left a letter with professor dumbledore to give to my parents in case i dontcome back rick couldnthelp but kiss hermione affectionately he found it difficult to speak finally he said in a thick voice thanks hermione but as much as i want to be with you i would never let you give up your whole world for me anyway it probably wont come to that i going to put my fate in snape hands and take both the potions and i have absolute faith in your ability to heal my spirit i ll try to deserve your faith said hermione blushing and you can trust snape to have done his very best for you too he been a different person since you removed his dark mark and the death of voldemort he almost pleasant at times ron keeps muttering about how scary it is snape was really eager to help i think he feels a great debt to you both personally and for the wizarding world he one of the few who really knows what happened on druids barrow and what you sacrificed for us all err there also another scenario i haventmentioned yet said hermione nervously what that asked rick well even if everything goes to plan and you get your magic back firenze wasntcertain it would be possible for us to get back the opposite way through the gateway of reality i tried to find out what the probability was of that happening but centaurs are so vague i really have no idea at all we may both be stuck here the only witch and wizard in this reality well that would be a whole different adventure said rick thoughtfully if it has to be two out of the three having you and having my magic are the two i would choose said rick me too said hermione but let try for three out of three yes let i ready said rick turning to kiss hermione note epilogue still to come please take a few moments to leave a review epilogue it was a beautiful enchanted mid summer night the full moon shone brightly illuminating the hogwarts castle and the surrounding grounds moonbeams danced playfully upon the ripples on the lake stirred up by the giant squid and the large dolphin playing in the moonlight in the castle all was dark except for three adjacent windows the students and most of the staff had departed the school a few days earlier for the summer holidays from the dark edge of the forbidden forest two foxes emerged playing joyfully chasing and tumbling exuberantly over each other but in the twinkling of an eye the foxes were gone and in their places stood a witch and a wizard the wizard remained motionless for a long time staring as if transfixed by a vision he was gazing enraptured upon the ancient castle with its familiar towers and turrets as it stood bathed in moonlight like some great benign being hermione said rick that the most beautiful sight in the whole world this is the happiest moment of my life and i owe it all to you how can i ever repay you well since you re asking i can think of a way said hermione grinning at him slyly you could let me beat you next year when we take our newts i really really want to be dux in our final year for you hermione i d do anything i promise i ll do my best or is it my worst he laughed hey there are lights in dumbledore office he must be waiting for us maybe we should hurry of course he waiting for us snape will be with him that why i was trying to hurry you up when you were writing the note to tell your parents not to worry and why you d disappeared why did it take so long err it was a bit more than a note replied rick you see after i left the hospital i seemed to spend all my time thinking about the nine months i was here except of course i thought it was just some incredible dream i think i told you once how people used to write their own harry potter stories well i decided to write a story about my dream but rick you cheated protested hermione you werentmaking up a story it was all true yeah i know that now but at the time i thought it was all a dream said rick as they walked on hand in hand giving the whomping willow a wide berth i used to bring my notebook computer up to the shelter to write the story was finished except for the final part what happened today when you came that what i was writing about before we left the shelter i put a note on top of the notebook for my parents telling them how to find the story and to read it and that it all true i really hope they believe it i also asked them to send the final chapter to a friend of mine to post it err that so other people can read it so what did you call your story the ghost of godric gryffindor that more appropriate than you may have realised said hermione why that asked rick because as far as the wizarding world is concerned it was the ghost of godric gryffindor and not you who destroyed voldemort magic allowing harry to finally defeat him apart from dumbledore harry ginny and i who were there only snape and ron know the true story of what really happened that day on druids barrow harry wanted to tell the whole story he felt we owed it to your memory to acknowledge your great sacrifice and he hated the idea of receiving praise for voldemort destruction when it was really you who deserved it but dumbledore knew i was obsessed with trying to find you and bring you back to our world although at the beginning none of the others held out much hope but i was determined to try so we decided to conceal your part in voldemort destruction otherwise the secret of your powers would have emerged and it would have been impossible for you to live a normal life in this world if you were ever able to return to it in his official account dumbledore attributed your part in voldemort downfall to the ghost of godric gryffindor he said it was the ghost who destroyed voldemort magic before harry killed him the ghost presence was corroborated by some of the squibbed death eaters but of course they all fled before voldemort revealed the ghost true identity that a relief said rick i d hate to have to put up with the fame and the pain of being hounded by rita skeeter i really dontenvy harry his fame one bit so how is he bearing up under the new notoriety dumbledore has been shielding him from the wizarding press he banned them all from hogwarts that skeeter woman had a field day just the same what was her ridiculous headline something like the boy who lived slays he who claimed he would never die so what else has been happening asked rick anxious to catch up on everything he had missed well gryffindor won both the quidditch cup and house cup we were miles ahead after the five hundred points dumbledore awarded when the dark creatures attacked oh and pansy parkinson was expelled she was the one who stunned ginny on her way down to the greenhouses and got her out of hogwarts under an invisibility cloak ginny caught a glimpse of pansy before she was stunned pansy got off pretty lightly i thought apparently she was acting under her father orders he wasntso lucky why what happened to him asked rick he was one of the death eaters you squibbed at haughtons heath said hermione with a grin serves the bastard right said rick so where harry gone for the holidays i d really like to see him he staying with the weasleys replied hermione but dontworry rita and the paparazzi wontbe getting anywhere near him at the burrow arthur weasley is the new minister of magic and he banned the press from the burrow wow that great news said rick smiling i cantthink of anyone better to restore the integrity of the ministry after fudge corrupt rule so what happened to fudge he was ignominiously drummed out of office a few days after voldemort fell along with all his lackeys all the people fudge had fired because they d opposed his draconian state of emergency and corruption got their old jobs back what about percy weasley as rick dumbledore personally vouched for percy he revealed that percy had been working as an operative for the order of the phoenix he quite the hero ron and ginny were so happy and proud of him when they found out he working as his dad assistant it a huge job getting the ministry working properly again after what fudge did to it percy got his own flat near diagon alley but he visits the burrow a lot you ll see him there for sure why am i going to the burrow asked rick eagerly yes ron and ginny told their parents that you might be back soon back back from where asked rick when you disappeared dumbledore announced that you d been called home by your parents said hermione well it was kind of true in a way observed rick with a smile yes laughed hermione mrs weasley insisted that when you came back you should spend the holidays at the burrow that ll be great said rick happily err but what about you well i ll be at the burrow for the first couple of weeks as well she said smiling impishly at rick now that i ve got you back i not in any hurry to part again there going to be quite a crowd apart from ron ginny and harry padma coming to visit as well sounds like fun said rick happily so have your parents returned to england now that voldemort gone no way said hermione they love the greek islands in a few weeks i ll be leaving you at the burrow to spend a couple of weeks travelling with my parents in portugal but we ll be returning to my parents place in the greek islands at the end of july in time for harry birthday party what asked rick who was having trouble keeping up with hermione holiday schedule everyone ron ginny harry padma and you will be coming to spend the last month of the holidays with us on the island the house is right on the beach by the way mum says it huge and there plenty of room for everyone you ll all be coming the day before harry birthday so he can celebrate it in peace without half the wizarding world and all of the press trying to gatecrash gosh it going to be a great holiday said rick squeezing hermione hand contentedly it almost too good to believe that i back here again and i owe it all to you for making my dream come true not only were you brilliant in figuring out how to give me back my magic and bring me back with you but you were incredibly brave you had no idea at all whether you would ever be able to return to this world again or if you would ever see your parents and friends again that true said hermione blushing at rick praise as they stopped at the castle entrance although firenze did say something just before he left me at the gateway of reality which gave me hope what was that asked rick intrigued why didntyou tell me before err it was something he said he saw in the heavens something about great deeds that would be done by two hogwarts students at some time in the future said hermione sounding uncharacteristically vague i dontunderstand why would that give you hope oh was it you and me asked rick err no the hogwarts students were err our children said hermione blushing fiercely and staring down at the ground oh said rick his face lighting up with delight as he put his arms around hermione that the most wonderful future i can imagine he said smiling at her in the moonlight hermione looked up at rick smiling shyly me too she said before rick silenced her with a kiss the end i would like to acknowledge

years away chapter 4 slytherins and skulduggery rick first few weeks at hogwarts passed relatively uneventfully he easily caught up with his studies and thanks to the gifts of rowena ravenclaw and others his homework took him hardly any time at all that left him with plenty of time for intelligence gathering he kept close tabs on harry using his legilimency abilities frequently if harry was planning to sneak off somewhere or get lured into danger he wanted to know about it as hermione had noticed rick was frequently absent from the gryffindor common room of an evening he was most likely in a common room just not his own his most frequent visits were to the slytherin dungeon rick was learning how to use more of his gifts one of the most useful was the ability to disapparate without having to immediately apparatesomewhere else it was like his body was nowhere at all but his mind and senses were wherever he wanted them to be it was much better than just being invisible because no one could trip over him hear him or smell him he spent quite a lot of time in the slytherin sixth year boys dormitory most of it was listening to draco malfoy boring arrogant drivel but occasionally he gleaned some useful information his legilimency skills were of more use to him than his ears because draco didntreveal much he just made snide knowing remarks about harry potter dumbledore and all those mudblood and muggle lovers insinuating darkly to blaise zabini and theodore nott that they would very soon be getting what they deserved rick discovered that draco himself wasntactually privy to the details of what the death eaters were planning however it was clear that there was to be an attack of some sort on harry soon and that draco would be involved he was awaiting instructions and a weapon or some other object from his father there was also a plan to remove dumbledore as headmaster whenever rick had some useful information to report he would apparate directly to the headmaster office professor dumbledore was most appreciative of the intelligence that rick was able to provide and always had a welcoming pot of tea with scones and jam and clotted cream to offer him he was also helping rick to understand some of the powers he had received and from time to time would remind him of the heavy responsibility he bore the temptation to abuse your powers should not be underestimated he warned rick very seriously one evening please remember that for all those powers you are still human with all the human frailties the teenage years can be especially difficult ones you are still a teenage boy with the powerful hormones and strong desires that go with it he added engaging rick with a very direct gaze rick was getting more embarrassed by the minute and worried about where this conversation might be leading he had to fight the strong urge to immediately disapparate out of dumbledore office but the headmaster ploughed on despite rick obvious discomfort you must be very careful not to abuse your powers to satisfy what are after all the perfectly normal interests of a boy of your age rick gulped now i not suggesting that you should have nothing at all to do with girls only that if you are hmm pursuing such interests that you should be very careful not to employ your special gifts particularly your charm rick face was glowing red by now i also sure you will understand that you should be careful in your undercover work not to put yourself in inappropriate places and situations he concluded rick quickly nodded in agreement then mumbled something about homework and with a hurried thank you for the refreshments he disapparated out of dumbledore office as fast as he could rick had often thought about exactly those subjects but it was one thing for him to think about it and quite another to have the headmaster talking to him about it he was being careful with his charm especially around hermione because his feelings for her were growing stronger he had actually made up some rules of conduct although there was no way he was going to discuss them with the headmaster rule 1 was not to use charm on witches unless it is strategically necessary in the fight against the dark he continued to use his charm on pansy parkinson because she was close to draco and might be helpful and he certainly didnthave any romantic interest in pansy so that was safe rule 2 was not to use legilimency to find out how hermione felt about him although he probed the minds of hermione and ron from time to time in areas relating to harry and any collective plans of the trio he was experienced enough now to be able to identify different areas of the mind and only go where he needed to it was like arriving at a crossroads and choosing which road to follow he had so far managed to stay away from hermione emotions although he was dying to know if she had feelings for him and also how she felt about ron he didntneed his special skills to know that ron fancied hermione ron was a bit obvious rule 3 stay out of the girls dormitories and bathrooms well he did sometimes visit the dormitories of the senior slytherin girls but exited fast if they looked like they might be about to take off their clothes the slytherin girls werentreally much of a temptation anyway defence against the dark arts with tonks had become the gryffindors favourite class unfortunately they had it together with the slytherins sure tonks was clumsy and managed to fall over something or someone or herself at least once or twice a lesson but she really knew her stuff and her classes were always fun she enjoyed teaching them and they enjoyed learning what a contrast to potions not to mention that her current appearance whether it was really her or not was very much admired by all the boys when she demonstrated new moves in front of the class she always had their undivided attention rick had to be careful and remember not to do everything perfectly the first time tonks was amazed at his abilities and to deflect suspicion he said that he d received personal tuition before coming to hogwarts from a very skilled wizard and so already knew a lot of the spells rick was always a bit nervous when they paired up for practice and harry was with draco he kept a close watch on draco intentions today they were studying the shield charm they were working in pairs one person would cast the shield charm saying protego while the other threw a hex at them which would be blocked if their shield was strong enough after each person had taken a turn at casting the shield charm they would change partners rick was being careful using weak hexes so as only to penetrate imperfect shields like everything else hermione was very good at defence against the dark arts although it was the one subject where harry excelled her at least in the practical part hermione cast her shield with a confident protego it was very strong and she looked smugly at rick as if to say let see you break through that rick couldntresist the challenge rictusempra he said and sent a tickling charm right through the shield hermione was furious but she couldntstop laughing and the more she laughed the more furious she became finite incantatum said rick finally hoping she was not too angry with him fortunately it was time to change partners and before hermione could say anything draco malfoy stepped up to her saying smugly this should be easy go on let see you try to cast a shield granger hermione immediately cast her shield with a firm protego draco began hurling hexes at it for all he was worth but he couldntget through no matter how hard he tried i dontknow how you managed that granger said draco clearly miffed either sheer luck or else you spent the whole holidays practicing and swotting up on shield charms but it my turn now i ll show you how it done come on let see you try to even dent my shield he said arrogantly rick was now partnered with harry and since they were standing near to draco and hermione he was probing draco mind just to make sure he wasntplanning anything unexpected he was rick caught it just in time instead of casting the shield charm he flung a furnunculus curse at hermione who had dropped her shield leaving her totally unprotected take that mudbood he spat hermione was caught completely off guard as she had been looking towards rick and harry wondering if rick would be able to break harry shield rick flicked his left hand in hermione direction casting a reflecting shield in front of her it was something he had recently learned it deflected the curse back upon its caster but with double its original potency draco face began erupting in huge ugly boils he had no idea what had happened tonks asked pansy to take him to madam pomfrey immediately then turning angrily to the class she demanded who cast the furnunculus curse it was malfoy he cast it himself said harry i heard him clearly and saw him instead of casting his shield charm when it was his turn he threw a furnunculus curse at hermione but just before it reached her it bounced back and hit him square in the face maybe hermione shield charm was still active or something shield charms dontsend back curses like that said tonks thoughtfully i cantunderstand it but hermione could well she didntactually know what rick had done or how he had done it he hadnteven used his wand which had been in his right hand but she had seen him flick his left hand in her direction and was certain that he was responsible for whatever it was that had protected her and sent malfoy curse back into his smug face she was thankful to him but her suspicions about him were increased even more first he had penetrated her perfect shield and now this an unknown spell cast without a wand but for once in her life hermione kept quiet she decided not to reveal to the class what she had witnessed she was sure now that rick was hiding something significant and she was more determined than ever to find out what it was when she told harry and ron about what she had observed in defence against the dark arts their reactions were different harry was slowly becoming convinced that rick really was on their side he had saved hermione from a dreadful curse which he had turned back upon malfoy but the incident only strengthened his opinion that with all his unexplained power rick would be dangerous indeed if he turned out to be their enemy i think we should give him the benefit of the doubt for now said harry but we should keep a close watch on him until we are completely certain where his loyalties lie hermione agreed with harry but ron was still unwilling to consider rick anything but an enemy look said ron reasonably how do we know that it wasntall an act to get us to trust him and then once our defences are down he moves in for the kill godfry must have known what malfoy was planning no one could have thrown up a shield or whatever it was that fast so his poor little ferret friend has to spend a few days in the hospital wing gorging himself on lollies and sweets from endless comfort packs from mummy dear while he gets a holiday from schoolwork big sacrifice that i could handle it the following monday morning was double potions with snape what a way to begin the week draco looking fully recovered from the furnunculus curse was sitting with pansy rick partnered dean thomas and harry and hermione were together as usual rick noticed that draco and pansy who usually sat as far away from the gryffindors as possible were at the other end of the slytherin bench today near to harry and hermione today you will be making the folliculus rerverus potion began snape it was immediately obvious to him that the insufferable know it all granger knew all about the potion and could barely wait for him to ask for someone to tell the class about it her hand he imagined was primed to shoot up as soon as he asked humph desperate as usual to dazzle us with her knowledge he thought with disgust so instead of asking he continued immediately on noting with satisfaction the look of disappointment on her face it is closely related to the polyjuice potion but is simple enough to be brewed in around an hour note that i did not say that it was simple enough for everyone in this class to brew successfully he added with a smirk he then waved his wand at the blackboard upon which the list of ingredients and the method of preparation appeared in his loopy script the last item on the list of ingredients was three hairs from each person brewing the potion one person from each pair go over to the bench he said and take your ingredients when they had returned to their places snape continued correctly brewed the folliculus rerverus potion exchanges the hair of the two people who brew it the effect lasts for approximately 24 hours there were some muffled giggles from the students as they each looked at their partner hair and then at that of the other pairs only one pair will be asked to sample their concoction today in order to demonstrate how this potion works he said madam pomfrey would never forgive me if i were to fill up the hospital wing with a whole class of re arranged students he added with a smirk be very careful to add each of the ingredients at the proper moment and then make exactly the requited number of turns in the correct direction if you do not or if you should fail to grind the boomslang skin to exactly the correct consistency your potion could have very unexpected effects for example instead of exchanging the hair on your head it could exchange well almost any parts of your body at all snape was obviously enjoying himself and finding it hard to conceal a sadistic smile everyone guessed who would be sampling the potion and snape did not disappoint them potter and granger you will be demonstrating the effects of this potion i do hope that you have been paying careful attention to me because otherwise gryffindor house might have to get used to two new students herry grotter and harrmione panger they might have some difficulty deciding which dormitories to put you in he added with unconcealed glee the slytherins were laughing with delight at the horror on the faces of harry and hermione get started ordered snape harry decided to allow hermione to do everything as she was much better at potions than him however he was watching her very carefully and double checking everything she did against the instructions on the blackboard just as they were in the final stages of preparing their potions an agonised scream came from the far end of the slytherin bench where theodore nott was working with blaise zabini their cauldron had tipped over drenching nott who was screaming in pain stop that terrible squealing nott yelled snape if you have been following my instructions correctly your potion should be barely above blood temperature at this stage the potion whether brewed correctly or not has no effect when applied externally save perhaps for some minor skin irritation get to your dormitory nott and get yourself cleaned up if you feel unwell then go to madam pomfrey you zabini can clean up that terrible mess several minutes later snape handed harry and hermione each a goblet the moment of truth he announced with a malicious grin fill these completely to the top and then drink the entire contents this promises to be most interesting rick began to feel uneasy as if some sixth sense was warning him that something bad was about to happen it wasntbecause they might have made a mistake with the potion it was something far worse rick was sure of it he probed snape mind no nothing there but sadistic anticipation that james potter brat and his insufferable know it all friend could be in for a very unpleasant and embarrassing time he turned his attention to draco yes there it was harry and hermione were just minutes away from an agonising death while everyone attention was on the diversion that blaise had created by deliberately upsetting his cauldron over nott draco had tipped a deadly poison into harry and hermione cauldron draco mind was seething with anticipation imagining the praise of the dark lord and the rewards that his father had said were sure to be heaped upon him as the one who had killed harry potter his master great nemesis plus he was getting rid of the mudblood too an unexpected bonus as harry and hermione nervously raised their goblets to their lips rick jumped up and yelled out no dontdrink it snape strode over to rick fuming and towering over him he said menacingly as i recall mr godfry i am the hogwarts potions master not you i am the one in authority here not you i am the one whom the students in the potions dungeon have to obey not you twenty points from gryffindor now sit down and remain silent potter and granger drink the contents of those goblets right now or you will lose gryffindor another ten points each but rick did not sit he stood his ground no he yelled frantically pushing past snape donttouch it it poison snape was now livid how dare you disobey me godfry another thirty points from gryffindor and you are to leave this dungeon now i want you back here at eight o clock tonight and for the following six nights you will be serving detention with me and learning obedience something which apparently you did not come across in your copious reading i not going anywhere said rick with a tone of steel in his voice that was starting to unsettle snape draco malfoy put poison in harry and hermione cauldron when zabini distracted everyone by upsetting his caldron over nott if they drink it they will die snape still didntbelieve rick he still thought that he was just trying to save his fellow gryffindors from the consequences of their own badly brewed potion but there was a note of authority in rick voice which he seemed unable to ignore it created just the slightest doubt in his mind certainly he disliked potter and granger but he didntwant to see any real harm come to either of them prove it said snape rick thought for a moment how was he going to do this all right he said to snape why dontyou ask draco malfoy to drink a goblet from their cauldron the folliculus rerverus potion whether brewed correctly or not only affects the pair who put their hair in it it would have no affect upon him correct conceded snape grudgingly then attempting to reassert his authority he added and when mr malfoy suffers no adverse effects from the potion i will award fifty points to slytherin for his kind assistance potter and granger will then drink their potion as requested a further fifty points will be deducted from gryffindor for your insubordination and fabrications in addition to the fifty points already deducted plus you will have a second week of detention in my dungeon to learn the discipline of obedience which you so badly lack but snape victorious grin was wiped from his face when rick enthusiastically agreed to his terms without a moment hesitation harry hermione and dean thomas were all turning green at the prospect of gryffindor going down one hundred points while slytherin went up fifty how would they ever catch them up but before any of them could object draco spoke up for the first time well i dontagree there no way i drinking anything out of potter and granger cauldron come come now mr malfoy said snape silkily here is an opportunity for slytherin to go one hundred and fifty points up on gryffindor in the house cup and i assure you the potion no how badly prepared will have no ill effect upon you at all no no sir said draco nervously i i just dont trust those gryffindors snape now stared very hard at draco as if he was really seeing him for the first time his legilimency skills were not on a par with rick s but it was clear that draco was lying and hiding something he was starting to sweat under snape intense scrutiny it could all be a trick between the three of them sir to poison me he said desperately trying to justify himself all this time rick was probing draco mind trying to find some evidence of what he done he found it professor snape lied rick i saw draco pour something into their cauldron from an envelope that he returned to an inside pocket of his robes rubbish spat draco i didntput anything in potter potion and there nothing in my pockets are you sure said rick lifting his wand and uttering the summoning charm accio but draco clamped his hand over his robes against the lip of the inner pocket a summoning charm was not going to be strong enough to extract the envelope rick quickly did a severing charm opening up a slit beneath draco hand then before he could cover it said accio again a brown envelope popped out through the slit and floated towards rick draco made a lunge for it but rick used a banishing charm to send it up out of reach and towards snape who plucked it from the air he studied it carefully it had the words amanita phalloides written on the outside in what he immediately recognised as the elegant hand of lucius malfoy he carefully held the envelope at some distance from his face peering inside at the dregs within yes the label was correct dried and powdered death caps said snape the most poisonous mushroom in this part of the world in a concentrated form such as this it causes death within minutes he then carried on as if he were delivering a regular potions lecture flobberworms are particularly susceptible to fungal poisons however their very simple digestive systems are impervious to most other poisons and potions ingredients as such they are ideal for detecting the presence of fungal poisons particularly as they turn different colours depending upon the variety of mushroom or toadstool they are tested with death caps for instance turn them red without missing a beat he took down a jar from a nearby shelf and removed a wriggling flobberworm first he dunked it in rick and dean cauldron as you can see he said holding it up and examining it it suffers no ill effects from the folliculus rerverus potion now let see how it fares in this one he said dunking it in harry and hermione cauldron when he removed the unfortunate flobberworm it had turned bright red and swelled to twice its previous size it was also obviously quite dead ah observed snape the classic response of a flobberworm to death caps he then turned to draco and asked in a feigned tone of casual curiosity so would you care to explain mr malfoy just why you would have an envelope containing a lethal poison such as dried powdered death caps in the pocket of your robes and how most of it seems to have found its way into mr potter caldron draco face went red but he kept his mouth shut he knew that he was cornered you do realise mr malfoy that poisoning one fellow students is completely against school rules said snape with heavy sarcasm it shall be my unfortunate duty to have to report these events to the headmaster i must tell you that the certain outcome will be your immediate suspension from hogwarts pending an official enquiry which will in all likelihood result in your permanent expulsion from this school you should also be aware that attempted murder is a criminal offence for a wizard of your age and is punishable by a lengthy sentence in azkaban draco held his head high and replied in his most arrogant voice i deny everything anyone could have put that poison in potter cauldron and then slipped the envelope into my pocket to pin the blame on me just to get me expelled no malfoy has ever been expelled from hogwarts nor convicted like a common criminal my father will not stand for these trumped up charges i think you will find that he has quite a lot of influence at the ministry then turning angrily on harry he said dontworry potter i ll be back you ll keep he then turned and stormed out of the dungeon snape shrugged his shoulders in resignation draco was probably right his father would get him off everyone clean up and put your things away he said all house point deductions and detentions are rescinded he added as an afterthought before exiting the dungeon can you wait a minute rick asked harry as dean followed the last of the slytherins out leaving rick harry and hermione alone in the dungeon i just wanted to say thank you hermione and i would be dead by now if it werentfor you i dontknow how we can ever repay you i do said rick how about you both try trusting me for a change harry and hermione both began protesting that of course they trusted him but rick brushed their protests aside with a wave of his hand listen i very perceptive and i know you donttrust me ok look i know that i a bit different and i can do things that you never learned here at hogwarts but please believe me when i say that i on your side one hundred percent after lunch harry hermione and ron were in a private huddle in a corner of the gryffindor common room hermione had recounted the events of the morning potions class to ron as the story of malfoy attempted poisoning of harry and hermione had not yet got around the school so said hermione finally does that change your opinion of rick then ron was quiet for a few minutes he was using his not inconsiderable intellectual abilities to try to find an explanation which fitted his dislike of rick and he found one i ve got it he said triumphantly he was in on the whole thing all along the plan was to poison harry right but as it turned out both harry and hermione would have to drink the potion of course malfoy was probably more than happy to poison hermione as well we all know how much he hates her but when godfry discovered that hermione was going to die as well he decided to scuttle the whole thing it obvious said ron clearly convinced by his own argument what utter nonsense ron said hermione if he was really in with voldemort the death eaters and the malfoys why would he ruin all their plans just to save a muggle born witch it completely absurd no it not said ron i ll tell you why it because he fancies you dont be ridiculous ron of course he doesntfancy me i think i might have noticed if he did well actually hermione you may know every word in hogwarts a history and half the books in the library but there are some things that you just dontseem to have a clue about said ron oh that rich coming from you ron you cantsee what right under your nose sometimes if it doesnthappen to fit in with your prejudices retorted hermione angrily you re wrong hermione if you re talking about godfry said ron i gave you a perfectly rational explanation for what happened in potions this morning it explains everything how do you explain the fact that godfry alone managed to catch malfoy putting something in your caldron when everyone else was distracted by zabini diversion even if he did see malfoy put something in your cauldron how could he be so certain that it was a deadly poison that he would dare to stand up to snape like that and risk going a hundred and fifty points down against slytherin how did he know that it wasntjust a harmless prank the sort of thing that fred and george would get up to go on tell me then demanded ron he got a point said harry it is kind of hard to explain oh i so confused said hermione there are just so many things he seems to know and do which i really dontunderstand but there is something about him that makes me trust him i just cant explain it oh come on hermione replied ron since when are you the intuitive type going on feelings rather than using your brilliant mind you know what i think you fancy godfry that why you re behaving so out of character that why you re so blind to his true intentions ron that enough cried hermione jumping to her feet i do not fancy rick godfry i ve never heard anything so stupid in all my life and with that she dashed up to her dormitory she does fancy him you know ron said to harry in a jealous tone i sure of it yeah i think you might be right there said harry i just dont know what to think any more it just too confusing we re going to have to keep an eye on her you know sighed ron oh well look on the bright side mate we ve gotten rid of that git malfoy for now replied harry but let wait till he safely locked up in azkaban before breaking out the butterbeers please review chapter 5 welcome back to the inquisition at breakfast the following morning the events in snape dungeon of the day before were the hot topic draco malfoy was conspicuous by his absence from the slytherin table just as harry and hermione were about to leave for their first class professor mcgonagall took them aside the headmaster would like to have a word with the two you please go up to his office at once the password is galloping gobstoppers said professor mcgonagall attempting to keep a straight face i will send a note to professor flitwick to let him know that you will be late for your charms class galloping gobstoppers said hermione stepping onto the rotating stairs followed by harry professor dumbledore rose to greet them as they entered his office harry hermione thank goodness you are both unharmed you can thank rick that we re alive said hermione he saved us yesterday yes so i heard please sit down said the headmaster drawing a comfortable leather sofa up behind them with a wave of his hand professor snape gave me a complete account of everything that happened in the potions dungeon yesterday will malfoy be expelled asked harry hopefully the headmaster sighed by all rights he should be expelled and imprisoned but with all judicial bodies dissolved under fudge state of emergency and the great influence that his father wields over the minister of magic i am afraid that nothing of the sort will happen draco was acting under his father direction professor snape has identified the writing on the envelope containing the poison as belonging to lucius malfoy said the headmaster there is no doubt in my mind that the origin of this attempt was voldemort himself professor dumbledore do you trust rick godfry hermione suddenly asked determined to solve the troubling enigma of rick he saved our lives yesterday and he also protected me from an awful curse of malfoy in defence against the dark arts last week but there is something very strange about him he seems to have extraordinary abilities and it is obvious that he is hiding things ron suspects that he spying for voldemort i shall be very happy to answer your question hermione in fact mr godfry is one of the reasons why i wanted to talk with you yes you can most definitely trust rick godfry i am certain that he is completely committed to our side said dumbledore it is true that mr godfry has some unusual abilities which he is concealing but he is doing so for very good reasons please trust me when i tell you that i am fully aware of rick godfry secrets and that you have nothing at all to fear from him on the contrary he continued directing his gaze at harry he will be a most valuable ally if you give him the opportunity please pass this message on to mr weasley although i fear that it may be a little difficult to convince him to trust mr godfry said dumbledore with a knowing smile a little difficult exclaimed harry talk about an understatement ron is dead set against him i just dont understand why but when it comes to rick he just beyond reason ah said dumbledore with a look of concern that may cause some problems it may be that there is a little jealously involved the three of you have shared an inseparable bond since your first year at hogwarts rick is a very friendly and charming young man it would seem only natural in the circumstances that rick might befriend one or the other of you which could in time alter the dynamic of your unique friendship mr weasley family background with five older brothers all of whom have excelled in different ways makes him feel insecure at times i fear said dumbledore he feels the need to prove himself and he has surely done that many times over but it has always been as a member of your extraordinary team for him the bond he shares with you is more than friendship it defines who he is and it sets him apart from his brothers i suspect that he feels either consciously or not that mr godfry may cause this bond to break he may even fear that in time mr godfry could supplant him i have also noticed that mr godfry has made quite an impression on the witches at hogwarts said dumbledore with an amused smile it is a natural instinct for other males to treat him as rival particularly if they fear that someone they care for very much is attracted to him added dumbledore his eyes came to rest significantly upon hermione who blushed brightly and looked down at her feet it was a reaction that harry didntfail to notice mr weasley heart is the right place and he is as committed to our cause as any of us in this room said dumbledore in time i hope he will come to accept mr godfry as a comrade but until then it may be best if you do not repeat everything that i have said concerning him perhaps if you just tell him that i trust mr godfry completely i would ask you both to assist mr godfry in concealing his powers said dumbledore especially from your friend ronald weasley as long as he remains hostile to mr godfry there is a danger that he may behave unwisely and divulge things that are best kept hidden now i must come to another matter said dumbledore with a sad sigh it appears that i will very soon be relieved of my duties as headmaster of hogwarts what but how they cantjust harry and hermione reacted together in alarm ah but they can said dumbledore nodding his head in resignation all vestiges of fairness justice due process and decency have been ruthlessly suppressed by fudge wizarding society has fallen into very dark times indeed but we must not despair we must not give up he said staring directly at harry i for one shall not be giving up said dumbledore with a steely determination i shall be working fulltime in the order but i shall also be keeping an eye on hogwarts and its students fudge will no doubt put in ones of his lackeys as headmaster i have every confidence in the hogwarts professors to do their utmost to protect the students but without you here there will be no one to stop voldemort from said harry in despair but there will interrupted dumbledore in an assertive voice i wontpretend that the coming weeks and months are going to be easy for you but i shall remain in touch with events here there are your professors all of whom i trust but particularly and i want you to remember this harry there is mr godfry stay close to him and learn to rely upon him the headmaster was absent from his place in the great hall at dinner that evening as the students began their meal the doors of the great hall swung opened and in strode four robed figures there was a buzz of excited whispers as the four figures made their way up to the teachers table one of them was a short plump little witch when she reached the teachers table she turned around to survey the students a fluffy pink cardigan was visible beneath her robes where they parted in front it was none other than dolores umbridge formerly high inquisitor and later headmistress of hogwarts standing next to her was the minister of internal security and also deputy minister of magic percy weasley looking very smug and pleased with himself the two wizards who had entered with them obviously both aurors now flanked them in front of the teachers table percy drew a scroll from his robes then puffing himself up self importantly he made his announcement by order of cornelius oswald fudge the minister of magic and the powers vested in me as his minister of internal security and under the provisions of the state of emergency act i hereby proclaim this special educational decree number thirty six he then waved his wand at the scroll to break the official seal of the minister of magic and unfurled the parchment ceremoniously adjusting his spectacles he cleared his throat and began to read i cornelius oswald fudge minister of magic in exercising my executive responsibilities to ensure the safety and well being of all students attending hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry declare that the following measures shall take place with immediate effect 1 i hereby relieve albus dumbledore of his post as headmaster of hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry 2 i hereby appoint dolores jane umbridge to serve as headmistress of hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry 3 i hereby vest in headmistress umbridge authority to take such measures as she deems fit in securing the safety and ensuring the proper education of all witches and wizards attending hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry 4 i hereby vest in headmistress umbridge authority to dismiss any member of the hogwarts staff whom she deems to be failing to carry out their teaching responsibilities in a satisfactory manner 5 i hereby dissolve the hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry board of governors 6 i hereby appoint lucius malfoy as executive governor of hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry 7 i hereby charge the hogwarts executive governor with the revision of the charter of hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry and its articles of convocation and suffrage i mandate him to ensure that the school shall provide a suitable and proper magical education to the sons and daughters of all witches and wizards of this land hermione gasped as the final measure dropping her head into her hands in despair most of the other students looked totally stunned trying to understand what all the bureaucratic mumbo jumbo meant apart from the obvious that their beloved headmaster was gone and had been replaced by a witch whom almost every student above first year loathed percy pompously rolled up his scroll returning it to his robes and bowed his head to the new headmistress handing proceedings over to her she immediately walked around the teachers table and stood at professors dumbledore place resting her hands on the back of his empty chair her chair a collective sigh of deja vu arose from the students hem hem she began with her annoying throat clearing it is a great pleasure to back at hogwarts and to see so many familiar and cherished faces she said looking over at the slytherin table it seems like only yesterday that i was standing here in this very hall as your headmistress i feel privileged and greatly honoured that our illustrious minister of magic the right honourable cornelius fudge has shown such confidence in me to entrust me once more with this noble undertaking i intend to make an immediate start in rectifying some of the more glaring mistakes of my predecessor particularly in the area of teaching appointments the expressions on the faces of he teachers sitting at the teachers table had slowly changed from shock to horror and finally to outrage as events had unfolded now they were now sitting alertly listening to her words with an air of foreboding hem hem said umbridge it is indeed fortunate that i had the opportunity last year in my role as high inquisitor of hogwarts to rigorously evaluate and scrutinise the performance of all the present hogwarts staff so happily i come to my present task fully prepared i have already taken steps to find suitably qualified teachers for the following positions care of magical creatures divination and transfiguration the present incumbents of all three positions performed woefully in my evaluations however i shall permit them to remain in a temporary capacity until their replacements have been appointed hagrid immediately jumped to his feet his face bright red umbridge gave a sign to the aurors to be ready for trouble but hagrid simply turned and stormed wordlessly out of the hall professor trelawney was teaching divination alone this year as the other centaurs had finally been persuaded to allow firenze to return to their fold in the forest however as was her custom she was absent from the evening meal but professor mcgonagall was there and her faced was etched in stony fury were it not for the aurors umbridge would most probably have been transfigured into something truly terrible by now such as a chamber pot a full one turning to tonks umbridge made her signature hem hem then smiling falsely she said you may have noticed my previous reference about having already evaluated the performance of all the present hogwarts staff that didntinclude you of course because you werenthere last year and also hem hem because you are no longer a member of that staff tonks just sat there stunned you may leave now miss err said umbridge she had obviously been instructed to root out anyone suspected of involvement with the order tonks prompted percy from the other side of the table then indicating to the aurors that they should draw their wands again umbridge said pointedly right now tonks rose to her feet turned a withering gaze on umbridge and muttered loudly for all the hall to hear stupid cow then turned and left the hall her hair changing colours violently from crimson to black to yellow to purple as she fought to control her seething anger it was a memorable an exit hem hem ah that much better now isntit children she said patronisingly to the shocked students who were reeling from the changes that had come upon them like a bolt out of the blue i will not be appointing a replacement defence against the dark arts teacher as i do not consider it to be an appropriate subject for school children at least certainly not for everyone she continued in her infuriatingly condescending manner the inquisitorial squad which was so helpful and supportive last year is to be re formed all of last year members are invited to join other students who demonstrate a suitably supportive attitude to myself and the ministry of magic may be privileged to receive an invitation to join this select body members of the squad will receive special lessons in magical law enforcement from visiting ministry aurors hem hem said umbridge that will be all for now enjoy your meal harry ron and hermione were totally thunderstruck hermione who was sitting between them was in tears she blurted out to her friends that the so called revision of the hogwarts charter would probably mean that all muggle born witches and wizards would be thrown out of hogwarts especially since lucius malfoy had been appointed to carry it out suddenly ron looked up and stared just when we thought things couldntget any worse look what just walked in he said glaring in the direction of the slytherin table harry and hermione followed his gaze to see draco malfoy striding triumphantly up to the slytherin table grinning from ear to ear noticing the three gryffindors glaring at him he swaggered over to them and grinning evilly at harry ran his thumb across his throat and said looks like your time is up potter there no more dumbly doos to save your skin now then he burst into wicked laughter harry started rising from the table reaching for their wand but before he could get to his feet or hermione could stop him rick who was sitting along a bit on the opposite side of the table said no holding up his hand harry felt himself being pushed back down onto the bench although to everyone else it just looked like he had changed his mind about attacking malfoy oh harry cried hermione in distress dont be so stupid he just trying to provoke you to attack him so that umbridge will have an excuse to do who knows what have you forgotten how she tried to put an unforgivable curse on you last year draco meanwhile swaggering like a king made his way over to his friends at the slytherin table who were celebrating his return and all the sudden changes at hogwarts which had tipped the tables towards them it was as if all their christmases had come at once for once in his life ron weasley wasnthungry and neither were harry or hermione let get back to the gryffindor common room said harry i dontfeel very safe here in the great hall any longer ron and hermione nodded in understanding and rick also rose to leave the hall following a short distance behind them for as much as the slytherins were elated at the turn of events most of the gryffindors were depressed but none as much as harry and his friends as they sat in their usual corner of the common room trying to understand the implications of it all ron was also seething at the part that the great turncoat git percy had played in the evening events he was beyond embarrassment now when it came to percy as far as ron was concerned percy behaviour didntreflect on him and ginny and his family any more percy wasnta weasley any longer he had been excommunicated he should change his name to percival pompous fudgelet he thought in disgust these thoughts were interrupted by hermione who gave him an edited version of their talk with dumbledore that morning ron was upset that they hadnttold him sooner what dumbledore had said about his leaving hogwarts well this is our first opportunity for a private conversation said hermione defensively and i never dreamed that it was going to happen so quickly me neither mumbled harry morosely he was still in a state of shock you know i think dumbledore may be losing the plot said ron what do you mean demanded hermione well telling you that we should trust godfry said ron ron professor dumbledore told us that he has complete confidence that rick is on our side and that we have nothing to fear from him said hermione desperately wanting to convince ron ron turned doubtingly to harry for confirmation did dumbledore really say that yeah said harry he said we should trust rick and treat him as an ally trust him gesticulated ron that just proves my point that dumbledore lost the plot just too much pressure i guess you cantreally blame him ronald weasley how can you be so stupid bloody minded and divisive demanded hermione finally letting her frustrations get the better of her if ever there was a time that we needed to trust in dumbledore and the order it now if ever there was a time that we needed help from a powerful ally like rick it now if ever there was a time that the three of us needed to stand together and support each other it now just look at harry look at the state he in with all that has happened tonight and all you can do is single mindedly pursue your prejudices and petty jealousies said hermione getting carried away and saying things that she hadntintended to say about either harry or ron although they were perfectly true ron face turned red jealousies he demanded and who exactly do you think i jealous of then of course they all knew she meant rick but hermione had got control of her temper by now and kept silent things were bad enough without her making them worse you know i the only one who can see godfry for what he really is and judge him rationally said ron you he said pointing at hermione you re just like every other witch in this school you ve fallen under his spell he has some strange power over people particularly witches how come you cantsee that ron said hermione trying to salvage the situation professor dumbledore said he knows all about rick unusual powers and that he trusts him completely ah ha said ron as if he was about to say checkmate in a game of wizard chess but what if dumbledore is under godfry power for all we know he could be using the imperious curse or some even more powerful and irresistible variant that he learned from this mysterious master of his what then all of dumbledore assurances are worthless and mean nothing hermione realised that there was no way out of this and wanted desperately to minimise the damage especially to harry please ron she pleaded i just dontwant to keep fighting with you over rick i accept that you cannot trust him and i going to stop trying to convince you otherwise but you have to accept that harry and i believe professor dumbledore when he says that we should trust rick you have to stop trying to destroy that trust because without it we really donthave much hope right now she concluded sadly and you mate said ron turning to harry do you believe that when dumbledore said to trust godfry that it not possible that he was under godfry power harry didntseem to be completely with them he had to struggle to come out of the shell that he was crawling into and really consider ron words finally he said you know you re really clever ron with your logic you can prove that black is white one day and that white is black the next i know i cant persuade you that rick can be trusted but neither can you persuade me that he can t everything that rick has done has been for our benefit said harry just before in the great hall when i lost my head and swallowed malfoy bait rick saved me again ron and hermione looked at harry in surprise he cast some kind of spell than stopped me from getting up and attacking malfoy it pushed me back down onto the bench i couldntraise my wand at all explained harry and did it occur to you countered ron that he turned you into a sitting duck so that malfoy could blast you while you were defenceless ron yelled hermione this was really too much that ridiculous but harry put up his hand to silence her ron he cried more in frustration than in anger what hermione said before was right this constant bickering is driving me crazy and i really dontneed it right now i cantconvince you and you cantconvince me or hermione so let just leave it all we re doing is going round and round in circles and i cant handle it at the moment not after everything else that happened tonight dumbledore told me to trust rick and that is exactly what i going to do said harry but harry why cantyou see interrupted ron let me finish ron said harry becoming more assertive with everything that has happened tonight i am completely vulnerable there is nothing left to protect me from voldemort i a sitting duck he doesntneed rick help to kill me with fudge umbridge and lucius malfoy in charge of things i practically defenceless and you and hermione cantsave me so donteven start on that i ve only got one hope and it rick said harry that what dumbledore told me if i cantbelieve in dumbledore and rick then i might as well just ask malfoy if he wouldntmind taking me to see voldemort right now cantyou understand that ron he demanded in desperation yeah i can understand said ron it not just dumbledore and hermione that he got under his spell it you too harry dontworry i ve got the message you and hermione dontbelieve me anymore but you believe rick ok ok he said holding his hand up as harry started bashing his fists in frustration on the table sending several of hermione books flying to the floor i ll stop trying to convince you i can tell when i not wanted you have both made your choice and it perfectly clear what it is he said staring directly into hermione face ron face was red with anger but his eyes were full of hurt he turned and dashed for his dormitory before the tears came rick was sitting by the fireplace and had been observing their argument he had been well aware of their differences of opinion about him since the start of term as ron stormed from the common room rick was able to read the latest chapter in the dispute from his face there was no need to probe any further rick had been keeping his distance from the three figuring that any attempt to get closer to them would just make matters worse between them but with the events in the great hall this evening he knew he had to make a move harry was very vulnerable and rick had to protect him it wasnta question of if there would be another attempt on harry life only of when rick rose from his chair and walked across the common room to where harry and hermione were sitting unhappily in silent thought err could i join you for a moment asked rick looking at harry sure said harry i spoke with the headmaster before he left hogwarts today said rick trying to find the best way to approach the difficult subject he said that he had told you to trust me and i really hope that you can you dontneed me to tell you what kind of danger you re in i sure you know yeah dontworry said harry i sure do it looks like voldemort has finally got me right where he wants me i surrounded and he moving in for the kill i dont think they ll be calling me the boy who lived for very much longer he added dejectedly oh harry please stop that morbid fatalism pleaded hermione tears running down her cheeks we re not beaten yet unless we believe we are voldemort failed to kill you when you were a totally defenceless little baby and no matter how bad things are now you re not that defenceless hermione right harry said rick in an assuring tone i know things look really bad right now especially with professor dumbledore gone but there is something that you need to know harry and hermione both look up at rick he had their attention i think that i can protect you but you have to give me your trust said rick i know it hard to trust someone who is hiding secrets from you all i can tell you is that the less that you and everyone else know about me the better i ll be able to protect you that a lot of trust you re asking for said harry but harry your life depends upon it pleaded hermione please trust rick we have to well if you re so powerful why dontyou just kill voldemort asked harry and then this whole nightmare will be over it was a good question rick sat deep in thought for a minute before replying i not really sure but i dont think i can it may be because of the prophecy but it may be something else rick continued turning the question over in his mind because he didntreally understand it himself his power was like the distilled essence of the light part of that essence was a kind of moral or spiritual quality a sense of connectedness yes that was it he felt connected to everything and everyone not just good guys for as much as he abhorred the evil behaviour of someone like draco malfoy he couldnthate him or want him dead he felt connected even to draco malfoy even to tom riddle finally he said to harry and hermione who were waiting for him to finish his explanation no harry i dontthink i can kill voldemort you are going to have to do that but i can help you how can you know that asked hermione puzzled i really sorry said rick but i cant tell you my whole story what i can tell you though he said putting a hand on harry shoulder and staring intensely into his eyes is that if you let me stay close to you i can protect you ok said harry he really had to trust rick the more they talked the easier it became rick was turning out to be very easy to trust hermione also trusted him although her curiosity about his powers and who he really was and where he had really come from was driving her slightly crazy what was also starting to drive her crazy was that as she spent more time around rick she was beginning to feel emotions that she had never felt before previously she had despised lavender and parvati and all the other girls who swooned over him but now she seemed totally unable to stop herself being drawn towards the mysterious rick that was one thing that ron had been spot on about please review chapter 6 quidditch quaffles and blue balls the end of the week arrived without further drama umbridge inquisitorial squad slytherins all were starting to make their obnoxious presence felt around the corridors of hogwarts rick stayed close to harry hermione was usually with them rick didnt want to make it too obvious that he was acting as harry protector to others it probably looked like the unthinkable had happened after five years the dream team had fallen apart either that or rick had displaced ron in a reformed triad harry and hermione tried hard to be friendly with ron but he shunned them and always made a point of sitting well away from them at mealtimes and in classes there was much gossip in the gryffindor common room about harry hermione rick and ron the witches were particularly curious to know what if anything was happening between hermione and rick gryffindor most desirable wizard the other hot topic was the first quidditch match of the season gryffindor versus slytherin harry had been waiting for umbridge to reinstate the life ban that she had placed upon him last year and which dumbledore had subsequently rescinded as each day passed his fear that she would reinstate the ban was slowly being replaced by the fear that she was deliberately not reinstating it because she wanted him to play that something bad was going to happen in the match or maybe she just didntsee any point in a life ban given his very short life expectancy quidditch is a very dangerous game said hermione on the friday night before the big match as she sat with harry and rick in the common room you better be very careful tomorrow harry you know how many close calls you ve had playing quidditch it would be all too easy to make an attack look like an accident during the game right said harry i ll try but there so much happening in a quidditch match that it hard to concentrate on other things sometimes well harry you re just going to have to concentrate said hermione forcefully forget about winning and forget about the stupid snitch let malfoy have it for once just concentrate on staying alive do you think you can do that harry i really dontknow said harry when i on my broom in a quidditch match something else just takes over and when i see the golden gleam of the snitch it hard to explain he said shaking his head oh harry said hermione in exasperation it just a game remember that right agreed rick it just a game harry looked wistfully over towards where ron was sitting with ginny and the rest of the gryffindor quidditch team ron understood about quidditch hermione just didntget it and it looked like rick didnteither he was really starting to miss his other best friend he remembered in their fourth year how they had fought for months over his name coming out of the goblet of fire in the end they got over it and were best friends again he desperately hoped that they would get over this one the whole school turned out for the first quidditch match of the year gryffindor versus slytherin was always the highlight of the season madam hooch gave the two teams her usual lecture about fair play and penalties for cheating then threw the ball up in the air to start the game rick was sitting beside hermione at one end of the gryffindor stand where he would not be too visible if he had to take action do you like quidditch asked hermione i dontreally know said rick this is my first game i ve never played it myself in fact i ve never even been on a broom he looked at the players dashing about at breakneck speed but it looks like a lot of fun hermione had stopped listening to him looking over to the professors stand she had spotted someone sitting next to the headmistress who made her blood run cold and her skin crawl it was lucius malfoy this could not be good she nervously pointed him out to rick rick just seemed to stare fixedly at him for about half a minute then said wryly another for whom the world stops for quidditch what on earth do you mean asked hermione puzzled right now all lucius malfoy can think about is the quidditch match he imagining a great slytherin victory with draco bringing glory to the malfoy name by capturing the snitch if he does have any plans to attack harry we wontneed to worry about them until the game is over he said this with a certainty as if lucius malfoy had told him himself which in fact he had although not intentionally how can you know all that demanded hermione surely it just supposition hermione trust me i know it said rick quietly realising too late that he should have kept quiet how was he going to talk himself out of this one but how she demanded again surely you ve heard of legilimency said rick my master in new zealand was an expert and err he gave me a bit of training it comes in useful at times well of course i ve heard of legilimency replied hermione as if it should be obvious that she would know about such things i read all about it last year when harry was taking occlumency lessons with professor snape it quite impossible to use legilimency over such a long distance you have to be in very close contact with the other person and anyway i didntsee you cast the legilimens spell however you ve figured out lucius malfoy intentions if indeed you have it cantbe legilimency rick had to smile hermione was living up to her reputation as the font of all knowledge hermione i know that what it says in slinkhard defensive magical theory and that the way it usually done but my master must have taught me some special technique that works over longer distances bluffed rick for a moment hermione was actually more impressed by the fact that rick had read the slinkhard text than the possibility that he had somehow discovered what lucius malfoy was thinking but then her thoughts turned back to lucius malfoy we had better keep an eye on him just the same i doubt that he would attack harry openly in front of so many spectators but he might be able to make it look like an accident she said the quidditch match had meanwhile become very exciting slytherin had started strongly peppering the gryffindor goal with the quaffle but ron was in superb form dashing manically about defending his hoops valiantly the slytherin players became frustrated at their inability to score on him but the gryffindor spectators were inspired and began singing loudly ronald weasley he our king he never lets the quaffle in ronald weasley you re our king eat you heart out slytherin this enraged the slytherin team and they began resorting to their trademark foul play madam hooch however was having none of it she didntmiss a trick and kept awarding penalties to gryffindor until the foul play stopped by which time the score was gryffindor 50 to slytherin 0 ginny weasley was playing chaser today as harry was back in his customary position of seeker as she gained in confidence it became evident that she was an absolutely brilliant chaser forty minutes into the game she had scored a further 12 goals for gryffindor were now 170 to slytherin 0 ron had continued his perfect record in defence but the slytherin chasers hardly got possession of the quaffle it was all ginny weasley her electrifying performance inspired a new song from the gryffindor stand ginny weasley quidditch queen greatest chaser ever seen slytherin dontstand a chance when she does her quaffle dance hermione was getting excited along with the rest of the gryffindors but she was still maintaining constant vigilance on lucius malfoy suddenly she nudged rick sharply pointing over to the professors stand where he had just risen to his feet rick concentrated on him again he making his move hermione said rick he obviously given up on slytherin winning now and he going after harry rick tried not to make it sound like he could read lucius malfoy mind this time well shouldntwe be following him then asked hermione but rick said nothing he was following him sitting quietly with his eyes closed he projected a map of the stadium in his mind lucius malfoy had concealed himself beneath the professors stand from where he would be able to cast spells unobserved look cried hermione ginny who had just scored again suddenly seemed to lose control of her broom it began twisting and turning all over the place and steadily rising higher and higher harry meanwhile had spotted the snitch at almost the same moment that ginny broom began its wild dance although slytherin could not win now draco was desperate to beat harry to the snitch for once especially with his father watching they dipped and dived and soared together after the erratically moving snitch they were pushing and jostling each other as they flew often side by side neither of them aware of the drama taking place high above them with ginny and her broom but hermione wasntinterested in the battle for the snitch all here attention and concern was focused on ginny it looks like the same spell that professor quirrell cast on harry broom in first year cried hermione anxiously we have to do something but someone was already doing something look said rick harry had finally spotted ginny and was now soaring upwards in an almost vertical climb to reach her thank goodness said hermione tensely i just hope he gets to her in time actually said rick i think it might all be part of lucius malfoy plan what do you mean asked hermione the spell on ginny broom is making it uncontrollable but not to the degree that someone with her skill is likely to be thrown off explained rick he knew harry would go to her rescue i think he planning on killing them both together his master stroke it just the sort of thing that would appeal to his evil twisted mind he hates the weasleys he hates her father he hates ron and right now he absolutely livid at the way ginny has humiliated his precious pureblood slytherins said rick he planning to make her pay for it harry meanwhile had reached ginny and with a strong arm he pulled her onto his broom placing her in front of himself then just as rick had predicted lucius malfoy struck he performed a clever combination summoning banishing spell he accio ed harry broom and simultaneously banished its two riders effectively throwing them from the it a gasp went up from the spectators as harry and ginny began a deadly freefall plummeting earthwards from many hundreds feet up in the air but then suddenly their descent began to slow as they came closer to the ground a frantic hermione saw that they appeared to be encased in what looked like a glowing blue bubble she allowed herself a small sigh of relief although she knew that they werentsafe yet cheers rang out from the worried spectators when they saw harry and ginny in the blue bubble and realised that they were not going to be dashed to death on the quidditch pitch after all but as the bubble floated gently down it was struck by vicious a flash of green light no it an avada kedavra curse screamed hermione but then she saw to her amazement and great relief that it was unable to penetrate the bubble avada kedavra curses were supposed to be unblockable yet it had been simply deflected away next followed several jagged red flashes which hermione imagined must be blasting curses designed to destroy or shatter the blue bubble but none of them had any effect upon it turning to rick in relief hermione noticed his studied concentration his eyes were fixed upon the blue bubble and she realised that rick must have somehow created it and was now in the process of slowly lowering it to the ground she noted in amazement that he did not even have his wand out hermione wanted to ask him how he could do wandless magic like that she wanted to ask him so many questions with great difficulty and supreme self control she managed to remain silent she did not want to break rick concentration and cause the bubble to burst or crash she also didntwant to draw anyone attention to rick she forced herself to sit quietly watching the blue bubble floating downwards when it finally touched down she let out a huge sigh of relief rick waited until the teachers and students had run forward and surrounded harry and ginny before removing the protective bubble he waited until the surrounding crowd obscured them from lucius malfoy thus preventing him from flinging any further curses at them lucius malfoy left the quidditch grounds in a fury and made his way to hogsmead from where he apparated to malfoy manor he was absolutely livid slytherin had been humiliated and his brilliant plan to do away with potter and arthur weasley youngest brat the source of the humiliation in one fell swoop had been thwarted by some unknown power could it have been that fool dumbledore was he still at hogwarts hidden away somewhere he could think of no other wizard with that kind of power fortunately for rick neither could anyone else meanwhile harry and ginny were the centre of attention as the blue bubble landed on the quidditch pitch they could be seen inside harry with arm wrapped protectively around ginny they looked quite cosy when the bubble disappeared harry delved into the sleeve of his left gauntlet and pulled out the snitch he had caught it in the same moment that he had spotted ginny and had stuffed it into his gauntlet for safe keeping as he raised it over his head grinning broadly the scoreboard was updated to read the final result gryffindor 330 slytherin 0 it would go down in the history books as gryffindor greatest quidditch triumph over slytherin harry and ginny were raised on the shoulders of their team mates to be carried back to the inevitable celebrations in the gryffindor common room as the walked they sang over and over again in joy ginny weasley quidditch queen greatest chaser ever seen slytherin dontstand a chance when she does her quaffle dance the gryffindor celebrations lasted well into the night rick had never seen harry looking so happy or relaxed he and ron seemed to have put aside their differences for tonight at least as they sat with the other team members at the centre of the party being toasted with butterbeers harry and ginny seem to have bonded in the bubble remarked rick to hermione with a grin yes said hermione they have been keeping rather close together since the match of course ginny has always liked harry but he never seems to notice her much other than as ron little sister i guess he couldnthelp but notice her up there in the blue bubble she added it looks like ginny finally got some quality time with harry but what about dean thomas asked rick i though ginny was dean girlfriend goodness rick i thought you knew everything ginny and dean broke up the second week of term said hermione glad to be able to tell rick something he didntknow well i guess i miss some things laughed rick but i never picked you as the type to be up on all the latest hogwarts gossip hey said hermione in annoyance when you share a dormitory with lavender brown and parvati patil believe me you get more information than you need about who is doing what and with whom so what happened with ginny and dean then asked rick hermione gave an ironic laugh dean decided that their relationship was unhealthy unhealthy asked rick what do you mean unhealthy well let me rephrase that said hermione dean was convinced by ron that it was unhealthy as in bad for dean health i really feel for ginny with all those overprotective big brothers of hers and ron is definitely the worst she added with a sigh i hate to think what he ll do to harry then said rick if he decides that ginny is worth the health risk he already angry enough with harry because of me sadly there nothing to worry about on that front sighed hermione harry wontlet ginny get close to him or let himself get close to her or anyone else while voldemort alive he would be too afraid of making her a target tonight harry filled with quidditch euphoria for a few hours he not worrying about all the dark things going on around us and the prophecy that binds him to a fate he cantescape but tomorrow she continued sadly those things will come flooding back to him and he ll be filled with worry and foreboding once more he ll withdraw back into himself and try pushing everyone and everything away ginny and romance will be the furthest things from his mind you mark my words rick was amazed at hermione profound understanding of harry feelings he could feel her heart crying out at the unbearable suffering that life had thrust upon her dear friend hermione was right about harry of course when they rose sunday morning rick noticed that the anxiety and worry were back the rest of the gryffindors took longer to come down from their quidditch high but any remaining joy was soon extinguished at the evening meal when the students entered the great hall that evening they noticed a guest sitting at the teachers table next to the headmistress hermione felt a sense of deep foreboding it was lucius malfoy no one started eating it was obvious that there was to be some kind of special announcement when the students and professors had all taken their places the dumpy headmistress made the short journey to her feet hem hem she began in her irritating manner it is my great pleasure and privilege to welcome mr lucius malfoy executive governor of hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry to address the school as you know mr malfoy has been given the momentous task by the minister of magic of reforming the charter of hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry governor malfoy we would be greatly honoured to have you address us she gushed attempting to engage lucius malfoy with an obsequious smile lucius malfoy rose arrogantly to his feet acknowledging the grovelling umbridge with a disdainful nod he paused for a moment surveying the students assembled before him haughtily as if he were an emperor about to lay down the law upon his subjects as you will know he began in his supercilious drawl the minister of magic has entrusted me with revising the hogwarts charter the minister shares the concern of many leading members of wizarding society that this school has for some time been failing to meet its traditional role hogwarts he continued has a long and proud history one which is intertwined and inseparable with that of the great wizarding families of this land the primary role of this school is to educate the sons and daughters of those families to achieve their full magical potential and to inculcate the correct values of wizarding society to prepare them to take their rightful places in our society to maintain our great and time honoured traditions to preserve the proper order of things sadly the previous headmaster he said with distaste failed pathetically in this task he allowed those of unworthy blood to debase the purity of this school and ultimately to contaminate the whole of wizarding society the task of revising the charter of hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry and its articles of convocation and suffrage to reflect the true role of this school may take some time these things cannot be rushed he droned on self importantly when it is completed the revision will be known as the malfoy hogwarts education reformation statute in the interim i have decided in my capacity as executive governor of this school to issue special educational decree number thirty seven to take effect immediately it will redress some of the more serious mistakes and glaring errors of the previous headmaster he said pronouncing the word headmaster with a tone of disgust he then unfurled the parchment he had been holding and commenced to read it special educational decree number thirty seven article 1 hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry will henceforth accept no muggle born students article 2 muggle born students currently enrolled at hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry will not be permitted to return to the school after the christmas break article 3 hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry will henceforth accept only pureblood wizards and witches article 4 mixed blood students currently enrolled at hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry will be permitted to complete their education article 5 the ministry of magic will establish a separate vocational training institution for future mixed blood students where they can learn the appropriate trades necessary for them to serve their proper place in wizarding society he then rolled up his parchment and returned to his seat with a smug grin hermione was in tears this was her worst nightmare come true banishment from hogwarts and the wizarding world into an uncertain and insecure future she felt a consoling arm around her shoulder it was rick dont cry hermione he whispered in her ear he wontget away with it we ll find a way to stop him he spoke with such fierce determination that hermione allowed herself to take some comfort and believe that perhaps her situation was not yet totally hopeless the headmistress meanwhile had stood up again after lauding lucius malfoy as the saviour of the wizarding world she announced that as a consequence of special educational decree number thirty seven certain changes were to be made at hogwarts with immediate effect all non pureblood prefects are hereby relieved of their duties and instructed to hand their badges in to their head of house caretaker filch has already been sent packing hogwarts is a school of magic there is no place here for despicable squibs the inquisitorial squad will assume the former caretaker policing duties and will have an expanded role in maintaining law and order at hogwarts hem hem that is all enjoy your meal she added but not many students were eating the slytherins purebloods all were too excited to eat the position of privilege that they had been brought up to believe was theirs by birth was now going to be guaranteed by law but many students in the other three houses were muggle born or mixed blood and their future suddenly looked grim indeed not much food was eaten at those three tables that night please review chapter 7 the temptations of ronald weasley when rick came down to the gryffindor common room the following morning hermione was sitting dejectedly curled up in a ball in a corner as he walked over to her rick saw that hermione eyes were all red and puffy she looked drawn and tired as if she had not slept much on sunday night arent you coming for some breakfast asked rick with concern none of us ate much last night you must be hungry hermione just shook her head i just cantgo out and face everyone she said malfoy and the slytherins will be unbearable abusing all the non purebloods and lording it over us i dont want to remember hogwarts that way i want to take some happy memories with me of the way it was if they let me keep my memories at all she added darkly what will happen to the muggle borns when they throw us out she asked will they wipe our memories so that we cantremember anything about our time at hogwarts i sure they intend to wipe everything from our minds that we ve learned about magic all the spells everything oh it just too horrible to think about she said bursting into tears it like having a part of yourself torn away and obliterated i just cantbear to think about it rick sat down next to her wrapping both arms around her and letting her sob on his shoulder for a while he tried sending a sense of calm and reassurance towards her it seemed to work hermione stopped crying and looked up at him hermione said rick looking deeply into her eyes it over two months until the end of term and we re not beaten yet we re not giving in to lucius malfoy racist pureblood supremacy plans without a fight i know i not but in truth rick was feeling pretty lost himself he had been focused on protecting harry but this was different lucius malfoy had in effect carried out a coup that stood the wizarding world on its head without casting so much as a curse in anger death eater attacks were one thing rick knew he had the power to fight them but this was about political power control and manipulation an arena where rick was a novice and lucius malfoy was supreme that was the problem somehow they had to break the political hold of malfoy and his minions fudge and umbridge but he had no idea where to begin if only hermione could pull herself together she might be able to help him figure it out she had the brains for it oh rick i dontwant to give up said hermione but i so worried about what going to happen especially after i thrown out of hogwarts what will happen to all the muggle born witches and wizards even if they can erase all our memories of magic and the wizarding world they canttake away our ability to do magic so we ll still be performing accidental magic what did you say about not being able to take away magic asked rick well it something that has intrigued wizarding scholars throughout the ages replied hermione regaining some of her confidence as she launched into a lecture drawing upon her extensive reading on the subject where does magic come from what makes some people magical and others not and of course some more magical than others she said looking pointedly at rick just like alchemists she continued who try to create gold from base metals witches and wizards through the ages have sought ways to create magical power but without success what about voldemort asked rick didnthe develop great magical powers that not the same said hermione it is possible to increase one own power through knowledge or possession of powerful objects or dark rituals but it takes loads of time and effort and there are costs involved both physical and mental just look at voldemort what i mean continued hermione is that even the most powerful witch or wizard cantmake a non magical person magical or increase the magical power of another by the same token it not possible to reduce or take away the magical power from a magical person if it were the ministry of magic would have just gone around un magicking any muggle borns like me and you can imagine what voldemort would do if he had that power so you never read about any witch or wizard ever un magicking anyone asked rick becoming interested hermione thought hard for a while well i once read a rather obscure book by germaine pankhurst called witches of the world unite you have nothing to lose but your pains aka wizards it not exactly mainstream you understand there a lot about the great witch circe in it she was famous for transforming sailors into pigs pigs asked rick why umm she used to eat them apparently grinned hermione after they d been nicely fattened up of course of course repeated rick pankhurst claimed in her book that circe could actually transform almost anything into anything else after she met odysseus she gave up her evil ways and became a good witch according to pankhurst she once cast a spell on an evil sorcerer destroying his power now that very interesting thought rick as ron was leaving the great hall after breakfast pansy parkinson came up to him and with her most bewitching smile said do you think i could have a little word with you ron what do you want to talk to me for asked ron suspiciously looking around to see if anyone was watching ron i just want to talk to you cried pansy looking hurt and batting her eyelashes pathetically well whatever it is i not interested said ron i think you might be actually said pansy in a low seductive voice but if you dontgive me a chance you ll never find out ok said ron nervously let go somewhere private he added anxious not to be seen consorting with a slytherin follow me said pansy leading him into an empty classroom she closed the door casting a locking charm on it followed by an imperturbable charm on the classroom so that they couldntbe overheard ron reached for his wand he didntlike this it could be some sort of a trap relax ron cooed pansy in a soothing voice as she returned her own wand to her robes you can trust me and why should i trust you or any slytherin asked ron still holding his wand at the ready and telling himself that this was a time for moody constant vigilance firstly because i like you ron you ve grown into a very handsome wizard you know and a powerful one said pansy seductively moving closer to ron and running her finger down his chest ron vigilance was quickly becoming anything but constant but that hardly surprising the weasleys are one of the oldest pureblood families in the wizarding world she added pointedly rubbing her finger on the prefect badge which he still wore on his chest well i dontcare about all that pureblood stuff said ron it doesntmean anything to me i think you ll find as the future unfolds ron that you ll be very thankful for your pureblood lineage said pansy what exactly do you mean by that challenged ron look ron said pansy draping herself ornately across one of the desks i know that you ve allied yourself with potter and dumbledore and all those muggle borns i not going to engage in a philosophical discussion or try to convince you to return to your pureblood roots i simply pointing out realities dumbledore and those who share his ideas have had their day history is like a pendulum it swings back and forth between opposing ideas if you open your eyes to what happening right now here at hogwarts and outside at the ministry of magic and in the wizarding world generally it obvious that the pendulum is swinging back to pureblood power hard and fast well i dontlike that idea said ron defiantly ron it doesntmatter whether you like it or not it doesntmatter that you d prefer the world to be different the world is the way it is regardless of how you feel about it the only question is whether you re going to be one of the strong ones who survive and prosper or whether you ll get washed away with those who cant see the inevitable it would be very sad if that were to happen to you ron said pansy getting up from the desk and coming closer to him as she switched back to her seductive tone you ve got a lot going for you you know you were very impressive on the quidditch pitch yesterday you could be one of the great keepers in quidditch history if you had the right kind of help of course she added what do you mean by help asked ron suspiciously well smiled pansy to get on to one of the really top teams you have to be more than good you need the right connections my father is on the board of the montrose magpies they ve won the league cup more times than just about all the other teams combined and did you know that the montrose magpies keeper has also been keeper on the english team for seventeen out of the past twenty years of course it might just have something to do with the fact that both my father and uncle are on the selection committee for the national team she added with a meaningful wink well i not interested in the montrose magpies or in getting on any team by anything but my own talent said ron proudly i d rather play for the chudley cannons anyway oh well you better just keep your fingers crossed and hope for the best then quipped pansy before continuing on in a more serious tone you know you chose the wrong friends when you came to hogwarts ron and the reality is that they wontbe here for much longer you are soon going to be all alone granger will be gone with the rest of the mudbloods at the end of term and potter luck cantlast forever there is nothing and no one left now who can save him from his fate well i not about to abandon harry avowed ron determinedly ha scoffed pansy deciding to try a different tack but he already abandoned you and so has granger they ve both turned their backs on you and are cuddling up to godfry that not true yelled ron but no matter how hard he yelled he couldntovercome the thought that pansy was dead right look at the thanks you get for all you ve done for the pair of them continued pansy sensing that she had ron on her hook at last you ve stood beside them and fought for them for five years then slick rick suddenly shows up and worms his way into the dream team and pushes you out who does potter listen to challenged pansy raising an eyebrow you or him it obvious that potter doesnttrust you any more godfry has turned him against you and as for granger well she just throwing herself at him added pansy hitting pay dirt dontworry i know how much you fancy that worthless little mud err muggle but since slick rick showed up on the scene you haventstood a chance with her and you know it i ve seen them ducking into broom closets and empty classrooms why what ron ejaculated oh come on said pansy are you blind or just unwilling to see the truth dontyou know what that pair get up to right under your very nose ron fumed in silence trying to contain the unpleasant visions and emotions that pansy had brought boiling to the surface she had just verbalised his own suspicions and there was nothing he could counter with well thanks for enlightening me said ron you ve really made my day he turned to leave not knowing if he could hold his feelings in for much longer and he was damned if he was going to let a slytherin see him cry wait said pansy placing a gentle hand on his shoulder to stop him you donthave to put up with that git rick if you dontwant to you could help to get him out of the way you know what said ron suddenly turning help who let just say that that you re not the only one at hogwarts with their nose out of joint over rick godfry he made a lot of enemies in slytherin and almost every wizard in this school is sick to death of the way all the witches swoon over him why i one of the few witches who can see right through that charming phoney facade said pansy lying through her teeth so what are you planning to do about him asked ron fearing that pansy was trying to drag him into a murder plot as much as he hated godfry he would never get involved in anything like that oh dontworry replied pansy sensing his nervousness nothing too drastic we just want him out of here and fast the plan is to rough him up a bit with a few hexes let him know that he no longer welcome at hogwarts and then portkey him to somewhere in deepest darkest africa far away from civilization without his wand of course added pansy with an evil grin on her face in the unlikely event that he stupid enough to try returning to hogwarts said pansy which would take him weeks umbridge would just expel him for having left the school without permission she hates him and wouldntbelieve a word of it if he tried telling her what had really happened the plan is perfect gloated pansy so why are you telling me all this asked ron well you must have noticed explained pansy that godfry is rather powerful and he seems to have some kind of sixth sense so the whole plan hinges on catching him unawares with a stunning spell and the safest way of doing that is to catch him in his sleep oh no protested ron holding up his hands in front of him i not trying that you re right about him having a sixth sense and i not sneaking up on him even if he is asleep or pretending to be calm down ron said pansy i not asking you to stun him all i asking you to do is to help me get into your dormitory so that i can do it i ll be under an invisibility cloak so i wontbe seen i ve learnt a silent stunning spell no one will even wake up especially godfry then i ll throw another invisibility cloak over him and levitate him out you ll never see him again wait said ron the penny finally dropping you want me to give you the password to the gryffindor common room right obviously said pansy how else can i get to your dormitory and how do i know that you or anyone else for that matter wont just attack harry or me or anyone else demanded ron because replied pansy i swear a wizard oath which you know cant be broken that i will be the only one entering your common room and that i wonttouch potter or you or anyone else in your dormitory ron was clearly uneasy so pansy added then tomorrow morning you can change the password but ron was still uneasy about giving the gryffindor password to a slytherin sure he hated godfry but he was no traitor no he said finally after wrestling with his conflicting emotions i wontdo it but pansy had not given up yet she was a master manipulator and she knew that she just about had him what if i offered you a small favour in return she asked like what asked ron suspiciously well i have no idea why but you seem to fancy granger she ll be out of hogwarts at the end of this term and back with her muggle family i sure you know what kind of dangers she will face she ll be practically defenceless what are you trying to say are you threatening hermione asked ron angrily let just say that she made some enemies during her time at hogwarts began pansy like malfoy spat ron exactly agreed pansy enemies who might want to take revenge once she away from here and vulnerable so what exactly is this favour you re offering asked ron if you help us get rid of godfry we ll leave your little mud err muggle friend alone to enjoy living like a muggle again in peace and quiet it really a very simple choice said pansy who do you want to save godfry or granger ok said ron finally i ll do it pansy smiled inwardly she was very pleased with herself it had just been so easy and darling draco was going to be so pleased with her just after midnight the portrait of the fat lady swung open and a figure emerged from the gryffindor common room hidden beneath an invisibility cloak it gently guided its stunned victim lying beneath another invisibility cloak if the fat lady thought anything of it she kept her thoughts to herself in fact she was quite used to having to open at all hours for invisible witches and wizards and thought no more about it it was all just part of the job draco malfoy waited impatiently in a small dungeon he was really looking forward to this he was feeling quite euphoric actually the events of the past few weeks had entirely rearranged the power structure at hogwarts the purebloods were now on top where they rightfully belonged slytherins being the only purely pureblood house were therefore considered the pureblood elite then there were the members of the inquisitorial squad they were the elite of slytherin draco had just been appointed commandant of the inquisitorial squad his silver i was bigger than everyone else s his father as executive governor just about owned the school and that pathetic umbridge did exactly what she was told next year of course draco would be named head boy but really he was already to all intents and purposes yes life was very sweet right now draco felt powerful like a king and he was going to enjoy using his power the door to the dungeon swung open for a moment and then closed again draco watched as pansy parkinson head suddenly appeared in mid air followed by the rest of her the smug grin on her face told him that her mission had been successful pansy whipped away the other invisibility cloak from the prone figure hovering beside her ah well if it isntmy very favourite little mudblood drawled draco observing his stunned bushy haired victim all right you can go now pansy said draco what arentyou even going to thank me draco asked pansy pouting it was my brilliant plan and my masterful manipulation of that weasley jerk that got us the gryffindor password he was just like a puppet on a string you owe me big time draco well i ve got to admit pansy replied draco you are one cunning conniving witch and i glad you re on my side you re a credit to slytherin well thanks draco said pansy it so nice to feel appreciated but remember we made a deal i deliver granger and you invite me as your date on the next hogsmeade weekend ok ok said draco becoming impatient you ll get your date now get out of here i ve waited a long time for this moment and i dontwish to wait any longer enjoy yourself smirked pansy as she left the dungeon much as she disliked the little know it all mudblood she did not want to think about what was about to happen to her pansy was a pureblood to her bones she understood that power was everything and draco had it lots of it in time he would become one of the most socially and politically powerful wizards and she was planning to share that power with him pansy had lots of cunning plans but her ultimate plan was to become the next mrs malfoy she wasntabout to let soft heartedness or scruples get in her way she was a witch with a mission draco meanwhile had locked the dungeon door and placed a silencing charm on the dungeon finite incantatum he said pointing his wand at hermione she immediately fell unconscious to the hard dungeon floor as the levitation spell was removed not taking any chances draco magically chained hermione to the dungeon wall before removing the stunning spell saying ennervate hermione opened her eyes the first thing she saw was malfoy leaning back on a chair a few feet in front of her leering she tried to move but couldn t then she saw that she was chained to the dungeon wall by her wrists and ankles she shivered in her thin pyjamas surely she must be dreaming the last thing she could recall was climbing into her snug four poster bed and going to sleep this must be some kind of nightmare she thought draco heart was thumping in his chest now he understood how it felt to be a death eater closing in on some helpless victim the adrenalin was surging through his veins the feeling of power was intoxicating he was going to take this nice and slowly enjoy every moment of it i hope you re afraid mudblood he said you ought to be very afraid hermione realised with absolute certainty that this was no dream it was real fear like she had never felt in her life twisted her stomach into a tight knot she had difficulty breathing her whole body was tense with terror she kept silent well well sneered draco the little know it all mudblood who can never keep her foul mouth shut seems lost for words well that fine with me i didntbring you here for a friendly chat you know what did you bring me here for asked hermione nervously guess said draco grinning evilly hermione stayed quiet she didntwant to think about it her sense of foreboding was rapidly increasing you know i ve hated you since the day you arrived at this school you uppity little mudblood thinking that memorising a bunch of spells and reading every book in the library would make you a witch put you on a par with us purebloods you think you re so clever because you always come top of everything he said getting angry his voice growing gradually louder well it not your place to come top of anything for five years i ve had to listen to my father lectures about how he was always top of every subject about how a malfoy must always come first about how disgraceful it was that i allowed myself to be bettered by a mudblood draco was livid with fury by now his face red and blotchy well it payback time little miss mudblood he said rising to his feet when i finished with you you wontbe good for anything ever again not for you dear little friend potty or maybe it that upstart godfry now he probably another mudblood but dontbe concerned for your future you didnthave one anyway i mean you didntreally think that the dark lord would allow mudblood filth like you to survive once all you mudbloods are thrown out of hogwarts you ll be defenceless easy prey and pleasure for his death eaters i ll be doing you a favour said draco in a sinister tone you should be grateful i going to save you from all that you see you wontbe leaving this dungeon alive hermione froze in fear at malfoy words they werentjust idle threats when he mentioned rick she thought to herself oh rick rick where are you now when i need you but before i finish you off i going to have a little fun with you mudblood said draco coming closer i going to teach you your last lesson at hogwarts although it should have been your first i going to teach you your place i going to teach you who in charge here and exactly what little mudbloods like you are good for he raised his wand grinning why dontyou beg me for mercy mudblood it wontdo you any good but it might amuse me hermione knew that this was the end there was no hope left she was helpless malfoy would take whatever terrible revenge on her he pleased and then he would kill her well she was not going to go down grovelling before him you re very brave malfoy she said with me chained helplessly to the wall and you with your wand that hardly fair we malfoys dontplay fair he smiled wickedly we play to win and we always win in the end i always knew you were evil malfoy but i never imagined that even you were capable of committing murder in cold blood when you attempted to poison harry and me you were obviously following orders from your father and voldemort but this is different this is simply for your own twisted pleasure have you not a trace of humanity in you you just dontget it do you mudblood sneered malfoy you mudbloods arentlike us you re vermin killing you isnt murder it just pest control we purebloods are a higher species you re merely our quarry killing you isntmurder it sport you re a but hermione never got to tell draco what he was the door was blown off of its hinges and in the doorway standing in his pyjamas was an enraged rick draco didntsee him he didnt have time to turn before the curse hit him he was lifted from his feet and hurled unconscious against the dungeon wall rick walked over to hermione and making her chains disappear lifted her into his arms he didntuse his wand in fact he d forgotten it in his haste to get to her hermione fainted in his arms rick wondered if he could just apparate with her back to the gryffindor common room he was fairly sure that he could apparate another person with him but he was worried that the hogwarts anti apparition wards would prevent him from doing it in the castle the last thing he wanted was to splinch hermione she had suffered enough already so rick decided to do it the slow way carrying hermione lightened by a levitation charm back to gryffindor tower in his arms he had considered taking her to madam pomfrey but hogwarts had become so insecure that he didntwant to leave her unprotected in the hospital wing not that draco malfoy would be causing any further trouble tonight when he reached the common room rick placed her carefully on a couch by the fire waving a hand at it to make it roar into life he summoned a blanket from his bed to wrap her in and a robe for himself rick decided it would be better to wait for hermione to regain consciousness naturally rather than ennervate her he could sense her fear and he knew that she must be traumatised even though it appeared that he d gotten to her in time before she d been physically harmed when hermione opened her eyes she saw that she was sitting in the gryffindor common room with rick beside her she threw her arms around him and began heaving great sobs on his shoulder rick held her he directed thoughts of calm and comfort towards her maybe it time he thought to let loose the feelings i ve been holding back for so long he knew it was what hermione needed now to recover from the trauma she was suffering hermione felt the loving feelings washing over her they felt so warm making her feel safe and secure they drove out all the fear and terror that she had been feeling she didntreally understand what it was but she knew that it was coming from rick and she wanted to let it to fill her suffuse her and take away all the pain and hurt they sat hugging like that for a long time without speaking hermione could still remember all the events in the dungeon with malfoy but now they didntseem to touch her anymore finally she said you saved me rick again he smiled at her and simply said you called me and i came i called you she asked yes smiled rick i was asleep when i heard you call out oh rick rick where are you now when i need you so i came but rick that not possible said hermione feeling confused i mean yes i did say that or think it to myself at least but you had blown open the door of the dungeon less than a minute afterwards i mean how could you have heard my thoughts in your sleep and how could you have known where i was and how could you have gotten there so fast she asked i was in a hurry he grinned in fact as soon as rick was awoken from his sleep by hermione plea for help he had immediately projected his marauders map and checked her dormitory but she wasntthere so he started searching for her it didnt take long because he began at the slytherin common room and the dungeon where draco was holding her was nearby before hermione could demand a proper explanation however ron came down the stairs and spotting them together on the couch began yelling at hermione hermione what the hell do you think you re doing down here with him you ve got to go back to your dorm now it not safe to be here with him he he s putting you in danger i cantexplain it but it not safe casting pleadingly looks at her ron implored please get away from him and go to your dorm please just trust me and go ron sighed hermione when are you going to stop this rubbish about rick he just saved my life he saved me from draco malfoy what are you talking about asked ron becoming uneasy i dontknow how he got me there said hermione one minute i was asleep in my bed the next i was in a dungeon chained to a wall with malfoy saying he was going to do all sorts of horrible things to me and then kill me if rick hadntrescued me i would probably be dead by now or at least praying that death would come soon she said bursting into tears as the memories came flooding back malfoy he he didntdo anything to you did he hermione ron asked desperately no said hermione through her tears rick arrived just in time i donteven want to think about what would have happened if if but she couldntcarry on rick wrapped his arms around her directing loving feelings towards her again while hermione had been talking rick had been probing ron mind he now knew the full story ron was distraught he knew exactly how hermione had ended up in the dungeon but how could pansy have broken her wizard oath he wondered she said i wonttouch potter or you or anyone else in your dormitory of course she didntsay anything about anyone else or any other dorms the plan had been to take hermione all along what a fool i was those slytherins are so sneaky and pansy parkinson has to be the sneakiest slytherin of them all hermione had stopped her crying now rick treatment had done the job again rick stared deeply into ron eyes and said maybe it time for a confession ron and an apology not just to hermione but to me too what are you t talking about said ron trying to look away do you want to confess the whole story to hermione or shall i tell her who betrayed her asked rick but i didntmean to betray her cried ron in despair pansy was meant to take me said rick with a wry grin pansy used your jealousy and hatred of me to make you do something that you would never have done if you were thinking clearly take a good look at yourself ron and see where your hatred and jealousy have gotten you and how they allowed you to be duped by your worst enemies what this all about demanded hermione not being privy to the contents of ron mind like rick and ron himself come on ron said rick confession is good for the soul confess and you never know you might be forgiven ron reluctantly told the whole sordid story of how pansy had tricked him when he had finished he begged hermione to forgive him you know i refused everything she tried to tempt me with it was only when she said that your life would be spared that i finally agreed oh ron said hermione getting up and throwing her arms around him i know you wanted to save me and i know your intentions were good but cantyou see how pansy used your hatred of rick to fool you no said ron who still couldntsee it ron said hermione you ve got a brilliant mind you re unbeatable at wizard chess because you can think so logically but sometimes you just get some idea about something or a prejudice against someone and then you totally lose the ability to be rational about it i dontsee what that has to do with pansy and objected ron not wanting to concede the truth of which hermione had just spoken what exactly was there to guarantee that i d be spared if you gave pansy the password interrupted hermione did she swear a wizard oath on that did you consider that once inside the gryffindor common room pansy could have taken whomever she chose except for you harry neville seamus and dean or that she could have done anything she liked to anyone umm no conceded ron and do you know why you didntthink about those things do you know why your powers of rational thought failed you because she wound you up about rick she played on your hatred and jealousy and as soon as those feelings got the better of you you stopped thinking oh ron why cantyou see it she cried in desperation ron didntsay anything he just stared at the floor for a long time but finally he did see it please review chapter 8 the haunted house of malfoy hermione wanted to stay in gryffindor tower the next morning she felt too insecure to walk about the hogwarts corridors rick was trying to convince her not to be intimidated by malfoy you know how i heard you calling me last night from the dungeon he said well i think there some kind of umm well link between us rick said blushing what do you mean asked hermione i mean if you re in trouble or need me i think i ll know it and i ll come to you i mean that what happened last night but after i had been err comforting you and err holding you afterwards in the common room it seemed like the link became a lot stronger what do you mean by a link asked hermione becoming curious do you have this link with harry or anyone else well no said rick not that particular kind of link no what kind of link is it then persisted hermione rick sighed this was getting difficult for lots of reasons hermione i know this is going to sound stupid he said and i know how much it annoys you that i hide things from you but the truth is that there are lots of things that even i dontunderstand about myself so you donthave any idea what this mysterious link is asked hermione getting annoyed at rick typical evasiveness umm i do have an idea said rick but i could be wrong of course so tell me what your idea is then asked hermione finally pinning him down i think it because of the way i err feel about you i like you a lot hermione said rick blushing oh rick said hermione not knowing what to say she could have said that she liked him a lot too because she did but she wasnt sure if she should say it she wasntsure what to say or do about the way she felt about him it was all so far removed from her experience and reading rick was in a real quandary his feelings for hermione were starting to overwhelm him he found himself thinking about her all the time wanting to get closer to her a lot closer he had to keep reminding himself that he was here for a purpose a very important purpose and he could not afford to allow himself to be sidetracked the great witches and wizards of the light had put a great deal of themselves into him they had pinned their hopes for the future of wizardkind on him so much was riding on him the future of so many good people no he didnthave time for romance he must not allow himself to become besotted with hermione he had to stay focused on his great task he had to commit all his energies to the purpose for which he had been sent to this world i have to be strong rick told himself firmly umm hermione said rick trying to steer things away from the unfortunate direction they had taken if we all stay together you me harry and ron i think that after what happened last night ron may be willing to accept me now we can all look after each other i know you take a few classes that no one else does but i can walk you to and from those classes and monitor you when you re alone in them if there are any problems i can be there in a flash what do you mean by be there in a flash suddenly hermione eyes opened wide as she stared at rick in astonishment you ve been apparating around hogwarts haventyou that how you beat us to potions that first day and how you got down to a dungeon which must be a good five minutes run from gryffindor tower in less than a minute but rick i know that it simply not possible it stated unequivocally in hogwarts a history on page 678 and on pages 978 1205 and 1634 added rick with a grin great book but desperately in need of an update hermione was shocked how can you know all that it took me four years to memorise that book and you ve only been here four weeks and i ve never even seen you reading it she demanded in righteous outrage good memory said rick modestly look hermione you re a bit sharper than harry and ron you seem to pick up stuff about me that they miss i know it hard to hide things from your friends and i really dontwant to upset things between you but could you please do me a favour and not tell them or anyone what you figure out about me err like the apparating please just trust me the more i keep secret the better it will be for all of us ok hermione looked at rick for a long time the more she learned about him the more mysteries there were it just seemed endless trying to unravel him hermione could not stand mysteries she had to know everything it was just so annoying rick was just so annoying but she really liked him oh what was she going to do ok she said finally i ll keep your secrets for now come on let grab harry and ron and get some breakfast over the next few weeks the hogwarts students began to get organised the inquisitorial squad had become a pureblood vigilante gang hexing anyone they didntlike with impunity their favourite targets of course were the muggle borns the resistance to them began with the sixth year gryffindors they started moving about the corridors in a single group wherever possible and always made certain that any likely targets amongst them like hermione and dean thomas also muggle born were never alone rick was happy to see harry come out of his shell and get involved at last harry had found something he could do to defy his enemies instead of just sitting and waiting for them to attack ron was also active in the resistance he was their logistics expert he analysed the class timetables of each year and helped to organise them to move about in groups to protect themselves especially the muggle borns ravenclaw and hufflepuff inspired by the resistance shown by the gryffindors to draco malfoy and his gang of slytherin thugs followed the gryffindor lead they emulated ron strategy of forming protective groups at each year level when moving around the castle most of the non slytherin purebloods had not shared in the slytherins delight at lucius malfoy plans for hogwarts they might be proud of their pureblood heritage but that didntmake them pureblood racists not all of the slytherins were pureblood racists either but they were outnumbered by their housemates and had to at least pay lip service to the pureblood power ideology hogwarts under albus dumbledore had nurtured an attitude of tolerance witches and wizards were judged not by their blood or their ancestors but by what they made of themselves what was important was their own personal qualities and the magical powers they developed for this reason most of the students did not easily succumb to the influence of umbridge and lucius malfoy the students were not alone their professors were as supportive and protective as possible they were all extremely upset with the new regime under umbridge and lucius malfoy but they couldntact too overtly against them for fear of being dismissed and thus leaving their students even more vulnerable professor mcgonagall however didntneed to be careful she was only there until a replacement transfiguration teacher could be found she was a very powerful witch and as long as she remained at hogwarts draco malfoy and his fellow thugs wouldntdare try anything when she was around mcgonagall was proud of the hogwarts students at the way they were all standing up to the insufferable umbridge and her inquisitorial squad not that umbridge was doing very much herself she wasntinterfering or bombarding them with educational decrees as she had done the previous year she seemed to be keeping a low profile and leaving the inquisitorial squad a free hand at their bullying harry potter had become the leader and figurehead of the resistance the other students not only the gryffindors looked up to him and drew strength from his defiant example they all knew that he was marked and that his future was bleak that the odds were heavily stacked against him if he wasntgiving up then neither were they the student resistance was so strong now with gryffindors ravenclaws and hufflepuffs united against the inquisitorial squad that they could no longer attack openly in the corridors of hogwarts as they would soon be heavily outnumbered they resorted instead to sneak attacks one monday morning when harry hermione rick and dean were on their way down to snape dungeon for potions rick scanning ahead as usual spotted an ambush there were four of them two on each side of the corridor concealed behind heavy drapes rick whispered to the others to dive when he told them at his signal the four gryffindors hit the ground the hexes flung by the inquisitorial squad flew over them hitting the two on the opposite side draco malfoy pansy parkinson theodore nott and blaise zabini didnt make it to potions that day they spent the next two days in the hospital wing recovering from the messes that they had made of each other the next ambush was better planned draco and his thugs there were seven of them this time were all on the same side of the corridor again concealed behind a heavy drape the corridor lay between gryffindor tower and the great hall the plan was to lay some hexes on potter and his fan club on the way to breakfast they couldntuse anything lethal like the unforgivable curses so openly but they had some very nasty hexes ready for them rick almost missed them as he approached with the other sixth year gryffindors he was thinking about hermione again instead of staying focused and checking what lay ahead harry was in the lead when draco and his gang jumped out from their hiding place hurling hexes furiously rick barely managed to get a reflecting shield up in time it was a very close call the gryffindors reacted quickly turning and pointing their wands at their attackers but before they could cast a curse in anger the members of the inquisitorial squad were writhing in agony on the floor they were experiencing the effects of their own nasty hexes hurled back at them with double the original power by rick reflecting shield the gryffindors looked at each other in confusion wondering who had made such a mess of malfoy and his mates harry and ron were both pretty sure that rick must have done it but they knew by now to keep quiet hermione caught rick eye before he looked innocently down at the floor she had no doubt at all rick however was feeling anything but innocent damn it he thought i have to stop thinking about hermione all the time this is not what i here for the next time it could cost harry his life i have to get hermione out of my head i just have too he told himself but somehow he didntfeel very convinced for all his awesome magical powers rick was just like any other sixteen year old boy in love he might know what he should do but overcoming his powerful emotions and doing it was another matter entirely draco malfoy and his six friends spent the rest of the week in the hospital wing he couldntfigure out how potter and his fan club had managed to foil his attack yet again he was becoming afraid of their power and decided against further attacks on them at least draco never found out who had attacked him that night down in the dungeon as he was about to take his revenge upon the mudblood granger he was pretty sure it must have been potter there had probably been a whole bunch of them weasley obviously wasntas stupid as he looked he thought not that that was possible mind you he must have alerted the others to what pansy was up to potter was probably waiting under his own invisibility cloak when she entered their common room damn pansy he just couldntrely on anyone to do anything properly not even pansy with all her sly cunning he had given her a tongue lashing and had called off the date to hogsmeade still his father and the dark lord had plans for potter final plans yes maybe he would leave potter for them to deal with once potter was safely out of the way it would be open season for the inquisitorial squad in the mean time he could at least enjoy taunting potty and his pathetic little fan club that was a pleasure he excelled in the following week the gryffindor and slytherin sixth years were making their way towards hagrid hut for care of magical creatures which they still took together much to their mutual dislike hagrid had been replaced by professor grubbly plank soon after umbridge arrival but care of magical creatures was still held outside hagrid hut as it was near to the magical creature enclosures well if it isntlittle pot head with his mudblood trash sneered draco be sure to enjoy the fresh air and sunshine while you still can that is he said with an evil laugh ron was already reaching for his wand but rick and harry grabbed him before he could attack draco ron said hermione with a calm dignity dontlower yourself to malfoy level leave him alone in the gutter where he belongs the gryffindors all sniggered at draco brave words filthy mudblood keep up your mindless ranting while you can because you haventgot much longer draco snarled back at her in anger hermione turned and glared at him hard you dontscare me malfoy you re just a little wimp oh but it the dark lord that you should be afraid of little mudblood very very afraid he added darkly with a horrible sneer on his face you wontescape your fate you ll get what you deserve hermione was not going to be intimidated by malfoy well i not scared of your dark lord she said raising her chin as far as i concerned your dark lord is nothing but a dark fraud draco gasped he was outraged to hear his master insulted like this the slytherins were all in shock even some of the gryffindors felt uncomfortable it was as if hermione had broken some sacred taboo but harry was delighted with the effect of hermione words on malfoy hermione right he nothing but a fraud and all you brave purebloods cower before him like timid little mice he said derisively shut up potter screamed draco appalled at this sacrilege you dont even know what you re talking about oh but i do said harry finally overcoming the fear of his memories he continued i was there in the graveyard at little hangleton at the end of fourth year when voldemort summoned his death eaters your father was there malfoy and he was cringing and grovelling before voldemort just like the rest of them he not even a pureblood did you know that voldemort or tom riddle i should say that his real name had a muggle father he a mixed blood wizard under your father reforms he wouldnteven be allowed into hogwarts now what a joke and yet all his pureblood death eaters bow down before him like slaves malfoy remained silent with rage why you re too scared to even say his name arentyou teased harry enjoying himself go on malfoy say it it vol de mort but he should be called mouldy pork you know i ve seem him and that what he looks like a rancid maggot infested blob of mouldy pork draco was too angry to speak for a few moments that enough potter you will pay for this he finally said trembling with rage and what are you going to do about it asked harry stepping closer to him i know why dontyou challenge me to a wizard duel to defend the honour of your precious mouldy pork no harry cried hermione fearfully he ll cheat you know he will oh no he won t said ron this will be a formal wizard duel it a kind of magical contract and it not possible to cheat right i harry second go on ferret face name your second i really going to enjoy this yeah said harry let see if you have the guts to face me in a fair fight one on one without daddy death eater or your inquisitorial idiots to hide behind come on then show us the malfoy pureblood power he taunted draco turned a ghastly white he was trapped there was no way he was going to face potter in a fair fight everyone gryffindors and slytherins were looking at him expectantly waiting for him to respond to the challenge finally he thrust his chin arrogantly in the air saying i d like nothing better than the chance to finish you off potter but someone else has already reserved that pleasure dontworry you wonthave long to wait he added trying to hide his cowardice with his snide tone but he wasntfooling anyone not even the slytherins the following evening as they were finishing their meal professor umbridge appeared at the gryffindor table hem hem she said potter i want to see you what what for asked harry nervously you ll find out dontworry she said in a less than reassuring voice hurry up and finish eating i will be waiting for you through there she said indicating the door to the room next to the teachers table where harry had gone after his name had come out of the goblet of fire dontkeep me waiting she added and turned to leave oh harry cried hermione i dontlike this at all i have a really bad feeling about it yeah me too added ron maybe we should all dash back to gryffindor tower or find mcgonagall or something i ll just have to go said harry there no escaping umbridge in this castle what will come will come he said trying to hide his fear and apprehension harry wanted to put on a brave face for his friends but he certainly didntfeel very brave he was filled with foreboding events were spinning out of control he gripped his wand through his robes and giving hermione and ron one final glace he walked off to meet umbridge helplessly they watched him until he entered the room and closed the door behind him the headmistress was standing by the fire when harry entered ah potter she said disdainfully you know i did try to teach you some discipline last year but unfortunately you wouldntlearn you are still quite out of control expelliarmus came the spell from behind harry his wand was ripped from his hand and he was thrown hard against the wall falling in a heap on the floor standing over him pointing his wand down at him while tucking harry wand into his robes was lucius malfoy looking extremely pleased with himself at his side stood a gloating draco malfoy thank you headmistress you may go said lucius brusquely dismissing her umbridge uttered a small hem hem as she obediently left the room well potter how nice to see you again purred lucius keeping his wand trained on harry chest as he lay sprawled on the floor and i sure you can guess who else is very keen to see you again father said draco canti have a little fun with him before you take him away this is my last chance i ve wanted to use the cruciatus curse on him for five years now and anyway i need to practice it before i receive my initiation from the dark lord as much as i d like to indulge you and allow you a little sport draco his father replied the dark lord instructed that potter is to be brought to him unharmed and he is not lenient with those who disobey him no i wontallow anything to spoil this my moment of triumph this will be the highlight of my career as a death eater handing our lord his mortal enemy the one who stands between him and immortality he said his voice rising in anticipation oh yes draco he continued rapturously the dark lord will reward me with great power and privilege and finally i shall be his undisputed lieutenant this will be remembered as one of the great events in the history of the malfoys at that moment all the candles in the room spluttered and the fire died down as a cold wave swept through the room the candles and fire returned quickly to their normal state but the cold shivery presence remained lucius looked about wildly but there was nothing to see who is that who are you what are you he demanded why a ghost of course replied a spectral rasping voice which seemed to be coming from nowhere in particular and yet from everywhere draco jumped behind his father in fright clinging to his arm well i not afraid of ghosts spat lucius i quite used to them and anyway you have no real power in the world of the living he added turning his wand back on harry anyway you dont look like much of a ghost to me i canteven see you he added dismissively ah replied the ghost that because i am a very special ghost and i have very special powers even in the world of the living whose ghost are you asked lucius beginning to lose a little of his confidence the ghost of one of the founders of this very school which founder from my voice it should be obvious that it wasnta witch founder laughed the ghost enjoying the pun so that leaves just two possibilities salazar slytherin asked lucius hopefully no godric gryffindor at your service now look i rather busy right now i donthave time for these games perhaps you would care to come back at a more convenient time said lucius anxious now that his great mission might be placed in jeopardy by this ghost or whatever it was well actually this is a most convenient time for me what exactly do you mean asked lucius attempting to sound more confident of the situation than in fact he felt i mean that i ve come here expressly to prevent you from abducting one of my gryffindors well you cantprevent me doing anything no matter whose ghost you are or claim to be you have no power to interfere in our realm now be gone before i teach you the consequences of meddling with a malfoy harry meanwhile had sat up on the floor attempting to figure out what was going on was it possible that this really was the ghost of godric gryffindor was there hope for him yet with what were you planning to teach me lucius malfoy stared in horror at his empty hand where is my wand dont worry you wontbe needing it lucius immediately drew harry wand from his pocket but before he could even point it at harry it flew up in the air and landed in harry hand harry immediately pointed it at draco and said expelliarmus draco flew back against the wall as harry caught his flying wand which he pocketed before getting up from the floor and pointing his wand menacingly at lucius malfoy well it looks like there been a bit of a glitch in your plans for this evening mr malfoy grinned harry well done harry you re a credit to your house well err to my house really but you can put your wand away for now why dont the three of you sit down and make yourselves comfortable i thought we might have a little fireside chat harry did as he was asked but lucius was making a dash for the door he suddenly stopped and flew back through the air landing neatly in an armchair by the fire draco lying groggily on the floor where harry spell had thrown him also came sailing through the air to land in the chair next to his father they attempted to struggle out of their chairs at first until they discovered that they couldn t it so very nice of you to join me lucius you know you should feel greatly honoured you are one of the main reasons for my coming back to visit my old school after these thousand years i keep in touch with the other founders you know well rowena and helga at least salazar is still a bit peeved about us ganging up on him over a difference of opinion and keeps pretty much to himself which suits the rest of us quite nicely we three founders are very concerned with what you and this chap riddle are attempting to do to our school so we decided that it time to put a stop to it and to you me are you going to kill me he asked in panic no no that wontbe necessary and anyway we re in no hurry for you to turn up in our realm believe me no we had a bit of a think about it and decided upon a suitable punishment for you one that would fit your crimes and ensure that you dontcommit any more and what punishment is that asked lucius nervously fearing that it might be some kind of super powerful cruciatus curse oh it wonthurt a bit squibbus there all done i ve just cast our new spell on you and you didntfeel a thing what exactly is this spell asked lucius nervously what does it do oh it really rather clever said the ghost happily it was rowena idea she such a brilliant witch you know it called the squibbus spell but surely you can guess what it does what shrieked lucius in disbelief trying but failing to get up that impossible my master spent years searching for such a spell and he assured me that it not possible no it not possible for your vile master most fortunately nor is it possible for anyone in your realm in fact i believe that i am the only sentient being or perhaps i should say sentient been he chortled who can perform this spell i dontbelieve you it not possible cried lucius desperately unwilling to allow himself to think the unthinkable well to be perfectly honest neither am i you see this is the very first time that it has ever been cast you should feel greatly honoured you know why you ll probably be in all history books you ll be famous in a somewhat ignominious sort of way but i very anxious to know if it worked so would you be kind enough to try some magic draco wand floated out from harry robes and landed in his father hand he immediately pointed it at harry and said crucio harry tensed up for a moment but when nothing happened he grinned at lucius and said not even an itchy nose lucius panicked he tried a summoning spell on a book but it didntcome he tried lumos but not a flicker came from the wand finally in desperation he tried wingardium leviosa on a piece of parchment but it didntbudge wonderful absolutely wonderful it works perfectly rowena is so ingenious dontyou agree he said delightedly how long exactly does this spell last for whispered lucius fearfully forever it permanent absolutely permanent i couldntreverse it even if i wanted to you mr malfoy are a squib lucius was totally stunned his life was over as the appalling reality sank in his stiff upper lip began to quiver the blood drained from his face which turned a pallid white his hands began trembling uncontrollably this was without question the most terrible and shameful moment of his life in one calamitous moment he had been reduced from a proud and powerful pureblood who stood at the pinnacle of wizarding society to a thing which he utterly despised and loathed a squib i know things must seem quite bad right now but they could be a lot worse you know however do you mean mumbled lucius he had sunk into a deep depression and was finding it difficult to think clearly his mind wanted to shut down to self destruct rather than acknowledge the terrible truth of the detestable thing that he had become well you re a wealthy man mr malfoy i suggest that you convert some of your gold into muggle money and disappear into some very obscure part of the muggle world like mongolia but why would i want to do that he asked in befuddlement well firstly you re going to have to live in the muggle world you re a squib now remember secondly i believe that you have just failed your master in a most important mission one that is very dear to his heart or whatever he has in lieu of one he not the forgiving type i sure you ve noticed a quick painful death is probably the very best you could hope for thirdly i believe that your master has a rather low opinion of squibs such as yourself he and your former fellow death eaters plan to exterminate them dontthey lucius malfoy cringed in fear as the import of the ghost words sank in yes i would attempt to get very far away and very fast if i were you but there is also another matter to consider as i said things could be worse a lot worse how asked lucius morosely unable to imagine how things could possibly get any worse than they were right now how many centuries old is the malfoy family we can trace our ancestors back to the time of merlin and draco is the sole heir to the house of malfoy why yes replied lucius nervously you see the squibbus curse not only renders the witch or wizard a squib it also guarantees that their future progeny will also be squibs both malfoys fell silent as the spectre of the end of the house of malfoy loomed large before them if i were to squib young draco here the house of malfoy would become a house of muggles forever lucius and draco gasped in horror but you cantdo that dracohasntdone anything oh yes but he has replied the ghost i ve been keeping an eye on events here at hogwarts for some time now young draco has been bullying and leading attacks on other students particularly the muggle born students he attempted to fatally poison two of my gryffindors as you well know he also recently attempted to take a most terrible revenge upon a gryffindor witch all such behaviour must end if there is any recurrence of this kind of behaviour against any witch or wizard of any hogwarts house including his own i will immediately squib draco if he has anything at all to do with voldemort or his death eaters i will squib him the same goes for mrs malfoy she is to cut all ties with voldemort and his death eaters and if so much as another malfoy knut should end up in the minister of magic pockets or his gringotts vault both mother and son will share your fate i do hope you understand me the ghostly voice paused pointedly to let the gravity of its words sink in before continuing good i think that concludes our conversation draco you will need to escort your father back to malfoy manor so that he can arrange his affairs and be gone he ll need your help without magic he wonteven be able to find his own house and draco i sure that you would prefer to keep the somewhat embarrassing events of tonight secret for as long as possible harry i would also ask you to ensure that what has happened in this room tonight does not become common knowledge at hogwarts with that the ghost seemed to have gone draco and his father hurried quickly from the room studiously avoiding harry ron and hermione jumped up and ran over to harry as he entered the gryffindor common room hermione lunged at him almost knocking him to the floor as she threw her arms around him hugging him desperately tears of joy and relief running down her face ron put an arm around harry shoulders pulling him close he too seemed close to tears you ve no idea how worried we ve been mate he said with feeling oh harry harry cried hermione we were so afraid that we d never see you again it been just awful waiting here but you re ok she said joyfully dragging him over to their corner spot tell us what happened as they were sitting down rick came down the stairs from the boys dormitories yawning where have you been asked ron asleep said rick but when i went up to the dorm looking for you when we got back from dinner you werentthere said ron no i dashed off to the library after dinner i needed to look something up for our potions assignment explained rick but i became really tired potions does that to me so i came back for a nap i saw you and hermione sitting over here but i went straight up to the dormitory i was so tired why were you looking for me anyway he asked well because of harry of course said hermione didntyou hear umbridge tell harry to meet her after the meal she asked err no said rick i must have already gone to the library what happened harry he asked with concern harry proceeded to tell them the whole unbelievable story of how umbridge had merely been a decoy to allow lucius malfoy to stun him it was his worst nightmare come true lucius malfoy was to deliver him over to voldemort then just when he had given up all hope the ghost of godric gryffindor came dramatically to his rescue hermione ron and rick sat listening wordlessly until he finished his incredible tale then there was silence hermione was the first to speak what lucius malfoy said about ghosts having no real power in this realm is correct all the books say the same thing their only means of interference is through threats and instilling fear but they cantactually physically do things it like they are not quite in the same dimension as us she explained well the ghost of godric gryffindor was definitely in the same dimension as the malfoys grinned harry no doubt about it he said that he was a special kind of ghost maybe there are different kinds they may not all be like nearly headless nick and moaning myrtle and the other ones around here that dontseem to do very much it true that there are different kinds conceded hermione but i ve never read anything about any ghost that could act in the world of the living hermione smiled rick when are you going to realise that just because a book says that something is impossible it doesntnecessarily make it impossible books arentinfallible you know yeah agreed ron i ve been telling her that for years now but you know this is too good to be true lucius malfoy turned into a squib i cantthink of anyone more deserving i cantwait to tell my dad you can t said harry the ghost asked me not to spread the news around so we have to keep this secret to ourselves yes he right said hermione ron you re just going to have to control yourself and not taunt malfoy about it but dont worry she grinned i expect he ll be on his best behaviour from now on please take a few moments to leave a review chapter 9 the rise and rise of the resistance assisting his squib father in beginning life as a muggle was a most salutary lesson for draco the malfoy family was at the pinnacle of the magical aristocracy to be turned into a despised squib with no more magic than a loathsome muggle was the most shameful humiliation imaginable lucius malfoy had sunk into a deep depression he would never dare show his face in wizarding society ever again his own wife and son were embarrassed in his presence and it was clear that they wanted him as far away as possible and as quickly as possible perhaps this odious and shameful calamity could be hushed up narcissa malfoy fearful that draco could suffer the same terrible fate as his father instructed him forcefully to resign from the inquisitorial squad break off friendships with anyone close to the death eaters and to keep his nose clean and his head down the very future of the malfoy dynasty hung in the balance when he returned to hogwarts draco was on his very best behaviour he did exactly as his mother instructed as a result the inquisitorial squad lost much of its impetus with draco gone it was just a tool for umbridge to exert her authority and the slytherins had no more respect for her than anyone else in the school with filch fired because he was a squib umbridge was now isolated the teachers despised her and treated her as an unwanted and superfluous imposition forced upon them by fudge she soon got the message and began to keep a low profile which wasntdifficult with her short and dumpy shape she was already pretty low to the ground she thought she had seen the last of potter when she had left him with lucius malfoy that evening but when lucius malfoy disappeared instead of potter she became anxious and didntknow what to think when draco returned to school after seeing off his father she asked him where his father was draco had mumbled something about his father taking a long holiday and that she should wait from him to contact her she waited a long time despite his disappearance lucius malfoy special educational decree number thirty seven was still hanging over the hogwarts students as the end of term drew near according to article two muggle born students would not be allowed to return to school after the christmas break we have to act now said hermione one night as she sat with harry ron and rick in the common room but what can we do asked harry even with lucius malfoy gone fudge will still be sucking up to voldemort death eaters and they ll insist that he go ahead with malfoy reforms student power said hermione as if it was obvious of course it wasn t however hermione was happy to explain opening her bag she pulled out a parchment and began reading from it we the students collective for the defence of the hogwarts charter hereby make the following demands upon the minister of magic 1 that professor albus dumbledore be immediately re instated as headmaster of hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry 2 that all dismissed hogwarts staff be returned to their former positions immediately 3 that the position of executive governor of hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry be dissolved forthwith 4 that the duly appointed hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry board of governors be reconvened 5 that the charter of hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry and its articles of convocation and suffrage remain unaltered 6 that special educational decree number thirty six and special educational decree number thirty seven be revoked in full wow hermione said ron impressed you could sure give that git percy a run for his money in the flowery speech department it got to be like that official sounding said harry obviously also impressed so what do we do now well this is the master parchment said hermione indicating the document she had been reading from and these are magical copies she pulled a bundle of scrolls from her bag we ll circulate them throughout the school and try to get as many students as possible to sign each signature placed on a copy will magically appear on the master parchment well i wouldntbother with the slytherins said ron oh yes we will said hermione dontbe such a house chauvinist ron you may be surprised added rick without malfoy and his band of thugs bullying them some of them might sign the following morning while waiting for professor mcgonagall to arrive in their transfiguration class hermione passed a magical copy of her petition to padma patil to circulate in ravenclaw may i please see what you have there miss granger asked a curious professor mcgonagall upon entering the classroom hermione handed the parchment to the transfiguration professor who studied it carefully finally she said with a small smile might i suggest one minor alteration to your excellent document miss granger hermione was taken aback she had not known what to expect why why certainly professor she stammered at the beginning after the words students collective for the defence of the hogwarts charter please insert the words and hogwarts professors returning the parchment to a very flabbergasted hermione she added if you would be so good as to drop an amended copy off to my study it will be my great pleasure to circulate it in the staff room the petition was a huge success harry became the ambassador in publicising it and encouraging students to sign for once in his life he found his fame and notoriety a benefit rather than a curse he was admired throughout the school for his bravery and he seemed to inspire bravery in others it took a certain amount of bravery to put your name on a petition defying the ministry of magic in such tyrannical times as these much to ron surprise almost half the slytherins signed the petition in the other houses support was unanimous all the professors added their names even professor snape at first he wasntgoing to sign after all he was supposed to be a death eater but then he reasoned that since he was also supposed to be spying for voldemort and feigning allegiance to dumbledore it would be quite in keeping with his pretence but the main reason was that he despised umbridge to the depths of his soul everyone was gathered in the great hall for friday evening meal hermione and harry rose from their seats and walked side by side to the teachers table stopping opposite the headmistress the usual chatter and noise of mealtime died away as students nudged one other it was clear that they were about to deliver the petition at the teachers table all the professors had stopped eating and turned expectantly towards umbridge who was the last to notice harry and hermione standing before her when she did notice them she also saw that everyone in the great hall was staring at her in anticipation she began to feel nervous she didntknow what was going on but it was obvious that everyone else did hem hem what are you doing who gave you permission to interrupt my meal she tried to sound annoyed but her unease was apparent harry handed the petition to her it was tied with a bright red ribbon he and hermione looked at her expectantly in fact everyone in the great hall was staring at her expectantly she had a bad feeling about this and decided it would be safer not to read it now in front of the whole school she put it down unopened upon the table and with a dismissive wave of her hand ordered harry and hermione back to their table immediately they didntmove you have to read it headmistress said hermione in a clear voice that rang through the hall how dare you tell me what to do you little upstart she shrieked no you dontunderstand it a magical petition you have to read it explained hermione i dontcare what it is return to your table immediately the pair of you i ve never seen such impertinence as she yelled at them the headmistress was attempting to stuff the petition in her robes but it leapt from her hands magically unfurled itself and in a loud and officious voice that would have done percy weasley proud proceeded to read out its list of demands for all the hall to hear when it had finished it rolled itself up with a flourish and then dropped back onto the table all the students who had signed the petition began clapping loudly the noise was tumultuous the headmistress sat stony faced becoming redder and redder harry and hermione had returned to their places hermione was looking very pleased with herself the enchanted petition had put on quite a performance and it wasntover yet when the noise died away everyone in the hall was staring at umbridge awaiting her reaction she rose to her feet attempting but failing to exude authority as she drew herself up to her full four foot something she was quite stunned and totally at a loss for words she simply said this is what i think of your impudence she ripped off the red ribbon unfurled the petition and then proceeded to tear it to pieces a gasp ran through the great hall most of the students looked horrified but not hermione she was grinning before the pieces of the shredded parchment had landed on the table they transformed themselves into the caricature of a giant face it was a very imposing face a very intimidating face it turned red with fury upon the headmistress and screamed at her in a deafening accusing voice which reverberated throughout the hall i am a magical petition and i am addressed to the minister of magic not to you you stupid witch how dare you presume to destroy me i have been entrusted into your care thus you are contractually obliged to deliver me to the addressee namely the minister of magic with all due haste those who are unwise enough to attempt evasion will find that the consequences can be very itchy with that the terrible red face transformed back into an innocuous scroll once more bound with a bright red ribbon the headmistress was suddenly overcome by a fearful fit of itching she began scratching herself in all sorts of places it was most undignified the students began howling with laughter while their professors attempted to restrain their equal glee at her obvious discomfort and embarrassment finally the headmistress grabbed the petition in one hand and ran from the hall flailing at her backside with the other trying to relieve the terrible torment it can be safely assumed that cornelius fudge was in possession of the petition very soon afterwards fudge is just ignoring our petition it obvious we need to escalate things said hermione one evening a week after their petition had been delivered to the headmistress no response had been received from the minister of magic and the headmistress was trying to act as if the whole embarrassing episode in the great hall had never happened what did you have in mind asked harry certain that hermione had it all figured out she did we ll go on strike and refuse to attend classes until fudge addresses our petition if he doesntagree to meet each and every one of our demands by the end of term then none of us will return to school after christmas fudge will have no option but to close hogwarts harry again took the role of ambassador though this time it was more like that of a union organiser all the students who had signed the petition agreed to join the strike in fact due to some encouragement by a certain ghost draco malfoy decided to join them he brought many other slytherins who had also not signed the petition with him only a handful the children of dyed in the wool death eaters acting under parental instruction had refused to join the hogwarts professors all wholeheartedly agreed to support the strike action the headmistress seemed to be the only one in the school who didnt know what was going on until one sunday evening in the great hall when harry and hermione approached the teachers table once more bearing a parchment having learned her lesson the headmistress gingerly took it from them and opened it it was in fact a magical announcement which proceeded to announce itself we the students collective for the defence of the hogwarts charter do hereby serve notice that pursuant to our petition to the minister of magic and the action of said minister of magic in ignoring our just demands we hereby take strike action we hereby serve notice that we will attend no further classes until our demands have been met in full we hereby serve notice that should our demands not be met in full by the end of term that none of us shall return to hogwarts until such time as they are met in full the parchment then rolled itself up and floated into the headmistress hand she immediately jumped to her feet and rushed from the hall obviously keen to deliver it to the minister without delay for the next three days there was a holiday atmosphere at hogwarts the few students who had not joined the strike discovered that there was no one to teach them as their professors were all on strike as well the headmistress found herself in the untenable position of trying to teach a handful of slytherins from a variety of year levels a whole range of subjects about which she knew very little it became crystal clear that if something wasntdone soon hogwarts would have to close cornelius fudge minister of magic swept into the great hall just as the students were starting on their wednesday evening meal he was flanked on one side by a very important looking percy weasley his minister of internal security and on the other by dolores umbridge headmistress of hogwarts surrounding the three were some thirty grim faced ministry aurors when they reached the front of the hall the headmistress took her customary seat at the teachers table wearing a very smug smile while the minister of magic and percy weasley stood in front of it facing the students the minister signalled his aurors to secure the doors and to spread out around the sides of the hall with wands drawn it was clear that fudge meant business fudge cleared his throat and nodded to percy students and staff of hogwarts you will now be silent the right honourable cornelius fudge minister of magic order of merlin extraordinary class will now address you said percy in a very loud voice fudge glared around the room at the students the students all looked away but in whichever direction they turned their gaze it inevitably fell upon an auror standing wand drawn in an intimidating posture fudge drew the students petition from his robes holding it up like a naughty child held by its ear who is responsible for this act of anarchy he demanded there was silence it is intolerable that my supreme authority should be challenged and my precious time wasted by a bunch of disobedient children a strike is unprecedented in one thousand years of hogwarts history i will not permit this insubordination this this mutiny to go on for one moment longer i intend to put down this illegal insurrection by force under the terms of the state of emergency i exercise supreme power in the wizarding world my authority is absolute my word is law it may not be challenged by anyone i do not intend to allow a bunch of wayward mutinous children challenge my sovereign authority i am going to make an example of the ringleaders who have fermented this rebellion then the rest of you will know what awaits you if you do not immediately buckle down and learn absolute obedience to those in authority without question the minister of magic conferred with the headmistress before pointing harry and hermione out to four aurors who immediately seized them they were dragged to the front of the hall and held in front of fudge hem hem your excellency minister fudge beseeched umbridge rising from her seat please allow me to administer their punishment certainly agreed fudge be sure to make a memorable example of these criminals headmistress make it a lesson which the students of this school will never forget teach them the consequences of disobedience insubordination and subversion umbridge quickly made her way around to the front of the teachers table and stood next to fudge thank you minister may i hem hem may i use the cruciatus curse on them minister they most certainly deserve it she pleaded quivering with malicious anticipation hmm said fudge stroking his chin the cruciatus curse that a little extreme but then again this is an extreme provocation it calls for an extreme response yes i authorise you to use the cruciatus curse said fudge finally then they will be sent to azkaban for life a gasp rose up from the hall at the appalling ruthlessness of the minister i hereby pronounce harry potter and hermione granger enemies of the wizarding world let them suffer the consequences umbridge raised her wand pointing it at harry chest her eyes glinting maliciously a gleeful smile splitting her ugly face from ear to ear harry stood bravely bracing himself for the excruciating pain which he knew all too well he tried to reassure himself with the thought that he had experienced this curse at the hand of voldemort himself this pathetic excuse for a witch would have nothing close to the dark lord power cruc she began but she never finished because her wand suddenly flew out of her hand and began dancing about in circles above her head just out of reach dolores whatever is going on exploded fudge umbridge looked foolish as she jumped about trying to pluck her wand from the air but she couldntquite reach it for goodness sake said fudge in exasperation as he came to her aid he was certainly tall enough to reach her wand but when he tried to grab it the wand rose higher still he turned furiously to percy who was scrutinising the hall which student cast the spell on her wand weasley i i ve been watching them carefully minister but no one has used their wand i have no idea what could have happened sir really dolores you had better get that wand of yours checked at ollivanders ah well i suppose it the old story if you want something done properly you have to do it yourself all right i ll punish these two myself he drew his wand and pointed it at harry and was about to begin the cruciatus curse when his wand flew up in the air where it danced around just of his reach exactly like the headmistress what on earth is going on here bellowed fudge in fury glaring at percy as if it was his fault but percy didnthave a clue nothing on earth minister fudge came an eerie quavering voice which seemed to fill the whole hall rather than coming from any one point in particular as it spoke the lights in the hall dimmed for a moment and it felt as if a cold mist had permeated the place fudge looked about in confusion who who said that who are you allow me to introduce myself minister fudge i am the ghost of godric gryffindor i do wish i could say what a pleasure it is to make your acquaintance but sadly it is nothing of the kind in fact i cannot recall a more pathetic petty pretentious inadequate person than you as head of the wizarding world in these past one thousand years why how dare you yelled fudge i am the minister of magic i know what you are i just finished telling you there was mirth in the disembodied voice the ministry of magic has ultimate jurisdiction over all magical life forms whether corporeal or incorporeal that includes ghosts as minister of magic i have full authority over you and i demand that you leave this hall at once commanded fudge and what if i dontwant to go what then the ghostly voice sounded highly amused at the thought of being expelled fudge was furious at this public ridiculing he turned to percy demanding to know what could be done to control unruly ghosts percy indicated that several of the aurors present were trained in the use of the special spells used upon ghosts i order those aurors trained in dealing ghosts to eject this unruly ghost immediately i have already wasted enough of my precious time said fudge trying to re establish his dignity and authority but none of them did a thing hurry up now barked fudge get this ghost out of here i donthave time for this nonsense err umm excuse me sir said one of the aurors nervously to the minister but i dontthink that this is a normal ghost it has no visible form and occupies no fixed location its voice seems to come from everywhere at once i have a great deal of experience in dealing with ghosts and the like but this is quite beyond anything that i have ever encountered sir none of the standard ghost control spells can be used against it well does it have any power can it do anything a normal ghost can do very little minister but this does not appear to be a normal ghost so it hard to know it did manage to disarm you and the headmistress and it still levitating your wands sir so it must have some power all right said fudge looking around the room it was rather difficult to talk to a ghost when you didntknow where it was you say you are the ghost of godric gryffindor in that case i dontimagine you will want to see members of your own house hexed well that exactly what will happen if you dontget out of here and right this minute aurors surround the gryffindor table and when i give the order hex the students did you hear that ghost get out of here now or your gryffindors will be badly hexed fudge was rather pleased at his cleverness no surprises how i got to be minister of magic he thought smugly to himself suddenly the aurors discovered that they too were empty handed their wands had joined those of umbridge and fudge spinning in aimless circles beneath the enchanted ceiling however the distance between them and their wands was soon reduced not because their wands had come down but rather because they had gone up the aurors found themselves floating helplessly ten feet up in the air they couldnt touch the students below them nor reach their wands above them they were totally useless bobbing pathetically in the air well minister fudge i believe that establishes the fact that i do indeed have power now it time for us to discuss what you are going to do to avoid suffering the consequences of that power w what do you mean stammered fudge beginning to realise that the tables were turned and that he had lost control of the situation the ghost ignored him you two gryffindors there please return to your table the minister has graciously decided to pardon you your sins not only that but he is going to agree to all the demands in your petition arentyou fudge i most certainly am not and donttry bullying me by floating me around in the air you dontscare me at all said fudge defiantly now listen to me fudge and listen well the time for games is over you may wonder why the spirit of one of the hogwarts founders has seen fit to return i am here to prevent you from destroying this school and turning it into some kind of exclusive playground for purebloods i am also acting on behalf of rowena ravenclaw and helga hufflepuff salazar slytherin hasntbeen much interested in what happens here at hogwarts since he parted company with us and left the school some thousand years ago however the three of us care very much about our school we will always protect hogwarts and its students in times of crisis but you re all dead now you are nothing but disembodied spirits shrieked fudge it is well known that the spirits of the dead cannot act in the realm of the living your time is over old ghost now be gone with you i am in charge in this realm and you have no right to interfere it not not natural you in charge fudge what a joke who exactly do you think you re fooling even we in the spirit world know that you are nothing but a puppet of voldemort and his proxies how dare you that outrageous be quiet you pathetic little quisling i know all about you you take your orders from voldemort death eaters and do their bidding while lining your grubby pockets with their gold i know exactly how much you ve taken in bribes and stashed away in your gringotts vault down to the last knut you are going to sign the hogwarts students petition into law and do exactly what i tell you to do oh no i not i the minister of magic and you have no power over me why you re nothing more than an apparition i dont have to listen to a word you say hmm it seems that you are in need of an example of my power fudge now let see yes this feeble excuse for a headmistress will do very nicely dolores umbridge i understand that last year you removed two dementors from azkaban and set them upon harry potter in little whinging with orders to give him the dementor kiss to suck out his soul do you know what the punishment is for ordering the dementor kiss on an innocent person this is nonsense roared fudge firstly i hereby retroactively approve dolores action which makes it perfectly legal secondly harry potter has been declared an enemy of the wizarding world and as such is stripped of all wizarding rights and protections thirdly i have revoked the whole criminal justice system the only legal penalties are those that i the minister of magic decide to impose and fourthly under the powers vested in me under the state of emergency i hereby absolve dolores umbridge of all wrongdoing and grant her an unconditional pardon yes we ll come to your state of emergency in a moment please be patient fudge now where were we ah yes dolores umbridge that right your punishment for attempting to destroy the soul of an innocent person a fitting punishment would of course be the dementor kiss the forfeit of your own soul however i am a most merciful ghost and would not wish to visit such a terrible retribution upon anyone not even you you shall not be deprived of your soul only of your magic squibbus umbridge wand slowly descended from above her landing in her hand she grasped it confidently not believing the ghost well go on try a spell how about something simple like lumos lumos she said with confidence but no light came from her wand she attempted a number of simple spells with growing desperation but not a single one worked finally she sank to the floor her head bowed her arms wrapped around her knees sobbing hysterically she made a pitiful and pathetic figure huddled there a poignant illustration of the frightful consequences of the squibbus spell there was stunned silence in the hall fudge stared at umbridge his face turned a deathly shade of white his jaw hanging as the implications sank in well that the end of her career as headmistress of hogwarts i do believe that the position requires a proficiency in magic something which she clearly lacks now fudge i think you will do exactly as i tell you it will not be lost upon you that the job description for minister of magic includes amongst other attributes the ability to perform magic a squib for example would not be eligible to hold such a position said the ghost in a threatening tone now write at the bottom of the students petition that you agree to all of their demands in full and sign it with shaking hands fudge picked up the petition from where he had dropped it on the floor and taking a quill from his pocket did exactly as instructed loud applause and cheers broke out from all around the hall fudge just stood there stony faced he had just eaten humble pie
