 absolute shocker by jamesroxmysox a n sorry about this being reposted but i had to make a few little alterations so the story would make sense please read it as the change does affect chapter 27 which should be coming up as as available right about now so thank you for your patience and please read right on with the story tuesday august 31st i lillianna elizabeth evans but ever and i mean ever call me that and you will be rewarded with two very striking black eyes get my drift good just call me lily or evans so much simpler i have no idea what my mother was on when she named me but it was strong i think my parents liked both lily and anna and couldntdecide between them so they used lateral thinking and stuck em together good grief can you image what a mouthful that is when my mother wants to scream at me not that she ever screams at me for being in trouble i a good girl get good grades never act rebellious and always do my chores it more an exasperated sigh when one of my shall we say frequent accidents occurs i happen to be a little uncoordinated in some areas say my han aaaahhhhh damn it i just fell down the stairs okay i might as well just say it i a klutz and i dontmean a trip over every now and then klutz i mean a full fledged four trips to the hospital wing a week klutz yes that how bad i am i manage to trip over my own two feet in varying degrees of severeness at least once a day i an absolute shocker hopefully that little vacation down the stairs is today only adventure i going to encounter pft as if this is me lily evans we re talking about i attract misfortune and accidents waiting to happen like the marauders attract girls and trouble now that is saying something the marauders are a trouble making bunch of seventh year boys that happen to be absolutely gorgeous james potter and sirius black are the tall dark handsome and womanising duo remus lupin in the ideas man and he works out the nitty gritty of the pranks not bad to look at either the final member is their devoted look out peter pettigrew he not as good looking as the others but has a boyish charm all the same of course the entire female population has a crush o at least one of them for me it remus he such a sweetie but still a mischievous little cretin potter and black mainly because they are such stud muffins i wontdeny it they are two fine pieces of eye candy only problem they know it meaning they have an ego to match but that doesntstop their fan clubs you heard right fan clubs so to compare my lack of coordination and awkwardness with marauders appeal to the opposite sex shows the extent of my klutziness bloody massive any way it not like anyone actually notices anymore i somehow manage to slip into the background and my yells of damn it bloody hell oh my giddy aunt and many more simply become a part of hogwarts my friends assured me that if i was sick for a week they would have to step in because people would become nervous from the lack of disasters good to know i have friends who care so deeply about my welfare now isntit dana and bridget reckon they could divide the misfortunes between them ha what a riot those two klutzes deary me they know how to joke or at least i though they did till the told me they were serious i couldnthelp but point out that they could never be klutzy it takes skill or rather a lack there of i can tell you are wondering why these two people could never be clumsy or awkward easy they re part veela their great grandmother was a full veela and the looks run in the family in case you haventnoticed they are twin identical in every way right down to every last pin straight silvery blonde hair on their magnificent heads no need to state just how drop dead gorgeous they are it only depresses me i am especially jealous of their hair that happens to be the exact opposite of my auburn coloured mess of curls they have pin straight hair that is always in place dag nab it some people have all the luck they are often referred to as the crazy declour twins due to their eccentric tendencies that can be expected from people named blodeuedd and cliodhna dontask their mother is slightly obsessed with celtic mythology that why we stick with their middle names thankfully their father made those pronounceable but all is forgiven due to their friendliness can you guess what comes with veela looks apart from charm which they definitely have go on guess yep that right grace natural grace the lucky little berks have natural grace and nice hair can you say unfair thought so i love them dearly but i canthelp feel a bit jealous nessa vanessa reckons she could take my place i couldnthelp but scoff before putting on a fake sympathetic face and patting her on the arm while carefully explaining that although she may be more graceful on a broom stick than on her own two feet she still cantkeep up with me when it comes to being accident prone you see nessa is a chaser on the gryffindor quidditch team happens to be my house also so she has the hand eye thing down pat eye foot in a different matter nessa is a trip over every now and then klutz the type i mention earlier which in truth is perfectly normal rhi rhiannon didnteven put up a case for her taking my place because everyone knows rhi can never ever ever be klutzy she even tried once as a joke the twins dared her to fall over and lose all her books but it just didntwork must be all that wretched ballet she does permanently affecting her brain after one day at attempted klutzdom i had to ask her to kindly stop as she made me look even worse i mean really who can land gracefully on her arse drop only one book and have to two absolute hunks help her up and pick up her book i ask you no one ever helps me up or helps with my books and rhi gets helped up by not one but two drop dead gorgeous ravenclaws who both invited her to hogsmeade hmmph i trip over people laugh rhi trips guys rush forward to be her knight in shining armour again can you say unfair i must have been a complete wanker in a previous life to rack up this much bad karma not even taunting tuna petunia my sister can create this much negative energy maybe i have help from an evil little demon that goes around doing evil little demon things in my name must be there no other explanation or not oh well the fact remains that no one can replace me see my friends would be lost without me arrogant statement i know but my ego needs something to compensate for the klutz factor we wonteven enter tristan and cam into this seeing as they are 6th year versions of black and potter apart from being the biggest klutz to ever stumble the face of the earth i muggle born which means the slytherin arse wipes just cantget enough of insulting me though after five years of hearing the term mudblood it still has surprisingly little effect it a poor arse excuse for an insult i mean come on dirty blood a five year old can do better it a ridiculous concept and most of the time i end up laughing at the stupidity of it all so you imagine when regulus black calls me a mudblood during potions i dissolve into silent giggles one lesson at the end of last year black was feeling particularly malicious and kept mouthing mudblood across the dungeon followed by a glare each time well let just say i got annoyed and i cursed his hair into blonde pigtails with pink bows while he wasntlooking needless to say i was soon shaking with silent laughter leaning on nessa to keep myself upright and stuffing my hand into my moth the muffle the laughter he looked so ridiculous trying to look threatening when really he looked as though someone had stolen his lollipop still makes me laugh black the moron he is thought i was crying and sent me a very triumphant look only making me laugh harder our potions master is an old bat he half blind but has the most phenomenal hearing i had to try so unbelievably hard to keep quiet as soon as class finished a sprinted out the door and burst into a fit of laughter i was almost doubled over one hand clutching my stomach and the other on the wall for support when black came out with this bewildered look on his face i looked at him with this maniac grin in place and managed to gasp your hair before giving into another round of laughter the look on his face was too much and i collapsed on the floor finally giving into my mirth he looked as though he had just been slapped in the face with a rather large fish i cantwait to learn the patronus charm as i will definitely be using that memory of a gob smacked black hilarious on a happier note i cantwait till tomorrow when i get to go back to hogwarts and enter my 6th year yay offcourse that means seeing black but hey i a prefect again this year so i can just give him detention the little twerp wait make that plural detention s ooh that good i cantwait to see who the head boy and girl are hopefully someone who is fair unbiased and i dontknow humble maybe my god last year we had narcissa black and amos diggory you have no idea how many times i wanted to resign after every meeting cissa as i called her and i used to be study buddies and friends since my first year even though she was a slytherin 3rd year and i was a gryffindor 1st year we even tutored each other in areas we have trouble with we met every sunday in the library to do homework or we did until cissa started dating luscious malfoy he made cissa promise never to associate with my kind or else he would inform her aunt regulus mother real piece of work that one and then she d cop it the lowlife black mailed my cissa into never speaking to me again complete jerk is malfoy i believe her even trapped her into marrying him by arranging it through the deranged aunt we ve never talked since but she still owls me every now and then poor thing married to the evil git malfoy poor poor cissa but i think the new head girl will be amelia bones but the head boy is harder to determine though anybody has to be better than diggory he was a pompous wanker by all accounts we had several near uprisings out of hatred for our head boy had we had an actual uprising diggory would have been lynched not pretty i know but he was a tosser daniel diggory is the male prefect of gryffindor for our year he amos younger brother but so much nicer and a whole lot cuter also the big difference daniel is not obsessed with himself he actually very sweet and thoughtful and yes before you ask i do have a slight crush on him okay that was a horrible lie i have a full blown out of this world crush on daniel diggory say anything and i will kill you and it will be a long slow drawn out death he has no idea of course but i sure he ll find due to my disturbingly frequent humiliations of myself in his presence though i know any day now he going to wake up and realises he truly loves me yeah right my ego just likes to keep up its spirits with delusions of this nature so it doesntlose faith entirely i mean the poor possum has quite a bit to put up with for example the klutziness that the big one awful evil appalling unpleasant cretin hair the scatterbrain workings of my mind as you can see from this diary my stubbornness and last of all my melodramatic tendencies so with all this on its plate my poor ego has no other choice than to be borderline schizophrenic or shrivel up and die i would choose insanity also also it best not to insult my pride the ego will not hear of it and forces me to maintain what pride i have left after being known as the resident klutz i also have the red heads temper so it not in your best interest to upset me especially when it comes to my pride black has done this a few times and each time has landed him a week in the hospital wing take that sucker the tosser thought he could do we against me silly mislead little boy hello narcissa black tutored me in defence against the dark arts for four years coming from a dark arts obsessed family cissa was able to give me a few pointers some curses and hexes dirty duellers cough black cough would use she was right stupid prat dontthink his teeth ever fully recovered from the incident he wontknow what hit him if he messes with me this year cissa felt so bad for her behaviour last year she sent me this nifty dada book it has some wicked hexes and curses i just itching to try out i cantwait for tomorrow dana and brig are picking me up to leave for kings cross i cantwait i cantwait i cantwait i cantwait i cantwait i cantwait i cantwait i cantwait i cantwait i cantwait i cantwait i cantwa you may also i am extremely impatient but i so excited about seeing all my friends i can t wait a n okay here are the characters a limited number but the majority of main characters lily and her friends lily evans auburn hair that falls in ringlets at her shoulders startlingly green eyes slender yet curvy figure and 5ft 5 completely scatter brained and quite klutzy vanessa nessa halleway classic country girl looks mousy brown hair that wavy big blue eyes and a dusting of freckles over her nose athletic build from quidditch chaser is fiery and sporty 5ft 6 rhiannon grey spanish beauty in her own right with liquid black eyes black black hair and skin so tanned she looks like a walking mochaccino patient and the group cool calm and collected member willing to go with the flow 5ft 4 danna and bridget declour if anyone knows a french last name please tell me i have no idea so i had to settle with declour twins with a french father and irish mother part veela with long silvery blonde hair penetrating grey eyes and smooth tanned skin and about 5ft 5 loud outspoken and even a little crazy tristan montgomery pretty boy blonde spiky hair sea green eyes well built and toned tanned and well just yummy quidditch player keeper and 6ft cameron cam davies dark hair that falls in his eyes tanned skin and crystalline blue eyes 6ft 2 well built all gryffindors the marauders do i really have to explain them okay okay donteat me james potter 6ft 1 messy black hair melt in your mouth chocolate brown eyes tanned well built quidditch captain and chaser sirius black original tall dark and handsome stranger black hair that always falls in place black eyes that draw you in and of course well built from quidditch beater and 6ft 2 remus lupin shaggy blonde hair amber eyes and peaky looking at times slightly les built that the others but good looking all the same 6ft peter pettigrew cute in a little boy way with watery blue eyes and flaxen blonde hair 5ft 10 okay dontkill me but i had to make him presentable the marauders wouldntlet an ugly little toad hang around them plus he good at this stage so dontgive me any grief for it all in gryffindor of course all in a category of his own regulus black think younger version of sirius for those of you unfamiliar with celtic mythology here are a few explanations blodeuedd means born of flowers or flower face she was a beautiful and magical woman conjured by magicians from various flowers said to be the fairest woman in the world cliodhna otherworld goddess of beauty she had three magical birds that could sing the sick to sleep and cure them dana the great mother goddess gave her name to the tuatha de danann a race of wonderful beautiful but often vulnerable gods who lived in the sparkling other world rhiannon a figure of welsh mythology associated with horses as patient as she was beautiful rhiannon endured her misfortune and injustice without complaint and remarkable patience she had magical birds that could wake the dead and send the living to sleep tristan a tragic lover of celtic mythology and a prince of cornwall i got sick of james being lily nemesis so i decided regulus black was a good candidate for the position regulus is a year younger than sirius in my story yes i know he is supposed to be two years younger but a year fits better in my story please review i promise you get a cookie if you do even if it is a flame tell we what you think absolute shocker by jamesroxmysox disclaimer i own nothing recognisable from the harry potter books or movies that belongs to j and warner brothers studios thursday 28th october girl dorm i greeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeen ugh green would you believe it i covered in green from head to foot and not happy about it it everywhere on my arms my hands on my face it even on shirt and skirt aaaaaggggggggghhhhhh it under my nails ewwwwww that yucky yucky yucky i hate things under my fingernails it just feels sooo disgusting i think i may have greenophobia fear of all things green sticky liquid things in particular shudder some twat thought it would be ohs o funny to make my quill explode with green ink when i went to write with it when i was in the library earlier i have a sneaking suspicion of who it was the marauders normally when a prank is pulled on me i suspect reggie but i doubt he even knows hogwarts has one remus however was sitting at the table near me and i swear i saw him watching me from the corner of his eye he may seem like the sensible and level headed one but i know for a fact that just a cover remus in probably the most cunning treacherous and brilliant of them all he has constructed this illusion of being innocent and sweet but i know he really the brains behind the marauders i not saying potter and black dontcome up with excellent pranks it just that remus fine tunes and elaborates on their ideas i think remus was getting me back for being such a cow to him the other day well i was having one of my klutz fests they happen quite often and i happened to snap at remus when he asked me what was wrong hey i was in a rather fragile state i had just had a rather nasty run in with the queen of perfection herself rosie she didntappreciate being knocked to the ground or having her hair filled with the whipped cream and custard that was previously my chocolate clair i was understandably upset about losing my clair rosie was more upset that she was now wearing a desert as a hair accessory and the fact that we were in a tangled heap on the floor is it my fault rhi leaves her stupid books everywhere i dontthink so she was glaring at me as i sat up so i thought i had better apologise i really sorry rosemary i tripped on rhi books she still glaring crap that can mean only one thing she was flirting and it was high profile bugger you never miss an opportunity to embarrass me do you just because i can get the attention of any boy i want does not give you the right to harass me i know you re envious lily but could you at least try to keep your jealous urges under control she hissed at me with her eyes mere slits i sat there dumfounded rhi bridget and dana were at the top of the stairs pissing themselves with silent laughter and tri and cam who had been playing a game of chess were trying to smother the sound of their chuckles by swallowing their hands i stared at rosemary jealous of rosie is she completely deluded i wouldntwant whatever she thinks she has except maybe the natural grace in a million years i heard some more suppressed sniggering to my right and looked over at these rude people who have obviously never heard of subtlety with a death glare could my day get any worse who should be siting there but black and potter now i realise why rosemary dear is so upset with me she was flirting with the handsome half of the marauders geez am i going to cop it now i closed my eyes took a deep breath to control myself and stood up then helped rosemary up i really am terribly sorry rosemary i didntmean to embarrass you and i sorry you seem to think that i am rancorous towards you i said quietly with my head held high i performed a cleaning spell before continuing as i said before i didntmean for this to happen and will you two please shut up i snapped out the last part at the famous duo who just answered me with identical evil grins i smoothed out my uniform before exiting the common room with what little dignity and grace i had left rhi dana and bridget joined me outside in the corridor where i was banging my head against the wall excellent lily bloody excellent gasped out bridget yeah did you see her face it was hilarious rhi chimed in did you here her i know you re envious lily but could you at least try to keep your jealous urges under control as if mimicked dana bloody hell you d think they would try and cheer me up but no my friends embellish my embarrassing moments so i will never be able to live them down i ve said it once and i ll say it again with friends like mine who needs enemies to make matters worse when i finally shook off my friends and made my way to the library i met remus on the way and bit his head off when he tried to talk to me but that is no reason to turn a person green okay you may be thinking what the hell is this girl going on about she hates green her eyes are green for christ sake well i dontcare i have a severe dislike for the colour green especially when it happens to be my skin tone after my quill exploded i sat there in shock trying and failing to comprehend what happened remus looked over at me and i could tell he was suppressing a grin must have gone off better than expected cam came round the corner from the astronomy section and burst into laughter i finally regained the use of my body and looked all around me green i was hysterical and cam came over and tried to calm me down a bit which just got me even more distressed calm down how can anyone calm down when they re green he eventually sent me off to the bathroom promising to clean up all my books for me i managed to drag myself to the nearest girl loo drawing a lot of funny looks as i went past i cleaned my self up as best i could my sleaves had been rolled up and my tie was loosened so i had splatters of green all over my hands and chest area also little splashes all over my face my shirt was completely ruined and i really didntneed any more confrontations but what do you know the law of being lily evans never fails as i came out of the bathroom i met potter great bloody great just what i need potter to see me like this nice look evans it really suites you brings out the colour of your eyes i almost strangled him i had managed to get most of the ink out but i still had a few stains on my arms chest and face dontforget we have patrol tomorrow night and with that said he stroll off in the direction of the kitchens ugh just what i needed when stained green to be reminded that i have to patrol with potter by potter who was grinning at my predicament like a cheshire cat my god i look awful what does he mean it brings out the colour of my eyes wait one cotton pickin minute why should i care what potter says or thinks oh dear i have serious issues ugh can i crawl into a hole and die now or am i required to walk barefoot across hot coals as well friday 29th october herbology it now been five days since i had daniel feelings revealed in all their knicker baring glory i have been sulking and with good bloody reason and to add insult to injury he seems to be avoiding me tosser what is so damn repulsive about me huh i shower daily i donthave bad breath my feet dontsmell so why is it that every time he catches a glimpse of him he runs in the other direction i have been moping all week that probably why i freaked out so much about the green ink there too much pressure too much is happening at once i canthandle this admittedly i haventtold anyone about my feeling for daniel so it my own fault i have no one to share my troubles with really but i have been trying to act as though nothing is wrong around my friends peers and professors love sucks hard i ve also still got that problem of somehow acquiring a boyfriend some where along the road and still have no clue as to who it is reggie of course wontlet up about it but i have a feeling who ever my supposed boyfriend is will be having a harder time that me black looked especially happy that i didntknow who that person was but the thing is everyone and i mean everyone thinks i have a boyfriend damn it now i depressed but that isntentirely daniel fault or too do with the whole boyfriend thing this morning at breakfast the daily prophet reported that a muggleborn family had been attacked by the rising dark lord voldemort the poor girl was only a third year hufflepuff both her parents and little sister had been killed there was a sort of smoke sign above the house shaped like a skull with a snake protruding from its mouth the paper called it the dark mark and me being the twat i am just had to ask what are they doing to catch voldemort as you can guess that went over well especially with those from wizarding families i was immediately told to shut up and not to say the name ooooh scary the word is going to come to life acquiring body soul and a wand from nowhere and curse me to next thursday now aintit if i had of said that i would probably end up in st mungo psychiatric ward and a 72hr lock down sheesh i have never known so many people to be afraid of a silly little word i mean it not even his real name it one he made up well i suppose he had to really i doubt anyone would get the willies if someone said tom riddle roll eyes i wouldntbe surprised if wasnteven pureblood as he puts it like hitler wasnteven aryan well it plausible i mean bangs on about this pureblood concept enough oh well i ve had enough of being deary and depressing i have to go on rounds now with potter ugh may the force be with me common room okay that was weird i just went on patrol with potter and he was actually polite which was a little unnerving i met him at the entrance to the common room and we set of from there i was feeling miserable but i didntfeel the need to cover up my feelings seeing as it was only potter and i really couldntcare less if he thought i was unhappy or not after about 15 minutes of silence potter broke the silence so what the matter i looked at him with my face expressionless and opened my mouth to tell him there was nothing wrong but he cut me off donttell me there isntanything wrong because there obviously is you always have a smile on your face or at least an expression i just stared at him since when does he know my facial expressions fine i just a bit psyched out about the attack by voldemort this morning okay so i lied well i didntactually i more told a half truth but then again to tell the truth is to tell the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth fine i did lie but i dontwant potter knowing personal problems there well personal hey i saw that look he gave me a funny look when i said voldemort oh crap not another one of those onomatophobic freaks i cocked an eyebrow you wouldnthappen to be onomatophobic now would you he clenched his brows together whatphobic i rolled my eyes idiot on o mat o phobic i said nice and slow in case he really was as stupid as he looks he glared at me for the patronising tone and i just smiled sweetly back okay and what is that a phobia of it the fear of hearing a certain word s or name s he quirked an eyebrow at me why do you ask if i afraid of hearing a word or name good grief i didntrealise he was this thick thick as two short planks i tell you because you gave me a funny look when i said voldemort he did it again see you just did it again so you must be onomatophobic i announced triumphantly and somewhat indignantly i did give you a funny look because you said the name i opened my mouth to say that he just proved me right but he continued on but it was because i didntexpect you to say voldemort seeing as the vast majority of the wizarding world refuses to call him anything other than you know who or he who must not be named oh i hesitated so you re not onomatophobic then he smiled actually smiled instead of his regular grin no though is that even a really phobia i stared at him great he still thinks i a basket case that comes up with all sorts of junk actually it is i said stiffly just like xanthophobia atelophobia bibliophobia and arachibutyrophobia like what it true they are all phobias xanthophobia is a fear of the colour yellow or the word yellow atelophobia is a fear of imperfection bibliophobia is a fear of books and arachibutyrophobia is a fear of peanut butter sticking to the roof of ones mouth potter just laughed i think sirius is bibliophobic he hates books i giggled what the hell i just giggled i giggled oh dear lord i have succumb to the embarrassing habit of teenage girls the world over i just giggled what worse is that it was because of james potter oh my giddy aunt i ve crossed over to the other side shoot me now how do you know all these phobias anyway potter asked i groaned i have a deranged aunt who training to be a psychologist and she tried to analyse me and help me resolve my phobias over the summer i answered with a sigh is a psychologist one of those mental health muggle healer people arentthey all a bit nutty yeah they re the mental health wacks that have more problems than their patients i couldnthelp but smile at the thought of my outrageous aunt lizzie she was always bright and colourful injecting life into our rigid household he was quite for a minute and i saw him looking at me out the corner of my eye it good to see you re smiling again i just smiled at him and kept walking we made our way back to the common room joking around the whole way when we went in he politely said good night and made his way up the boys stairs talk about weird potter was polite considerate and even managed to make me laugh i actually enjoyed his company maybe he not so bad after all oh dear i just reread that last couple of sentences i definitely have issues but maybe just maybe he isntthat bad damn it why does he have to be so confusing thankyou to all my lovely reviewers and i am very sorry for not updating earlier but i ve had exams revision and i have had trouble getting on the thing long enough to do anything because my mother has taken it hostage while writing her cv all right so that a pathetic excuse but i had to give it a try so please remember to review and tell me what you think i so sorry i cantwrite individual replies but i have no time on the computer my wretched mother is kicking me off yet again and if she just read that over my shoulder then yes you are wretched anyways r e v i e w absolute shocker by jamesroxmysox disclaimer i own nothing recognisable from the harry potter books or movies that belongs to j and warner brothers studios sunday 31st october common room today halloween i love halloween ever since i was a little girl it has always been tradition for my parents to go to this big fancy masquerade ball for people of their stature as my mother would say very stuffy very boring and of course no children allowed in the ball room not that it made any difference my brother and i managed to get in their once but we realised that we had sooo much more fun so we left after 5 minutes it was the principal of the thing really petunia didntcome with us she too much of a goody goody to sneak anywhere let alone the ballroom every year i wore the same costume a black sparkly dress that had strips of the material around the bottom and as the sleaves i wore it with a pointed hat and carried a broomstick around with me i was a witch with my china doll annabelle which i dragged everywhere dressed the same ironic hey i remember one year a couple of boys laughed at me but being the delightfully eloquent eight year old that i was i told them in no polite way to sod off lovely child i know but i always had heaps of fun with my brother annoying the hell out of some dignitary or another and making all the attendants laugh at our antics we were proclaimed devil children on more than one occasion that stopped once i came to hogwarts but i refused to give it up consequently i inspired my friends to dress up and we now usually spend halloween running around the halls of hogwarts dressed up playing hide and seek chasy of course this is in the dead of night once everyone else has gone to bed so much more fun like that i cantwait till after the feast but back to the reason for my writing in here we just got back from hogsmeade and i have to say my encounter with star boy has only enforced my theory that the blacks have it in for me by star boy i mean sirius black one of the greater idiots of the world poor world has to contend with nutcases like voldywart and prats like the black brothers reggie and star boy i have great sympathy for it star boy decided to have a little chat to me while i was in the three broomsticks much to the pleasure of dana and bridget when sirius sat down you could see the drool start to collect at the corner of their mouths disgusting you could also see the death looks bridget and i were receiving from dana since black sat between us i assumed he was there to talk to the twins so i turned to nessa and rhi to continue our conversation after a couple of minutes of flirting sirius turned to me hey lileeeee he addressed me drawing out the e in my name i faced him with a tight smile my hands laced around my glass so i didntgouge his eyes out for distorting my name in such a whiny tone yes black gave one of his killer smiles which has no effect on me at all okay so it made my insides feel like mush and my knees got a bit wobbly but he didntneed to know that what it not like i can help it i openly admit that sirius black is one of the dishiest lads to ever walk the earth how can any female not be affected him that does not mean i have a crush on him or would ever consider dating him he just happens to be hot and to deny that would be just straight out lying which i am not very good at what his smile just got bigger uh oh i am not going to like what ever it is he has to say lileeeee do you have a boy friend he said in a singsong voice i really had stop myself from dumping my butter beer over his head by clasping them in my lap i pursed my lip and gave him a penetrating look what concern is it of yours he grinning damn that grin i was just wondering looking out for my fellow gryffindor so do you i tried to work out what he was up to nope i give up the boy is a mystery and how in the name of all things good does he even know who i am so nice to know you care i replied sarcastically but no i donthave a boyfriend it was reggie your demented brother who told everyone i have a boyfriend sirius raised his eyebrows demented is a good description of dear regulus do you know who your suppose boyfriend is he was surprisingly serious and looked at me intensely as if to determine if what i said was the truth does it sound like i do he stared at me blankly i sighed in frustration no i don t but do think i like having the population of hogwarts having more knowledge of my love life than i do huh no i don t and do you think i like random people i stared at him here coming up and asking me about it no i don t so you know what star boy sod off i glared at him before turning to my glass so as to resist the temptation to carry out the scenes playing in my head by george black would look damn good drawn and quartered he slung his arm around my shoulder ick i am going to have to here about this all night about how lucky i am the great sirius black talked to me and that he touched me oooh that just the highlight of my day plus we shall all be subjected to the black and potter are so hot rant ugh someone cut off my ears now awww i hurt you think of me as a stranger lils but i just showing my concern though i do like being know as star boy i could here the fraudulent hurt dripping from his every word i rolled my eyes and removed his arm from me using only my thumb and one finger as i said thanks for caring but why exactly do you care how do you even know who i am he gave me a roguish wink you could say i have some invested interest in you i made a face i am going to totally disregard just how disgusting that statement was and move on but you know what between you and you re bloody brother i destined to be committed to st mungo by christmas i placed my arms on the table and buried my head in them stupid sodding star boy my darling friends decided to finally intervene what do you know it nessa who speaks first you know sirius we think we might just know who lily mystery boyfriend might be you could hear the psychotic grin in her taunting voice and why you would have invested interest in her love life i felt black stiffen next to me scared as a widdle bunny serves him right the bloody tosser hey back up there what did she say they have an idea of who it is my head shot up who everyone head swivelled onto me looking surprised they had all previously been looking at black smirking their little faces off no one answered me who i repeated they were all still in a state of shock then i got angry who who do you think is my supposed boyfriend my voice an octave still with the wide eyes answer me nessa tell me who do think it is vanessa lowered her eyes well er were not sure we um we could be wrong and er we dontwant to jump to conclusions so er she kept mumbling like this and i was ready to blow a gasket vanessa answer me properly please with a name she avoided my eyes still and fiddled with her napkin i sorry lily but i canttell you that gasket blew a mile high what do you mean you canttell me i was met with silence answer me damn it they all looked at the floor with guilty expressions on their face black included what none of you have the courage to tell me are you gryffindors or what now that just pissed me off further when didntdare face me but instead kept their eyes locked on the table they say red heads have a temper that matches their hair colour i dontusually let my temper of its leash but when i do the famous red head temper is given a whole new status you lot disgust me you all know who this supposed boyfriend of mine is dontyou do you think it funny to see me agonize over this none of them would look me in the eye do you i thundered slamming my hand on the table do you enjoy watching me become more and more miserable as people continue to harass me as i have my heart crushed because the one guy i like wontcome near me anymore do you all find that exceedingly enjoyable huh oh great now i crying and my voice is filled with emotion that made them all look up with surprise are you that sadistic or did you just forget that i a real person with real feelings inane lily with her head in the clouds oblivious to everything well guess what i do take in what going on around me dana finally spoke lily we re sorry no dana sorry doesntcut it my voice finally broke as the tears rolled down my face you know what forget it i going for a walk i ll meet you back at the castle i croaked before running out the door as i made my exit i saw them all staring at me mind you half the pub was staring at me i saw the gob smacked faces of the other marauders who were sitting at a table near my escape route sod em sod the whole sodding lot of them once out of the three broomsticks i did what any normal stressed emotionally unstable teenage girl does i went straight to honeydukes and bought the biggest bar of chocolate i could find before dragging myself off to the shrieking shack i crawled in there through a hole in the boarded up windows round the back i know people say it haunted but i seriously doubt it i figured out long ago that a werewolf probably uses it during the full moons the furniture s all ripped and torn as though someone has been trying to express their pain the poor person whoever they are must have a heinous time every month but the full moon isntfor another week and half i barricaded myself in the master bedroom upstairs wrapped myself in the doonas and transfigured some tissues before balling my eyes out and munching my chocolate by the time i finished my chocolate and my crying it was time to head back to school once i entered the common room my friends were waiting for me they ran up to me and engulfed me a massive group hug saying sorry about a million times i just smiled and asked them who was going it first for our annual game of hide and seek chasy they all smiled back and started arguing over whether it was nessa turn or cam i realised whilst i was being over emotionally enthusiastic that they were probably just protecting the boy feelings pft his feelings whoever he is and that it was my own fault that no one knew about my feelings because i never tell anyone right now they want to drag me off to the feast so i had better go monday 1st november history of magic pinch and a punch for the first of the month last night was so much fun the seven of us ran around like mad hatters trying to stifle our screams so filch wouldntcome swooping down on us needless to say it was futile attempt but we had so much fun we dana and i coerced cam into going it first we then split into pairs predicably the twins wandered off together and nessa and tri ran of together rhi and i just looked at each other and started giggling we entertained the idea of locking them in a broom closet together but lost enthusiasm once we remembered both were on the quidditch team they re fit and can run fast meaning they could catch us easy we use only the major corridors from the gryffindor common room to the great hall and including the entrance hall this makes it all the more exciting because so many people use these floors every time a teacher ghost student or animal goes past we have to hide it adds an element of danger it good being with rhi because she is awfully good at this sneaking thing plus she knows the best suits of armour to hide behind also over the years we have worked out a strategy of winning so we always go together for the first couple of hours after the feast we ran around like twats we had all had a decent amount of sweets to get us on a sugar high and a few butter beers we brought back from hogsmeade at about 2 o clock we were all packed into the 1st floor main corridor because dana had managed to round us all up rhi and i were concealed behind a tapestry while cam tri nessa and bridget were further down dana was at the father end of the corridor so rhi and i were content peeking out as she came closer to cam and bridget however dana never did get to spring them what are you lot doing out this late came an stern voice from our end of the corridor we all froze i pretty sure dumbledore knows about our annual halloween escapades but it d be a little difficult to explain to any other teacher hey evans grey you can breath again you know we dontbite rhi and i both just stared at each other refusing to move we saw the light of a wand come on i peeked up the corridor dana had obviously blended into the wall or joined bridget and cam well if you wontcome out then we may as well talk to you anyway what are seven grown 16 year olds doing playing hide and seek in the dead of night asked an amused voice wait i recognise those voices those sodding marauders rhi obviously recognised them too because we let out a breath simultaneously but then my red head temper go the better of me what i d had an emotional day i was running solely on my emotions i ripped back the tapestry and glared at the marauders as the grinned in the wand light potter and black looked especially happy while remus and peter just smile and waved what do think you re doing filch will hear you and then he ll come after all eleven of us and what does it matter to you what we re doing i could ask you exactly the same thing i hissed at them sirius grinned a bit wider but lilikins we only care for you re safety we have to make sure you little 6th years dontget into any trouble now dontwe oh please safety my arse that why they have numerous cakes bulging from their pockets please black let not start with the caring again as it obvious you have other interests namely the sticky bun protruding from you pocket i tried to keep my voice down but that was blown when black started to laugh obnoxiously caught me again lilikins i ll have to remember not o try and fool you you re almost as good as remmy here he definitely had too much sugar i was just about to inform him of that when filch came tearing into the middle of the corridor effectively cutting rhi and i off from our friends hi everyone i actually had this

movies that belongs to j and warner brothers studios i tried to keep my voice down but that was blown when black started to laugh obnoxiously caught me again lilikins i ll have to remember not to try and fool you you re almost as good as remmy here he definitely had too much sugar i was just about to inform him of that when filch came tearing into the middle of the corridor effectively cutting rhi and i off from our friends everyone froze for a second while filch tried to determine who the culprits were cam tri dana bridget and nessa were still hidden so they were safe but filch had seen the marauders rhi and myself i grabbed rhi hand and took off for the entrance hall with the marauders right behind us once down the steps the marauders tried to pull us towards the dungeons rhi and i shook our heads and wriggled out of their grasp no way in hell were we going down there who knows what potion ingredients come to life at night and skulk around those creepy dungeons rhi and i ran over and pushed opened the doors before running out on to the grounds the marauders hesitated before following us i think the felt they should protect us or some other idiotic male instinct we ve done this numerous times before and never been hurt or caught we didntneed the marauders protection but we humoured them all the same rhi and i ran all the way down to the lake before we collapse with laughter under the beech tree when the marauders came up the looked at us as though we were insane which just made us laugh harder well come on running helter skelter away from an enraged filch is awfully funny especially since the marauders are coming after us to protect us after a while we settled down but then caught each other eyes and that set us off all over again are you quite finished potter asked annoyed we quietened down to just giggles i looked up at potter smiling sweetly sorry i tried i really did but the look on his face was hilarious and when i looked at rhi she was trying to keep a straight face as well the look on both our faces set each other off laughing yet again so that we ended up lying on our backs laughing into the night after a while we calmed down however i got ideas into my little head now seems like a perfect time for pay back plus i was hungry the marauders were sitting behind where i was lying down so i had to tilt my head back to see them hey siriiiiii i cooed in a sickly sweet voice he surveyed me warily yes i broadened my smile can i have a cup cake he looked relieved for a second sorry i donthave any cup cakes i like the sticky buns i pouted fine be that way star boy he chuckled i squinted at the rest of them trying to determine which one was a cup cake eater remus raised an eyebrow at my squinting what are you doing he inquired i looked at him innocently trying to figure out which one of you blokes eats cupcakes so i can scab one i answered matte of factly they all laughed and rhi just smiled completely used to my random cravings potter grinned that would be me the cupcake eater my eyes lit up as i turned to him really could i please have one pretty pretty please rhi laughed i wouldnthave said that if i was you potter now you donthave any chance i smiled at rhi she knows me too well once i discover a cupcake or cookie you have a snowball chance in hell of keeping it off me i turned back to potter with big round eyes it called the bambi taught to me by will so can i please potter regained his smirk what in it for me i thought about if for a second i didntlike the way he said that or the glint of mischief in his eye it actually sounded pretty seedy so i think i shall stick with the innocent and clean meaning of that question i would offer to do your homework for you but you re a 7th year and head boy so i pretty sure you can do a better job yourself i would also offer you money but you seem to have enough i paused for a second i could get you two cupcakes tomorrow potter shook his head and pouted but i want some cup cake now again that sounded rather dirty but for my own sake i think i shall just ignore those sexual under tones geez what else can i use as trade what about the humanitarian approach what about giving it to me solely out of the goodness of your heart i asked hopefully potter just shook his head i ll give you half i sighed in defeat oh well it better than nothing i sat up and turned around and potter placed half the cupcake in my hand it took me a second to register exactly what was in my hand oi he had given me the bottom half of the cupcake that is surrounded by paper and has no frosting or decorations potter what do think you re playing at i didnteven get any frosting i cried indignantly the marauders laughed you never said which half but if you dontwant it i ll take it back with that he snatched it back i glared at him as they laughed again rhi just shook her head despairingly knowing what would happen next she muttered not even a snowball chance in hell well i was understandably upset at having my half of the cupcake taken off me it may not have any frosting or chocolate chips but it was still a damn good cupcake i lunged at potter knocking him onto his back with my force and grabbed his half of the cupcake i gracefully got up and brushed myself off before sitting back down next to rhi to devour my spoils potter was in shock still on the ground while the other marauders roared with laughter he got up blinking his mouth wide open i smiled innocently at him black looked at me still chuckling my arentwe a feisty one rhi grinned at this that nothing potter got off lightly usually if you try to deprive lily of a cupcake or cookies you re met with a curse that takes at least a week to wear off and i speak from experience on this rhi said with a twinkle in her eye one of you wouldnthappen to have a custard tart would you i starving she asked remus coughed up a tart while potter was still dumbfounded i think that the first time i ve been assaulted by a girl i rolled my eyes drama queen potter locked his eyes on me hey that my cupcake give it back i looked at the half eaten cupcake you sure you want this back i mean i ve eaten almost half plus it not your cupcake anymore you never said which half was yours potter humphed and glared at me i stuck my tongue out at him sirius chuckled she got you there prongs i felt sorry for him so i broke off the last third and gave it back to him before lying back and looking at the stars off in my own little world the marauders continued to talk for a while and they must of asked about my stargazing because i heard rhi laugh oh she does that all the time lily one of the very few people who use the astronomy tower for its intended purpose i was actually listening to their conversation i just couldntbe bothered involving my self after a while we headed back to the tower and managed to arrive safely with out to many incidents needless to say i am rather tired today with my late night wanderings library i knew i was right about that remus lupin he sneaky cunning conniving devious shrewd and just too damn endearing why you ask am i listing the unfavourable characteristics of remus lupin because he was being an intelligent prat during the prefects meeting intelligent prat sounds like an oxymoron but isntreally if the individual in this case remus is using his intelligence to assist his prattishness which i must say he did excellently we were set into groups discussing ideas for the ball that mary from hufflepuff had suggested at that fateful first prefect meeting of the year i was with remus and a couple of hufflepuffs not that we could actually get much out of them they were babbling about the first quidditch match on saturday and about their quidditch team i have no idea why they re so excited seeing as it gryffindor and slytherin who play first when i pointed this out i was told that it gave insight for the other teams and apparently hufflepuff has a new captain who will lead the badgers to victory pft as if they stand a chance not that i said that to them i do value my life so basically i was working with remus trying to brainstorm for the ball what there is to brainstorm about i dontknow i mean you set a date pick a theme and decide on a form of entertainment and bada bing bada boom you have a dance not exactly rocket science well potter and amy are working together and amy doesntseem to trust him so she getting the prefects to help just great we are now all embroiled in the disagreements of the head boy and girl never a good thing so there we are diligently working away okay so i was doodling but that beside the point when out of nowhere remus strikes up conversation weird considering we hardly ever talk during prefect meetings except when i tell him potter an arse and he apologises on his friends behalf and we never speak outside these prefect gatherings so lily that was an interesting show you put on yesterday i quickly looked up and tried to determine what the devil he was talking about really which show are you referring to he smirked at this well for starters the rather interesting display in the three broomsticks i ve never seen you become quite so emotional even when threatening to blast regulus black to smithereens i looked back down at my parchment to avoid meeting his eyes star boy just touched on a sore spot is all i answered loftily i continued to doodle really i thought it was a combination of factors i didntlook at him still what intrigued me the most was the last part about a crush not talking to you i looked at him sharply and felt the blood rush to my face i believe that is none of your business mr lupin i said while glaring at him he smirking again well it may not be any of my business but i am intrigued by it that and the fact that you have no idea of who your mystery boyfriend is i looked him straight in the eye and was met with a disturbing twinkle alright what do you what lupin remus is a complicated person which makes his underlying motives hard to determine nothing just wanted to cure my curiosity is all so who is this mystery boy i was very tempted to look over at daniel at that moment but i controlled myself and kept looking lupin straight in the eye that is none of your business and why would i tell you any way when even my friends dontknow i glared at him waiting for an answer which i didntreceive i went back to my doodling scowling like there was no tomorrow well i thought you might just like an outsiders opinion as to whether all hope is lost ugh please as if he cares and i know for a fact that all hope is indeed lost for your information i happen to be well aware that all hope is lost and i dontneed an outsiders opinion to back me up so i snapped but wouldntyou if you had people continually asking about your private love life we sat in silence for a couple of minutes while remus seemed to be scrutinising me and analysing my response i haventseen you and daniel talking together lately he said off handily but i knew he was well aware of what he was saying okay he just hit the nerve dead on i quickly looked up at him cocked my head to one side and raised an eyebrow waiting for him to continue it just seems weird is all i mean you used to spend most of the prefect meetings talking to him and you were good friends out side of these gatherings as well what happened i went back t my doodling i dontknow what you mean we re still friends and i dontthink anything has changed except that i have my heart broken into a thousand tiny pieces with no one there to help me glue it back together but remus is right we haventspoken in so long and daniel avoids me at all costs that doesntexactly give me much to work with on the whole rebuilding of friendship at this point i was trying very hard not to break down crying in front all the prefects and the heads but most of all i didntwant to let remus see what a delicate subject this was too late remus put a comforting hand on my shoulder you know lily love can cause people to do crazy things even hurt the objects of their affections i looked at him confused but he just smiled and went back to his brainstorm i was about to ask what he meant when potter called our attention okay everyone can i please have your brainstorms up here and we will further discuss the ball at a special prefect meeting on thursday i was about to objet because that when i tutor charlie and he was having real trouble with the latest charm no objections please we have already arranged the meeting and quidditch practice tutoring and all other activities are to be postponed in favour of the meeting is that understood everyone nodded except a few slytherins who looked as though they were about to rebel but quickly nodded their heads after a glare from potter well that was a productive prefects meeting surprisingly remus and i managed to get a few ideas down but most of all remus is now fully aware of my situation with daniel and the sensitivity of the issue plus he confused the hell out of me with that crazy love thing can you now understand about how pratishness and brains are a bad combination yes if you happen to have a rather delicate issue never allow a wanker with an iq over 80 interrogate you about it they re too bloody smart wait a sec someone just sat down next to me it alright it just charlie he asking if i all right because i look as if i about to break down or start blubbing at any rate i try to convince him that everything just fine but he insists there something i not telling him talk about opening a can of worms what am i supposed to do poor out my heart and soul to some unfortunate fourth year i dontknow how he would handle it in fact i pretty sure he has no idea what he getting himself into by asking that question oh my giddy aunt francis i an emotional wreck it like a train derailing and pulling all its carriages off the rails with it wreckage only on an emotional level i mean i considering talking out my problems with my fourteen year old tutoring student and i close to tears again i ve gone mentally insane i think i need to be taken to st mungo for an immediate head examination or even better i can get my nutty aunt lizzie to analyse me thankyou to cait my excellent beta and to all those that review and to those that have me on author alert i know your reading it any way a big thankyou to all of you mello80 bloody server i tried too update a couple of times the other day and it tried to eat me needless to say i gave up pretty soon after but oh well i hoped you enjoyed the chapter thanks for the review occupied neptune thanks for the compliments i ve never read those books before but i ll look out for them if you think they re any good i try to make lily easy to relate to cause everyone has a bit of a melodramatic ditzy side to them that they can recognise in lily i really should have good diction and language because i do english literature at school never ever do that it is evil with way to much work and i constantly nagged by my teacher for not using enough literary devices shakes head but thanks for the review vanessa black and zabini thankyou i a firm believer that everyone has their own little quirks and perfect lily just doesntcut it so i got fed up and wrote my own story ok so i was a tad drastic in my protest about perfect lily but oh well if i wasnta dramatic person i wouldnthave written this story but anyway thanks for the review jensnuffles thank you i glad you find my story enjoyable but really bridget jones i wouldntgoo that far days i update my god i awful at up dates i all over the place maybe check every 5 6 days generally i promise to make my updates more regular thanks billy hey no problemo my story is solely for the enjoyment of the readers sure i love reviews i would even say i a bit of a review whore but i know people read my story and i basically write because i bored as hell so dontworry it not your responsibility to flatter and enlarge my ego leave that to me i do too good a job on my own and what else would i do if i didntwrite as for the little quotes and facts that was a good one i full of completely useless information like did you know that chocolate is actually a drug weird hey it affects your brain chemistry to make you happy so it is technically a drug also explains a lot about how chocolate sends me bouncing off the walls with cheeriness so dontworry your pretty little head about not reviewing i know you read it thanks for the review p s you must be the change you wish to see in the world mahatma gandhi it the quote i live by nimue88 dontyou just hate you try to be a good friend and cheer them up with a pick me and smack they throw it back in your face with a no it full of fat makes me want to slap them but i just eat it in front of them instead i such a spiteful person i know drama is the main element of my fic but i try to keep it humorous drama with verbal diarrhoea dear lord it took me about seven tries to spell diarrhoea right it definitely better out than in double chocolate cake with whipped cream and icing eyes roll into the back of head and saliva collects in mouth yup that in one fine incentive to up date thanks for the review slippersrfuzzy cait your such a sweetie you beta ever chapter but you still review my goodness you just found your way onto my christmas present list how i would get it to you is a different matter but it the thought that counts by the way when will you be updating your own stories you haventin ages i know because i checked oh well thanks for the review please remember to r e v i e w absolute shocker by jamesroxmysox disclaimer i own nothing recognisable from the harry potter books or movies that belongs to j and warner brothers studios thursday 4th november common room great just bloody great i have to go to that sodding ball i hate balls i mean really hate them i dontlike getting dressed up in frills lace and ribbon and i certainly dontlike having to dance around with some fake smile plastered on my face this is just what potter and amy are forcing upon me at the prefects meeting we just had the following was decided theme winter wonderland how original dress formal muggle clothing big surprise there entertainment madge some popular wizarding band that play classical instruments in a new age way shakes head date saturday 18th december the hogwarts express will leave on sunday so that student can go home to see their families for the holidays oh joy we have a ball and even then i cantescape my family age limit 4th year and up wouldntwant the munchkins getting up to no good now would we leave that to the older brats curfew till midnight witching hour and the clincher partners prefects must go together with their year and house counter part and the head students must go together also all will open the ball great i going with daniel pity that the boy can hardly stand being in the same room as me let alone having to dance with me marvellous bloody marvellous i am forced to go to a ball then i am forced to dress up and then i am forced to open the bloody thing with daniel can i say i sick i could make myself sick i know quite a few potions that will have me in the infirmary for two days enabling me to bypass the ball completely and still allow me to go home if only amy would fall for it and my friends for that matter they all know of my fondness for these formal gatherings and my exploits of trying to escape from them damn it what am i going to do i have no way of getting out of it and even if i did daniel would be left looking like an idiot i couldntdo that to him i know he ignoring me and avoiding me like the plague but i cantbring myself to embarrass him like that but i think it would be best just to forget my feelings for daniel and move on sigh on a completely different subject that little piece of advice remus gave me has been nagging away at me for what seems an eternity i mean seriously what does love can cause people to do crazy things even hurt the objects of their affections have to do with any thing i mean i haventhurt anyone i love at least not to my knowledge though he could be talking about the hurt being inflicted upon me but who would be doing that that would mean that some one actually likes me but that not possible at least i dontthink that it is i mean who would like me the only person who has wounded me lately directly is daniel but he didntdo this out of love he thinks of me only as a sister so i dontthink so that only leaves me with no one i cantthink of any one other than daniel who has caused me any emotional pain lately maybe remus is just of his rocker i think he is the sensible marauder has finally lost his marbles but speaking of remus i heard him having a hushed debate with someone i still trying to figure out who in the library after charlie left on monday i was researching my herbology project about magical plats and their medical uses and properties i have to choose one to raise and care for that ll be fun any way it was quite intriguing as remus would say so i was just standing in the herbology isles searching through those musty old books that no one has looked at in centauries and all of i sudden i heard voices arguing over something which was a bit hard to determine it isntfair to her you re toying with her emotions remus settle down i not toying with her feelings at all i just trying to get her attention prongs making a girl miserable isntabout to get you into her good books i didntmake her miserable how did i make her miserable there was a silent pause and i could tell remus was glaring at whoever he was talking to i know all about padfoot little intimidation tactics i heard the other guy curse under his breath how did you find out i saw padfoot right after his interrogation oh remus was doing the piercing look thing again what did you think you were doing the poor boy wontgo anywhere near her and she doesntunderstand it remus voice rose a couple of octaves i know the second guy was cowering because even i winced i didntwant him petrified i just wanted to scare away competition remus juts got angrier at this and stepped up to full fledged venom scare away competition prongs you certainly did that but did you ever stop to think that maybe they liked each other that kid had been trying to work up the courage to ask her out for two years i know because he would ask me for advice and please tell me you dontmiss the glances she gives him they were slowly getting together and i thought my out bursts were bad oops no prongs oops isntgood enough they liked each other and then you come along and decide that no you want the girl killing whatever chance they had at romance silence remus sighed as though resigned to the fact that whatever they were arguing about was not going to go his way you had better treat her right if you eventually do get her after all the trouble you put her through i will moony i swear but could you maybe help please your better at this whole romance thing than padfoot and wormtail remus seemed to be considering this proposition before agreeing okay but you have to promise me that this is for real not just another one of your flings it isnti swear i really like her she different from every other girl i ve known remus sighed again fine then we that was all i heard because sophie baxter came up and started chatting to me apparently her and potter had been over by the next evening after she talked to me apparently they broke it off because potter said he fell for some one else and that it wasntfair on sophie if they kept going out what a load of bull potter just got bored like he always does however if just made sophie become even more smitten with him when i told sophie my opinion of the situation she scolded me immediately telling me how romantic he was how he changed pft potter changed i dontthink so of course my stifled giggles earned me a playful slap on the arm and a look you know james hasntbeen out with anyone this year apparently he been trying to get the attention of some one in particular she added as though hinting to something and widening her eyes for emphasis i raised my eyebrows wow two months without a girlfriend how does potter control himself oh really well i hope she knows what she getting herself into sophie hitched a knowing smile on her face oh i think she knows she looked at me meaningfully before wandering off in the transfiguration direction definitely a little loopy that one i dontknow what was with all the hinting but i think sophie may have had just one too many cheering charms she much too chirpy but i wonder what all that was about with remus i know i ve heard that name prongs before i just cantplace it and i wonder who it is they re talking about i mean she has two boys fighting over her affections and they seem pretty competitive about the whole thing lucky thing oh well i suppose i shouldntstick my nose into other peoples affairs and just worry about my own and i still say sophie is cuckoo sunday 7th november breakfast well that was a err interesting quidditch match can you say dirty my god the slytherins were awful i have never witnessed such revolting tactics before i think it because it potter last year and they are determined to end his four year winning streak they re rather bitter about the whole thing actually but they still suck even when they play dirty hopeless cases nessa dragged us all out of bed at 6 30 am to go to breakfast because she was nervous and wanted a bit of moral support of course she would never admit this instead she says that if we didntget up then there was no guarantee we would make it to the game i know better though nessa still gets nervous after being on the team for three years and likes to have us with her for support that doesntmean i was happy about getting up that early on a saturday the twins werenthappy campers either but we all realised nessa needs us so we get up with minimal amount of grumbling quidditch saturdays are the only weekends that the twins surface before ten period see we are good friends even if we complain about it later we all got dressed and put on our gryffindor coloured hats scarves rosettes and ambled down to breakfast i draw the line at a scarf banner and rosette rhi is like me only she adds a hat to her collection but the twins get decked out painting their nails and putting red highlights in their blonde hair the night before fanatics those two breakfast consists of the quidditch team rhi bridget dana cam and myself the team have got used to us sitting with them the first couple of times when tristan and nessa just got on the team they gave us weird looks but now their used to it bridget and dana of course always fight over who gets to sit closest to black and potter meanwhile rhi and i keep our distance cam tried to flirt with the new beater melanie higgins we saw her at tryouts and she was definitely the best beater out of the wannabes and she may not look it but damn that girl can hit a bludger to pluto and back i usually talk to mikey the fourth year seeker he the youngest on the team but he pretty funny quite sweet actually his name is michael but i call him mikey and he calls me lilly billy we have a unique companionship of sorts the rest of the team call him michael or mike rhi and daniel kept nessa and tri apart by sitting in between them they snip away at each other all the way through breakfast it their personal way of relieving stress snap each other heads off while picking on each others playing technique and what not mikey and i get along well he makes all these stupid jokes that you canthelp but laugh at he adorable the rest of the team picks him on regularly for his inexperience but he a bloody good seeker all the same and they all know that remus and peter came down shortly afterwards and sat near me and mikey while potter encouraged everyone to eat something those two arenttoo bad but i am rather wary of remus now he knows too much about me for me to be entirely comfortable around him but peter and mikey are just plain hilarious when they get together all the hare brained schemes they come up with they always manage to make me laugh they had just devised an amusing plan involving the slytherin quidditch team fluffy pink bunny costumes and the hogwarts school song when potter asked for something up our end of the table remus and i were in fits of hysterical laughter and peter and mikey were trying to find a way to execute their prank needless to say potter didnttake kindly to being over looked in this manner i know you re probably thinking i should have learned my lesson by now not to ignore james potter but i couldntexactly breath at that moment so i think i should be excused evans pass the bacon already my head snapped up and i looked at him puzzled for a second before realizing what he wanted mikey passed me the bacon here you go lilly billy before the ogre eats you this set me off giggling again while potter glared at mikey for calling him an ogre watch it mike you dontwant to go calling your captain names or you just might find yourself in the stands mikey just grinned naw you wouldntground me jamsie i the best seeker you got completely true of course but potter didntseem to like being reminded of that fact and was steadily going red not a good sign i think it all the pressure from being captain that gets to him on match days tsk tsk mikey we wouldntwant you to get an ego problem now would we and your supposed to respect your captain you little prat i scolded jokingly michael pouted at me mikey potter asked raising an eyebrow in question i shrugged and went back to my breakfast with peter and mikey re discussing their plans for the opponents with renewed enthusiasm he not the only one who can get away with being aloof and brushing people off the game was well it was ugh i canteven explain it it was that bad the slytherin quidditch team is all boys and their captain is particularly nasty towards our team because since he been quidditch captain he never won the quidditch cup due to potter and his fine assembly of team mates i think that through out the game about 20 fouls were committed by the slytherin team yes that how bad they got they really are sore losers i think half the time i spent yelling insults at the slytherin team and the other half digging scar marks into my face from worrying about the grievous bodily harm being done to our team i almost lost my breakfast when a bludger caught daniel right in the chest the quaffle was up the slytherin end with our chasers forming an excellent hawkshead attacking formation daniel had no reason to be on look out but the beaters employed a dopplebeater defence both hitting the bludger at once towards daniel it hit him straight to the sternum and he fell from his broom three quarters of the crowd lost there heads and the insults flew thick as mud towards the slytherin team madame korkoff did her nut in she blew her whistle and screamed at the beaters before awarding gryffindor a penalty shot nessa scored of course that was just the beginning that was the dirtiest game i have ever seen played there was blagging blatching blurting bumphing cobbing flacking snitchnipping stooging and many more i couldntbelieve it the slytherin beaters were ruthless they even attacked nessa with their club they picked on nessa and melanie constantly because their girls slytherins think quidditch is a man game obviously korkoff was a bit hoarse by the end of the game though it was interesting to see tristan reaction when nessa was hit he was livid worse than potter even and potter was pretty mad when time out was called so that nessa could be cleaned up for the second time he stormed over to korkoff and had a full on blow out about the slytherins and how they should be sent off the field and made to forfeit we could hear it all the way up in the stands not pretty at all the look tristan was giving the beaters was nothing short of terrifying i pretty sure those two slytherins are going to mysteriously turn up at the hospital wing completely covered in hexes he would never admit to it but i know he cares a great deal for nessa and anyone who hurts her has to answer to him last year nessa ravenclaw boyfriend cheated on her with some blonde bimbo they both disappeared and about a week later they were found in dungeon three shivering and rambling about psychotic pink bunnies when word got out tri had a rather large smile on his face especially when nessa said they deserved it it got me wondering about those two that for sure but anyway we won anyway by loads even though it was a horrific game the slytherins are actually a pretty good team it just that they focus too much energy on causing as much damage as possible mikey caught the snitch before things got too bad though he didntlook to good when he landed mikey caught it the worst out of the whole team he the smallest and one of the more important players as i said the slytherins were ruthless we all spilled onto the pitch to congratulate the team and to make sure there was no lasting damage done i ran over and hugged both tri and nessa they werenttoo bad but exhausted poor mikey though he could hardly stand up straight i went and slipped his arm around my shoulder to give him some support he gave me a grateful smile and rested a bit of his weight on me he wasntvery heavy so it didntreally make much difference damn i such a mother hen the slytherin team was not pleased with their loss and glared at us before stalking past on their way to the change room however one felt that they had to have the last word well well well what do we have here the mudblood whore playing mummy you should be used to that by now bloody reggie king of all sore losers i was flabbergasted he was just so nasty true regulus and i are pretty mean to each other but he has never insinuated that i i sleep around i almost let go of mikey i was so shocked the whole gryffindor team was in shock of what black had just said sirius clenched his fists and let out a very dog like growl regulus smirked at us like he had just won the war enter potter shut up black dontcall lily either those things again if you like the shape of your face just because you lost spectacularly is no reason to take it out on innocent bystanders 15 points from slytherin and a detention black sneered at potter if it isntthe golden boy of hogwarts himself what do you care if i call her that it not like this little mudblood bitch is worth anything bam potter lost his cool and black lost his teeth literally sirius had to jump forward and pull potter off regulus by this time the whole team was ready to jump him they were furious at the nerve of black black stood up again hitching a sneer back onto his face is that the best the almighty potter can do smack i punched him square between the eyes my senses back along with my temper oooh he going to look a treat today with two black eyes and a swollen jaw how dare you you spineless piece of filth what qualifies you to judge me or anyone else for that matter you have no right to insult me i was showing kindness to a fellow gryffindor not that you would know anything about such a concept black he looked like he was about to retaliate so i punched him again square on again talk about accurate this time cam pulled me back and kept me from hitting him for a third time dontspeak you horrid disgusting little cockroach if i ever and mean ever see your ugly mug again you will find those black eyes permanently on your face now sod off before i break every bone in your worthless body black hurriedly got up and scampered away like a dog with its tail between its legs cam let me go and i turned around to the team and friends behind me i had tears glistening in my eyes nessa rhi dana and bridget rushed forward and engulfed me in a group hug with a collective oh lily i must say it was comforting to have my friends around me like that when they let me go i managed a smile come on dontwe have a victory party to attend i choked out they all smiled at me nice punching evans how did you get so good sirius asked patting me on the back i grinned i have an older brother he keeps me on my toes everyone laughed as lily said we have a victory party to attend with more than one victory to celebrate i think lily deserves a cheer for berating the crap out of regulus black potter proclaimed smiling at me almost fondly the party in the common room was awesome we cast a silencing spell on the common room so that we could party into the wee hours of the morning there was sooo much food and bottles and bottles of butter beer some how this all just appeared and we hooked up some music from the wwn wizarding wireless network on the radio i had an excellent time talking joking and dancing with my friends all night but just have one question concerning potter since when has it been

i e w absolute shocker by jamesroxmysox disclaimer i own nothing recognisable from the harry potter books or movies that belongs to j and warner brothers studios tuesday 9th november library i think i just got the worst news of my life this morning apparently i am to have a coming out party i know what your thinking a what party well you see my dad family is rather well to do and my mother well my mother is the original social climber her and my sister fuss about absolutely everything and know everyone business and my mother makes sure the whole family is seen at all the right events my dad brothers and i couldntcare less about how people see us my mother on the other hand is obsessed with high society and in high society it is custom for the daughters to have coming out parties once the young ladies come of age they are formally introduced to society biggest load of wank i ever heard but here you go it took me three months to talk my mother out of making me a debutant last summer i mean why would anyone want to walk down a catwalk like a piece of cattle at market prospective husbands that is why all this takes place to find me a husband personally i think she balmy i sixteen for christ sake my dad has the same attitude but he just rolls his eyes when she starts up and goes back to his paper later on he brings me bowl of chocolate ice cream tells me not to worry i can marry whoever i want my mum and i always have these big fights especially over the prospective husband issue petunia was a good little girl and did everything she was told a queen debutant ms society and is now about to be engaged to a whale of man that my mother picked out i used to just stand there and take her verbal abuse but then i hit fifteen and thought screw it so i started to shout back the first time i did this my mother was so shocked she burst into sobs and managed to choke out why are you so difficult lillianna now she tries more subtle tactics dontget me wrong i do get along with my mother i love her and i know she loves me and that this is just her way of doing what she thinks is best for me it just that i have always been the more difficult child out of the four to raise i steadfastly refused to grow up into the wallflower my sister has become i voice my opinion scrape my knees and play fantastical make believe all the things frowned upon by our society especially in women you can tell i popular with the great aunts all right so i hated by ancient relatives no biggie i can deal with that as horrible as it sounds they ll kick the bucket soon enough and then be on their way to that big country club in the sky but a coming out party has she truly lost all sense of reality me in a big white dress smiling pleasantly at senile delegates with values and attitudes based on the fourteenth centaury feudal system forced to dance with some pompous son of an important member of society oh of course and do pass the cucumber sandwiches gag sod that as if i would even turn up but what worse is mother wants to introduce me to society before the summer season starts and what better time than the annual christmas ball dear lord i think i going to hurl the annual christmas ball and she said this as if it were a great honor yep she definitely gone off the deep end this time like i want to go to the bleeding ball it full of stuffy self important deluded jerks that think they re some one in other words they re would be s if they could be s it drives me nuts and my mother happens to be one of the worst her and her friend vivian i hear them having tea sometimes during the summer and i just want to rush in there and beat them over the head with a foam noodle but what astounds me even more is the fact that she new about the ball hogwart is having how did she bloody well hear about that i swear she has spies she probably got to the twins they always got along well with her due to their mutual fascination with clothing but i swear i will find out her news source and then discretely resolve the issue most likely by blasting the good for nothing sneak into oblivion but in a private and proper manner with no witnesses i have already been instructed that i going to the ball and that i am to find a date um how about no i dontagree with balls in the first place so but i have to go any way and with daniel so that that part done with though i could probably find a way not to go just to spite her i am not to wear white as my mother has already picked out a ravishing cream dress for the annual christmas ball as my coming out dress and i cantbe seen wearing the same color twice because gasp people might think it the same dress yeah like people from hogwarts are actually going to see me at the annual christmas ball bloody cashew now i have to figure out a way of becoming conveniently sick on christmas eve but work it so i not sick for the rest of the holidays or christmas day with out raising suspicion this is going to be a tricky one like i want to go to that ruddy ball anyway all they do is sip brandy and port go around gossiping about on another and being two faced mongrels that sounds like fun i cantwait to get there ugh once you turn sixteen you are of age and then you have to full fill your duty of being present when your younger you re called upon by your parents to be introduced to some relative or are aid to your parents bragging we ve all been a show pony at one stage or another i was planning on saying that i needed to look after harry this year because there are no other kids his age but now i have to actually be present in the ballroom at least will is going to be there so i not completely out on my own i will have to continue scheming later charlie here for tutoring presently charlie is reading my mother letter with a very amused smile on his face it threatening to become a grin wait it just did he now full on grinning at my letter i still say that grin is familiar i cantwork out were i know it from i just do you have a very interesting mum if he smirks i ll whack him one yes she thinks so and that she incredibly beautiful and charmingly charismatic and entertainingly witty ugh vain as hell too i guess you dontget on that well try world war is a regular occurrence in our house over the holidays you could say that but as you can see from the letter social climber is the only word that can best describe her i swear if that grin gets any larger it will crack his face dontworry my mum a bit like that too i scowl at the letter it bad enough that i have to go to one ball now i have to go to two charlie frowned a little i know what you mean my parents go to one of these christmas parties every year and my brother and i get dragged along i gave him a sympathetic smile then you can understand my great dislike for going he smiled only too well i smiled back at least someone else knows the torture of these balls okay charms homework please let see if you re learning anything the more i see charlie the more i like him he like a little brother always there to talk to me when i feel absolutely rotten it very comforting apart from the fact that he knows a hell of a lot about me such as the psycho mother which even my friends hardly know about charlie is definitely a good friend to have thursday 11th november history of magic you know i had the weirdest revelation today more like an epiphany actually you see i always knew there was something different about remus a little off not weird as such just something didntfit you know he always sick and goes missing every few weeks now that i know i feel like a complete idiot for not recognizing his condition straight away i only found out because i pieced the clues together after overhearing one of potter and black loud conversations at lunch i wonder how moony is doing yeah that transformation was shocking last night transformation i snuck a peek at them as they both winced what set him off asked potter someone had been in there since last month and had been on the bed potter looked at black for a moment was it just one person or two black looked up quickly i know what you re thinking prongs no it was just one a girl any idea who how long ago potter seems quite distressed no idea who it was but it was about a week to two weeks ago but padfoot how did she know how to get in to the shack i froze shack a week to two weeks ago a girl the bed bollocks how the hell did they know about that i mean how could they tell that i had been in there what were they doing in there in the first place unless dunno but it seemed she knew what she was doing you would think she knew what it was used for but padfoot no one could possibly know by this time i was completely puzzled as to how they came by this information well she would have to be smart to work out the shack isntactually haunted and as well as what it use was i couldnthelp but smile do you think it was a villager or a student prongs think about it all the villagers are scared witless of it only a student would be curious enough to go in there very true i a curios person i suppose your right padfoot do you think we should try and work out who it is nah they dontknow who uses it so moony is safe moony remus he a poor thing i wonder how old he was bitten it was definitely a full moon last night i know because i was sitting at the window next to my bed looking at it so that how he got his nick name poor remus it must be hard being a werewolf i had my last mouthful and snapped my book shut i turned to leave and ran smack into someone good grief what a klutz i canteven leave the great hall with out at least one accident i apologized profusely while collecting my books and wondering how in the name of all things holey i managed to be such a disaster when i finally look up at my innocent victim who should i run into none other than remus he looks a bit tired and kind of white actually he looks like he in shock oh remus i really sorry you know that i like unexplainably klutzy i shook my head and smiled at him he still seems a bit weird but gives me a timid smile sorry again i said as i hurried away i looked back at him briefly as i made my way to the doors remus had made his way over to black and potter and all three of them were now staring at me i think i know why now it took me a while to figure it out potter said something about setting him off i can only imagine that when remus goes to the shrieking shack to transform having a humans scent in there doesnthelp and when i bumped into him just then he must have recognized me no wonder they were staring at me seeing as how close i had been to their conversation now my dilemma is whether or not i should let remus know that i know but maybe he already knows i know or even further he knows i know he knows i know wait i confusing myself here i think i shall just carry on as normal and just disregard that piece of information well and truly right carrying on oh i found out who those nicknames belong to though remus is moony as i knew before black is padfoot and potter is prongs i can finally make sense of that conversation from the library potter likes some girl and is getting his buddies to help him make her come round to his reasoning the intimidation is the worst though poor girl i mean i know potter a prat but this is slightly obsessive dontyou think i never thought he d sink this low damn it i doing it again i sticking my nose into other people affairs bugger i may as well resign my self to the fact that i am going to be the next sophie baxter all right so not that bad but still cam wants to write me a note so little lily what are you up cd contemplating what future i have as a gossipmonger le sorry to break it to you sweet heart but you wouldntmake the grade and why cameron do you say that cameron now well i sorry to say you re much to sweet sweet cameron davies do you think i am incapable of being nasty to put it simply lillianna evans yes sure you could be nasty or scathing but then your conscience would catch up with you and drive you mad till you apologised to no end to whoever it was that you paid out on damn your right why were you considering a future as a gossip any way i accidentally overheard a few conversations and just happen to have a revelation at lunch accidentally overheard is there such a thing yes on both occasions i was minding my own business when the people talking happened to come with in my range of hearing cam gives me a disapproving look what wouldntthe noble thing to do be walk away or move the first time i was looking for a book for my astronomy the second time i was eating lunch you want me to inconvenience myself just to please a couple of jerks who should keep their voices down who are said jerks complete prats we established that tell me their names why should i because i want to know and i your good buddy cam also if you donttell me i ll just go through this lovely diary and find the answer myself you wouldn t try me fine it was remus potter and black what did you find out and you called me a snoop i never called you a snoop i just implied it now what did you find out just what their nick names are how much of a prat potter is with a really twisted sense of romance and something about remus which i am not going to tell you cause it secret fine i wontask about lupin but what was that about potter and romance he a nut case worse than the twins come on lily no ones that bad yes he is i thought that dana and bridget came up with some pretty weird schemes to get a guy but potter is out right manipulative cam gets a weird look on his face what he done i not really sure but from what i can figure out potter has the hots for some girl and has assigned his good friend black to intimidate any one who could be competition he then roped remus into helping with the wooing of said girl maybe he really likes her cam dontbe ridiculous potter and black are the schools two biggest bachelors with a tral of broken hearts following behind them a mile long they never stay with one girl longer than a couple of weeks you never know this could be different potter hasntdated this year go him why does everyone find that such an important fact and feel the need to point it out to me who else told you about that sophie baxter oh well she d know any way do you really think that underhanded methods of intimidation are going to win fair ladies heart when she finds out about it well maybe they thought she wouldnt ugh i dontcare about potter i just feel sorry for the poor girl who is having her life manipulated to due to the whim of the great james potter cam raises his eyebrows any idea who no but i think that someone should tell her oh i think she knows about it she just not entirely aware it happening what that supposed to mean do you know who it is if you do you should tell her i ll think about it no you have to tell her cam cameron yammy cammy cameron davies answer me fine he being a twat but i will find out who it is from cam whether he likes it or not and then i can warn her as i said poor girl hey everyone thank you very much for your support i sorry i couldntwrite answers back to you but i have 30 mins on the computer that has internet access so i have to make this quick thank you very much to all 14 reviewers missmcweir vaness black and zabini

thank you of course to my wonderful beta cait please remember to r e v i e w absolute shocker by jamesroxmysox disclaimer i own nothing recognisable from the harry potter books or movies that belongs to j and warner brothers studios monday 22nd november girls dorm well tonight was eventful as ever first was the prefect meeting of course black couldntlet it pass peacefully he become rather narky true he never comments or comes near me during class or in the halls he too scared i might hit him again but in the deserted classroom we use for prefect meetings black seems to get his old self back complete with inflated ego rolls eyes why does he have to be such a drop kick huh i positive he was dropped on his head as a child either that or sirius did something that damaged the thought process during a crucial stage of development sounds like something he would do anyway everything was going dandy till amy mentioned that posters for the ball were being put up on house common room notice boards needless to say black was not happy about this reminder are you still adamant that we have to act like a bunch of muggles just to please the mudbloods oh he asking for it everyone except the other slytherin prefects were glowering at black now why does this sound familiar black potter growled black just sneered at him you re no better potter a family of blood traitors oh geez he really is upset if he having a go at one of the oldest wizarding families in britain i better step in and take the heat before he gets himself in real trouble give it a rest reggie he swivels to glare at me of course the mudblood bitch i roll my eyes and stand up to face him potter looks like he about to hex him till next thursday reggie i thought you would have got the point by now even if you do have the intellect of a troll muggleborns are part of the wizarding community so deal with it i think his head is about to explode it so red they most certainly are not especially the self important little mudbloods like you i sigh dear lord i think we ve been through this at least 100 times before 20 points from slytherin for foul language and racist attitude potter not happy and taking points would be one of the first signs that he losing his cool or it could be his neck becoming steadily scarlet black changes the direction of his glare again potter of course you seem to have a fondness for mudbloods one in particular black glanced at me as he said this what he thinks the mudblood insult is supposed to affect me idiot but i fed up with his incessant whining black sit down and shut up before i make you the ball is happening whether you like it or not and i know this may be difficult for you to understand but the world does not revolve you black gave me one last glare before sitting down i sat down as well and turned my attention back to amy once i got back from the prefect meeting i was attacked as soon as i walked into our dorm well i thought i was being attacked anyway it turned out to be a hysterical bridget she was hugging me and sobbing into my shoulder i sent a very distressed look at rhi nessa and dana her and matt broke up dana mouthed to me matt was bridget latest boyfriend and we had all thought him to be a decent guy apparently he not so decent oh sweetie what happened i tried in a sympathetic voice bridget just sobbed harder i looked over at the other girls all clustered on bridget bed bridget and i happened to er walk in on matt and maggie douglas in the library while they were in a very compromising position rhi answered i winced as bridget hugged me harder oh bridget it ll be okay it was better to find out what he like now before you got really attached bridget looked up at me with her big grey eyes but why wasnti good enough for him what was so horrible about me that he had to go find someone else we were on the bed by this time it hurt us all to see bridget like this as her body was racked with sobs dana had a particularly dark scowl on her face uh oh the twins are extremely close and couldntstand to see each other in any sort pain bad news for matt jefferies i can see the wheels turning as her beautiful face contorts itself even darker jefferies wontknow what hit him why do i have such bad judgement we were all fooled bridg consoled nessa but i seem to always pick the horrid ones maybes it because that the type of guy i attract the fuck wits she hiccupping now not good dontbe silly bridget there plenty of decent guys out there who want to go out with you she stared art me for a second that easy for you to say all the sweet ones want to date you hell you have two of the cutest and sweetest guys here chasing after you now it was my turn to stare you have to be kidding me what guys are chasing after me the chasing involving a guy and myself was daniel being chased away i shall put that comment down to her hysterical state of mind we spent the next hour calming bridget down and letting her cry on our shoulders before i had to go patrol oh what fun i have patrol with potter when i should be there my friend who has just had a very nasty break up though when i think about it it may have been an escape because bridget can become quite violet when she gets upset about a messy break ups her eyes had gone red before so i guess it was a good thing i left when i did i met potter in the common room and we made our way out into the main area of the castle usually we just go around in silence with potter making the odd comment every now and then tonight i was paying him no attention what so ever and i almost ran into several statues i finally ran into a suit of armour as potter was helping me up he couldnthold back his curiosity any longer what the matter you ve been rather preoccupied i chewed my lip for a minute deciding how much i should tell him it nothing i ve just been entertaining ideas of matt jefferies joining the headless hunt potter raised his eyebrows that rather harsh do you have these murderous thoughts regularly or is this a special case he asked in an amused tone i glared at him no i don t jefferies is a two timing jerk is all he looks confused for a second you were dating jefferies no bridget was you know one of the twins and he decided to have his cake and eat it too he went off with bloody maggie douglas only to have bridget and rhi walk in on them potter grimaced so naturally i am plotting jefferies and douglas down falls since i am unable to comfort my friend at this moment due to patrols potter nodded in understanding so what are you going to do to them i not sure yet but i ll have to confer with dana before we take any action i might actually have to restrain her from rendering jefferies reproductive organs useless potter winced now that is harsh cantyou settle for a simple highly embarrassing prank i looked at him appeal to dana not me though social standing will be the least of his worries when we re finished with him i dontknow if it right that you talk about this sort of thing with such passion i never figured you as the sort that likes to inflict pain potter said with a smirk ugh that bloody smirk i glared at him if you mess with my friends you re asking for it that about the only thing that can bring out my malicious streak well that and my mother potter knits his brows together is that why you ve never completely decimated black uh huh i can handle all of his pathetic attempts at intimidation and the idiotic name calling but if he was to say one word against my friends he would never see the light of day again i answered with a small smile on my face potter grinned i stared at him that grin oh my god thursday 25th november library on tuesday i had the most interesting conversation with charlie okay so it was interesting for me and just plain painful for charlie but he deserved it he deceived me the little cretin when he sat down next to me in the library on tuesday i hitched a sickeningly sweet smile on my face and addressed him in a voice that dripped with honey hello charlie he was actually smart enough to be afraid of me um hi i stared at him with a steady unblinking gaze charlie is there anything you would like to tell me such who you re older brother is he gulped you figured that one out i cocked my head to the side surprisingly yes i did did you know that grin of yours is a family trait charlie smiled weakly really who would have guessed i dropped all pretence of sweetness why didntyou tell me james potter was your brother er it never came up nice try kiddo charlie because i didntwant to be judged for having the wonderful james potter as a brother i pursed my lips charlie you should know by know that i dontjudge people by their families only by who they are he looked down and what do you mean it never came up all the times i was ranting about bloody james potter and you never once tried to interrupt me or make any attempt of telling me now i was hurt charlie had purposely kept this from me well what was i supposed to do plus for once i was hearing bad comments about my perfect older brother who every one else in this damn castle worships except the slytherins but they dontcount i smiled sympathetically i know only too well what it like to have wonderful older siblings will was a freaking genius he got a record number of owls was head boy and did excellently on his newts petunia was a bright student in her muggle school not one of the best but a high achiever but what really made her the apple of my mother eye was her social behaviour and various achievements as the perfect daughter ugh see what i have to live up to because i a witch and the second daughter i have to meet the standards set by both of my older siblings bloody bollocks i told charlie this and he seemed to perk up a bit i admit i was rather annoyed at charlie when i first made the connection between him and potter actually i was down right angry and betrayed but now i dontreally mind i still complain to him he understands where i coming from though i have no idea where that boy gets his word pronunciation and wand moment ideas from loony that the only word for it just this afternoon he did this weird complicated twist thingy instead of a simple wish and flick movement i swear potter done something to addle his younger siblings brain he and sirius probably had a game of who could screw up their younger brother more black won no doubt about that ugh right i ve had enough i hate hate hate transfiguration bloody mcgonagall she assigned this gigantically enormous transfiguration project on human transfiguration i an average student at transfiguration but this thing is massive the instruction notes were two and a half feet in themselves it mad i shudder to think how long the actual thing will be oh well my procrastination skills will of course be put well into practice i have no idea how i maintain my good grades when i such a slacker i do get things in on time but i finish it like the night before that why i such a stickler for punctuality i a perfectionist but i have a habit of leaving it to the last minute but i do use the time procrastinating to do productive things such as the witch weekly cross word reading the quibbler and reorganising the makeup in the bathroom okay so all those things are a complete waste of time but occasionally i do actually use the time to my advantage for example earlier i used the time i was supposed to use starting my transfiguration project sorting out my feelings for daniel i think this was an effective use of my time because that is one thing i have been putting off for well ever since i heard him and black in the library right well i took a good look at myself and at the situation and i came to one conclusion infatuation that was it i was utterly obsessed i think i was in love with the idea of being in love but i looked at things properly and could see that i didnttruly feel anything for daniel it was just my mind telling me i was i mean i get along with him well he very sweet and an absolute dish but i dontget that tingly feeling when i touch him or any of those things i dontfeel as though i could look into his eyes forever i suppose there just no connection i know that all sounds like clich and you just want to shout bollocks but i think i may have watched one too many disney movies wait scratch that i watched way too many disney movies what can i say i have an altered sense of reality for me love will have to come not necessarily in the form of a fairy tale prince but the guy will have to affect me like no one else has ever made me feel that a tall order i know but i ve always had high standards so what i felt for daniel was definitely infatuation or puppy love as people sometimes call it another productive way i spent my time was pestering cam though this one was not nearly as productive as the whole resolve what you re feeling thing but it took up time i have been pestering him for a grand total of let me think 14 days two weeks exactly he not happy about it either i think he was about to box me one or hex me at the least so i decided to confine my interrogations to the history of magic room well mostly i ask him one question every day at breakfast he gets all grouchy and looks uncomfortable and the others just give us weird looks i think cam told the others what it is about because every morning when i ask the others look sympathetically at cam and try to distract me hey i admit i am rather oblivious to most things but i not completely blind now in hom it a different story that when i truly get my information he keeps refusing to say anything but every now and then he cracks and gives me some seemingly useless and generic piece of information this is what i have so far it a girl i would never have guessed but you never know potter could have swung that way in 5th 6th or 7th year if he were cracking on to any one younger than 5th year i d have labelled him paedophilic not in slytherin really there goes my entire suspected victim list boyfriend no i should bloody well hope so but i really wouldntput it past potter to poach some other bloke girl some observations this girl obliviously doesntlike potter doesntknow he exists or is just playing hard to get considering the number of girls that throw themselves at potter i think the latter is the most likely potter is trying exceptionally hard personally i think he just likes the challenge and the thrill of chase potter is being sneaky and underhanded surprise surprise it should be expected really well from all those clues i sure have narrowed it down from 1008 approximate total number of students at hogwarts down to what to 504 girls approx in hogwarts to 216 girls approx in 5 7 year to 164 girls approx not in slytherin to i have no idea how many have boyfriends ahhh this is hopeless i have to investigate 164 girls wait make that 163 i know for a fact that i can exclude myself i am definitely not james potter type saturday 27th november common room ugh you know how i said a quidditch match is the only thing that will get the twins out of bed on a saturday before 10 i was wrong there is just one other thing clothes shopping i know dumbledore a brilliant man and all but really did he have to go and make a hogsmeade weekend especially for the ball there is such a thing as owl order the news was announced last monday the twins already had our whole day planned by lunch yes that is an our in there apparently nessa and i are hopeless with clothing so we need the supervision of the style queens so they though they might as well bring rhi along and make it a girls day out it started at six o clock this morning when i was literally dragged from my bed shoved in the shower and then hauled to breakfast along with nessa and rhi dana and bridget had been up since 5 30am we were in hogsmeade for 7 o clock precisely when all the dress shops open and all the normal teenagers are still in their beddies fast asleep and woke even think of waking up till for at least another two hours dana bridget rhi and nessa all had fun dressing up in the gorgeous muggle dresses the various boutiques had to offer personally i was happy to take the first dress i picked up and be down with it but oh no i had to try on the whole freaking shop i have no idea how many dresses i tried on but it was a little as possible dana and bridget showed hundreds of dresses but i felt like being fussy and refused most of them too revealing it lace you expect me to wear that colour in public too frumpy just a sample of my opinions once we had all got two dresses each dontask why it was something the twins were on about we moved on to accessories i hate accessories they annoy me to no end bridget and dana wouldntlet me have any say in it any way i just bought the stuff i was told then we moved on to shoes i love high heels it is my one girly fetish i love high heels sparkly feathery bejewelled high heels but we were only in the shoe store for about an hour fun suckers once we left the shoes behind i lost the little interest i had for this whole ball thing we were the last people back from hogsmeade we almost missed dinner because bridget spotted this little boutique just as we were leaving and just had to see what the earrings in the window would look like on her ugh nessa and i have just escaped from our dorm nessa doesntmind dress shopping i abhor it but there is only so much one can take the twins have taken out every dress hair accessory make up bag and pair of shoes our dorm contains and decided that there was no time like the present to organise everyone outfits slow death of boredom it must be the only thing dana and bridget have ever actually prepared for period had it been left to me i would have found a dress the night before in my trunk some where and figured out the rest as i went a long but oh no not the damn twins but noooo they have to be organised for the first time in their lives nessa is spread on the couch and i curled up in the armchair next to her i just looked around and there is not one other girl down here most of the younger kids are in bed anyway but the older girls are all admiring today purchases oh for christs sake bridget and dana just came down here in a whorl of energy bringing colour swatches of fabric make up samples a couple of bags and a few shoes lily nessa we need to coordinate of course this caught the attention the whole common room seeing as it was all guys and i pretty sure they had never seen this type of display before they were all rather curios nessa was yanked into a sitting position still half asleep bloody hell i giggled bad move next second my diary was torn from my grasp as the twins bore down on us what the dana bridget is this really necessary we went through this about ten times today and do you have to do that here nessa and i were acutely aware that the whole common room was staring at us you d think this lot had never seen a girl before maybe they ve just never seen dana and bridget on fashion endeavour lucky bloody them well we wouldnthave to be down here if you were in the dorm like normal people dana scolded i stuck my tongue out oh yeah i really want to be swallowed by a pile of clothes i fine here what does she mean normal people look all the bloody people down here nessa and i were both about to comment on this when bridget cut us off like normal girls she glared at us honestly you two are as bad as this lot indicating to the boys surrounding us lily you re probably worse i gave her a death glare you would be too if this was how you spent the majority of your childhood i come to hogwarts to get away from this crap you two are just as bad as my mother out the corner of my eye i could see charlie grinning from his seat next to mikey dana rolled her eyes come on lily your mum isntthat bad she actually very good with fashion i huffed for a social climbing wannabe i mumbled what were you down here for again i said loudly i hate having this debate with the twins they think my mother is wonderful and i think well you know what i think of her anything is better than a debate over my mother with dana and bridget especially in the common room with about 50 or so eager males bearing witness nessa and i sat dazed as dana and bridget decided our futures in a flurry of colours textures and undistinguisable chatter with in five minutes they were gone the only evidence that they had been down here was the shocked looks on our faces the rest of the common room was grinning at us what never seen a member of the opposite sex before i yelled they all just turned backed to what they had been doing with large grins on their faces nessa settled back onto the couch i was massaging my head due to my newly acquired twin induced head ache charlie came over smiling sweetly hey lily i eyed him warily what do you want someone snappy i looked at him you try putting up with that since six this morning and see how you deal with it he chuckled that would be pretty bad i stared incredulously at him pretty bad you have no bloody idea i thought you said you spent half your childhood putting up with this shouldntyou be used to it i closed my eyes my head in my hands no it just makes it worse i wasntsupposed to do anything when i was little except wear pretty dresses and put my dolls in equally pretty dresses you didntcomply i snorted no bloody way i saw what my sister turned out like and flat out refused to do the same i think i may have told the nanny to shove the doll up her nose before runny out the nursery and in to the garden you really arentthe girly type are you my eyes snapped open that was not charlie voice i was faced with james potter lounging next to his younger brother now i see them together they are a spitting image of each other i think it was charlie blonde hair that threw me off but other than that they re identical ugh not you as well ones bad enough i noticed black was having a right good time torturing the hell out of nessa because she had to wear a dress she doesntdo dresses remus was sitting casually in the armchair opposite me dontyou like dressing up lily questioned remus to put it mildly no i closed my eyes and leaned back into my chair no frills and lace for you then much to mother disappointment i could feel them looking at me sod off what am i a zoo attraction what were you doing instead i smiled climbing trees building cubbies trying to abseil down the tree having sword fights with my brother those pretty dresses become not so pretty after that abseil down a tree i opened my eyes and raised my eyebrows at potter i never thought he would know about abseiling what i wanted to see what it was like so i got a rope and swung it over branch tied it around my waist and away i went of course my sister snitched on me so i had to spend the rest of the afternoon in time out potter eyes are bugging from his head what abseiling asked sirius it a muggle activity where you use a rope tied around your body and attached at a higher to gown down things like a cliff face potter explained i nodded sirius stared at me you did that by yourself for fun yes he grinned at me you re better than i thought what that supposed to mean i bet your mum had a heart attack charlie pitched in i laughed she went nutty all red in the face but i get into trouble so often she just says my name with an exasperated sigh at least your mum has given up on the speeches i get them at least once a week charlie said with a defeated sigh oh i do get the lecture it just i know the how a well brought up young lady should behave speech off by heart plus i have daily reminders elbows off the table ankles crossed not legs sit up straight shoulders back blah blah blah ugh she a nightmare to live with but enough of horridly annoying mothers what did you lot do in hogsmeade the marauders grinned at one another wait i dontwant to know nessa had fallen asleep on the couch slumped next to black i couldnthelp but smile if tristan saw this he would probably have a fit plus nessa was softly snoring come on sleeping beauty i think the dorm safe now what no dana i dontknow what colour bra you should wear wait what oh sod it we all couldnthelp but laugh at nessa as she came to her senses i was still chuckling as we made out way up the staircase nessa was mortified at what she had said and kept giving me glares what it not my fault she said that all right so maybe i could have prevented it but it was to funny hey guys

harsher terms are never directed at anyone in particular sunday 28th november lunch i am going to disown my mother seriously the woman has gone completely nutty before i thought she maybe had a mild case of premature dementia but i am now ready to believe she has full fledged schizophrenia not only has she picked out my dress and accessories for this introducing me to society thing i drew the line at shoes nobody chooses my shoes except me the raving loony i call mummy dearest has chosen my escort as well it sounds like she hired a male prostitute here the letter dear lillianna how are you dear i hope everything is well for you daddy and i are both fine although daddy has a bit of a head cold from all the stress he been under at work those incessant clerks at the bank are causing an up roar again about their wages honestly you d think they would find themselves fortunate to even be earning the amount they do henry is doing wonderfully at school he came top of his class for his latest mathematics test and was champion boy for his age group at the interschool athletics carnival although i have some concerns about his behaviour at home he will not go anywhere in the house with out that fake wand you left here over the summer i really do wish you would make sure all those things are packed away henry is getting his hopes up about receiving a letter this summer but he asks after you continually and he wanted me to say hello for him very sweet of him petunia is getting along fine her and vernon are quite happy they are taking their relationships in leaps and bounds i am so pleased she has found happiness with such a gentlemanly young man i sure she will write and tell you all about it i wontsteal her thunder by revealing anymore the main reason i am writing to you dear is that the annual christmas ball is fast approaching and we need to finalise all the details now i have arranged for your dress to be sent two weeks prior to the ball in case you dontagree with my choice and i have the jewellery and hairpieces waiting for you i know you said your one condition for agreeing to my choosing the dress was that you chose your shoes personally but sweet heart leaving it till only a couple of days before the event is not at all practical haventi taught you anything you must always prepare well in advance for such events petunia has already had her whole ensemble planned for months in advance we are going to go shoe shopping the monday morning you get back no arguments oh i just received wonderful news you know vivian of course well we were having tea the other day when plans for the annual christmas ball and your coming out came up in discussion and vivian asked if you would like to take her eldest son to the ball as your escort i said yes of course how could i refuse vivian boys are gorgeous i ve met them a couple of times and they are just adorable the eldest is very handsome and quite the charmer i think this is the perfect opportunity for you to get to know him vivian and i both agree that you would both look stunning together this is like a dream come true vi and i have been friends for such a long time it would be simply charming if we could call each other family so darling dontforget about the shoes and please donttake to long to write back we donthave that long before the big event good luck for the yule ball love always mummy xoxox p s will said he would write to you with in the next couple of days doesntit make you just want to run for cover that thing has set me up with some poor boy and is even hinting at marriage i ve never even met vivian sons before sure vivian and harold have dinner every now and then with my parents but we children are never invited to partake in the event they also sometimes go on holiday together during term so of course the children are at school but i hardly know them let alone their children the mad woman is suggesting i marry someone i have never even met and that she has only met a coupe of times came up in discussion i highly doubt it those two old crones had probably been planning this since the day we were born it would be simply charming if we could call each other family not exactly subtle is she for some reason this doesntseem like a spontaneous decision that i go with vivian son especially since this is my first official time mingling with society wouldntthat ward other suitors off if i happen to be on the arm of a very handsome chap who is quite the charmer on my first outing in society looks to me as though my future is pretty much stiched up well at least from my mother point of view i wonder how old he is vivian eldest i mean he must be younger than petty or else they would already be engaged and vernon wouldnthave gotten a look in so he either a year older than me or my age ugh great i have to spend christmas eve with a pompous arse and i canteven ditch him because i if i do he ll tell his mother who will tell my mother and then i will really be in the sticky brown stuff this just plain stinks if my mother thinks i am just going to sit here and let her coerce me into an engagement with some arrogantly pompous golden boy she has another thing coming the only thing that i can think of is sabotage i will go out of my way and do what ever i can to make him run for the hills by the end of the evening he will wish he was 10 000 miles away and begging his mother to find him another more suitable partner perfect plan really i have arranged for your dress to be sent two weeks prior to the ball in case you dontagree with my choice hah more like so she can nit pick and make sure it meets her expectations exactly i doubt i could even get her to let me pick a different dress if i tried i am just praying there is no lace frills polka dots or bows i had a party dress like this once and i absolutely refused to wear it it was a deep maroon colour with a polka dotted lace over lay frilly stuff around the arms and waist topped off with a bow around the middle i was eight and i think i was supposed to have afternoon tea with vivian and mother i refused to wear such a horrid dress instead i threw on shorts and a t shirt and joined will playing safari when i think about it vivian had brought her son with her and i was supposed to meet him for some reason or another the only time i have ever been invited to meet her children and i blew them off go me even then they were planning this i can see that now sodding schemers but i mean seriously who puts all that on a dress i mean it too much going on you have to just have one or else it too busy uh i just sounded like my sister shoot me now please put me out of my misery i beg you but really i mean i could handle the bow but lace frills and polka dots you can see why i dreading what this dress will look like now cantyou and as for petty writing to me i dontthink hell has frozen over just yet but i hope will writes soon i really need some one to whine to wednesday 1st december common room yay it the official beginning of the yuletide season i love christmas but i have never been allowed to put up decorations before the first of december because apparently it not christmas before the beginning of december which i suppose is true to an extent though i know people who have their decorations up half way through november some how i manage to control my urge to tinsel everything in sight but as soon as december first comes there is no turning back our dorm is turned into decoration central i have tinsel wrapped around the beds holly around the doors decorations hanging from the ceiling a mini christmas tree complete with ornaments and candles little santas hanging in the window fake snow and a sprig of mistletoe hovering around plus the mirror is charmed to sing carols i put all this up without magic the muggle way is so much more fun it has become tradition for our dorm to decorate on december first the other girls in our year some times drop by to help and muck around we make a night of it by snitching food from the kitchens and some drinks and have a beginning of christmas party all right so we just want an excuse to have a party but that not important last year i managed to get out of decorating the castle by negotiating with cissa and flattering diggory until his head was about to explode this year i appealed to amy because she is a gryffindor girl and so knows about our ritual she said she would sort it all out with potter and that i could have the night off yes well amy version of sorting it all out is not telling potter that way he cantblow up at her and everyone happy unless you are me sodding bad karma okay so i squished a bug yesterday but it was an earwig spiders i can handle but not earwigs they have big pincer thingies and i dontwant to be eaten that is no reason to have me caught dodging prefect duties i volunteered to make the trip to the kitchens and roped tristan into helping me after much groaning and complaining he complied and we set off singing christmas carols that had been tweaked slightly to our liking jingle bells slytherin smells reggie laid an egg we bounced into the kitchens singing at the top of our lungs only to stop mid song like a couple of deer caught in the head lights sirius black and peter pettigrew were both staring at us as though we were nuts with their eyebrows raised er hi bollocks why is it every time i come down here i run into the marauders well half of them any way sirius smiled slyly out for a romantic endeavour to the kitchens are we tristan face contorted into disgust at the thought of us being intimate i know for a fact that my face was a mirror image black you have a twisted sense of humour i told him scowling everyone knows tristan has a thing for nessa i continued with a cheeky smile tri turned bright red and lunged at me i dodged and ran around the other side of the bench lils you are going to pay for that big time i smirked am i just how pray tell am i going to pay you know that issue you re investigating well i could convince cam to hex the living day lights out of you the next time you ask a question about it uh oh the tables have turned oi that not fair i am going to find out about that whether you like it or not tristan rolled his eyes i sure you will he mumbled black had been looking between us the whole time with a confused look on his face huh doesntmatter tri answered black brushed it off and his smile returned so you have the hots for nessa i ll see if i can get our beloved quidditch captain to arrange something he said with a wink at tri tristan looked as though he was about to jump him so i stepped in thanks that would be great wouldntthat be great tri he gave me the death glare sure great this was followed by much mumbling under his breath i ll be lucky to make it to my 17th birthday sirius attention was turned to me hey arentyou supposed to be decorating the halls or something with all the other prefects damn it why canthe be as idiotic as his brother er well you see i not actually doing any decorating tonight she wagging so that she can decorate her own dorm with our friends it their tradition every year on december first they eat lots of food and decked the dorm out in tinsel i glared at tri thanks tri he just smiled while black seemed to become all excited what do you wear just you re underwear right i looked at like he was mad no sirius they do not swan around in their underwear while decorating their dorm sighed an exasperated peter he rolled his eyes sorry about him but he seems to think all girls do in their dorms is prance around in barely any clothing while gossiping i smiled at peter he was always good natured and friendly and the boyish charm really get to a girl many want to just run up to him and give him a hug like the big teddy bear he is sorry to disappoint but peter right sirius put on an exaggerated pout bugger well why d you have to ruin my fantasy we all laughed at this so you re not decorating like the other prefects er no sirius smiled and turned to peter that explains it then peter just nodded that exasperated look on his face huh explains what i enquired oh nothing just there are less prefects out in the halls than we thought there would be i couldnthelp but be suspicious of this i was just bout to ask what they meant by that when the door to the kitchens opened and things just went from uh oh to oh shit hey jamesie look who we ran into damn you sirius just my luck the one time i skip out on my prefect duties and i meet the head boy bleeding marvellous potter narrowed his eyes at tristan and i jamesie we have a dilemma tristan here has the hots for the lovely vanessa so being the beloved quidditch captain and esteemed head boy do think you could arrange some alone time for them potter relaxed a bit i ll see what i can do oh that would be good meanwhile i can goad both of them into admitting they like each other i couldnthelp but grin at him what are you doing here evans all the prefects are supposed to help with decorations tonight i was caught well er i actually have permission from amy didntshe tell you potter eyes flashed no she didntand what exactly do you have permission for to come to the kitchens and pinch food well someone isnthappy now are they i was tempted too ask what crawled up your arse and died but thought better of it he already seems on the war path no need to push it not exactly but i think we ll just get what we came for and leave you in peace i hurried off to find the house elves when i think about it what the hell was potter doing down there any way shouldnthe be helping the prefects not that i about to question him i not exactly his favourite person and i doubt he would appreciate having to explain himself to me once the house elves came back with my basket of food i quickly grabbed tristan and made a run for with only a quick goodbye to the marauders i could feel them looking after us well glaring in potter case geez someone has their panties in a twist tri raised his eyebrows who potter no the dancing monkey tri smiled he just a little disappointed about what doesnteverything usually go his way damn that mysterious smile not everything oh please what could potter possibly be upset about his bertie bott every flavour beans didnthave enough of his favourite flavour like what well lets just say things are exactly going his way oh the poor thing he must not have gotten as many slytherins with his last prank as he would have liked poor petal rolls eyes what a prat i had to get rhi to help me up the stairs with the basket it was so heavy tristan just plopped it down and ambled off in hopes of not seeing nessa so soon after the arrangement made in the kitchens half way through our merry making there was a knock on the door followed by numerous hollers of come in is lily here i was at the top of a ladder in a rather awkward position trying to wrap tinsel around the curtain rods er yeah what can i do for you i twisted around and regained my balance i recognised the speaker as samantha briggs a third year oh hey sam would you like to come in you can hang out if you like she smiled shyly really thanks lily with excitement on her innocent face she then sobered up but that not why i came up here james potter is at the bottom of the girl staircase and says he wants to talk to you the whole room went quite i cocked my head to one side did he say what about no he just asked if someone could go get you weird okay rhi can you finish with this piece of tinsel see you all in a second the room burst to life as i shut the door each one of occupants coming up with their own theory on why the head boy wants to see me ugh the gossip queens will get some thing juicy out of that when i went down stairs potter was waiting for me i met him with a curious look on my face you wanted to see me yes you know how you owe me a favour i was confused for a second favour what favour then i remembered the astronomy homework ugh i just realised why i buried that incident in the back of my mind bloody black and nadia stevens ewwwwwwwwww right yes the favour so you

thursday 2nd december transfiguration potter officially insane wait i officially insane i think i ve entered an alternate universe where chocolate chip cookies dontexist i mean seriously i repaid my favour to potter only to end up owing him another sick and twisted bloody world it was about 15 minutes later that potter came back down the stairs carrying a blank piece of parchment and something tucked into his robes i looked at him questioningly he ignored my curious glance follow me yes sir shall i lick the mud off your boots as well what does he think i am a mindless groupie how about you tell where we re going first that would be helpful er where to he sighed cantyou just follow me and find out later like hell i can no he dragged me away from my favourite tradition for what exactly potter better explain if he expects me to repay the favour he turned around with an exasperated look why do you have to be so difficult why do you have to be such an arrogant over bearing wanker just tell me where we re going and what i have to do the library well that a start but what exactly do i have to do and i ll tell you later ugh and he calls me frustrating potter just walked off in the direction of the library leaving me to catch up with him i was tempted to just turn right around go back up to my dormitory and rejoin my happy little party but then decided that potter would probably not appreciate this and would acquire an eve more negative attitude towards me so i scrambled through the portrait hole and jogged to catch up with potter so what exactly is it that you want me to do he didnteven look at me i ll tell you when we get there doesntit make you just make you want to smack him one no tell me i remember you said you wouldntmake do anything i didntwant to do potter looked at me with this wolfish smile on his face who says you wontwant to do me this favour bloody hell my eyes went wide and i leaned away from him potter quickened his pace and left me to my thoughts if that wasnta suggestive question i have no idea what is seriously it scared the bleeding daylights out of me i kept to the safe distance of 2m behind him and avoided all forms of eye contact from then on it was only my gryffindor pride keeping me from running back to my dorm where there was plenty of friends and food courage had nothing to do with it i was not put into gryffindor for my bravery it was the pride thing my ego nudges me into doing almost anything to keep it from becoming a shrivelled up meaningless little lump potter was waiting for me at the entrance to the library i was still quite wary of him but he just rolled his eyes at me when i gave him a weird look i followed him past the librarian madam pince who gave me a small smile to the study area at the very back of the library to my relief the other marauders were waiting for us i discreetly let out the deep breath i had been subconsciously holding dreading what the hell it was potter wanted what did you do to the poor girl james she looks like she going to her death okay maybe i wasntas discreet as i would have liked nothing he answered simply nah nothing i was just wondering how well liquid shows up on my skirt for the sake of it nothing at bloody all i gave him a filthy look why am i here potter gave me that look again and opened his mouth to give another disgusting comment i have no doubt in that thank merlin remus stepped in we need an alibi an alibi i raised my eyebrows normally that one of my jobs but some of the teachers namely the slytherin head of house are getting a tad suspicious of me and my credibility i just looked at him and i here because and we decided that we needed a new accomplice you happened to be the perfect candidate seeing as most of the teachers trust you and you actually owe james a favour great basically because i a geek i get sucked into this why couldnti be more like nessa no teacher would ever trust her as far they could throw her so what do i do do i really want to know sit here with remus for about an hour to an hour and a half while we go do what it is we want to do that not so bad apart from the fact that remus is a nosy prat with a substantial iq fantastic i gonna be grilled by mr sensitive over here because i intrigue him with my atrocious actions while helping the marauders keep out of trouble while they reek havoc on some poor unsuspecting individual bloody fantastic this sucks what am i supposed to do for that prolonged period of time watch the dust fairies mating dance they all just stared at me i rolled my eyes you come up with some weird shit but if that what want this coming from star boy who throws spaghetti at the wall to see if he ll win the quidditch match well what am i suppose to say if a teacher turns up say you re doing home work thanks peter that would actually be plausible if i had my books with me oh yes silly me why donti just get my books out of my amazingly magical invisible satchel that follows me everywhere i glared you know what the marauders arentas stupid as they seem they actually took the hint and winced here lily you can borrow some parchment ink and a quill of mine i looked around and sure enough all the marauders had their homework set up to look as though they had been diligently working away i took the stationary from remus and decided i may as well start that damned human transfiguration essay for mcgonagall fine i huffed off to find a couple of books when i got back potter black and peter had already left do i even want to know what they re up to remus analysed me for a second probably not humf i was bored brainless and absolutely outstandingly jealous of my friends who were quite happy singing carols putting up decorations and stuffing their faces after a while remus noticed my downcast look i assume you had something much better planned for this evening you dontsay a bizillion times better no offence meant of course what would you have been doing i noticed you werenthelping with the decorating caught again fulfilling my annual tradition of decorating my dorm with my friends and i had permission from amy to miss the prefect decorating tonight but i have to do it tomorrow well that does sound much more fun than wasting away next to me all evening he looks slightly put out awww remus i wasntinsulting your company i just rather annoyed that i happen to be doing home work when i could very well be feasting on chocolate chip cookies that reminds me there had better be some cookies left when i get back or the festive season will be kicked off with a rather fantabulous mass execution i went back to my work not that i did any work i basically doodled little pictures of holly bobbles and shining stars until i couldnttake it any longer oh my god who cares about human transfiguration i mean seriously do you actually need this in later life i suppose if you were interested in being an animagus then hey it all good but for the rest of us it pretty damn pointless though you may need to know about some of this stuff i find it just so damn boring remus lifted his brows feel better i was breathing deeply surprisingly yes damn it what an out burst i think i blew a fuse what was that about my needing to know some of this i stiffened crapolla i couldntkeep my big mouth shut now could i i um er i uh mean my hands got all sweaty from the pressure dontworry lily i figured you worked it out though i just have to ask if you have shared your little revelation with anyone relief swept through me i shook my head i haventtold a soul not even my owl riley who i tell absolutely everything because he canttell anyone well no one who could possible be understood by a human being if he can understand me at all that is no i swear i haventtold anyone thank you and thank you for staying my friend even though you know the truth i crumpled my forehead why wouldnti you re the same person the fact that you happen to turn into a slightly less pleasant form once a month doesntreally faze me seeing as our whole dorm does that remus chuckled thank you for comparing my lunar problems to the female menstrual cycle hey be grateful it for only one night we have to put up with a whole week and pms you got off lightly he beamed at me well that puts it all into perspective so it should i d hate to see you in a total perspective vortex you d be gone in seconds i got another odd look you know your eccentric train of thought makes you incredibly endearing i still trying to workout if that was a compliment or an insult maybe it best if i just leave it completely alone what it like turning into a ferocious monster once a month we can compare notes another bright smile at least i can make him smile it so so cravings pains back aches i gave him a sympathetic look i know what you mean those pineapple juice and mei goreng cravings really get me though you should try applying heat for the cramps and back ache it helps heaps i ll keep that in mind we fell into silence once again so lily have resolved any of your outstanding issues yet i groaned no though black has finally shut up about the whole boyfriend thing thank merlin since the quidditch match ah yes when you and james made his face indistinguishable from mouldy pizza i laughed yeah but what up with that remus looked at me searchingly up with what potter one second he is a perfectly nice human being helping me rearrange reggie face the next he jerk of the month following me around with death glares remus kept his expression neutral i wouldntsay it that bad he has the same intentions behind his actions i was not at all swayed from my stance really you try being on the end of one of his glares not a favourable place to be i can tell you as for his intentions what exactly are they preservation of stress ball victim remus was about to answer but i kept going i swear that boy has split personality disorder do you think they could help him in st mungo or would he have to be sent to some screwed up muggle psychiatrist you never know it could do wonders for him they say this disorder results from suppressed desires do you have any idea what desires potter is suppressing i looked at remus inquisitively wide eyed let see mr cool deal with that i not even going to comment if you cantbeat em confuse the heck out of em we re back but we saw fogarty heading this way so if we could all just act like we re working that would be good i glared at black as i went back to taking random facts about human transfiguration down do you think mcgonagall would let me do my assignment on werewolves i know it more defence against the dark arts but it has to do with transfiguration mainly though i suppose it could be seen as natural transfiguration potter black oooh fogarty looks a little peeved take down those idiotic mistletoe before i give you two months worth of detention i looked at the marauders their innocent looks are firmly in place but sir we ve been here all evening pft sirius couldntpull off an innocent act if he was shirley temple it true sir i ve been with them the whole time lupin dontstart i ve heard enough of your testimonies to last me well into my next life time he gone red professor we ve been here for the last two hours i dontknow what happened but it couldntpossibly be potter or black all five males turned to me in surprise is that you miss evans yes sir and you say these boys have been here since 7 30 if you say so correct sir they were helping me what with may i ask bollocks my human transfiguration assignment potter and black are two of the best in the school at transfiguration so i was entailing their help i showed him my random notes knowing full well that the bloke is so blind he couldntmake head nor tale of them luckily i had just added a diagram so it looked even better very good miss evans keep up the good work he turned to leave and i let out a relieved sigh miss evans what type of human transfiguration are you doing bollocks bollocks bollocks er animagus very good if you need help at all with the potion component donthesitate to ask i nodded thank god he blind if he had seen the colour of my face he would have known there was something up this is why i believe i now live in an alternate universe i managed to pull off lying to a teacher when normally i find it hard to lie to my pillow so we re the best in the school are we smiled black arrogantly i rolled my eyes i have no idea actually i made that up oh poor star boy doesntlike that never mind padfoot i sure you ll find someone else to stroke your ego black pouted you re pretty good at the whole creative answers thing i carried on packing up an over active imagination i answered nonchalantly oh crap now i have to do animagus for my project peter was rather perplexed by this why why because fogarty will go tell mcgonagall about this little meeting damn it they didntunderstand my predicament and this is bad how it bad because i am gigantically colossally awful at transfiguration and now i have to do a2 rollassignment on animagus could my night get any worse i hate this damn mcgonagall and her sodding assignments jamsie here could help yep my night can get worse that one statement is what nightmares are made of i looked at them suspiciously bloody star boy and his bloody loud mouth i did this tonight so i would no longer be indebted to potter and now you want me to owe him again well not meaning to boast snort from remus but james and i happen to be the best at transfiguration and i sure that the wonderful head boy wontmind upholding his responsibilities of helping younger students i looked at potter he seemed eager to help a little too eager fine whatever i snapped if you ll excuse me i have to go convince half the gryffindor female population i was not in a broom closet all evening believe me that is exactly what i was doing dana and bridget refused to believe that i could be gone for so long just to sit around doing homework and making excuses but this sucks i now have potter helping me with my assignment this is definitely an alternate dimension i was doing homework instead of listening to mindless gossip and hanging holly being a werewolf is not all that different from being female star boy was actually being sensible and helpful potter was willing to help and there are no sodding cookies thank you very much to all my lovely reviewers dontworry the next chapter will be up in a couple of days it typed been to the beta and just waiting to be uploaded thank you to annmarie aspasia tikvah ariel

thanks cait for reading reviewing and fixing all my despicable mistakes now i just have to ask who do you think lily will be going to the annual christmas ball with please remember to answer and r e v i e w absolute shocker by jamesroxmysox disclaimer i own nothing recognisable from the harry potter books or movies that belongs to j and warner brothers studios monday 6th december history of magic ludicrous that is the only word i can use to describe my life at the moment on thursday i spent my whole afternoon putting up more decorations in the halls i also had to bewitch the suites of armour to sing the carols i swear if i catch peeves putting in anymore of his own more imaginative lyrics he ll never put gum in another keyhole again though in the end i struck a deal with him he could pelt bobbles at people and sing crude songs if the slytherins were his victims he only agreed if i promised to provide said bobbles i was having a wonderful time of course singing away to deck the halls with bows of holly reggie black is a molly peeves is actually quite talented in song writing i would never have come up with that but seeing as molly is 17th centaury slang for a cross dresser it not really surprising then potter showed up at first i didntnotice him peeves was quite happy floating at the top of the stairs screeching away chucking bobbles at by passing students who i not sure were slytherins but he was leaving me alone so i wasntreally bothered and i was humming along to his tune while i put up the tinsel he just tried to strangle some sixth year with interesting partnership you have going i jumped so high i almost fell off my ladder bloody hell talk about sneaky i regained my composure before answering partnership potter looked over at peeves he usually throwing things at the prefects yes i had that unfortunate experience last year we struck a deal peeves must have heard potter because he turned around his little black eyes lit up with mischievous when he saw who it was well well well if it isntpotter the rotter potter smirked nice to see you too peeves do you remember what we discussed last night peeves evil grin just got bigger you know those firsties really could do with a festive fright and he swooped off before i could stop him i bit my lip worrying what mischief peeves could possibly reek on the unsuspecting first years potter seemed to read my mind dontworry he ll just give them a good scare a good scare is there such a thing i looked at potter disbelievingly before going back to my decorating where should i put these wreaths of holly he helping the world has gone wacko i raised my eyebrows at him he just raised his right back on some of the doors you sure goldstein wontmind damn i forgot about him the nasty tempered muggle studies professor who has a unhealthy dislike for the holidays does it matter he ll get over it eventually potter grinned at me i d like to see him when he first discovers it though i smiled as well that would be worth watching first he d go all splotchy then red then scarlet then almost purple before exploding at whoever happens to be closest to him i couldntresist i had to add the mistletoe goldstein would totally lose it over that potter cracked up and i couldnthelp but chuckle apparently mistletoe is inappropriate in a school as it encourages romantic relationships between students and contradicts the schools one metre between opposite sexes policy dontask that rule only exists to pacify the likes of goldstein i spent the rest of the afternoon hanging decorations with potter we actually got along quite well even managed to make up another couple of verses to peeves carols see it ludicrous that i actually enjoyed spending time with potter another ludicrous situation that i seemed to get myself into was a run in with two of my absolute favourite people who hold me close to their hearts if you follow the saying keep your friends close and your enemies closer that is finicky phinella and merry rosemary i was coming back from the owlery i had just sent riley off with a letter to my mother which took all my strength not to just write sod off on a slip of paper and leave it at that instead i wrote a letter that mocked my mother style of beating around the bush while subtly insulting the hell out of her i am quite proud of that letter actually anyway so there i am dawdling along thinking how pretty those big black storm clouds actually are when bam i run into the dream team i felt like dorothy skipping down the yellow brick road in her ruby slippers only to bump onto the original wicked witches of the west and east lily they squealed my eyes widened as i tried to find an escape i failed miserably on that one er hi they both ran up to me figures these two are friends they are pretty much alike arrogant opinionated and just plain nasty pieces of work how are you you know i dontthink we ve spoken in such a long time we ll just have to catch up really you dontsay maybe because you have never given me anything but glares since third year i stared at them wild eyed as they each took one of my arms and led me down the corridor er you know ella and i were just talking about you we thought it would be nice if we have lunch together at the gryffindor table er ok um phinella please call me ella okay right ella i sorry about your private potion project i really didntmean to smash it she got a cold look in her eye dontworry lily it was nothing i just whipped up another one she said airily now you have to tell us what is going on between you and james hey what james james who phinny and rosie exchanged a quick glance james potter of course silly rosemary supplied happily oh dear lord rosemary no off she slapped my arm lightly dontbe silly lily call me rose ugh kill me now look rose ella there is nothing between me and p oh look there some free seats at the gryffindor table right near the marauders phinny squealed sure enough we were at the great hall and there was three seats just waiting for us to sit in right next to the marauders oh my giddy aunt as they marched me down the isle dana and bridget saw me both giving me identical have you gone absolutely troppo looks help i mouthed they were both in shock at seeing me in the arms of two people who usually cantstand me believe me the feeling is mutual nessa rhi cam and tristan finally looked up to see what the twins were staring at needless to say they were all gob smacked at the company i was in i kept sending looks that said help me to my friends until i was forced to sit in my seat thankfully i was furthest away from the marauders phinny went round the other seat while rosie kept me sitting there by keeping a tight hold on my arm i finally gave up and started loading potato bake on to my plate i went into sulk mode hey james sirius funny seeing you here rosie giggled i had to see this the marauders all stopped what they were doing mouths full of sprouts and chicken and stared at rosie potter swallowed er hi rosemary rosie flashed him a smile how many times do you have to tell you to call me rose at least once more interjected black i was shaking with silent laughter covering my hand with my mouth to stop the sound of my laughter rosie was laying on the charm so thick i thought i was gonna need to climb on the table soon to avoid it what made it even better was that the marauders simply ticked her off and seemed extremely apprehensive about talking to her i really did try to keep my laughter under control but i ended up bent over with tears in my eyes phinella spotted me first are you all right lily damn that got the attention of all six people in front of me i wiped the smile off my face and sobered up oh it nothing a bit of um potato just went down the wrong way is all i said wiping away the tears my smile was still threatening to take over my face i chanced a look at the marauders and caught black eye they where twinkling with amusement i couldntcontrol myself so i turned away to smirk into my potato bake phinny and rosie just narrowed their eyes at me before turning back to the marauders again this is ludicrous i having lunch with rosemary macdonald phinella gooseberry and the marauders is there anything worse have you met my friend phinella gooseberry she in ravenclaw please call me ella all my friends do i couldntget rid of the damned smirk so i chanced a look at my friends who all had grins on their faces except rhi who gave me a sympathetic look before a small smile appeared i glared at them and was about to ask them to come and get me when i was interrupted dontyou think lily this brought me back to reality and facing a quite pissed off rosemary macdonald sorry rosemary i must have drifted off what did you say her eyes narrowed at me rose she growled and we were just discussing what the latest style of dresses were since the ball only two weeks away she continued in a lighter tone my disgust must have shown yep it just got worse lily not exactly fond of dresses and balls are you thanks peter er noooo they re not really my thing what an understatement that is but the sweet heart neck line is sooo in fashion right now and you really cantgo past organza i mean it like sooo silky and shimmery and stuff i said in a falsetto voice doing my best impression of my sister that i could manage you re sooo right lily why i was just looking at this gorgeous turquoise dress the other day thanks ella i rolled my eyes at the marauders as they went back to engaging potter and black in meaningless conversation i glanced at my friends and sent them an sos look there is only so much i can take of phinny and rosie they just smiled and waved excuse me rose but i have to go talk to dana for a second woah and i thought potter was bad with the death glares dontbe too long she pursed her lips as i left but turned back to potter with one final flash of her eyes i hurried over to my friends and let out a long breath when i sat down next to the twins having fun inquired cam so much they couldnthold it any longer the whole lot of them burst out laughing the rest of the table looked at us to see what was so funny i could feel the glares from phinny and rosie ugh shut up and find a way to get me out of there rhi settled down first what do you want us to do create a distraction ask me to go to the library remind me of a non existent tutoring session i dontcare just come up with something anything that will get me out of the clutches of the carnivorous air heads i smiled sweetly before walking back to my death oh lily dontyou think that james and sirius are just marvellous fliers ugh phinella please flattery will get you nowhere and those two certainly dontneed to be reminded of their god like status i guess so phinella eyes bugged out of her head you guess lily have you seen them fly rose asked indignantly geez this really gets old fast rhi hurry up on numerous occasions and potter put a little bit of effort in next time will you the last game was shocking phinny and rosie looked scandalised lily black was smirking while potter looked mildly amused peter and remus snorted into their lunches thank god nessa showed up hey lily i turned to her with a brilliant smile on my face hey nessa sit down she glared at me uh no thanks i just came to remind you that we were supposed to go study for charms i feinted surprise oh sure well er bye peter and remus stood up quickly hey lily wait for me remember you were going to help me with the protean charm i still dontget it yeah and i ll come with you i have to revise for that charms test next week looks like remus and peter like rosie and phinny as much as i do okay well bye guys i said with a little finger way phinny and rosie smiled politely while black and potter gave us dirty looks for deserting them needless to say i was ecstatic once we made it to the entrance hall i think they suite each other potter and rosie phinny and black phinella black actually sounds astoundingly good you know rosie is exactly potter type blonde hair big blue eyes long legs if it wasntfor the repulsive look on potter face and rosie eagerness i would say she was the mystery girl that leads me onto my quest to find the mystery girl i believe tristan held to his word and made cam promise not to give me any more information i haventgot one skerrick of data on this girl since our fateful trip to the kitchens so i decide to do a bit of investigation of my own i started with the fifth years because they were the easiest to approach i sought out the gryffindor fifth year gossips anna and judy good grief they could give sophie baxter a run for her money they gave me a list of girls who fitted my requirements of course they wanted to know why i was asking for this always on the look out for a good story i told them i was trying to figure out the crush of a friend of course i use the term friend very loosely so technically it wasntlying before i left though they asked one more question that had me wanting to scream is it true you spent wednesday evening in a broom closet with james potter i almost died though my blood pressure did double and my face turned crimson i politely told them that i did no such thing and walk away quickly before i lost it damn dana and bridget damn them to hell and back i went and found the one person i was certain knew every detail of the relationships with in hogwarts walls sophie baxter she probably already knows who it is that potter is after scratch that she does know i just have to get the information out of her without raising suspicion the thing is i didntactually get to say anything sophie was in a rather depressed mood and was elated when she found a sympathetic ear to prattle to a k a me seems she having withdrawals from potter she wouldntstop rambling on about how wonderful he is and how he ll forever have a piece of her heart get it together woman you were with him for one bleeding week you cantform that strong a relationship in only seven days i mean for merlin sake grow a sodding backbone of course i didntactually say any of this to her because she was already close to hysterics and that would have just sent her over the edge i just sat there while she cried on my shoulder and babbled in my ear i offered a tissue when the snot became to much the response was an enthusiastic thank you lily you re such a wonderful friend i only escaped when potter himself came back from quidditch as soon as sophie saw him she burst into hysterical sobs and ran up the girls staircase giving me one last hug before she went potter sent me a bewildered look and i just shrugged though this searching for the mystery girl thing is going to be harder than expected i went to double check a name with anna and she gave me a completely new list apparently the fifth years change their romantic partners more frequently than i change my under wear ludicrous that my new favourite word for my life and everything in it bloody ludicrous thankyou to everyone who read reviewed and just plain took a gander you are all still keeping me inline by pointing out all my miserable little mistakes that i make when i do last minutes changes thanks for that thank you to my beta cait who has to put up with me and my shocking writing skills thank you to

getting way to into this understanding of other peoples thing vh i know the hair gel freaking me out look at the collar on that cape so much for destroying stereotypes he looks like dracula bloody weirdo hey banana uh oh i not gonna like this you never call me that unless i not gonna like something well i was just wondering what you got up to the other night with potter i mean really got up too you donthave to hold back what makes you think i was holding back the first time oh please lily no one walks out on their favourite christmas tradition to sit around doing their homework talking to remus lupin especially when the incredibly dishy head boy has called them down from their dorms specially well that just what i did and since you think potter so amazingly hot you go after him i admit he a stud muffin but he not my type just tasty eye candy even you cantdeny that and i dontdeny it he is one fine specimen of the male species it his personality that less desirable his ego takes up more space than asia sure sure you donthave to contend with personality or ego when you re taking part in tonsil hockey you know eeeeeeeeewwww nessa that revolting and a horrible way of looking at things but since that your perspective why arentyou chasing potter around again he not my type hmmm i dontsuppose you prefer blonde hair and sea green eyes now do you well i suppose so ha any blonde haired sea green eyed quidditch player in particular what are you getting at tristan what about him dontgive me that you like him i do not oh come on nessa not even just a little bit nuh uh bummer tri

something are you serious uh huh it a pity you dontlike him he ll be crushed well donttell him i dontlike him why not once i tell him he can get over you so really it for the best if i tell him no i really should it what best for tri no well why not then because what a an accurate argument you ve won me over now really why not because well i sort of like him i raised my eyebrows at her she just gave me the death glare fine i wonttell any one good crap here comes twizledick to inspect our notes that the first part of my mission completed now i just have to get tri to admit his feelings he ll be a lot harder to crack though ah well better go vlad wants us to show him our notes common room will finally sent me an owl today but being the useless being that he is he forgot to send it till after breakfast so it came in halfway through my game of chess with tri i was quite put out i had been building up a conversation that would allow me to get information about nessa out of him but no bloody meridoc has to choose right then to come busting into the common room will had a bit of a lord of the rings obsession when he got him so we named him after the hobbit merry since it was peak hour in the common room many people were pointing at merry a couple of third years let him in and where cooing over him and giving him a pet i gave him the look and he stopped showing off long enough to give me the damn letter my reaction once i had read the letter i slightly upset by the information my brother provided tri grinned at me and asked what the matter was i snapped out of my trance i haventactually told my friends about the whole coming out thing for fear of the twins nominating themselves as my stylists for the event or worse still them wanting to be invited i gave a fake smiled problem no problem why would you think there a problem bollocks that was a shocking lie anyone could see through that i mean my voice was about three octaves too high and i said all that rather fast tristan raised his eyebrows as i got up so i could write back actually i wanted to be alone so i could wallow in self pity and become devastatingly depressed in private i was about to make my way into the depths of despair when mikey showed up hey lily billy why the long face you look as though you ve been sentenced to detention with filch you know the one with the whips and chains i screwed up my nose wait that didntcome out like it was supposed to i chuckled a bit trust mikey to be able to make me smile well it made you smile but you have a sick sense of humour sick i d say my humour was just plain dark what can i say i have a twisted and perverted mind but i wish i just had detention with filch mikey was shocked nothing can be that bad oh yes it can you ve just never had to deal with my mother before i sighed resigned to exploring just how deep the depths of despair are mikey wasntgiving up yet though oh no he just called in reinforcements hey charlie get over here oh no two of them charlie ambled over to the darkest corner of the common room where i was reclining in a large over stuffed arm very elegantly might i add legs over one arm while i upside down trying to forget my future predicament by flooding my brain with blood hoping against that hope i can find some way out of the pickle i some got myself into it wasnta detention with filch that had her howling charlie grinned nah she probably just realised how outstandingly bad i am at charms what he only got an exceeding expectations on his last assignment instead of an outstanding terrible effort that i chucked my letter from will at him he whistled once he finished your mum really is set on this coming out thing i dontmind charlie reading it since he read every other letter i raised my head and gave him the no really look hey mikey what about we go play exploding snap and leave lily to mope in peace i smiled at him thankfully okay bye lily billy hope you feel better dontlet them get you down were charlie parting words pft give me some happy pills and they wontbe able to reach me on cloud nine maybe i could get nessa to cast a cheering charm no that wouldntwork they wear off and then i would be even more depressed fine i will just have to reply to will will what the hell do you mean she has a program if she thinks i about to follow some regimented schedule the old bat has another thing coming but thanks about the heads up about the hair appointment and the beauty parlour thingy i will not come out looking like tuna if it kills me about this escort thing canti just take you pretty pretty please i really dontwant o go with some random all right so vivian and harold are okay people but that doesntmean their son is i know you think i should give him a chance but come on her highness has been hinting about making two families one and how her and vivian would love to call each other family please try to make her see sense she ll listen to you you re her favourite you know how she feels about my out spoken ness please see what you can do about that tuna not happy with me why isntthat surprising i suppose she feels that mother dearest is spending way too much of her time on the disturbed younger daughter tell her she can have as much of the old bat attention as she wants in fact i would appreciate it if she brought up plans for the wedding that way the wicked witch would be far to busy worrying about flower arrangements and bridesmaid dresses to bother with me i hope you re doing okay you can laugh at me all you like but it ll be your turn next you ll be turning 21 soon mother will be taking you bride shopping think of all those fashion shows you re going to have to sit through with tuna and the old bat before you laugh at me buddy tell harry i said hello and give him a big hug for me thanks again for the warning love always anna as you can see i have a few issues to work out with my mother and my loving sister but i think i shall take action and actively shove these problems into the back of my mind where they will stay in the archive reserved for things that i will deal with at a later undecided date if i dontforget about them first i ve said it before lily evans queen of denial cleopatra sounds just as good saturday 11th december library you know i think i may have found an incredibly talented partner in crime having james potter for an older brother has definitely rubbed off on charlie dana and i finally decided on a form of payback for matt jefferies psychological damage and mortifying embarrassment we thought that was perfectly acceptable seeing as that what bridget had to go through well maybe on a lesser scale but still he hurt bridget so we hurt him our philosophy is not an eye for an eye but a head for an eye first of all we found out about jefferies phobias turns out he deathly afraid of rodents oh the possibilities that spring to mind well we decided to go with the more obscure way of using this silly little fear against him and decided to use potter suggestions of embarrassing the hell out of him everyone knows the theory about how lemmings mass suicide every year by running themselves off a cliff whether they believe it or not is a different story dana and i decided to use this little piece of knowledge we researched all the spells we would need diligently but rhi nessa and dana decided they would leave the actual magic up to me because for some reason magic is the one thing my klutziness doesntaffect but i needed a little help from my good friend charlie i talked him into it by telling him that i would talk to flitwick about his outstanding progress when i think about he didntactually need that much persuading it was the start of lunch and the hall was completely packed with students when a piercing scream resounded in the halls and shocked the majority of the student body dana rhi nessa charlie and i all slipped into the mass of students entering the great hall as quietly and discreetly as possibly earning suspicious looks from bridget tristan cam and mikey the screaming continued and all the students watched the top of the stairs wide eyed waiting for a sign of what was happening a couple of seconds later matt jefferies appeared at the top of the stairs completely white and shaking starkers except for his boxers with little snitches flying all over them he looked like he had voldemort on his tale lemmings he screamed hundreds of them they re looking for somewhere to mass suicide they want me to join them i had my knuckles in my mouth to stop the laughter that was bubbling in my throat they re after me i swear we then heard a faint squeaking sound jefferies went rigid and his eyes got really big looking down the corridor they re after me he wailed he let out a very girly scream before pelting down the stairs followed by hundreds of lemmings squeaking and squealing their way down the stairs i thought they looked quite cute their fat furry little bodies swayed and wobbled as they scuttled down the stairs mrs norris looked as though her worst nightmare had come true as she ran to hide behind filch the lemmings streamed into the great hall to form a sort of sea around the barricade that jefferies had built around himself under the hufflepuff table the squeaking and squealing went on as the lemmings tried to get to jefferies a few did and he screamed bloody murder of course to everyone else they looked like your average everyday cute fluffy lemming but to jefferies they looked to be the size of barn cats and had teeth and claws a foot long though i heard some one asking him later how he knew they wanted him to join their mass suicide jefferies promptly answered that they told him so we never put a spell on them to do that go figure but the rest of the school thought it was rather hilarious that jefferies was running from a bunch of innocent furry little hamster like creatures dressed only in his underwear dumbledore eyes twinkled as he vanished the lemmings could i please see ms evans and mr potter in my office after dinner please i smiled slightly that man knows everything potter was looking at dumbledore as though he had gone made yes professor answered charlie and i potter looked at us with his eyes popping out of his head once inside dumbledore office charlie and i took a seat that was very interesting display earlier at dinner i dontthink mr jefferies will every get over his phobia of rodents we stayed silent and i bit my lip crappolla i didntthink of that though i must say it was quite a feat to conjure and charm so many animals he did the whole piercing stare thing i swear that where remus learned it from i really should give you both detention for this little prank silence still please please please dontlet that be the case however i will let you both off with a warning and 20 points will be taken from gryffindor charlie and i were looking at our feet you may go i reached the door 10 points will also be awarded to gryffindor for your excellent charms work i quirked a small smile well that wasntso bad charlie finally said as we made our way back to the common room do even want to know what experience he is comparing it to i ve had much worse you know mind you that was the time james and i tried to feed casey williams from slytherin to the giant squid we tied squid treats all over his body and dumped him into the middle of the lake i stared at him dumbledore was rather unhappy about the whole thing imagine that he was upset because they committed attempted murder on a fellow student dumbledore an old fuddy duddy now ainthe i rolled my eyes i donteven want to know charlie was rather unruffled by the whole thing i however felt rather bad now about the lemming thing not about the partially naked thing though he was a complete wanker and deserved it so here i am in the library trying to avoid doing my transfiguration assignment that i now have to do on animagus it true i do mcgonagall told me during class yogarty had talked to her about it and she thought it was excellent i was getting help from potter and black because it turns out they actually are quite gifted when if comes to transfiguration especially animagus bollocks i have no bleeding idea what i supposed to write about okay so people change themselves into animals big deal i dontreally care it due monday and i haventeven sodding started how am i supposed to do a assignment that has to be two rolls of parchment long when i have no bloody idea about the concept ugh i need help i not going there with black if i asked him to help me with homework he would probably take it as a come on i suppose i should go find potter and see if he ll help me i think i saw him in the charms section earlier i ll go find him hi everyone i am on probation so i have to make this super super quick thankyou to everyone who has reviewed read whatever super super big thanks to cait the wonderful beta everyone choose a chapter and come up with a name for it idecided that would make the titles a bit more interesting i will change the chaoter titles to the most creative suggestions please remeber to r e v i e w absolute shocker by jamesroxmysox disclaimer i own nothing recognizable from the harry potter books or movies that belongs to j and warner brothers studios sunday 12th monday 13th december girls dorm it sooooo late but i finally finished my assignment with an enormous amount of help from potter i ll give him that he knows his stuff on saturday afternoon i did eventually find him in the charms section screened from view by the mountain of books he had been looking through revising for that test that remus had been prattling about er excuse me james he didnthear me james no answer james true i was getting aggravated but honestly the boy is worse than i am hey potter what sorry did you say something do not roll eyes do not roll eyes do not roll eyes thank you geez what you have to do to get the blokes attention did i say something no nothing not a peep i ve just been trying to get you to answer we for the last five minutes calm lily calm you need to ask him for help blowing up at him would not help your plight and would only make you a hypocrite er yes i was wondering if you could help we with that human transfiguration assignment for mcgonagall because it due on monday and i sort of haventeven started i rambled while having a fascinating staring contest with the spot on the carpet sure just give me a second to get my stuff together i quickly pulled my head up and beamed at him thank you so much i just dreadful at the whole transfiguration thing he smiled warmly a new expression for him potter read over the instruction notes i d taken and then disappeared for about fifteen minutes returning with books i d never even seen before he must have charmed madame pince into letting us use the ones from the restricted section we were holed up in the transfiguration section for hours on end we eventually got chucked out at 10 30 due to curfew we even missed dinner we packed up all the books and transferred them all to the common room my stomach gave a massive growl it doesntlike being neglected especially in the form of food deprivation potter looked at me with raised eyebrows i smile sheepishly my stomach doesntlike to miss meals potter grinned why dontwe go get it some food then i smiled and nodded once down in the kitchens i asked the house elves for some cottage pie some apple pie and vanilla ice cream chocolate chip cookies some old english toffee ice cream and of course some pineapple juice someone hungry potter remarked i raised an eyebrow what you d prefer i ate a small salad with some mini toast he let out a laugh no i think it good you have an appetite me too now what are you having later on we got into a pointless argument over what tasted better pumpkin juice or pineapple juice dontbe ridiculous pumpkins taste awful even if they have a gallon of sugar mixed in with them i beg your pardon but pineapple juice has sugar and sweeteners in it too yes but it tastes just as good unsweetened the fact of whether the juice is sweetened is not relevant it which one tastes better as it is pft you re just sore because pineapple juice is superior and tastes better whether it sweetened or unsweetened pumpkin is still better no it not i never had pumpkin juice until i came here and i bloody glad what a life without pumpkin juice that just sad not as sad as being dependent on pumpkin juice hey i not dependent on it i just happen to like it immensely you keep telling yourself that why dontwe just agree to disagree good now try some cookies with old english toffee ice cream tastes fabulous i shoved an ice cream smothered cookie into his mouth to shut him up see doesntit taste lovely and here some of your life saving pumpkin juice to wash it down with potter took a gulp of juice that was a dirty trick maybe but it was a delicious dirty trick and it shut you up oh so you think you won then uh huh well you ve go another thing co you have to try this apple pie it just excellent and the ice cream is incredibly creamy dontyou think i shoved a piece of apple pie in his mouth potter glared at me what isntit creamy i asked innocently once he swallowed he wasntvery happy stop doing that what i was just sharing with my fellow food critic dontyou want to be a food critic evans he growled yes try some pie he shoved a piece of pie in my face prat you missed my mouth and you wasted a really good piece of pie i complained wiping apple pie off my face true that but i can always just get some more i narrowed my eyes well you ll need some ice cream to go with it then wontyou before he knew what was happening i flicked some ice cream at him why you little i got him with ice cream again that it i declare war an hour later we emerged from the kitchens covered from head to foot in cream apple pie ice cream and apricot tart when i got back to my dorm rhi was still up she looked me over a disagreement about the supremacy of pumpkin juice got slightly out of hand i offered rhi rolled her eyes i dontwant to know today potter helped me again and we spent the day pouring over all those bloody books working out the intricacies of becoming an animagus and the details of normal transformations we missed lunch so dana brought us up some sandwiches when i thanked her she ducked her head down to me and whispered in my ear someone spending an awful lot of time with the delightfully dishy head boy she said in a teasing sing song voice i was shocked i threw a bit of screwed up parchment at her she just wiggled her eyebrows as she left but for the majority of the time we were left in peace i told potter it was okay and that he could go study for charms but he wouldnthear of it he said that he would stick with me till it was finished good of him really i ended up with a roll and half of parchment more than was required we just went down to the kitchens and had a late night snack i ordered pineapple juice and looked at him challengingly oh no no way i not getting into that argument again we can just agree to disagree i grinned glad you came round to my way of thinking he looked thoughtful yeah you were right about the cookies and ice cream thing hey mint can we please have some chocolate chip cookies and some what was it old english toffee ice cream right and some old english toffee ice cream we spent about an hour eating our ice cream and cookies mucking around and having a good laugh he not that bad i suppose potter that is he can actually be quite nice it helps that he an absolute dish saturday 18th december also known as the day of doom prefects bathroom oh my god i have been on diary probation apparently since i started this infernal diary i have not been nearly as interactive with my friends as i should be of course it would have nothing to do with the fact that my workload has almost doubled this year with tutoring patrols assignments no it all the bleeding diary fault they re mad they re all bloody mad dana and bridget confiscated it on monday morning and because i was so tired from doing my assignment i wasntable to do anything about it but since today is d day and yes i am comparing the ball to the normandy landings i dontbelieve i have a good chance of getting out alive i was able to snitch it out of dana dresser and then snuck out while our dorm is in total shambles as the twins lose their heads over every little thing i am at the present moment barricaded in the prefects bathroom hopefully i wonthave to come out for a very long time for the last week i have been coping it from my friends because i spent so much time with potter last weekend apparently we looked awfully cosy huddled up together with armchairs oh so close together nutters we had to be that close so that potter could explain what the hell i was suppose to write not that i complaining because i not potter actually smells very nice like cinnamon and musk excellent combination really any way that beside the point he was just helping me geez the way they talk about it you would think we were trying to eat each other faces in front of the great hall ugh bad mental picture but i got an outstanding so they can all go boil their heads for all i care speaking of boiling heads i do believe cam wants to boil mine i gave up on the whole trying to investigate each girl thing there to many and way to many possibilities i mean how exactly am i suppose to find one girl who meets all the requirements when the busy social world of hogwarts never stays still long enough for me to see who in a relationship and who isn t bloody impossible i decided to move on to plan c pry the information out of sophie baxter only problem every time she sees me she turns into a shaking blob of hysterical tears it seems that i the only one who will actually listen to her so every night for the last week i have spent a good hour with her in front of the gryffindor common room fireplace half listening to all her troubles my god doesntshe get dehydrated if i cried that much i d need to be drinking at least 4 litres a day potter isntthe only thing wrong with her life her sister is giving her grief at home and she thinks she may be failing her classes so last night i sat her down and gave her a good talking to 1 she had to move on from potter he wasntworth it there are plenty of fish in the sea many of which would treat her better than potter ever did and all she had to do was go fishing and then she would find some one perfect for her 2 if the sister has a genuine problem with her then sit down and talk things through if she just decided she wants to be a bitch give the sister the finger and tell her to shove it it not worth sophie time worrying over pleasing a person who will never be pleased and just ignore the ungrateful sister 3 failing classes take a little time off socialising and barricade yourself in the library and refuse to come out until some knowledge has soaked in to your brain usually works and you grow to like it why do these problems all sound so familiar oh yeah because i happen to have had all those problems though of course i was mooning over daniel not potter but anyway so i quickly decided that the whole prying of information thing was not going to work so i returned to plan a pester cam i asked him so many questioned him continuously about the girl hair colour eye colour skin tone house year first letter of her first name first letter of her second name it is a girl right got me bloody no where except a death glare for the last question and an extremely pissed off cam i had nothing else to occupy myself with either and i couldnteven ramble here for goodness sake cam expressed that exact thought at lunch on thursday after one of my rather thorough interrogations and he articulated his thought by blowing up at the twins you had to take that bloody book away from her this week didntyou i had one week to go till holidays and you had to confiscate the bloody book he continued muttering under his breath for a good half an hour i distinctly heard the words dismember mutilation and execution i not sure who he was talking about me or the twins most likely both i the order of bridget dana and myself i think i ll lucky if i just get away with the execution part and not the mutilation and dismemberment but last night he got so peeved he told me to shut up and listen for once i actually obeyed if i tell potter to just come out and tell the bloody girl will you leave me alone i thought about it for a second how will i know he went through with it cam rolled his eyes you ll know believe me i looked at him suspiciously okay but if he doesntyou ll never hear the end of this after that cam relaxed considerably well that was one issues resolved but i had been working on another as well daniel since i had to go to the ball with him i thought it would be best if we were at least past the strictly polite stage so that we would actually be able to have some fun at this bloody thing i took decisive action on wednesday i searched the whole bloody school looking for him i checked the gryffindor common room got tristan to look in the boys dormitory went down to the quidditch pitch peeked into the change rooms asked hagrid if he d seen him and even went to the hospital wing and do you know where he ended up being the library the sodding library i rolled my eyes when i finally found him trust daniel to be in the most unlikely of places the muggle studies study area i called out to him hey daniel he turned and looked at me with his eyes wide and surprised what got me was the person sitting next to him when daniel turned around i was able to get a glimpse of the person next to him a girl a very pretty girl i smiled uncertainly i sorry i didntmean to interrupt i can talk to you later daniel i said this all very quickly and was about o make my escape when daniel stopped me no it okay lily abby and i are just going over some notes for muggle studies may be you could help us i sneaked a quick glance at abby she seemed nice enough so i sat down lily this is abigail lawrence my girlfriend my girlfriend i blinked surprisingly those had less affect on me than i thought they would i smiled brightly ah i see you managed to bag the charming daniel diggory daniel blushed and abigail gave me a cheery smile though you have to watch him he can be quite the pratish wanker when he wants to be i whispered to abigail just loud enough so daniel could hear abigail laughed while daniel scowled at me shut up lily stop telling lies about me i raised an eyebrow at him lies are they i remember quite a few incidents where you found my misfortune quite entertaining daniel just shook his head abby this is lily evans the obnoxious creation i have as my gryffindor prefect counterpart i beamed at him it a pleasure to meet you lily call me abby by the way it wonderful to meet you as well abby if he does anything to upset you just tell me and he ll never get back from quidditch practice breathing abby laughed and looked at me curiously i have connections daniel rolled his eyes at me by that she means she good friends with two of the chasers and the captain has taken rather a shine to her i poked my tongue out at him so what is it that you ignorant purebloods are having trouble with i asked in a very posh voice i copied from my grandmother ignorant purebloods are we daniel knew i was kidding of course now what is it your narrow minds cannot comprehend television i stared at them incredulously they dontknow what a television is those poor deprived souls i couldntlive with out tv in the summer i think i d die of boredom the shock was on my face yes lily we have absolutely no idea how the bloody thing works i explained how the television works and about satellites and broadcasting and all that abby and daniel thought it was all quite fascinating abby is extremely nice she has long wavy golden blonde hair and the warmest brown eyes i ve ever looked into she also has these cute little dimples in her cheeks when she smiles abby is a hufflepuff in our year we have herbology together that was how she seemed slightly familiar over all i think she gorgeous daniel and i were back to our normal way of just blathering about nothing but if anything i suppose it was more comfortable because i was no longer pinning after him i glad he found a girlfriend you couldntask for someone better or sweeter than abby i waited till abby left looking for her friends to talk to daniel about the ball so daniel were still good friends right you wontfeel weird opening the ball with me still friends what do you mean well lately we haventbeen talking as much as we used to and you were avoiding me for a while no i wa yes you were i dontneed to know why i just want o make sure that there isntthat weird formal politeness between us because truthfully that would really suck he smiled okay i promise there wontbe any weird formal politeness good you know abby is gorgeous i glad you found her i expect you to ditch me straight after the first dance and spend the rest of the night with her oh no lily i cantdo that oh yes you will she your girlfriend your going to be spending the winter wonderland ball with her and that final thanks lily you re welcome do you need help with anything else er yeah what with those poles with all the ropes connecting them i was confused by this energy lines or something i laughed and explained about power lines and telecommunications at the prefects meeting on thursday afternoon i sat with daniel and we stuffed around taking the mickey out of the amy who looked as though she was about to explode from the stress of it all we were pulling faces behind her back as she lectured a couple of fifth years about their duties and how to behave they did try very hard to not to laugh and when amy turned around we were the picture of innocence i laughed so much my stomach hurt when daniel told me about a conversation he heard a couple of ravenclaw 7th years having about their dresses and make up the room was so loud and noisy everyone was having a good time just mucking around while amy was busy ordering potter around remus was laughing at his friends hardship when he caught my eye he nodded towards daniel who was busy in an argument with a fifth year over how you tie shoelaces i smiled at him to show that i had made up daniel remus came over to talk to me i see things are back to normal his eyes were twinkling as he said this yes thanks to you and your nagging i finally gave into remus and went resolved my problems like he told me to weeks ago i d just been stubborn about things i think i better go save james from an untimely death we looked over to see amy was well and truly worked up and beyond caring if she did actually send potter deaf i actually felt sorry for potter amy was possessed and would not rest until everything was perfect especially last night when we were decorating the hall i thought i wasntgoing to get to bed till dawn ugh but we eventually got to go at 11pm i could have hexed the twins when they got me up at crack of dawn this morning prattling about hair potions face masks and pedicures pedicures no one going to see my feet my dress goes to the floor when i pointed this out i was not so nicely told to shut up and that it was the principal of the thing i was also informed that i was going to have one whether i liked it or not so i may as well accept it i was up dressed and out of there as fast as my legs could carry me dana and bridget insisted that everyone had to look stunning for their dates literally well thank god i dontactually have a date then i told the twins this as well but they just brushed it off it the principle of the thing ugh kill me now i so glad amy decided that we go with our prefect partner makes everything so much easier that way i can just sit at a table all night and i only have to dance once awesome i must remember to thank amy for that oh wait some ones at the door if i ignore them for long enough they ll go away lily bloody hell do you know how much that scared me how the hell does remus know i in here lily i know it you in there how could he know it was me you have to be the only female in this castle not in a face mask and curlers bollocks damn you caught me out open the door um how about no i refuse to go back to my dorm and be man handled by my delirious friends no i not dressed i could sense him roll his eyes at me do i really have to comment on your lying ability not if you dontwant to no i quite aware it pathetic and dontroll your eyes at me i knew he was doing the piercing glare thing at the door stop giving the door that look what look the piercing look thing that you do it unnerving and you re not even looking at me directly lily open the damn door he angry but the twins will kidnap me and torture me into modelling a hundred outfits before settling on the first one do really want to be responsible for that about of psychological damage being inflicted on one person let hope he a humanitarian you ll live apparently not so much the humanitarian i opened the door glaring at him fine but if i become a babbling hysterical mess you re paying for my psychiatric bills remus smiled at my theatrics go join charlie snowball fight i sure he wouldntmind a little more help to defeat james and sirius i smiled at him thank you i gave him a hug before running off now i just have to sneak in and get my cloak scarf and gloves preferably while dana and bridget are distracted i am dreading getting ready for this ball actually i just plain dreading the whole damn thing my god you lot certainly know how to make a girl feel appreciated now dontya thank you very much to all those who reviewed i still on probation and

all reviewers as promised dontforget to choose your favourite chapter and make up a name for it also r e v i e w absolute shocker by jamesroxmysox disclaimer i own nothing recognisable from the harry potter books or movies that belongs to j and warner brothers studios sunday 19th december hogwarts express i swear the world has gone mad the earth has flipped on its axis the sun light is blue the sky is orange the trees are purple canaries prey on mountain lions pigs fly with out magical assistance and i refuse to believe all that been told to me my friends are all loonies and deserve to be locked up in a nut house you know one of those old fashioned ones with bars on the windows sterile white walls and special rooms where they preform medical experiments such as frontal lobe lobotomies for the last 12 or so hours i have been in a state of shock now i have progressed to upmost denial and am verging on hysterics at the present moment i am on the hogwarts express hurtling to my doom mother dearest has sent me a total of five reminders over the last week about what to pack and what is expected of me for the coming ball i just hope will picks me up pretty please let will pick me up please this morning i got up extra early to convince riley to get into his cage so i could take him and my trunk down to be transferred to hogsmeade station i ate my breakfast in the kitchens and was one of the first students on the train when people gave me weird looks i just gave the prefect duties spiel and they left me alone as they bloody well should nosy prats i found an empty compartment in the semi back of the train dragged my trunk and riley in and proceeded to barricade the door no one is going to bother me today no one what you may ask has made me become a grouchy greaten faced hermit the sodding ball what else i ll start at the beginning always a good place to start i managed to sneak into the dorm yesterday to get my cloak and things the twins rhi and nessa where all in the bathroom ohhhing and ahhhing over something or other dontask me i was trying to get in and out of there as quickly as possible it was probably just how smooth nessa got her nails from filing them or something i made my way out on to the grounds looking for charlie potter and black and found them near the greenhouses poor charlie and mikey they were being slaughtered by potter black and peter admittedly peter was just throwing a half hearted snowball every now and then so that charlie and mikey could actually throw a snowball once in a while hey charlie can i help both charlie and mikey were delighted to have a bit of back up they looked as though they were about to be forced to surrender to marauders hey that not fair yeah shouldntyou be painting your nails or something the outraged cries of potter and black not fair it may just be my screwed up sense of logic but three seventh years against two fourth years doesntseem fair i threw a snowball at black paint my nails who do you think i am bridget the snowballs started coming thick and fast but together mikey charlie and i managed to hold our own it unfair because those little buggers started it i sure it was provoked insults started flying along with the snowballs all in go fun of course i was actually enjoying myself this is how it show be put off getting ready till the last possible minute remus came running up about four o clock lily lily you have to go up to the tower dana and bridget are going nuts looking for you ugh time to face reality did you tell them where i was oh no they ll come down here in their facemasks and frog march me back to the tower no but their eyes did that weird thing where they go red so i thought i better come get you fiddlesticks okay i coming i quickly said good bye to the rest of the boys before sprinting up to the gryffindor tower well i didntreally sprint more like jogged okay that a straight out lie i dragged my feet the whole way asking the forces of the universe to just turn me into an ear wig right now and get it over with i have no idea what i did in that previous life of mine but it must have been some serious shit i mean two prestigious events inflicted upon me in one week what was i a bloody serial killer no they get off lighter than i do they just become policemen or something to avenge the justice thing see with karma apparently you balance everything out so if you were a criminal like the example above in your next life you become a policeman or detective or something to do with justice so the two lives will cancel each other out so since i have a great dislike for social climbers prestigious events and high society in a previous life i must have been like my mother sweet merlin i think i will just go throw myself off the back of the train bugger as i was making my way down the train looking for a suitable window carriage or door from which i could make my leap of faith faith in the fact i wouldntsurvive when i ran into him literally i cant even walk death row with grace sod the whole sodding concept i donteven have faith in the leap of faith thing any more well of course i didntrealise who i had run into and i started apologising rambling profusely explaining how disturbingly klutzy i am and that god or whoever has a damn lot to answer for in the way of innocent people being harmed by yours truly lily oh bollocks it him the one person i want to avoid i looked him in the eye for a split second before sprinting back to my compartment and preforming every locking spell i knew on the damn door dontworry i wasntactually making my way to experiment the exact effects of iron wood and crushed rocks have on the human body when flung from a moving vehicle with a speed of 90 miles per hour i was heading for the toilet but i felt like venting my anger in a melodramatic and artistic manner bloody coward more like anyway back on topic i finally got back to my dorm when i was leapt upon by all four of my so called friends aaaahhhhhhhhhhhgggggggg i was wrestled into the bathroom and promptly thrown into a freezing cold shower what the bloody hell do you think you re doing damn that water is cold making you presentable do i even want to know what you ve been doing all day only dana could pull off that harassed mother like tone having a snowball fight and does making me presentable require freezing me to the point of comatose no change in the water apparently i need to have any form of bacteria or molecule of dirt frozen from my body stop complaining and just wash your hair like bloody hell i will my blood is about to congeal and they want me to wash my hair we finally came to the compromise that i could have hot water if i wash my hair and use rhi special body soap stuff after i got out the shower i was presented with only clean undergarments and my bathrobe i was about to tell them to sod off when bridget cut me off save it lily i was rather taken aback by her abruptness yeah we ve all done our make up and hair all that left is nail polish and our number one concern you my eyes widened as i looked at them they had all indeed been made up they all looked drop dead gorgeous in my opinion see some girls look beautiful and entrancing when make up is added they acquire this enchanting quality about them the make up and hair styles enhance their features making them nothing shot of enticing so for me a girl who throws her hair in a simple ponytail every day and does not wear a skerrick of make up this is all quite foreign and intimidating i mean did you know you can actually blow dry your hair straight bloody amazing if you ask me on the odd occasion that my mother has me all dolled up i feel completely out of place i dontfeel comfortable with my hair all styled and my face plastered in gunk i dontfeel any prettier or more feminine than usual as most girls say they do i weird i know but i dontsee what so special about it like when dana and bridget played stylist at the beginning of term i felt like a little girl who has got into her mother make up ending up wearing to much rogue and bright red lipstick in an effort to be grown up and just like the mother she idolises i just dontfell comfortable dear lord this is depressing but when i always feel like an ugly duckling compared to my friends rhiannon is the original spanish beauty being the human cappuccino nessa has the girl next door look that makes you wonder and the twins well the twins are the pin up girls for how many europeans would like to be i different though which i have to admit i like i wouldntchange myself for the world but i still have my insecurities but i wasntreally given the choice right then about whether i was comfortable or not i believe we had a half an hour long argument over how my hair was to be styled it seemed a vote had been taken before i arrived that i was to have it half up and half down ugh i hate that hair style it just looks weird i argued my point and refused point blank to let them do that to me i weakened when i saw dana and bridget faces how can you say know to those big grey eyes i sure as hell dontknow how i finally agreed to let them do what they wanted so long as it was not half up and half down i shut my eyes and thought longingly of the chocolate chip cookies annie our cook makes at home they d be waiting for me when i got home from the station tomorrow then it came to make up double ugh did i really have to have paint on my face i was met with a very enthusiastic yes by four slightly irritated teenage girls i took my chances and shut my gob i refused to let the twins do my make up look what happened last time i ended up looking like a slapper rhi did my make up for me she actually very good and i knew she wouldntpile it on at least not as much as dana or bridget after that ordeal was over i relaxed slightly and we all painted our nails manicure and pedicure i admit i have another slightly girly fetish nail polish i wanted to get all creative with the black red and white but those colours were forcefully snatched from my hands by nessa shaking her head at me they were replaced by a grey how boring how as i supposed to make things interesting with just one colour grey you want me to paint my nails grey canti at least have a red to liven things up a little i got a look from nessa it not grey it a light shifting silver now shut up and put it on bloody spoil sports i was muttering away to myself by the injustice of it all when dana announced that it was time to put on our gowns gag it only a dress again an argument erupted between myself and the twins i am not wearing green i abhor green and refuse to wear it to matter how much it brings out my eyes come on banana it looks really good on you pft never mind that i dislike it immensely as long as it pleasing to the eyes of others sod off i dontknow where the hell you got that but i not wearing it i stormed off to my bed and pulled the curtains tight around me i already had a dress and i thought it was quite nice thank you very much it was the colour and texture of an invisibility cloak silver and silky very flowy it was simple timeless a line dress matched with a simple wrap and a pair of killer stilettos i serious these are awesome shoes they are a soft grey colour darker than the dress they have bright clear jewels all over them so they are awfully sparkly plus they happen to have a 3 inch heel i in love i think i will wear these shoes till they literally fall apart oh for christs sake cam and tristan are at the door trying to get me to let them in pft as if i officially not talking to them especially not cam he ll be lucky if i talk to him before the turn of the centaury bugger off come on lily you cantstay in there forever wanna bet silence for a second they seemed to be changing tactics we ve got some cookies cam taunted in a sing song voice bloody amateurs so do i i called backing the same teasing voice i had already scabbed some off the house elves this morning when i went down there for my breakfast muffled arguing look lily we re really sorry okay but what else could we do we would have been dismembered i sorry do i appear to care lily nope i dontwant to hear it stop being so bloody stubborn and open the bloody door sod em i not talking to them and that final ah they got bored and wandered off to tell the others how they failed miserably at getting me talk to them civilly or they might go in search of the food cart the latter is more likely when i think about it but back to the night of horror once bridget and dana had decided we all looked perfect that took for ever it was 7 30 pm and time for us all to go down i sat on my bed as the twins prepared for their great descent oh please give me a break nessa and i shared a look as the twins continued to primp themselves once dana and bridget had gone down separately of course with rhi in between them so that there was no confusion about who was who nessa gave a great sigh her turn wish me luck i gave her an encouraging smile good luck and dontworry you ll knock tristan out you look fabulouso she gave me a smile before sweeping off down the stairs and i was telling the truth there she did look gorgeous with her shimmery blue dress and her wavy dark hair pulled to back on one side oh and yes she is going with tristan they re both a little nervous seeing as it was just recently they admitted they had feelings for one another i coerced tri to admit his feelings and then convinced him to ask nessa to the ball my smile slid off my face as nessa shut the door wondering if i could get away with not actually going down those stairs until tomorrow morning for breakfast but i resigned myself to the fate worse than death made my way down the stairs the common room was full of noise and laughter people coming and going joking with their friends i scanned the room looking for daniel i spotted him sitting by the fire waiting patiently i made my way through the congregation of students to daniel ready he looked up oh sure you look great lils thank you you manage to scrub up well yourself yes well it did take me a couple of hours but i eventually got to the point where i acceptable i couldnthelp but laugh shall we descend to the great hall ms evans daniel imitated the twins theatrics in a posh voice we shall we linked arms and made our way down to the great hall once in the entrance hall we had a few minutes before the hall was opened the noise level was unbelievable as people rushed around gushing to their friends about how good everyone looked i couldnthelp but smile school uniforms of black robes and grey jumpers had been traded in for dazzling dresses and tempting tuxedos it was fascinating though i have no idea where these inane people lost in their worlds of romance get their ideas you hear about the room going quiet and people become stunned as one girl comes down the stairs what a load of wank everyone looks gorgeous and glamorous you cantpossibly choose one person who stands out from all the rest i dragged daniel off to find abby i dontcare if he has to open the ball with me his date is abby come on we have to find abby we do of course what were going to do after the first dance mosey on over to her table he looked at me bewildered that was exactly what he was going to do i rolled my eyes bloody boys not a romantic bone in their bodies i conjured a romantic red rose for him to give her when we were just a little way off alright now go shower her with compliments give her the rose and arrange a place to meet after the first dance i ll be waiting for you at the doors with that i rushed of to see my friends rhi was going with a very handsome ravenclaw she has this uncanny talent for attracting that sort they were talking quietly when i bounded over trying with all my might to enjoy this infernal ball oh lily this is robert my date from ravenclaw please call me robbie it nice to meet you it lovely to meet you as well i hope you have fun after a quick introduction i left them to it dana was becoming acquainted with her 7th year ravenclaw dates clique of friends pretty smart really since she would be spending most of her evening with them bridget was enthralled wither date sirius black i dontknow who looked happier about this black or bridget i didntreally feel like interrupting either of the twins and left them to ooze charm and make googly eyes while i flounced off to see nessa and tri cam was there with his date as well a fifth year gryffindor who i suspect was one of the ones flirting with him at the marauder party wait dontthink about that do not think about that it can only make my cheeks become a stunning ruby red especially now we chatted for a while mainly about quidditch and christmas decorations very polite very reserved very boring i wanted to gag thankfully amy called all the prefects over before i made a retching sound that would have earned me daggers from my three friends amy looked exquisite in a snow white strapless gown with a little gold wreath in her hair the original christmas angel thankfully she was quite pleased with how everything had turned out wasntabout to pop a vein any time soon i found daniel and linked arms as we waited for the rest of the students to enter what a stupid tradition i mean what the point of it it supposed to be a privilege for students to open the ball personally i cantthink of a worse punishment we all filed in once the rest of the student body had taken their seats and fanned out across the floor just as we had practiced it a good thing amy and potter are so far away in the middle or else daniel would have to hold me back from ramming this damn record down amy throat i love amy dearly and she a wonderful friend but she has a dreadful perfectionist streak that could make me look slack add the pressure that she head girl this year and in charge of the whole ball thing and you get a very scary very determined person i think we practiced this one dance for about two hours on friday ugh i was ecstatic when it was over the most tiring five minutes of my life thank all the things i hold dear it was only five minutes i curtsied to daniel finally in a much better mood seeing as i wouldntbe putting another foot on that dance floor except on my way out nessa had saved me a seat at the table she had with tri and cam i took it gratefully and started nibbling at the snacks put out on the table before me amy had decided that a sit down dinner wasntappropriate since it was a week before christmas she settled on leaving out food on the tables so that people could pick at food as they felt like it i was quite happy sitting there minding my own business all right so i didntreally mind my own business i forced nessa and tristan to go dance but i was on my best behaviour i didnteven curse rosie perfectly styled curls as she swanned past on some 7th years arm bugger he found me what it wasntenough to literally run into me today he had to come find me as well sod him i not talking to the gigantic prat lily nu uh i refuse point blank come on lily you have to talk to me at one point or another how about another let say another in the undecided future when i cantpossibly avoid you say in seventy years or so if we are committed to the same retirement home and are placed in armchairs next o each other and my legs are too old to carry my weight and there is no other possible way of getting away from you yeah that sounds about right how about i pencil you in for then that good for you hopefully he d be dead or better yet i d be dead by that time seeing as that would take me about five years over my expected expiry date with my muggle heritage and all he still banging on the blasted door maybe if i pretend i asleep he ll go away lily i know you re awake i saw you writing in that bloody book just a minute ago bollocks bloody windows they may be rippled but you can still see through them what the hell can i do now lily open the door i have to talk to you yeah you and every other tom dick and harry ewwwwwwww i just managed to gross myself out dontmind me i have a childish disgusting mind actually it excellent when you want to distract yourself from something or someone however that someone is making it terribly hard for me to block him out i sure he about to break the bleeding door down i would dearly love to tell him to go rot in hell but that would require conversing with him so i have to ignore it you cantignore me forever lily i can see you re awake and i going to talk to you at some stage pft that what you think not during this train ride you re not i have other plans i pulled down the blinds using my wand i was not going to get up and go any where near the jerk of the universe that solved one problem he cantsee me any more just how do i get him to go away i suppose i just have to wait till he gives up and slinks off lucky thing i have a strong bladder but speaking of him he the reason why i in such a foul mood i was actually enjoying myself sitting placidly at the table nibbling away at the smorgasbord on offer but nooooooo he had to show up sodding potter the root of all my sordid problems all right not all my problems but the vast majority of them as i said i was happy just sitting there actually behaving myself for a change when potter dragged himself over to say hello to tri and nessa and offer his congratulations that they finally got it together true it was partly because of him that they admitted they fancy each other he had the do some research on a certain chaser move that needed hours of reading being holed up in the dusty old library according to him it benefited the team and got those two to fess up when tri and nessa went off to dance again i was left with potter not too bad seeing as how i could easily ignore him and get lost in my own little world of day dreams a big plus was that i was in a unnaturally happy state of mind due to how i had got off scot free from this date thing due to daniel i had just begun contemplating how horrid my mother was for ruining my favourite day of the year with her bloody social status crap when i noticed potter had been unusually quite what the matter potter did you leave your personality in your dorm i joked that didntgo down well er i was just joking um what the matter how come you re not off dancing with one of your adoring fans he just stared at his butter beer oh for goodness sake get some fire whiskey if you re going to drown your sorrows at least then you can actually forget what ever it is that bugging you he just sat there this is not the james potter i used to james potter does not sit lifelessly at the edge of a dance floor trying to get drunk off of butter beer james potter dances in the very middle of the floor with the prettiest girl available jolly from a capful or two of ogden that were slung back in the boys dorms at the pre ball celebrations i racked my brains trying to think what had the mighty james potter in such a dark mood a light bulb clicked on and i narrowed my eyes at him is this about the girl you ve been obsessing over potter finally dragged his gaze away from his bottle to look at my face quickly before refocusing on his beloved beverage cameron said you mentioned that mentioned wouldntlet up about it is more accurate well i know you couldntexactly ask her to the ball seeing as technically amy is your date but have you at least asked her to dance silence you haventasked her to dance i asked incredulously potter just glared sullenly at his bottle she wouldntwant to dance with me this took me by surprise the great james potter was doubting his abilities and sex appeal in case you haventnoticed the majority of hogwarts female population believes you to be one of the finest male specimens to roam the earth i sure she d jump at the chance to dance with you no she wouldn t how do you know is she here with someone else not that i know of but she just wouldn t that bottle is about to shatter from the ferocity of his glares in a second would you stop sulking go ask her before you become manic depressive she d just say no at this point i d had enough all you have to do is be polite and sweet i sure you can pull that off i got out of my chair and tried to pull him to his feet i mean if you were sweet and polite enough even i would dance with you by the way did you know that you weight a ton i got him to his feet puffing slightly from the effort since he is about twice the size of me now go swipe a rose from some where and sweep her off her feet i concluded giving him a small push in the back of the direction of the drinks at this point i was actually feeling quite jealous of that girl whoever she was she had one of the most wanted bachelors of our school after her and it turns out that he not actually half bad most of the time he can be sweet funny and very helpful at that moment i was actually thinking how lucky that girl was and i was feeling quite disappointed that this girl wasntme i can say quite confidently that i am the biggest bloody idiot to ever come into existence no bridget i am not going to let you in bridget dana rhi and nessa have come to see if they can have better luck than cam tri and potter lily please we feel really horrid so you bloody well should nessa you were one of the first to realise what was going on and yet you treated like a big joke please banana we can work it out he really is a good guy good guy my arse manipulative son of a dontcall me that i dontwan to talk to any of you you treated me worse than you would treat rosemary macdonald for god sake go away you know what i seriously feel like crying my eyes out now it may seem as though i over reacting but my friends were scheming behind my back tweaking my life style and influencing my emotions without my permission or knowledge it nasty and under handed i serious when i say they wouldnteven do this to rosie they just let her get on with her life and occasionally laugh at her for her disturbingly idiotic antics bloody potter why the hell did he ever have to show up and become a daily nuisance in my life really this is all his fault i mean i was sitting there thinking that james potter was actually a very nice person and wouldntmind if he asked me out some time when all of a sudden a white rose came into my line of vision i looked up only to be met with potter face i gave him a searching look lily would you please honour me with this dance i figured he must just be following me up on my offer because the girl had said no and i said i would dance with him if he asked politely enough he gave me that puppy dog look that the twins always use the one i can never refuse as he lead me out to the dance floor i was rather curious as to why he had asked i settled for surveying him scrutinisingly searching for a reason i came up with nothing so my curiosity got the best of me and i blurted out my question did she say no then he gave me a searching look before answering no shock that was my initial reaction denial followed closely then realisation my eyes got wide and i stood stock still no he wouldnt he couldnt he can t i pulled away from him still looking at him with big eyes lily please i started shaking my head how could he what about what sirius did to daniel oh daniel poor daniel i feel so bad and remus all those cryptic messages what about my friends they knew they knew all this time and they didntsay anything cam i swung around and stared straight at them they were al at a table talking and laughing tears started nipping at the corners of my eyes how could they do this to me they knew all about this and all the pain it put me through and yet they did nothing i turned around again and spotted daniel and abby dancing that could have been me if it wasntfor potter that could have been me in daniel arms not abby all my logic and rational thoughts went right out the window never mind the fact that i didntactually like daniel any more it was the principal of the thing if it hadntbeen for potter daniel and i would be together i turned back to potter with tear filled eyes all those things he had done all those awful horrible under handed things he had done flooded my brain i looked at him straight in the eye before turning on my heel and walking straight out the hall i ripped off my beloved shoes before sprinting all the way back to gryffindor tower once safely in my bed with the curtains firmly shut and a repelling charm and a silencing charm cast on my hangings i proceeded to scream cry and insult my lungs out i think i called potter his friends and my friends every name under the sun i even invented a few of my own but as i sobbed my self to sleep last night i realised how everything now made sense all of it every single thing that had confused me over the last few months finally clicked into place because of that one event the sound of star boy hammering away at the damn door has rudely awakened me from my emotional over load induced nap i must say crying certainly takes it out of you the previous part of my entry in covered in tear drops and the inks all smudged i still trying to get hold of my emotions on this issue evans sod off hey evans go away please just go away evans what locking yourself away isntgoing to accomplish anything you know what do you care black i care cos my buddy james is heart broken why should i care between the two of you i ended up with a broken heart what after all james did for you did for me oh yes bullying people glaring at me getting people to intimidate the guy i like is certainly in my best interest you should be ashamed of yourself what did i ever do scarring the shit out of daniel diggory on potter orders sound familiar oh right about that i dontwant to know i know he asked you to and i know you went through with it i was there so sod off black and leave me alone evans look it not li no i dontwant to know and i not going to listen to what you have to say since the beginning of the year potter has done nothing but manipulate me and my life to suit himself i have nothing more to say on the matter now leave me alone black he went away after that thank god i just got changed into my jeans and jumper i really should put on a skirt and cardigan to skip the feminine lecture from mother but it winter and i feel rotten please please please let william be here to greet me yes my darling older brother is here to save me hi everyone i really sorry this took so long but i had to go stay with my grandmother for the week that was certainly an experience which never want to endure again dear lord if i have to eat one more piece of tinned cucumber i think i will throw up apparently tinned cucumbers taste better yeah they taste better if you donthave any taste buds ugh also i will do a picasso and cut off my ear if i have to listen to another lecture on proper conduct any way thank you all for your lovely reviews i sorry i haventwritten individual reviews as promised but i promise to try next time now this is very important was this chapter believable i had trouble writing it but please tell me what you think and r e v i e w absolute shocker by jamesroxmysox disclaimer i own nothing recognisable from the harry potter books or movies that belongs to j and warner brothers studios sunday 19th december our kitchen dontyou just hate brothers i have come to that conclusion after my darling brothers came to meet me at the platform and were decidedly social yes i did want to torture and then decapitate them but i had to settle for glaring at them all the way home before running away to my room thank god i didntsee tuna when i came in seeing as i have written nothing but praise of my brothers in this thing i guess it may seem weird for mw to be inventing ways for them to leave this mortal coil as soon as the train stopped i jumped off the train and ran helter skelter over to will taking out a few first years on my way but hey i wasntreally in a caring mood i was deluded into thinking that the universe was an ok place seeing as it had invented big brothers and yes i am well aware that is a completely idiotic thought and that the universe is just a cruel screwed up place that has no heart billy i squealed and jumped into will arms pulling him into a bone crushing hug causing people around us to turn and stare it good to see you too anna i was hugging him so fiercely i could feel the vibrations of his laugh go through his rib cage at that moment i was thanking whatever supreme being for giving me my older brother i felt like i was five again and whatever trouble i had could be solved by my tough big 4th grader brother pity the feeling didntlast er anna i hate to spoil the moment but why is james potter staring at us ugh he comes near me and i will not be responsible for my actions because he a prat i muttered into will shoulder i buried my head further into the crook of his neck i swear if potter tries anything he ll be sorry that i not allowed to use magic i ll beat the bloody crap out of him with my bear hands i pulled back with a confused face how do you know who he is any way he was one of the newest chaser when i was in my last year i think i ll go talk to him harry should be back in a moment with the trolley i was left looking after him until i heard a squeal from behind me banana i whipped around to see harry running towards me he hugged me round the middle and i hugged him just as fiercely back how my favourite youngest brother ok how my favourite youngest sister wishing she could jump off a cliff actually harry laughed what ve you done this time would you believe this time it not self inflicted an actual out side force is the cause this time sure i stuck my tongue out any way how have you been good i suppose but tuna on the war path dontask the difference between saffron and primrose ugh donttell me she gave you a lecture he nodded oh well dontworry about her she ll get over it i hope harry was looking around for will where will over there with the jerks of the year i jerked my head towards will and potter who had now been joined by black harry and i watched as they had a very animated exchange potter and black looked quite excited about something i donteven want to know can i go meet them no why because they re prats well william is talking to them and with that the little monster ran off towards the afore mentioned congregation i narrowed my eyes my brothers have taken a shine to the one person i cantstand beyond all others understandably i was peeved i glared at them for a minute before i noticed dana and bridget coming towards me no doubt leading the rest of the motley crew behind them i grabbed my trunk and riley before making a quick escape out to the parking area where oliver was waiting for us oliver has to be my favourite of mother help he been with us since i can remember hello miss lily did you have a good term i helped him load my things into the car as good as a school term can be how are things with you fine thank you where have you re brothers got to talking to couple of idiots i was glaring at the left front tyre what it did to me i have no idea but it seemed like a good idea to glare at it rather than oliver a tyres feelings are harder to hurt than a persons i climbed in the car and waited after ten minutes i got feed up and asked oliver if we could just leave them but miss how would they get home i sure they d manage they always do i had just about convinced oliver to take me home when the dastardly duo turned up i mean it wonderful how well will and harry get along what with the ten year age group and all but sometimes their double act gets on my nerves they piled into the car and we set off to meet hades and his three headed dog our car is like one of those old fashioned cabs with the extra room in the back and the backward opening doors it midnight black with tinted windows mother prefers for us children to be chauffeured around so she doesnthave to deal with us for a prolonged period of time in such a contained space i was just thinking about how i feel like i in a funeral precession every time i go out i this thing when harry piped up they were really cool banana i dontthink their prats at all thank god the marauders will have graduated by time harry gets to hogwarts i dontsee why you dontlike them anna i invited them for a game of quidditch some time during the week i gaped at them both traitors really cool what did they do cast a confundus charm wait a second he invited them over for a game of quidditch oh dear lord kill me now if you have any mercy kill me now i sure changing me into my destined cockroach form now wouldntcause that much trouble and would relieve me of a lot of grief i can tell you i had a good talk with riley and he seems to think even though at the moment i think potter the biggest git in the world that when i look through this pretty little book there ll be something that proves he a good person after all i wouldntcare so much about him if he was all bad all right so that actually what the logical lillianna side of me is saying of course the bloody bird canttalk but i would prefer to admit that an owl is talking to me than to come to that realisation myself the lily part of me the part that belongs to hogwarts believes i should continue to be mad at all those people at hogwarts till my dieing day for their deceit the anna side of me the part that puts up with my demented sister and over active brothers is all for forgiving every one and giving potter a chance to prove himself yes i am aware i just described my reasoning as three separate subjects but each process of thought is based on different circumstances and obviously the lillianna part is the most respectable and trust worthy but what the bloody hell is it on i dontwant know anything about potter and i am most certainly cantbe bothered searching out his good points as you can see i rather upset that the practical level headed part of my mind is siding with the anna part now as i sit here munching on freshly made chocolate chip cookies and chocolate ice cream in our deserted kitchen the only thing that comes into my mind is one of remus weird thought provoking statements you know lily love can cause people to do crazy things even hurt the objects of their affections i ll take a look later tuesday 21st december observatory i in hiding tuna is out to get me yesterday i was woken up at 7 30 an ungodly hour for the first day of the holidays rather rudely by my mother so she could take me shoe shopping i wasntexactly enthusiastic about the whole thing until i remembered i was choosing my own shoes i became much more cheerful after i realised that small fact but first we had to go to the le secret dress emporium so i could try on the dress to make sure it fit bloody stupid name for a store if you ask me it no longer a secret if you broadcast it to the world i have been dreading what this dress was going to look like ever since i was first told about having to attend this party thing all i could think about was the plum party dress with all the trimmings one sign of polka dots and i outta here but i was pleasantly surprised it had a limited amount of lace no bows and no frills to speak of and certainly no polka dots it a cream colour bodice with a full skirt the bodice had flowery lace over lay but the skirt was plain so it okay sort of but then again i would be happier to never have to wear a dress again so i suppose my judgment may be a little harsh once the assistant had gushed over the way in which the fabric fell and the colour complimented me yada yada yada i dragged mother off to my favourite shoe boutique where i was allowed off my lead to sniff out as many shoes as i liked it was like releasing a furry rodent back into its natural habitat i ran around like a mad thing picking up every sparkly glittery sequinned feathered or strappy high heel i could find i doubt i could ever hold down a monogamous relationship at least with a shoe i found another to die for pair of heels they re quite simple with one strap across the toes they re a cream colour so they go with the dress and because they re about three and a half inches tall they had an ankle strap personally i love the ankle strap it two pieces of cream ribbon that you wrap round your ankle and then do up in a bow at the back i tried to convince mother into letting me get this other pair of gorgeous sparkly heels but she said that i wasntallowed a pair that would take away emphasis from the dress er that was the point but oh well i love my shoes any how i now have two new favourite pairs of shoes my grey ones and the cream ones sigh this love business isnthalf bad however the escort thing is will said that he tried to get mummy dearest to let him be my escort but the old bat just sat him done and told him that he had to release his hold on me and that i would be fine vivian son is a perfectly nice young man and would take good care of me ugh i swear she set on me marrying the bloke i refuse i will not be forced into doing something i dontwant to do i dontcare if the old bat begs me she can never force me to say i do holly doggy doo on toast tuna found me my bedroom ugh i thought tuna wedding planning would let me off the hook i thought wrong i have just been subjected to two hours worth of wedding talk two i tell you do you have any idea how many brain cells got killed off how about the number of iq points that will be have to be knocked off two hours of mindless chatter could turn einstein into a vegetable seriously tuna wedding prattle is more effective than a frontal lobe lobotomy less messy as well when petunia found me she dragged me off to the quilting room where mother was waiting for us i say the quilting room but that doesntmean it actually used for quilting my mother had a whim some where back along the line to make quilts dontask me where it came from it an unsolved mystery but gave up a after about a month and four quilts any way anyone who seen a quilting room knows that it has these massive great tables in middle that you spread the quilt out on turns out these tables are actually excellent for organising social functions on and my mother has made it her office for planning social extravaganzas when i walked in there was papers scattered all over every available surface there was table cloth samples colour samples material samples flower samples and every other sort of sample available ah there you girls are now lily we have to work out your best colour what why darling say pardon and we have to get your dress made i stood stunned for a second what dress why do i need a dress of course you need a dress after all we canthave the maid of honour wearing some ratty old thing well no they have to look just as good as the bride because after all they are expected to be the next to be married wait one cotton pickin minute me the maid of honour for petunia that it she finally cracked the woman has lost whatever little grasp she had on reality not that it was ever very much to begin with but still do you mean to say i petunia maid of honour i asked with a horrified look on my face my mother just nodded as she turned her back on me to fossick for dress material samples i turned wide eyed to petunia for conformation you re okay with this now that i wouldntbe able to believe tuna and i dontexactly get a long actually it more like we cantstand each others personalities petunia was perched on a queen anne chair it tradition that the maid of honour is the brides sister so it is only fitting that you as my sister are my maid of honour ah of course it expected of her so she excepts it had there been no protocol i would have been lucky to get an invite plus that was code for screw this up and i ll screw you up but wait that means i have to be her maid of honour even worse it means i have to play a large part in tuna wedding hey that means i knew she was setting me up for marriage i just knew it well i ll be buggered if i going to catch the damn bouquet nope no matter what she says i am not going to follow in tuna foot steps dear lord i didntrealise there was so many shades of yellow and i do believe that harry got off lightly from his lecture if i had my way i would be dressed in black or better yet not even part of the bridal party but i have to be because it tradition sodding tradition screw tradition there would be no modern advances in this world if every one followed traditio no television no zonko s no honeyduke chocolate oh my no honeyduke chocolate i think i d die wait scratch that i would die so like i said to hell with tradition but that would of course never happen especially not in our house seeing as the social butterflies here think every thing must be exactly inline with protocol well that will stop once i get married which i dontplan on doing for a while a long while a very long while but i will hand it to tuna she definitely has an eye for fashion i zoned out after the first 20 minutes of the different shades of yellow talk so i have no actual idea of what i ll be wearing but i not worried because tuna will want to display her wedding photos on her new mantelpiece and she couldntif i looked like i was wearing a sack she has to much pride to let anyone outside the family know just how much we dislike each other i dontwant to be her sodding maid of honour that means i have to throw her a hen hight ugh mother will give me a list of ideas and i ll have to pick one damn this is going to take effort wednesday 22nd december two sleeps till the apocalypse oh my giddy aunt i am going to beat william over the head with his broomstick till he unconcious when i ve finished with him he ll never look at a broom stick the same way again he ll wish broom sticks and the entire concept of quidditch had never been invented you see as will warned me my mother booked me into this beauty parlour thing where all of my mothers inner circle goes to get their hair done and all those other vital beauty things my mother checked me in while she went to have a look at suitable mother of the bride out fits thankfully i was able to persuade the stylist into doing just what i wanted of course that took quite a bit of convincing say about half an hour of arguing about how my hair would be cut the hairdresser wanted to cut it all funky and add highlights and give me a weirdo part with the latest bangs i on the other hand simply wanted my hair washed trimmed and blow dried you can see how that sparked the conflict well i came out with a nice trim so my hair looked healthy and it was blow dried straight so it was all bouncy and shiny the hair dresser was rather sulky when i walked out looking mostly like i did when i went in that was the same reaction as the wicked witches did you even get it cut was her indignant response you think a pushy hairdresser can defeat me pft you ve got another thing coming after showing me all the possible mother of the bride out fits which took a couple of hours since she felt the need to model each and every one of them for me to scrutinise we finally got to g home but i wasntoff the hook yet in the car mother dearest babbled endlessly about the upcoming ball that was fine because i could just stare out the window and will myself to drown her out however she started with the questions what colour should your corsage be what colour should the car be what colour coat should you have black or white what tie should your escort wear i was ready to scream so i rushed out of the car in order to avoid fighting with her lillianna get back here and answer me pointless effort really and it all went down hill from there we started a screaming match in the entrance hall and took it in to the parlour i dontcare what colour the car is it could be black blue or lime green with purple polka dots for all i care in all honesty i would prefer that it wasnt lime green with purple polka dots but i had to get my point across some how well you should care this is your introduction to society you should be taking an interest why petunia planned her entire party herself oh please petunia has planned every one of her birthdays by herself six months in advance since the age of five newsflash i not petunia and i never will be go talk to perfect petty about bloody corsage colours by the way my introduction is to impress your friends so you can keep me out it my only part in this is to be a pretty face they are not just my friends they will be your friends as well as of friday i dontbloody think so do i look suicidal like hell they will i not entering that piranha pit and just for the record i dontcare how nice vivian son is i not going to make two families one with that i flung my arms in the air whirled around and stalked off towards the lounge lillianna get back here i resisted the urge to scream sod off i ignored the old bat and kept walking i didntlook up till i was at the doorway separating the lounge room from the parlour and i was surprised to be met with five shocked faces surprised is an understatement i looked as though i had been petrified a major blow up on the what the third day of holidays that has to be a record even for you anna i glared at will before turning right around and marching straight up the stairs to my room bloody william the freaking marauders were sitting there in the couch staring at me shell shocked as though they had never seen an emotional teenage girl have a screaming match with her mother actually when i think about they probably havent they have no experience of sisters that i know of any way i refuse to go down stairs till they ve left i certainly dontwant to see potter the lily part is still prevailing i cantbelieve they saw that ugh how am i supposed to face them i will kill him he could have told me they were coming over but nooooo will just goes and invites the bane of my existence over without giving me any warning now i ll have to avoid the marauders for a bloody long time bloody brothers hi everyone i know that you are most likely throwing rotten fruit at me or at least thinking about sending abusive emails on the basis that i haventupdated in almost two weeks and i totally agree with you but here me out i have just gone back to school for my last year of high school so i have my tertiary entrance exams to study for and contend with you see our school came out really badly last year because the year above my year were a bunch of no hopers so they are taking no chances with us and i have been loaded with home work also i spent the week end friday afternoon till monday afternoon in the capital city of the state i live in to go to this mega awesome music festival so again i very very sorry but i will try to write another chapter this weekend but it is my friends birthday so i not promising anything i didntget time to answer reviews but thankyou so much to all those who took the time however i have one issue i would like to address the following review was submitted anonymously poter was a seeker like harry you moran now i have nothing against reviewers that point out my mistakes such as the picasso van gough mix up i apologise my brain was muddled from art history study but i would appreciate if they were well written grammatically correct with proper spelling and at least well thought out and researched to this review i can only answer with the following thank you for the review however it was hard to determine just what you wished to discuss by poter i presume you mean james potter and i hate to have to correct you but if you were to read the books you would find that james potter was indeed a chaser and his position was altered to fit the movie i have never been called a moran before so i guessing you mean moron i would like to point out that before you call some one a moran you should at least get your facts straight sorry about that little rant but that review has been annoying me since it appeared but thankyou all very much for your positive reviews and for pointing out my honest mistakes please remember to r e v i e w absolute shocker by jamesroxmysox disclaimer i own nothing recognisable from the harry potter books or movies that belongs to j and warner brothers studios thursday 23rd december my last day of freedom that if i ever actually ever had any so close and yet so far i referring to my hogwarts oasis and ultimate removal from the spotlight after christmas i can just relax and let tuna wedding take up all mother time until i get to go back to school where i will be hundreds of miles out of my mother reach the only catch is that i have to endure tomorrow which i can already tell will stretch itself out forever is it really worth it apparently yes i would say well look at petunia she turned out fine there no permanent damage just a little temporary insanity but nothing long lasting only thing is she didnt turn out fine this is the basis of my resistance i do not want to end up like either of the other two females in my immediate family today was shall we say interesting yes i think that the only way to describe it first of all i had a rather spirited discussion with will over breakfast all right so i blasted him but he deserved it and yes he did deserve it he had the marauders over with out even warning me they were coming i think i got my point across basically i pointed out that a they are all prats will included b that the could have at least warned me about them coming over and c that there was one in particular i couldntstand and did not want to see right now as will very well knew of course there was quite a few bloody and sod mix into the argument and it was a little more dramatic with a number of flamboyant statements but that the general idea after my little rant will gave me a weird look that said he had no idea what that was all about but he d find out later he just drained his orange juice and left before i could scream at him any more probably so i would calm down enough for him to interrogate me about the out burst thing and why i dontlike potter so much oh well i would probably have told him at one point or another still not happy with him though any way i avoided mother dearest and tuna all morning while they ran around getting things ready what for i have no idea most likely the wedding but knowing petunia it could also be for my coming out it would never do to have anything less than perfect her wedding is this summer and everything that any family member does apparently reflects on petunia and her ability to be a good wife and daughter in law go figure i ve had numerous lectures on not behaving freaky as petunia calls it will has been told to be on his best behaviour as well though i get the most warnings because i also happen to be a complete klutz and i younger so therefore tuna can hold her authority of being the older sibling over me dear lord what i would do for a pair of invisible ear muffs the kind professor sprout has for when dealing with mandrakes now that would be a useful invention of the wizarding world i bet that children everywhere would thank the creators incessantly due to the relief of no longer being subjected to the rants and raves of their nagging mothers and older siblings actually i think i ll have to look into that when i get back to school my summer needntbe so horrid after all speaking of blissful escapes from mothers and siblings while i was relaxing in the library all right so i wasntrelaxing but actually escaping tuna and the old bat but it not like either of them would actually go in there voluntarily unless they were certain i was in there and even then it would just be to drag me off to some important meeting any way as i was occupying myself in the library i came across this book on brains well apparently the cerebral cortex the big wrinkly fleshy part is responsible for coordination and motor functions until it becomes subconscious and then the cerebellum is responsible i ve been duded i demand a refund my cerebral cortex is malfunctional i wonder if it came with a warranty so all those times i have smacked into things and people for that matter it has been because my cerebral cortex is a lazy bugger who cantbe bother to get it right bleeding thing i think i shall have to have a little chat with the little men in my head dontlook at me like that according to my book when i was a kid there are little men up there pulling levers and pressing buttons to make me do things i ll have to sit them down and tell them to get their act together but mind you i have some things down pat such as sliding down the banister i love that it soooo much fun whenever my mother caught me when i was little i would tell her i was being mary poppins of course i never thought i was mary poppins but she seemed happy enough with that explanation seeing as mary poppins was a respectable role model though i have heard her complaining to daddy that it has had serious effects on me what with all that encouraging of the imagination she probably right when i think about it but these days i dontusually get caught emphasis on usually today i was having a great time sliding down the banister i usually have about three or five goes on my last go sixth time actually i didntrealise any one was in the entrance hall until it was to late i came flying off the banister and straight into my loony aunt lizzie and some other visitor my mother came rushing out from the lounge to see what all the fuss was about and immediately flared up lillianna elizabeth just what is the meaning of this i detangled myself from the various arms and legs i was caught up in so i was in a sitting position time for the innocent act right action stations remorseful air check bambi eyes check helpless look check defeated posture check oops my mother didntbuy it for a second you ve been sliding down the banisters again haventyou i cast my eyes downwards just how exactly do i get out of this one leave the girl alone meredith she needs to express her inner child anna has almost left the world of children completely let her enjoy it while it lasts i fought to keep the smile off my face aunt lizzie psycho babble finally comes in handy i looked up at my mother with the bambi eyes i was just trying to see if i could still be mary poppins my goodness i an awful liar she just gave me a glare you re lucky we have company i smiled brightly at my mother before jumping up and helping up aunt lizzie i gave her a hug and muttered my thanks i almost died when i helped up the other woman it was vivian holy crapolla on toast i apologised profusely and was about to make my get away when my mother decided on a bit of pay back lillianna since you were obviously coming down for afternoon tea why dontyou join us in the sitting room bloody hell i smiled weakly i d love too there was no way to get out of that one it was posed as a question but really it was a command half an hour later i sat slouched in my chair there tapping my nose with my left index finger bored out of my mind the three women in front of me were prattling about some baby shower they had just been to the beautiful d cor the gorgeous presents the ravishing attire the ungrateful host the cucumber sandwiches i sat like this for i dontknow how long when i made an interesting discovering i cantsquish my nose i serious i cannot for the life of me squish my nose it seriously doesntbend i once saw nessa flatten her nose against her cheek and that what inspired me to try but alas i cannot i looked over at mother dearest and aunt lizzie yep i definitely get it from their side of the family i tried pushing it down to the left to the right nothing worked i was just poking at it to see how hard the cartilage was when i caught my mother eye uh oh she widened her eyes and jerked her head towards vivian and aunt lizzie who were excitably gushing over something or other pair of bloody school girls i sighed straightened up and looked interested that lasted a whole thirty seconds i raised my finger to resume my nose cartilage investigation damn mothers yes that right the old bat caught me she stuffed a jam and cream smothered scone into my hands i just stared at it horrified no way was i eating that cream fresh sodding cream not bloody likely i glared at my mother she knows i hate fresh cream the evil cow she glared straight back at me evil evil cow that it i ve had enough oh mother i ve just remember i promised petunia that i would go over the brides maid dresses with her i so sorry but i ll have to go meet her yikes and people wonder where i learnt to glare from it biological i tell you not that i would openly admit to such a thing well dear you had better go see her then she ll be in the quilting room of course my mother could see straight through my lie but she didntwant to lose face in front of vivian plus it makes it seem like we have a close loving family it wonderful of you to be helping your sister like that lillianna especially with your own event so close vivian commented aunt lizzie stifled a grin i gave her a tight smile well i must be off it was lovely to see you again vivian aunt lizzie i terribly sorry our meeting had to be cut short i gave a small curtsy and walked calmly out the room as soon as i shut the glass doors i lent against the wall beside them letting out a sigh to end all sighs my mother voice floated out o me oh yes the girls are very close lillianna is to be petunias maid of honour i mean it is only fitting they simply do everything together it wonderful really i scoffed in her dreams i decided i should at least pay a visit to tuna i mean i did use her as an excuse to escape the clutches of the social climbers club i opened the door a crack and peaked in she looks a bit stressed i ll make it quick hi petunia are the bridesmaid dresses still yellow she looked up annoyed the glare is most definitely biological how many times do i have to tell you it prim i cut her off right they re still yellow bye i muttered quickly before shutting the door and sprinting down the hall that how i came to find myself back in the library aimlessly staring at walls and book spines i think this has become my refuge my sanctuary safe from my nut case family i ve been staring at the wall for quite a while now and since writing this i have finally paid attention to what exactly i staring at our latest family portrait ugh the disturbing thing is i cantclaim i adopted i look just like my mother and i cantclaim that tuna adopted either she looks just like dad sort of it weird when you look at our family because us children dontreally look all that alike okay so that not true will and harry look like they belong there i mean they are both the spitting image i ve always hated this expression i think it rather disgusting of dad the blonde hair tanned skin same facial features will has the same build but harry has a lot of growing to do yet they look like the pride and joy of any father but their place in our family is confirmed by their green eyes which are exactly like the old bat petunia and i are rather shall we say different i look just like mummy dearest right down to the last freckle i didntknow that was physically possible pale skin vibrant red hair green eyes average build yep that me petunia on the other hand is tanned blonde and has dad coffee coloured eyes i always wondered how she managed to make such a nice warm colour seem so cold and distant but really i am sad to say tuna and i share my mother facial features and build but i have to say there was mutated gene some where in tuna genetic make up because she has the longest neck i have ever seen i swear she could pass as a giraffe when i look at this bloody portrait i have to say that i look distinctly weird i stick out like a sore thumb being the only child with red hair and looking absolutely nothing like my dad how the heck did that happen i mean this has never occurred to me before i mean i really do look weird when compared to my siblings bloody hell some one come into the library most likely searching for me ugh if it tuna or the wicked witch i am not coming out anna sod it it worse than i thought anna i know you re here it the only place tuna and mum would never step foot it bloody will probably came to see me about that little out burst this morning anna where are y there you are damn he found me hi i gave a fake smile er was there anything specific you wanted to see me about i received a raised eyebrow for the idiot question and the failed attempt at ignorance anna the piercing stare thing again first remus now will where will it end yes innocence always feign innocence will rolled his eyes and took a seat beside me you know very well what i want to talk to you about that little out burst this morning it could just be me but i think you ve been holding that in for a while now yeah well if you count three days as a while then yes i have been holding that one in now are you going to tell me what has got you is such a mind bogglingly awful mood or do i have to drag it out of you i opened my mouth to answer that only the severest of tickling charms coupled with veritaserum and dontyou dare give me any glib about tickling charms and truth serum because i ll take you up on it i quickly shut my mouth and glared at our family portrait dontyou think it weird how i the only one that looks just like mum i mean i dontlook any thing like the rest of you will continued to bore his eyes into the side of my face how does he keep his eyes like that i suppose that another family trait i do that to dana and bridget when i need them to confess to something you re just different is all stop avoiding the issue why exactly are you so against the marauders they seem perfectly friendly to me yes well they are to you now arentthey me on the other hand well let not go there or is it more just one marauder in particular yet another family trait an overload of curiosity i just tightened my jaw i can sense the grin threatening to over come his entire head so what exactly is your problem with james i opened my mouth to answer and was cut off yet again and donttell me it because he a prat i sulked come on anna what the real problem i took my time trying to desperately find a civilised way to explain my situation he likes me wow that makes it sound so simple it the first time i ve said it out loud and oh my giddy aunt it sounds weirder than scuba diving monkeys actually this is the first time since the incident that i have thought about it well i ve thought about it it just that most of the time images of grievously maiming potter and his friends were flashing through my mind at the same time will brow creased with a frown and you dontreturn the feelings i turned and glared at will no i dontreturn his sodding feelings he nothing but an arrogant manipulative black mailing git he a bloody tosser who i wish to never lay eyes on again he a cunning vindictive prick who belongs with his reptile brothers in slytherin i sat there breathing heavily glaring with all my might will eyebrows disappeared into his hair that rather harsh just cos he likes you i wish it was that simple it would be harsh yes if and only if he hadntblackmailed my crush coerced my friends manipulated my life in general and just plain annoyed the hell out of me will just blinked okay well i can see you have a few things that you have to deal with i think i ll just leave you to sort them out shall i but i pretty sure our little chat will have helped you feel better with that he tore out of here so fast it was like me trying to escape tuna clutches will wrong however i do not feel better i was conveniently refusing to acknowledge the existence of the above statement there is a small voice in my head reminding me that refusing to acknowledge something is exactly the same as acknowledging it in a whiney sing song voice that sounds suspiciously like nessa well whatever it was the issue at hand and i had come to an agreement it ignores me and i ignore it we were quite happy in the world of oblivion well i think i was any way friday 24th december judgment day ugh it is now 7pm and i believe i have been put through every beauty treatment known to woman i have seriously been plucked powdered and pressed to within an inch of my life not a nice feeling i can tell you i am at the moment waiting while my mother goes to get my escort no matter how many times i say it it still sounds like a male prostitute has been hired to walk me round the room sort of like infer whenever any one says it i immediately imagine the person in a mink coat my mind is far to literal for my own good tuna and the old bat have been insufferable i didnteven get to tell the hair stylist how i wanted my hair or the beautician what make up all these decisions were made for me by my loving mother and caring sister i swear you would think that it was petunia coming out the way she has been going on about everything needing to be perfect on the phone screaming at people about flowers i dontsee what the big fuss is the annual christmas ball is held at the same gigantic mansion every year in the same ostentatious hall with the same ancient dilapidated host who is at least a hundred okay yes they are going to read out my name from a piece of card and yes i am going to walk down the stairs and yes i will be introduced to a bunch of mind bogglingly boring people but so what seems more appropriate to throw a wake then a party at the moment i am slouching in my designer dress which if i knew the price of i would probably keel over from the guilt of how many starving children could be cured of hunger for the rest of their miserable lives with the money spent on this one dress trying to breath from how tight the corset part at the back was tied this is the first time today that i ve been left unsupervised ahhhhhhhhhhh silence i like silence i wonder if there is any way in which i could remain here in my little holding pen our sitting room i suppose i could faint or trip and knock myself out but that requires to much effort mother dearest and tuna fish are being the gracious hostesses they are and are entertaining their friends they always go to the ball with oh lordy what i would do for a pair of earmuffs if i have to hear tuna high pitched fake laugh one more time elizabeth are you ready dear we re about to leave oh crap she called me elizabeth that can only mean she particularly wants to impress whoever out there ugh that statement was not for my benefit it was merely for show she knows perfectly well i sitting here all pretty just waiting she wheeled me in and sat me here for goodness sake no no that was just for the benefit of her guests she just came bustling in here a bustling ball of energy paid me a heap of compliments more like an excuse for her to flatter herself seeing as i look just like her and gave me the spiel about how this is such wonderful day for her and hoe she is so proud proud proud of what that i a sixteen year old girl as i said the woman has issues you know if the truth be told this isntmy day it not even petunia day it is with out a doubt my mother day and she is lapping up the lime light my god it makes me want to be sick after babbling for what seemed like an age and a half she slipped back out the door with one final instruction i ll send your escort in to collect you he absolutely gorgeous i pulled a face but she didntsee since the old primadonna was already out the door escort it has such horrid connotations collect me what am i a shoe in the lost property box it sounds almost like i belong to the boy i mean you collect your prize or in my case lost flip flop from the lost property box there is a distinct feeling of ownership accompanying those words well sod that i am most certainly not a possession of any kind wait the door is opening ugh i can here my mother twittering away about something and then some one answering hey i know that voice but from where that the million dollar question oh dear lord no does the universe hate me really i must have been the equivalent of stalin or something maybe i really the queen of the damned and i donteven know it right enough of my possible extremely secretive secret identities why in the name of things chocolaty does it have to be him i mean really how does my mother even know him well he may be vivian son but that doesntmean i am going to by any means allow mummy dearest and vivian to call one another family the woman has well and truly crackers if she expects me to marry him i dontgive flying fart in space what she wants i refuse to marry him sod it i have to go oh well they reckon that once you re dead you dontfeel anything which is always a positive but i believe death by boredom and awkwardness is a tedious and drawn out process why couldnti just be turned in to a cockroach hi everyone i know the immediate response to that statement will be a number of drawn guns and quite a few readers threatening to introduce me to hades and the acheron river but just hear me out first it is now up to you as the reader to decide who is vivian son you may or may not have noticed buti have set it up subtly so it can be a number of canidates there is the obvious and the not so obvious what i want you to do is tell me who you want the mystery date to be i am effectively putting it to you as the readers to decide who lily date is so when you review please vote for who who you want as vivian son okay you can now go back to those explict imaginations of my demise please remember to vote and r e v i e w absolute shocker by jamesroxmysox disclaimer i own nothing recognisable from the harry potter books or movies that belongs to j and warner brothers studios friday 24th december my room yipeee it finally over remus bloody remus lupin of all the sodding people on this sodding planet she had to choose sodding remus i mean come on it s remus remus oh i definitely need a cookie that who my escort was i was so shocked i just stared at him when he came in i almost screamed the house down when i regained my senses i think the only person worse would have been potter no wait black could have been bad as well no scratch that black wasnthalf as bad as remus i mean sure black did the intimidation thing but remus was supposed to be my friend well sort of anyway he was clued up and yet he still helped potter that it remus is the official scum of the earth of course potter is the bacterium that makes up the scum of the earth but the point is remus is one of the last people i wish to see at this moment he seemed uncomfortable under my gaze er lily we um sort of have to go now this brought me out of my trance i resumed my scowl and stalked out passed him of course i plastered a smile on my face as i left the room ah elizabeth there you are i thought we had lost you this little bit of theatre earned my mother some chuckles oh you look gorgeous elizabeth cooed a lady i cantremember ever meeting and this woman would be the very reason why i am being called elizabeth now for introductions oh elizabeth you remember lord and lady evensdale i smiled politely how could i ever forget it wonderful to see you both again i was thrilled when mother told me you would be at the ball ugh being polite to boring old fuddy duddies just one of the painful duties of being the daughter of elizabeth evans of course you know vivian and harold i turned to the happy couple that were fussing over their son it such a delight to see you again vivian harold i dontbelieve we ve seen each other properly since last august mother really must invite you round to dinner before the holidays are over remus was just staring at me as though i had gone mad hey i never said i was bad at the socialite thing i just said i didntlike it we should get going we wouldntwant to keep everyone waiting now would we the sooner we go the sooner i get home oh yes we really must leave remus dear could you please help elizabeth on with her coat as remus helped me into my coat well cape thing really it was cream like the dress and of course completely overdone with embroidery on the lapels and being made of cashmere he whispered in my ear you have a lot of explaining to do just who does he think he is i have a lot of explaining to do what about him he knew a lot more about this than i did i not the only one i hissed back by the time i had finally got my dress and cape thingy under control harry petunia and will were all standing perfectly assembled by the door my mother was gossiping away with vivian both of them looking at remus and myself with big smiles and glassy eyes now lord and lady evensdale you remember william victoria and henry of course my dad just rolled his eyes as the old bat continued to ramble on geez i love my dad how he ever got stuck with the old bat i ll never know finally it was time to get in the car remus and i went in a car separately from everyone else i do believe i almost suffocated from the amount of awkward silence filling the interior awfully stuffy i felt as though my only means of survival was to suffocate remus with my big coat cape thingy before i went insane of course i was saved from actually taking action and fulfilling my plan of survival by the sight of the dirty great manor looming on the horizon it wasntrelief that stopped me oh no it was shear terror as i had an anxiety attack all to my self just thinking about this whole bleeding introduction to society business once at the entrance to the massive great hall we had to all wait while we were announced well actually remus and i had to wait until exactly 8 30 pm before we were announced lord and lady evans were announced followed by william evans and petunia victoria evans harry was sent round to stay with the rest of the under sixteens finally it was time for my big announcement i had refused to look at remus the entire time we were forced to spend alone of course he was getting over his initial awkwardness and was trying to catch my eye not that i was having any of it i was still well and truly peeved at him and wasntabout to change my mind any time soon we arranged ourselves at the top of the stairs so that i was exposed the most to the crowd waiting below how i wished i still had my coat the little penguin man announced me and he was a penguin short squat and wearing a traditional tuxedo with black tie i thought that when he opened his mouth he might have one of those horrible squeaky little voices like the penguins on mary poppins actually when i think about it the waiters and butlers of the world are probably in alliance with those bloody penguins in there pursuit for revenge i mean the misrepresentation of the singing dancing squeaky voiced waiters doesntjust apply to the penguins i think i will be a hell of a lot nicer to any poor person forced to wear such attire from now on ladies lords and gentlemen may i introduce to you all ms lillianna elizabeth evans making her first appearance in society accompanied by mr remus lupin bugger me i took a deep breath before making my way down the stairs i almost fainted when i saw how many people there were i not good with being the centre of attention especially in front of large crowds as we made our way down the stairs i had to restrain myself from lashing out at will as i went passed him he told me that there was nothing to it you just walk down the stairs while everyone continued to chat between themselves he lied the whole sodding hall went silent as i came down those infernal stairs every single one of them watching me whispering as remus and i preformed the traditional waltz around the grand ball room once all that was over my mother and vivian bustled over to congratulate me and compliment both remus and myself i was just about to tear into my mother for putting me through this when something caught the corner of my eye he didnt he wouldntdare dear lord he did that little monkey harry stole my wand i muttered my excuses before tearing after the little cretin elizabeth where do you think you are going harry disappeared under the drinks table i snatched up the tablecloth i ve got you now you little monster harry gave me a startled look before a cheeky grin took over and he headed out towards the garden as we passed vivian mother spotted us lillianna elizabeth and henry charles you get back here this instant to hell with her my wand is on the line here when i got out into the garden it was rather dark and gloomy harry was no doubt hiding somewhere i have no idea how many times i have told harry he is not to play with my wand but if i ve told him once i ve told him a thousand times he probably saw today as his best opportunity to get his little mitts on it in a long while i mean i haventbeen anywhere near my room all day so he probably been working on getting it out of my trunk for a good eight hours harry come out now silence harry i mean it i ll never send you another honeydukes sweet again probably thinks he can hold out till he can get there himself fat chance you know since i always get the owl post i could always say you dontwant to come to hogwarts this summer if you get one that is i mean i could always go have a quite chat with mcgonagall he ignoring me still cocky little bugger thinks i dontmean it henry charles if you dontcome out this instance i will personally make sure you never set foot in zonko joke shop ever i scared little face popped out from behind a bush ha that got him to think a joke shop means more to him than honeydukes or hogwarts you wontreally do any of those things will you anna i can go to zonko right you and will promised to take me harry asked in a small voice as he ambled up to me and dropped my wand into my out stretched hand no you can go to zonko s now go back inside i watched him run off as remus came to the door looking for me on my mother orders no doubt i squared my shoulders lily your mother wanted me to find you blimey i need a cookie i sure she did he looked rather uncomfortable why dontwe go get a drink for me that was a reasonable comment seeing as i wanted to rip his head off for his recent behaviour um okay sure once inside remus seemed to become a little more at ease will came over and said hello see it wasntthat bad now was it anna i glared at him you are unbelievably lucky that there are so many witnesses or else you would already have ten bullets and various hexes riddling your body i gave him a sickly sweet smile but do you like my shoes i absolutely love them they re gorgeous arentthey remus politely nodded as i showed them both my pride and joy the only good thing to come out of this whole coming out thing will just shook his head and laughed anna you re the most flippant person i know he laughed before walking off i ve always wondered about that i was still admiring my shoes to really notice what remus was muttering about pardon i stopped looking at my glorious shoes and looked up at remus giving him my full attention sorry you ve always wondered about what why your brothers calls you anna but your friends call you lily and your mother well your mother calls you various names elizabeth lillianna lillianna elizabeth before tonight i wasntexactly which of elizabeth daughters i was actually taking to this ball and it turns out that all three are the one person i shrugged as we made our way over to a table well as you know my name is lillianna and if you didntyou do now my brothers have always called me by the last part anna when i went to hogwarts i introduced myself to nessa and the twins as lillianna evans they adopted the first half of my name to address me by lily my mother well my mother addresses me according to the people she introducing me to remus looked a bit confused i still dontget the elizabeth part ugh this may take a while well you see elizabeth is my middle name and in case you haventnoticed all my mother children are named after royalty just like her william james petunia victoria lillianna elizabeth and henry charles apparently they sound more regal petunia and i are addressed by our middle names in more prestigious company got it he still doesntget it sort of but let me get this straight you acquired a new name when you went to hogwarts i stared at him incredulously no dontbe ridiculous it simply a nickname it quite handy really i always know where i know someone from by the way they address me dear lord this is boring i cantwait to get home and get to those cookies i think i may be compelled to commandeer a whole plate lily about the ball at school i looked up sharply from fiddling with my dress dontstart remus there is no reason to make a mind bogglingly dull night even worse lily listen to me you cantavoid the issue forever true but i can have a good goddamn try i know but i can post pone it remus doesntlook at all impressed you know will has invited us over for another game of quidditch next week and i pretty sure james is going to seek you out while we re there i almost exploded i swung around in my seat searching for will when i catch up with him he is dead lily if you just let me explain explain what what part exactly would you be explaining remus potter manipulation black intimidation tactics the coercion of my friends your betrayal of my trust you ll have to be a little bit more specific about what you re explaining remus he looked a little stunned as i glared at him at this moment my mother swooped down upon us eek i can feel my very soul being sucked from me my darlings you should be dancing your little hearts out with that the horrid old bat confiscated our drinks and threw us on to the dance floor remus and i awkwardly held each other as we danced well really it wasntholding it was more just holding hands slightly i hate how you have to be silent when you dance so i decided to strike up conversation i had done my explaining well as much as i felt i needed to anyway now it was remus turn i muttered in remus ear now it your turn to explain you knew who i was all along didntyou remus shifted uncomfortably i knew you were elizabeth evans daughter if that what you mean your mother showed me a picture of you once when she was having tea one time i groaned so you have been at the same school as me for the last five and bit years and you never thought to tell me you knew my family well it never came up and i haventalways known it was the easter holidays of my fifth year when your mum showed me the picture plus i didntthink you d want a reminder of your lovely family existence i thought about this are you kidding it wonderful now i have some one to gripe to when my mother is being particularly social or rather is encouraging me to be particularly social once i ve forgiven you that is remus tightened his grip on me about that lily i sorry i truly am but i wouldnthave helped james if it was going to result in you coming to any harm i gave him a disbelieving look i sorry i betrayed your trust and helped james with his plans but i cantapologise for james and sirius or ask for forgiveness on their behalf i only asking for you to accept my apology i scrutinised him for a moment okay friends remus asked hopefully i thought about it for a moment it would be good to have someone who knew both sides of the story i quirked a smile friends remus grinned you do know this means i have to now start talking to all my friends again and forgive them entirely remus acquired an arrogant smirk of course i just single handily saved you from desolated and lonely life well maybe you can use that highly developed brain of yours to help me figure out this whole bleeding mess of course i can as you said i have a highly developed brain i can become your official advisor well it only fitting since i am clearly wise and clever beyond your years you re an arrogant prat you know that he grinned down at me i a marauder what do you expect i couldnthelp but laugh okay okay i admit you helped now help me decide the best way to liven this exceedingly dull gathering it took remus about an hour to persuade me that adding fake vomit to the punch was not the best idea and that i would never again set foot in this hall if i was to set fire to countess of kent wig oh come on just make it smoke a little then sh what are you planning to do now i sincerely hope it has nothing to do with the countess wig again she just got a new one and is quite proud of it i turned around to face william grinning like an idiot having a good time i glared at him you know it would save so much trouble if you had just got out your wand and made that horrid beehive smoke the first time i asked will just shook his head saved trouble for who i know that the countess wouldntsee it like that save my piece of mind you should at least try to save your youngest sister sanity i mean tuna has already gone off the deep end now you just have to save me will and remus both laughed at my dramatics hey remus the little wench here isntmaking things too unbearable is she no just letting her mischievous side show through speaking of mischievous i turned to face will straight on wilma when exactly where you going to get up the courage to tell me that you had scheduled another quidditch match i call him the female version of his name when he being a wimp will bit his lip i was actually hoping you wouldntfind out about that unbelievable and he was gryffindor golden boy as well he a disgrace i tell you i rotten disgrace by 11pm i was bored out of my mind remus was doing the dutiful son thing charming the pants off some crusty old woman to please his mother william was patiently listening to the rant of our dear uncle larson he positively ancient but he awfully nice harry was happily running around being the mischievous little cretin he is terrorising some poor delegate i do actually take a bit of the responsibility for that one but how was i to know he d grow up to be just like will i was having to do the dutiful daughter thing myself and was dancing with some self important wanker my mother and i i was forced into it i swear had been talking with some pompous woman who promptly summoned the gigantic bore that is her son i almost screamed when he asked me to dance the old bat gave me a look that said if i didnti would never see the light of day again ugh the things i am forced to endure i smiled sweetly and shyly as i have been trained to do and accepted his hand as he led me onto the dance floor i began to doubt my original judgment of this boy little did i know what i was letting myself into everything was fine until he opened his mouth my god i thought i have verbal diarrhoea this bloke has a spastic bloody colon first he told me how is going to be 21 next month that was the first warning sing any bloke in this circle of society who is coming of age is to be avoided at all costs their mother begin to shop for potential brides just like my own mother will begin to do after petunia wedding since will is 21 next year second he informed me he was studying law at harvard university it progressed to an unnerving sensation this is enough to make the warning bells go haywire you donttell people about your schooling unless you wish to impress them and i certainly didntwant to be impressed thirdly he expressed his interest in polo he inquired as to whether i liked horses and invited me to come to his match next week that was it i do not like where this is going no no no i dontlike this at all if my bloody mother puts me up to that then i will well and truly scream the house down you see this is how these people show affection to their horses and their dogs hence the magazine horse and hound inviting me to a polo match is like any normal person asking you to the movies or hogsmeade i opened my mouth to say no i busy when the music stopped and he steered me back over to our darling mothers you look lovely elizabeth you and edward both dance divinely ah so that his name i did the sweet smile thing again thank you it was pleasure to dance with you edward no no the pleasure was all mine elizabeth i am grateful just to have a chance to know you better i hope i shall see you at the polo match on thursday know me better he waffled about himself the whole time and didntask me one question about myself it was like listening to one long tedious advertisement highlighting the values of some useless item on the shopping channel again i went to answer but my mother jumped in of course elizabeth would love to go she had just finished telling me how much she missed the polo matches staying in france for the majority of the year means she misses out on polo elizabeth would love to come wouldntyou dear what a straight out lie i hate polo absolutely hate it tuna loves polo not me it the sport of nobles apparently everyone who anyone goes to watch the polo i stay at home reading a book when the family goes out for a day at the polo matches yes i cantwait till thursday oh my god i gonna scream i cantbelieve the old bat is making me do this i hate polo i hate watching the horses get beaten by whips i hate how cocky the players are most of all i hate the people who go to watch polo oh no i going to have to see morgan and margaret oh dear lord i hate morgan she has to be the most horrid person i have ever met i call her morgan le fay she an evil manipulative being who should be sent back to the fiery pits of hell from which she sprung margaret isntmuch better she more just morgan little minion unfortunately they both just love polo ugh kill me now tell me elizabeth do you miss your family terribly when you re at school i mean it such a long way from home i put a thoughtful look on my face oh yes i get awfully home sick sometimes but i write letters every week and i come home every holidays so it doesntget too bad my mother smiled proudly and the woman gave me a look of approval it very important for young women to be family orientated these people certainly dontapprove of these flittering young women who leave home with out being married or engaged to roam about the country side working or god forbid for fun when they finally went away my mother started up with her nonsense babble and nauseating gossip that was lady lavinnia drakefield and her son edward they re very well off you know lord drakefield has a number of well established businesses particularly in the middle east i can only imagine he probably employs a whole village for his established businesses and pays them a pittance a month edward is almost twenty one and lavinnia said that she is beginning to contemplate possible matches for her dear edward she has taken quite a liking to you dear and edward well edward is just plain smitten with you i stared at her incredulously how can this thing ever have been a woman let alone a mother mother i dontwhat know you are suggesting seeing as you and vivian have been scheming together for a good 15 years if she was going to set me up with any one i would much prefer it was remus rather than edward drakefield at least i know remus and there is the tiny detail that his best friend would dismember him if he tried anything also i have no idea how edward would take the fact that i a witch oh darling dontblow everything out of proportion vivian and i thought it would be nice but we never set anything in stone edward is a very handsome young man and such a gentleman i scowled as she drifted off to talk the ears off some other poor sap her and vivian may not have set it in stone but i pretty sure they sealed it with blood hi everyone alright before anyone tears my head off i sorry if you didntlike who lily escort was yes i did say vote but that doesntmean that i was necessarily going to go with what the outcome was it a totalitarian democracy so shoot me and yes i am perfectly aware that an oxymoron but if you think about it it is actually what happens you give people the power of choice but then turn around and do whatever you wanted to do in the first place i actually just wanted to see how many people thought it would be james if you go through the story you will actually see some clues that it james but alas it was a red herring thank you to everyone who read and reviewed and all those who had a quick peek as well i really do appreciate your opinions and suggestions tell me what you think please remember to r e v i e w absolute shocker by jamesroxmysox disclaimer i own nothing recognisable from the harry potter books or movies that belongs to j and warner brothers studios saturday 25th december christmas day last night i was so tired i didntget up this morning until nine o clock and that was only because harry came in looking for me seeing that i was asleep he did what any sensible ten year old boy does he jumped started jumping on my bed i screamed multiple insults before i finally gave up and got out of bed now you may be wondering why on earth i am still in bed at nine o clock on christmas morning when there are presents just waiting to be unwrapped see the thing is that in our house present opening doesnthappen until after christmas dinner therefore there is no reason to get out of bed until absolutely necessary harry usually gets will and me up will takes him to play a bit of quidditch before breakfast and sometimes i join them then it my turn i usually take him to the kitchen and we make christmas shaped cookies while christmas dinner is hurriedly prepared about us we actually make a pretty good team christmas dinner better known as the annual family fiasco our large dinning room table that my mother insists is used all year round it ridiculous there are only six of us and yet we use this whopping great thing at all times is adorned with candelabras that are wrapped in tinsel and smothered in holly fat freaky little santas that sing star sequin thingys that get everywhere and of course the traditional leprechaun dontask my mother has this thing about honouring her well our irish celtic ancestry or something as equally idiotic i ve tried countless to tell her that leprechauns have nothing to do with the celts and are in fact cheeky little creatures that love to antagonize people but will she listen not on your life but hey paddy the leprechaun has become a firm member of our christmas holiday traditions he was actually christened patrick but only mother dearest calls him that no one else can be bothered with such formalities family what would we do with out them have a bloody quiet time is what all my deranged family comes round for the annual christmas dinner of course aunt lizzie comes with whatever daft fancy man she picked up this time then there are the grandparents it my mum parents since dad died when i was only about three my god i never thought i would find a woman more aggravating then my mother then along came grandma oh dear lord if she tells me one more time how much i ve grown or what a young lady i ve become i will not be held responsible for my actions i swear my sister mother and grandmother are all channelling the same spirit of evil all with the same ambitious mindset just waiting for the right opportunity to pounce and bring their prey to its knees i have to say i definitely prefer the males of my family dad family is represented by dad siblings uncle damien and aunty debra and their immediate families and also by the batty great aunt dotty uncle damien okay he a barrister of some sort his wife clarisse is nice enough and their daughters amanda and annabelle are only three and two so they re not that much trouble they re actually quite cute when you stuff them full of chocolate aunty debra kids are another story absolute little monsters that the only way to explain them i afraid debra married some high profile brain surgeon and has never been the same according to dad and uncle damien i just like debra used to be carefree cheeky and insane with a healthy disregard for the rules their words not mine but the debra i know is slightly obsessive compulsive with no control over her children to speak of they demand chocolate they get chocolate they want a toy they get it they desire to stay up late they do with or with out debra consent the woman has no backbone eric logan and chelsea have their mother wrapped around their little fingers it pretty scary really eric is the eldest and is the same age as harry logan is eight a brat if i ever i saw one harry leads these two into mischief of elaborate schemes and exploding tea cups and chelsea is five i run and hide when they come to visit apparently chelsea likes me better than the rest of the family put together and shows it by following me around constantly asking annoying questions lucky me it a pity she such a spoiled little princess andrew ashbrook is debra husband and has to be the most arrogant man i ever did meet but you know what i not going to was my ink on him and of course great aunt dotty what can i say about old dotty well she a goer that for sure i ve never approved of this mamby pamby tea business she tells me and what good is living life if your not going to enjoy it with that she drains her glass and calls for another sherry you ve got to love her my lord it funny when her and my grandmother have a conversation grandmamma as she likes to be called acts all proper and dignified ankles crossed back straight sipping her tea delicately desperately trying to claim a place in society whereas great aunt dotty smokes like a chimney drinks like a fish and swears like a trooper and she grew up in this society i almost wet myself laughing listening to grandma try and be all posh in her pearls while dotty slouches in her seat and asks grandma if she ever found that stick she lost up her arse at the table are nine adults who dontnecessarily get along with three children sitting eating peacefully another one whining chelsea to her mother about how she doesntwant to be a lady three troublesome boys running around like mad just itching to get their fingers on the christmas pudding and blow it up and finally two toddlers dressed up to the nines in fairy gear sitting under the table gorging themselves on the chocolate they managed to smuggle from under the christmas tree as you can tell it absolute bedlam with the number of conflicting views on everything from politics and religion to how a galaxy bar should be eaten a debate is destined to break out and just my luck it happened to be about the way young women are conducting themselves these days oh joy as the only member of the congregation that can be described as a young lady i was at the centre of the debate oh please damien you must have seen those girls in the city no dignity at all those skirts they wear almost disappear under their belts i agree with debra the young women of today have completely lost the virtue of modesty and conduct themselves in such an inappropriate manner shut your trap ashbrook what do you know about the young people of today i ve seen the girls of today and they re not half as bad as my niece your wife was when she was young andrew spluttered looking about for some one to help him this started because clarisse politely complimented debra on her dress and then debra went off on some rant about how immoral and immodest the latest fashions are and well it just went from there with andrew the arse jumping on the band wagon alongside his wife now look at petunia and anna they are both respectable young women both have more dignity and are more modest than you ever were at that age debra petunia flushed and stammered a bit well i dontthink i can really be counted seeing as i about to be married but maybe anna can give you an insight into the youth of today if you ll excuse me i ll go help mother with the tea with that she swept off to find mother dearest who had declared she was organising the tea as soon as the debate started pft tea more like an irish coffee minus the coffee the whole table turned to me expectantly thanks tuna well er you see um maybe er i don t i caught sight of will smirking face and my resolve hardened i dontagree with you debra andrew i believe the youth of today are as respectable and dignified as it is possible to be in this changing world it may seem an outrage for some things to occur or be worn in your view but you must be tolerant and understanding just like your parents were with you debra and andrew gave me dirty looks while dotty gave me a hundred watt smile well what other answer would you expect with a mother like elizabeth mumbled andrew i gave him the dirtiest look i could muster she may be a scheming social climbing cow of a mother but she happens to be my scheming social climbing cow dotty heard as well and so did will thankfully dad grandpa and grandma were immersed in a conversation about hot water bottles and didntnotice dotty fixed him with her evil glare that out does even my own would you like to repeat that mr ashbrook or shall we assume that you were just passing wind andrew glared at her but backed down due to the glares he was receiving from the three of us the whole time debra had just kept quite and seemed to be torn between her loyalties of being a good wife and a good sister thankfully the tea finally arrived and we all had christmas pudding with custard of course after that we opened our presents and the evening deteriorated into drunken singing wild giggles and shouts of sheer delight my darling friends all sent me wonderful presents the most surprising was from daniel he sent me a friendship bracelet with a small charm with a small note the bracelet and charm are to renew our friendship and hopefully make it stronger awwwwwwwwww now aintthat sweet well it may be a solely platonic relationship but it has worked out better than any romantic relationship between daniel and myself ever could plus daniel has abby who i have become immensely fond of i am yet to find myself a new love interest admittedly i avoiding that sector of my life at the moment and i dontparticularly want to take any of remus advice bollocks i ve just remembered we have to go to the lupins for dinner on tuesday oh dear turn me into a cockroach now before i get hold of some stockings and speed up the processes of reaching the next life wednesday 29th december the kitchen oh lordy i dontthink i have ever been subjected to anything quite so superficial it the morning after the night of horror s dinner at the lupins and i still cantbelieve the level of fakeness i had to endure last night i know fakeness isntan actual a word but it is now it goes with my new socially unacceptable scale of fakeness the scale ranges from the minimal petty offence of fake smiles and high shrill fake laughter i myself am continually guilty of this offence smiling only though all the way up to gross exaggeration of expensive holidays cars and beach houses and elaborate amplifications of offspring achievements last night was right up there with the month long mediterranean cruise and child stars the cringe factor for both remus and i went through the roof we both had a wince permanently set on our faces for the majority of the evening it was what i like to call a formal evening a prelude to the business deal that was coming later namely remus and myself damn that weird to write just plain freaky actually i have never seen remus as anything other than a friend so to have my mother lining us up for marriage is just too weird due to the business nature of the dinner william petunia henry and remus little brother romulus were absent from the congregation leaving remus and myself to bear the unwavering discussion of ourselves alone ever had that feeling where you wish the earth would just split open and swallow you up yes everyone has i felt like that for the whole night this afternoon my mother forced me into this hideous green silky dress it brings out your eyes dear and told me that i was to be polite enchanting and charming for the lupins lillianna if you misbehave in way shape or form you will seriously regret it young lady i unwillingly complied okay okay no need to get your panties in a twist well what else could i do i had the wicked witch from the west glaring at me like there no tomorrow and giving off vibes that made it clear grievous bodily harm and homicide are not beyond her petunia wasntat all phased about not being invited to the dinner as she usually would be flowers for her wedding were still to be decided upon apparently the flowers either make or break the whole occasion so tuna was going to devote the whole day and possibly the whole night to picking the perfect flowers barmy that one personally i would just rather a traditional bouquet of white roses but not petunia oh no tuna has to pull out the baby breath lilies fern frons the different themes of tropical traditional beach i dontmean to be rude but what i mean she having a strictly traditional wedding and for the bouquet she thinking post modern tropical beach there is no logic there at all barmy bloody barmy will thought it was extremely amusing that i had to go to a business dinner complete jerk that he is was listing the number of ways in which i would most likely ruin the night and mortally embarrass the family that was until mother dearest informed him that he would be having tea with lady ludwig and her daughter on thursday at the polo match karma it ll get you every time though of course i not quite sure what i did to get myself into this mess of dinner with mother friends but when i think about it i instigated it when i was fulfilling my duty of being a good socially acceptable daughter actually you know what it was entirely my own doing why oh why did i have to suggest dinner because i could give even tuna a run for her money in the barmy stakes anyway so there i was dressed in my emerald green cocktail dress nervously perched on a queen anne arm chair more like spindly uncomfortable stool in vivian lupin formal sitting room dutifully participating in boringly polite conversation vainly trying to ignore the tension in the room it turns out vivian had tea with lady lavinnia drakefield the other day and was quite surprised when lavinnia mention my name commented on my charming qualities and how i was coming to watch edward polo match as you can guess that didntgo down well with vivian she was staring at my mother with a piercing glare my mother being as frivolous as she is was able to carry on as though nothing was wrong at all lucky her remus and i werentso lucky vivian sent me accusatory glances every now and then as though i had deliberately strung her son along with the full intention to become engaged to another man oh please as if i would marry edward drakefield shudder and it not like remus and i have any romantic tendencies towards each other anyway though i think vivian realised that i was much more inclined towards remus than the definition of arrogance himself i think she may have seen my not so well disguised look of disgust when the topic of lady drakefield came up also there is the fact that vivian has known mother long enough to know i despise polo and that mummy dearest has a tendency for making arrangements for me i was beyond relief when the dinner bell went at seven o clock i really dontlike formal dinners they drive me mad you have to be proper and refined for so long vivian was pulling out all the stops tonight first we had pumpkin soup with a bread roll i could see remus remembered my dislike of pumpkins by the mischievous sparkle in his eye i prayed to the supreme beings that they didntserve pumpkin juice i ve just had a thought i know remus has one parent who is magic and the other is muggle but it just hit me i dontknow which one i was staring into my pumpkin soup with a bewildered look on my face when a slight cough brought me back from dream world i gave remus a quizzical look the parents were chatting amongst themselves vivian was quite determined to change my mother mind about the drakefield situation i decided to ask him later second we had the fish course i have never really liked sea food so i wasntall that enthusiastic but that course signified the importance of this dinner usually when it just a friendly dinner there are only four courses so when the fish course comes out you know that it pretty darn serious whatever is going to be discussed after dinner i cringed when i saw the fish i did not like where this night was heading the main was roast lamb and suitable braised vegetables finally something i could actually eat with out feeling as though i needed to burn my taste buds off with acid or as if i had a cloud of uncertain dread over my head though mind you it was cooked in some fancy pants way with heaps of herbs and spices and whatever else and was not really what you would call food of sustenance dessert was these weird blueberry and orange crepe basket things god knows they would have been time consuming to make i mean you have to get the pancake stuff just right then make the little basket things and then you have to poach the blueberries and orange segments that after you ve peeled the oranges and cut them into perfectly equal parts come on julienne oranges what is wrong with this woman i feel great sympathy for her poor cook when i saw the basket i really knew something was up first the foreboding fish now difficult deserts i sure as hell hoped that i wasntgoing to be included in the after dinner talks last was the cheese board and fruit i was becoming desperate as to what i could do to get out of having to listen to at least another couple of hours of prattle and unrelenting interrogation after that it was to the drawing room for tea and brandy i made a silent plea to remus to get us both out of the forthcoming doom er excuse me mother but would you mind if i showed lily your roses my face lit up at this thankfully remus had came to my rescue i always knew he was my favourite marauder oh yes an excuse to miss the entire after dinner talk vivian glanced at me and i think she may have mistaken the look of joy on my face as enthusiasm to spend alone time with her son she smiled of course dear be sure to show her the fountain as well you ll just love it lillianna as we made our escape vivian threw a knowing glance at my mother how can you possibly think of drakefield when they ve obviously taken a shine to one another remus and i cringed simultaneously i ended up on a swing under the great willow near a stream somewhere in the vast landscape vivian called her garden remus was happily lounging on the garden furniture so you ve taken quite the shine to me have you mr lupin remus quirked a smile i could ask you the same ms evans damn he isntgoing to play along fine be that way but do think we should tell them we know each other from school they seem to think that we ve never met before uh oh he got his marauder look nah they can work it out i couldnthelp but smile imagine the reaction from vivian and the old bat oh my lillianna you could have told me it would have saved so much time remus really you should have informed me i must have made a fool of myself oh yeah i want to tell them just to see the look on their faces speaking of disorientated looks hey remus before i forget which one of your parents are magical my dad that why the house is almost completely magic free mum doesntwant anyone to know she just gets images of dad boss head popping up in our fire while someone like your parents are here oh well that explains a lot now doesntit ah so how was your christmas see your family at all remus laughed a hollow sort of laugh yeah i saw them alright way too much of them i gave a sympathetic smile i know what you mean between my spoilt brat of a cousin following me my brother and cousins running around trying to blow up the christmas pudding and ignorant arse of an uncle stirring things up i was only too happy to see the back of them remus chuckled i like the sound of your brother and cousins that was harry right leading them into trouble i nodded yeah and i cantthink who he learned that from bloody will from what i ve been told will partner in crime had a greater influence on our young harry than he did remus stated with a pointed look at me oh shut up i would have never introduced him to fire crackers if i knew what sort of damage he could reek with the things yes well blowing up the christmas pudding reminds me another group of boys i ll warn you now they dontgrow out of it i smiled as i swung higher donttell me the marauders had a reunion on christmas and blew up your mother famous christmas cake the one with santas remus grinned the very one i can imagine your mum didntexactly see your point of view it would also explain the brown spot on the painting of your great grandfather in the dinning room remus looked up from whatever he had been playing with you noticed well we thought we d leave it there to see how long it would take mum to notice james and sirius were particularly proud of how the explosion went we managed to get everyone in a five foot radius i shook my head at his enthusiasm he maybe the sensible marauder but he a marauder all the same he asked about you you know this statement startled me not because remus had said it or the information it provided but the fact that i immediately knew who he was talking about damn it i have a treacherous mind i tell you it makes decisions completely on its own without my consent bloody traitor remus took my silence as a sign for him to go on i know you dontwant to hear this lily but james really does care about you just for a second forget all those unfavourable qualities and dubious acts now tell me that you didntthink he was good guy some one who you even began to like i had stayed quite all through his reasoning quietly listening to his reason but the last comment commanded my attention i almost stopped the swing completely as i stared at remus dontlook at me like that lily i know you and you had started to see him in a different light a light that he wanted you to see him in my lack of response only encouraged him further maybe you didntnotice it yourself but i certainly did you were warming up to him and with good reason he was finally doing things right i just stared at the stars come on lily you know it true i glared at him my own mind has been nagging at about the same thing with remus like reasoning bloody traitor of a thing ok so what if it is what do you want me to do cast a memory charm on myself before flinging myself at him i just need a bit of time to think what i going to do remus gave me one of his calculating looks you could try talking to him i gave remus one of those do i have to looks it the only way you clear all this up you cantwork it out on your own i sighed knowing he was right okay fine i ll talk to him i resigned myself to that fate remus smile broadened at some point i quickly added remus smile faltered and he did the piercing glare thingy lily i said i would didnti alright so lay off we lapsed into silence after that only to have it broken by remus asking me if i thought rainbow robes would be becoming on mcgonagall needless to say we soon fell back into our normal light hearted talk it the day after and as i said i really cantget over the cringe factor of last night i believe they started with the wedding plans last night the reason i say this is because when remus and i were finally called in and it was time for us to go i couldnthelp but notice that the tension had shifted it was now my dad giving out death glares very different from his normal happy go lucky smile daddy was all red when we came in he looked me up and down then turned to my mother and stated firmly no i dontknow what he was talking about but i probably dontwant to know my mother then pursed her lips said her good byes and then quickly caught up to daddy hurriedly trying to convince him of her view point she failed miserably i ve never seen daddy this mad all i know is that he is not at all happy with the old bat he perfectly normal with the rest us just not her she must have done something particularly seedy to get him this peeved i mean my dad puts up with most things that other men wouldn t but this one issue seems to have him quite up in arms this morning will is stressing about having to meet with the ludwigs i canthelp but smirk this can only mean that i am no longer a priority thank the heavens for that annie has made me her wondrously delicious chocolate chip cookies again so they are my breakfast i ve been contemplating what remus was telling me last night and i have to admit he was right i mean just before james asked me to dance i was thinking how lucky any girl would be to have him after her and yes i did for a second or two wish it was me that much i have admitted to myself the anna part has won over again and i ready to give james a chance to prove himself i ve already forgiven and reconciled with all my friends so really the anna reasoning has subtly won the war even if it did lose a few battles blasted brain is so bloody treacherous alright so i ll give him a chance i have fully accepted that in my mind however letting other people in on that tiny bit of information is slightly harder well it not like they really need to know now is it okay so they would probably appreciate it but they kept me in the dark so it only fair i have my revenge right right okay damn these cookies they make me feel so bleeding good that i just become to agreeable and will comply to any haphazardly put together argument that comes my way bollocks petunia just made her entrance apparently she didntsleep a wink last night trying to choose those ruddy flowers guess what she chose big surprise this white roses she barmy bloody barmy oh dear lord i cantwait till she decides on the colour of her nails another tremendously imperative issue but will she go with the traditional french manicure or will she flip her lid and paint them red with black stripes i betting ten quid on the french manicure hello everyone yes i quite aware that a number of people would like to dismember me but i really very sorry truly i am the chapter should be coming out a lot quicker now since it almost my school holidays so therefore i can devote all my time to writing this story rather than learning about the trade cycle and trying to remember the functions of the endocrine system which i should be doing right this very moment instead of this thank you all so much for your reviews i really appreciate the encouragement and the constructive criticism this way i can improve all the chapters on my laptop and one day reload them i lazy ok i just have to motivate myself anyway thanks again and enjoy please remember to r e v i e w absolute shocker by jamesroxmysox disclaimer i own nothing recognisable from the harry potter books or movies that belongs to j and warner brothers studios thursday 30th december my room i hate polo i mean really hate polo for a start the way those pathetic excuses for human beings treat their horses is disgusting and i believe that they deserve an even worse fate than my future cockroachdom i think that they deserve to become one of the stable hands that has to look after all the less desirable features of horse ownership imagine edward drakefield with poopascoopa maniac grin oh yes that definitely sounds good would serve him right too the definition of arrogance is to kind for him he the original wanker thinking that he god gift to women me in particular i almost died of shame when he winked at me earlier today there i was in my matching designer skirt and jacket with coordinating blouse shoes and hand bag surveying the polo match surroundings thanking my lucky stars that i was yet to run into lady drakefield or morgan le fay i was just thinking about the poor horses when the players took the field as drakefield went past he winked at me in the seediest of manners i stood rooted to the spot absolutely horrified that he made such a flirtatious gesture in such a public place of course it didntgo unnoticed and before i knew it morgan had sashayed her way over to me she probably needs to let her inner demon out on someone lillianna how wonderful to see you again i dontbelieve i ve seen you at a polo match for at least a couple of seasons two faced and not a particularly nice person i getting out of this conversation as quickly as possible yes well seeing as mother thought schooling in france was best it really is hard to come home for the polo matches though i dare say it easier for you morgan dontyou go to st hilda school for girls i added in a falsely sweet smile morgan lips tightened st hilda school for girls is a prestigious private school but more affordable than most and has many students from an upper middle class background needless to say morgan was not impressed to have this subject brought up yes but i prefer to be close to my family i dontthink it proper for young women to be long distances from their families they become detached from their role touch i think i may have touched a bit of a sore spot you know lady drakefield sees family orientation as a necessity in young women i cantimagine her ever allowing teddy you know edward to marry some one who doesntvalue family as a top priority ah so that what this is about edward drakefield i raised my eyebrows at morgan really well i sure he ll find some one suitable morgan surveyed me for a second then narrowed her eyes listen here you little upshot edward drakefield is mine mother has been talking with lavinnia for years now so if you know what good for you you ll keep your grotty little paws off edward she hissed i took a step back i not terribly fond of spittle myself see why i call her morgan le fay she pure evil before i could respond lavinnia drakefield herself swanned up to us hello morgan lillianna i hope you enjoy the match morgan gave a smile that could make treacle look bitter oh i sure we will edward is such a wonderful player i dontknow what scarier how fast she can rip her mask of kindness off or how fast she can pull it back on nasty to nice in 0 02 of a second bloody freaky lavinnia smiled fondly at morgan it nice of you to say dear she turned her attention to me do you mind if i have a word lillianna i had no choice really as she took me by the crook of the arm and started to lead me to the tea area the look morgan sent me was enough to chill my blood she may only be a year older than me but my god she horrid it doesnthelp that she a complete trollop a yoyo knickered trollop at that lillianna dear how is your father lady ludwig was telling me how your charming brother william had to rush off this morning half way through tea to help him bloody william he canteven last an hour of this bollocks before making up some god awful excuse while i stuck here for the whole day now i have no one i can talk to in an even moderately normal manner time to lie my heart out oh i sure it not a life and death situation i believe that daddy merely needed william help with some documents he going through daddy likes to involve william as he will one day have to take daddy place and he feels william needs to be properly prepared livinnia smiled good good what an excellent idea it is only right that our future lords are fully aware of the responsibilities waiting for them thank god she doesnthave a daughter she d be all over will like a rash now you have to let me introduce you to some good friends of mine this is lady wrightwood and josephine henley the countess of wickham i almost died sitting in front of me were the two most wrinkled and shrivelled creatures i had ever seen i was afraid if i breathed they would disintegrate into a pile of dust give me morgan any day at least that doesntcause vegetablisation after half an hour of useless prattle the game started i felt as though i was about to explode the treatment of the horses had my anger threatening to take me over and the mindless arrogant comments by this shrivelled up old maids was enough to tip me over the edge the edge of what you may ask well personally i d prefer a cliff but that may just be me i quickly excused myself under the pretence of powdering my nose and was about to make my get away when morgan pounced look here evans i know what you re trying to do and it wontwork edward is mine so dontyou before i knew what i was doing i had grabbed her hand and dragged her over to the prune sisters who had actually seen moses part the red sea lady drakefield morgan here was just telling me about how important she felt polo was to the operation of society and how it helps the maintain cooperation and socialisation of people in our society didntyou morgan she just stared at me well i personally think it has many wondrous qualities and effects on society and i would love to discuss them with you but i dreadfully sorry i have to go find my mother for a moment but i promise to come be right back morgan perhaps you could expand on what you were telling me for lady drakefield after that i quickly dashed off leaving morgan gaping while the old ducks gave her admiring smiles wondrous qualities and effects pft what a load of wank i think i could even out do my mother in talking my way out of things i astound even myself with the amount of complete bollocks that pours from my mouth wondrous qualities and effects yeah of turning perfectly sane alright not perfectly sane but sane enough teenage girls into complete mental cases ugh hopefully livinnia and the ancient nannies will be too caught up with morgan wonderful values and views that they ll forget about me what i would do for an invisibility cloak at this moment for the rest of the game i spent my time feeding the ducks with a couple of scones i smuggled from the tea room they were as hard as stone i had to soak them in water first before i could break them up for the ducks our society as my mother so often refers to it really need to review their choice of caterers i love feeding the ducks my nanna daddy mother used to take me to feed them when i was little it the only thing i can remember about her so really it could be said that i feed them in memory of her oh lordie i such a sap oh well being a sap is good you can basically be extreme about everything and all you have to say is i emotional and people just accept it cool huh yes sappage is definitely good i was quite happy siting under the weeping willows feeding the ducks there was no reason for anyone to bother me only william mother dearest and myself came to the game today and even then it was against the wishes of will and i petunia was quite upset about the fact that she would miss the polo but she said she needed to set her priorities straight the colour of the tablecloths at the reception came first she a nut anyway once the last hoot thing went to signal the end of the game i deliberately dawdled on my way back to the playing ground apparently i didntdawdle enough just as i made it to the grounds edward swooped down upon me lillianna i ve been looking for you everywhere did you see my last goal good wasntit i gave a pained smile excellent i haventseen such finesse since the late harold edwards harold edwards was some famous polo played that tuna was always raving about she was depressed for days when he was killed in a car accident last year basically became a recluse to signify her mourning i was hoping she d take it one step further and become a nun unfortunately not all dreams come true thanks anna do you mind if i call you anna it just i heard your brother call you that bugger no not at all well edward please call me ted ugh i groaned inwardly ted you played er really well but you see i have to go my mother and i need to get home to see how my father and brothers are going a little emergency cropped up at home and i really need to find out if everything is all right of course anna i understand family first he winked at me again well bye edward ted right ted well bye ted i rushed off after this to find my mother and to get home a quickly as possible i ll have to thank will for that excuse later after i finish screaming at him for deserting me when we finally got home i started my search for will but not before i got changed from that horrid dress into jeans and a jumper which got me a very disapproving look from mummy dearest i spent a good hour searching our entire house i even peeked into the quilting room you never know tuna could have hauled him in there to give his opinion on whether cream or off white would look better on the tables not there but i was given a glare for interrupting her concentration how much concentration do you need to choose white tablecloths it the truth they will just end up being plain white we all know it even petunia knows it she just wants to feel more in control something to do with feeling powerless or some other psychobabble ask aunt lizzie that her area of expertise it beyond me i also tried daddy study but he wasntthere either daddy was pouring over some papers when i came in he only gave me a small smile before returning to his work i ll have to investigate as to what has him in such a horridly bad mood with the old bat but right now i more concerned with finding will it eventually twigged that harry wasntrunning around like mad either that lead me to come to the conclusion of quidditch it the one thing that causes ultimate peace in our household i made my way down to the bottom of our gardens we have a small wood on our property and this just happens to be perfect for a quidditch pitch the oak trees have grown extremely large courtesy of will so the players can fly rather high i stalked my way onto the pitch i was quite peeved by this point my darling big brother had left me to rot in the company of the bloodthirsty savages that were possibly the only beings to witness the big bang i was so wrapped up in my thoughts of betrayal i didntgive a second thought to the five other players on the pitch i was focused solely on will will saw me and landed about ten foot away from me you left me to rot in the company of lavinnia drakefield and her decrepit ladies in waiting so that could play quidditch did you not think for even a second that maybe you could have taken me as well will gave me a blank look you looked happy talking to some brunette so i thought i d let you be he a horrid liar morgan happy talking to morgan have you gone completely bonkers and you know very well that i hate polo will grinned sorry oh no he doesn t he not going to charm his way out of this one tell me will how was lady ludwig and her daughter beatrice did you enjoy their company because you know very well i could inform mother dearest how darling you think beatrice is i flashed my eyes lavinnia drakefield will do you have any idea what a bore that woman is i looked around for support i noticed remus remus you ve met her right please inform my demented brother of the torture he left me too remus suppressed a grin lily has a point there will lavinnia drakefield is rather i couldnthelp myself i had to butt in boring dull repetitive annoying shall i continue if you like i exchanged my angry expression for one of great sorrow you re supposed to be my heroic big brother not some spineless coward next time rose orwood asks you dance at a party donteven think about using me as a decoy will got a look of dread on his face he really doesntlike rose orwood she obsessed with him to the point of stalker tendencies okay okay i sorry but i had already arranged to play quidditch with the marauders what was i supposed to do i glared at him take me with you for a start but apology accepted her highness wants you in for dinner in an hour and a half and your guests are invited to stay for dinner though you know what she like it an order not request i turned to the marauders hello i hope you can stay for dinner mother would like to meet you all since william has given you such admirable praise dinner will be served at six thirty please dontbe late and i sure william will let you use his facilities to freshen up i gave them my best society smile and started to move away the marauders stared at me gob smacked at my polite and clinical manner even remus was surprised as i made my way back to the edge of the forest will caught up with me grabbing my arm and turning me around what the bloody hell was that you were treating them like they re one of mum idiotic acquaintances i yanked my arm free and continued in an ice cold voice william i have just been subjected to six hours of continuous egotistical prattle by social climbing gits i am in no way prepared to tolerate you or the marauders at this moment i turned to leave and he stopped me again that no reason to be so fake right now you have a choice of the epitome of politeness or the release of constrained aggravation so excuse me while i go vent my anger by debating with petunia about my maid of honour dress he backed off after that thankfully will is smart enough to realise if i am consciously willing to go over wedding preparations with petunia i not in the right state of mind and should be avoided i did actually go and see petunia my dress must be white or similar but very plain i have been told that if i show up the bride in any way i will never see the light of day again fine by me it means that there is no chance i will have to where some elaborate get up with corsets bows ribbon and lace hallelujah i could kiss petunia at this moment wait let me rethink that how about a hug a kiss is a little to far i could get cooties so until six o clock i was flicking through bridal magazines looking for a plain white dress harder than it seems at least in petunia magazines at six my mother called me into the sitting room i was told to go put the abhorred green dress back on fix my hair and make up and then come down to set the table as will guests would be staying for dinner i dragged my feat upstairs and stared at the formidable dress i finally dragged it over my head and put my hair in a twist to keep it out of my way while i ate make up my absolute favourite thing in the world i put on as little as possible a swipe of mascara and some lip gloss wow what a transformation roll eyes when i finally came down stairs twenty minutes later harry was already setting out placemats ten for dinner tonight not that my mother minded she loves to entertain and four strapping young men is just perfect in her mind harry gave me a glare when he saw me are you over your grouchiness cos will promised to dismember you if you acted like that again not that i blame him seeing as you didnteven say hello to me when you came out to the pitch i smiled i sorry i was in a bad mood from having to listen to mother friends all day harry gave me a look i know that no excuse i really sorry i promise i ll be nice tonight i ll even read you peter pan ok friends harry smiled friends good now you take the forks and i ll take the spoons and i ll met you back here at precisely six thirty daddy was sitting at one end of the table and the wicked witch was at the other they were miles apart and i had a feeling that whatever they have been tiffing about was yet to be resolved will harry sirius and peter were on one side of the table and petunia myself remus and james were on the other respectively petunia was being quite social talking away asking questions about their lives and mother was doing the same i was laughing at harry and sirius doing impersonations of the giant squid in their soups will and james were having a discrete food fight and managed to hit everyone in their line of sight except each other my father noticed and quietly joined in remus and peter were chuckling while answering questions thenas the second course came out my mother just had to ask that one question that could cause absolute bedlam what school do you boys go to i dontremember ever meeting you before well i know remus obviously but otherwise i quite lost i stopped laughing and glanced at petunia i prepared myself for the elbow in the ribs i was about to receive i exchanged a glance with remus and had to stop myself from smiling by covering my mouth sirius was only too happy to inform my mother about what she was missing oh we go to school with lily we re a year above 7th years james here is the head boy petunia went stock still before relaxing a little and jabbing me in the side she realised that went they were magical and you could tell their popularity with her went down a couple of points my mother eyes went wide before she turned to remus and me remus you go to school with lillianna remus nodded sirius jumped in again sure he does he one of the 7th year prefects for gryffindor she narrowed her eyes at me lillianna i looked up innocently from the plate which i had been trying to smother my laughter with yes my eyes were watering with suppressed laughter mother voice could have cut glass why didntyou tell me that you go to school with remus it would have saved vivian and myself a lot of trouble if we had known why it perfect now you can form an even closer relationship when you go back to school and remus can even start to court you here i was worrying that two weeks wasntnearly enough time to build the foundations of a relationship and well we donthave to worry about that any more do we she was babbling now while remus and i tried to keep a straight face as the rest of the marauders looked on in shock james went bright red and choked on his chicken when courting was mentioned will was smirking into his soup at the look on james face especially since he knows about james having feelings for me sirius was looking confused and being sirius he couldntlet things slide past he decided to clear things up as to exactly what the old bat was babbling about what you mean you want to get lily and remus together as in couple together my mother stared at him for a second unused to such a violent reaction to arranged couples yes of course vivian and i have had the intention of lillianna and remus one day uniting our families through marriage since they were young sirius was outraged on his best friends behalf as james had lost all colour in his face you ve arranged their marriage sirius was beside himself yes dear how else can i ensure my daughter has a suitable and secure future sirius stared at her remus and i were beside ourselves with laughter it not final sirius we make the final decision as to who we marry our mothers just like to be involved in the selection process he paused to look at james anyway we wouldntbe married until after my 21st birthday so dontworry there plenty of time for alterations peter sirius and james eyes all bugged out of their heads they were astounded that remus was seriously considering this implausible concept now that was too much for me i had to cover my mouth with both hands to stop my laughing my head bowed with my elbows resting on the table tears of mirth fell from eyes as i tried to control myself and unfortunately the rest of the table thought i was crying in despair of marrying remus my dad never yells so it was quite surprising when he let rip his opinion on this matter he got to his feet and surveyed the situation for a moment look at this elizabeth your daughter is distraught at the fact you are marrying her off she not even 18 petunia was different petunia is like you and is happy in your society anna isn t i put up with a damn lot elizabeth but this time i putting my foot down anna will marry whoever she wants with or without your consent i stared at him wide eyed he had started out slightly annoyed only to end up full on yelling at my mother so that what he d been so annoyed about he didntwant me forced into marriage my dad the best my mother jumped up david that is no way to talk especially in front of our guests daddy looked at her for a second before composing himself you re right i very sorry you had to witness that boys but i feel that i cannot let this matter go on any longer and keep disrupting my family if you ll excuse me i ll retire to my study now send my regards to your parents remus send my regards to your parents remus was code for if your parents heard a word of this i ll know who told them good night sir and dontworry they wonthear a word thank god remus didnttake it personally it also a plus he can read code my mother was furious david get back here we are not finished ugh she turned back to the table i sorry but i will have to retire for the night it was lovely to meet you all and i hope to see you all again soon tell your mother i ll be in touch soon remus and that was code for your mother mentions this and i will track you down and castrate you severe i know but hey that my mother with that she stalked off to find daddy the rest of us were left in shock petunia was the first to recover come on harry let go get some sweets before you go to bed do i have to go to bed yes is anna still gonna read me peter pan i think we ll save that for tomorrow as they walked out i was still staring dumb founded at the tablecloth are you all right anna will asked i looked up at him with a blank expression it took me a couple of seconds to register what he said i love my dad i finally answered with a massive smile will shook his head sorry i just emotional but i was actually laughing not crying i could tell they were all thinking that the female race is a weird and unexplainable species but the i just emotional did the trick and they accepted it see sappage is good and here i was thinking that you really couldntstand the thought of marrying me i laughed at remus and gave him a hug no i dontthink i could ever marry you remus but you make an excellent friend bugger i had my heart set on it too sirius couldntbe kept out of the conversation for long hey what about me do i get hug too i just rolled my eyes but grinned all the same i looked around at the rest of them so shall we go get dessert then with that we trundled off to the kitchens in search of food by the way are you staying the night they all gave me identical impish smiles uh oh i dontthink i going to like this sirius broke the news didntwill tell you we re staying for a couple of days over new year oh my giddy aunt well this will certainly be interesting let just hope my mother can handle having five of age wizards running around with an inclination towards blowing things up and creating mayhem wait scratch that let just hope i can handle having five of age wizards running around with an inclination towards blowing things up and creating mayhem i think i might go and see if annie has any cookies left god knows i ll need them hi everyone here is the next chapter seei told you it would be coming out quicker now that i almost on holidays once i actually am on holidays the updates will be super quick and hopefully i will be able to finish it yays anyway thankyou all very very very much for all your wonderful reviews please remember to r e v i e w absolute shocker by jamesroxmysox disclaimer i own nothing recognisable from the harry potter books or movies that belongs to j and warner brothers studios friday 31st december observatory the marauders have been here one day and already they re driving me mad instead of having two lunatic males running around trying to create havoc now there are six five of which are of age and can legally preform magic needless to say they re quite successful in their quest to disrupt the household and send all the occupants absolutely barmy seemingly with me as their main target i mean my mind is quite disturbed enough wouldntyou say anyone who knows me is well informed of my jumpy nature and whacked out perspective on things and most would whole heartedly agree that i was as far gone as possible without being committed to a padded room not only for the safety of others but also my own at breakfast this morning it was all oversized t shirts boxers and bathrobes well except for tuna and the old bat they were already perfectly dressed and ready for another day of social networking pearls matching skirt blouse and jacket and uncomfortable shoes perfectly suited to climbing the social ladder out of the ten people at the table at breakfast this morning eight were in the afore mentioned uniform of large t shirt boxer shorts and bathrobe earning the table many disapproving glances from lucifer and her apprentice i was blurry eyed and muttering incoherently nursing my head in one hand while i stirred my tea with the other when a herd of rampaging hippogriffs thundered into the dinning room well i thought it was rampaging hippogriffs turns out it was just will and the marauders coming down for breakfast noisy buggers i looked up briefly before going back to my muttering apparently none of them are morning people either they were all scruffy and i doubted they had even been to the bathroom before they came down they looked like they had literally just rolled out of bed mind you that what i looked like as well you see i wasntsitting at the table by my free will at this horrid hour of whatever it was looking blearily at the clock i could vaguely make out a seven oh no if it had been left to me i would not have emerged from the warmth of my deliciously snug bed until at least ten thirty but as it was the decision was not mine to make mother dearest came banging on my door at some absurd hour of the morning shrieking for me to get up i of course just rolled over and muttered vulgar profanities concerning the audacity of the person who had disturbed my blissful slumber and suggested some interesting things they could do with their morning but the old bat was not content to merely beat on my door and then move on no not at all she came in and pulled my duvet off this resulted in my rather loud scream of distress will ran in slipper raised with the intention of beating whatever had disturbed me or belting me over the head until i shut up i not entirely sure which i prefer to think that my older brother was concerned for my welfare as older brothers should be he rolled his eyes when he saw the old bat standing hands on hips ordering me out of bed as i put up a rather fierce defence he then retreated back to his room i can only guess that my scream was a wake up call for the majority of the household it was probably for the best that i hadntlooked in the mirror my hair had gone ballistic in the night and i now had a halo of frizz set off by random locks of wavy hair sticky out at odd angles quite fetching really you know frizz really is the new sleek yes it makes quite the statement complete nut case the i away with the fairies too often to groom properly look was really what i was going for thankfully no one commented on my unusual hair style i had just taken my first sip of tea when mother dearest sprung a rather unpleasant surprise on me hurry up lillianna we re going shopping i choked on my tea and ended up spraying it all over sirius remus had to thump me on the back numerous times before i got my breath back we i asked rather weakly we we what does she mean we oh no i not going to like this yes we as in petunia you and myself you need a new dress for tonight i stared at her in mild shock another one what in the name of honeydukes for what on earth am i doing tonight that requires i have a new dress please please please do not let this explanation involve the words society and obligation or i may just scream why didnti tell you we re hosting the new years eve party this year you know just a couple of people round for a few drinks and since you have become an official member of society you are obligated to attend she flashed me a dazzling smile before busying herself with the marmalade effectively missing my pained look i hate being a member of society and the obligations that come with it hang on hosting the new years eve party that would explain why everything looks so sprightly this morning i was in an almost comatose state but not even a blind man could miss the spruce up the house had had over night i could actually see my reflection in the varnish of the wooden armoire across from me you know just a couple of people round for a few drinks pft if that isntthe biggest understatement of the decade try the whole bloody neighbourhood a few drinks yeah a few dozen dear lord if you can survive the new years eve party you can survive pretty much anything including a nuclear attack since most people end up preserved from the amount of alcohol they consume the next morning is like walking into a biology lab with all the specimens swimming in formalin even worse my presence is required in the name of all things chocolately and sweet please please let me get through tonight of course the prospect of going dress shopping with tuna and her majesty went down spectacularly well with me the male congregation of the table was sniggering into their toast at my disgusted look when i received this unfortunate news the little appetite i had suddenly disappeared as comprehension settled in i was going to be dragged from shop to shop to shop to shop we will save a lot of time by saying this torture pure torture i have no idea how many dress shops i have been into today and truthfully i think it best that i don t i may become mental unstable oh wait i already at that stage i may need to be institutionalised but guess where we ended up go on guess i dare you le secret dress emporium the ridiculous dress store with an even more ridiculous name that happens to be tuna and the old bat all time favourite store personally i think it over rated and i also firmly believe that the whacked out self important sales assistant should be shot there are only so many ways you can instructed in the process of caring for dress material before you want to smack the instructor across the head with a rather blunt heavy object usually only once unfortunately for me i ended up in the care of said sales assistant and was ready to test the theory that you can drown in only a teaspoon of liquid using the complimentary fresh orange juice i was undecided on who would be a better candidate the sales assistant or me after two hours of unsuccessful dress hunting with the sales assistant who would be quite at home in a horror movie with the two inch talons and er unique hairstyle that involved a heck of a lot of teasing and bloody strong hairspray i was ready to take the next dress flung in my direction i had reached the end of my will to live they d broken me there were polka dots to the knees floor length granny nightgown ensembles multiple layers of taffeta lace for miles one that revolted me especially was a dark green dress if you can call it that i swear it could fit a five year old i mean the skirt was threatening to ride up and expose my unmentionables to the entire shop while i was standing still this was enough to contort my face with disgust but that wasntall the top came down so low i dontsee how anyone could wear a bra while wrapped in this flimsy piece of material these people call a dress when i pointed this out to lily munster here she simply replied you didn t this threw me a bit okay that a horrid lie it threw me entirely why on earth would you wear something that required you to refrain from wearing a bra don a thong and exposes your chest and your arse at the same time it definitely beyond me far beyond as soon as the thong was mentioned i turned on my heel and stalked off to the change room exposing stripy underwear to the boutique unfortunate occupants i mean really a thong have these people gone completely barking mad who in their right mind can feel comfortable with their arse hanging out and a piece of string riding up their well that area shudder after that they just got worse i was well and truly ready to take the next dress that actually fit properly did not expose areas of skin that had never before seen the light of day and did not make me look like i was in the same age bracket as batty old aunt dotty thankfully it turned out to be a black cocktail dress and was labelled suitable by the self appointed supreme court i had been forced into dresses of every colour glittering gold shimmering silver poison green pretentious purple macabre maroon prussian blue awe inspiring aquamarine startling white racy red canary yellow only to have the matriarch decide on black black it a nice hue and all not colour as tuna continually reminds me but a hue of grey but really even they can do better than that it just so mundane not that i voiced this opinion i was more than ready to go home and arguing would only prolong my time in this horrendously real nightmare of a shopping trip since i was getting a new dress i had planned on getting another pair of killer heels out of this shopping trip of horrors but by the end of it all i decided that getting home as quickly as possible was the only way to ensure i wasntgoing to be admitted to st mungo spell damage ward for those who are certified as emotional and physical wrecks oh well it just another chance to where my darling sparkly shoes from the school ball which lifted my mood considerably this afternoon has been madness and i think should reserve one of those beds on the spell damage ward i think i going to need it daddy the old bat and tuna have gone out to the fianc e parents for lunch and wontbe back till at least five as you can imagine the boys have taken full advantage of having the house to themselves for this afternoon i think they have invented a new game of sorts i not entirely sure what it is but i do know it involves flying down the corridors at full speed with everyone after you it also involves couch cushions how i dontknow but it is a vital part of the game and when they re not flying their brooms indoors or molesting throw cushions they re blowing things up i go to make myself some noodles and the bowl of freshly cooked noodles explodes all over the kitchen i was quite upset about this seeing as i had quite a craving for noodles i go to watch the television in the games room and the couch explodes as i sit down feathers and stuffing everywhere i go into the observatory searching for my herbology book that i had left in there and my mother prized begonia explodes and colourful petal confetti fills the air each time i get the scare of my life and end up frozen with shock for about half a minute until i hear suppressed giggles and am confronted with six angelic faces the lot of them have issues just because i happen to be the only living creature in the house at the moment merry and riley have flown the coop otherwise i believe there would have been explosions of owl feathers gives them no right to attack me after the encounter in the observatory i retired to the upstairs sitting room with one last glare and a good book hoping against all odds that they finally got the message and went back to that blasted game they were creating i think they still had a couple of glitches they need to smooth out such as what the point of said game is i ultimately got bored with the book and you could say i tried to daydream but my mind kept wandering i had just started singing the song that never ends when i decided enough was enough i really needed to put on the radio it the song that never ends damn i really need the radio on it goes on and on my friends just my luck that the damn thing happens to be feeling rather unsocial some people started singing it not know what it was please please work and they ll continue signing it forever just because bloody thing never trust a goblins i tell you they re sneaky creatures they sell you dodgy dodgy radios it the song that never ends it goes on and on my friends all right i resigned to the fact that i will have this blasted song in my head it not all bad i mean i could have the chicken song instead actually i prefer that one it has a little dance that goes with it bugger i turned around thoroughly annoyed at will and his goblin bought radio also at myself for letting that stupid song get a hold of me bloody hell i just got the scare of my life i think i jumped about a foot in the air sitting on the couch quietly watching me was james potter hi he said i looked at him like he was mildly insane that was more a statement than a greeting considering i ve spent the larger part of my afternoon being terrorised by him and the other five prats er hi he kept staring at me what song where you humming you sounded like you were going round in circles excellent observation dr watson that the point it was the song that never ends can i er help you have you lost your way to the quidditch pitch or something he continued to watch me as i squirmed a bit still standing in the middle of the room hey you d be rather squirmish too considering the circumstances i mean this is the bloke who effectively screwed around with my life for a whole term you d be smidge uncomfortable too if you were alone in a room with your stalker studying you now wouldntyou course you would he was really starting to freak out i was just beginning to count how many paces it was to the door when he spoke yes you can help me actually i stopped eyeing the door to look at him really well i suppose i can if you go to the end of the corridor go down the stairs and out the back door all you have to do is follow the garden path to the very bottom and you ll find the quidditch pitch well there my attempt at leading him down the garden path both figuratively and literally hopefully he ll take the hint lily uh oh it the tone that we have to talk tone i hate that tone yes sit down he patted the seat next to him hmmmmmmm no i dontthink so i good thanks i like standing less chance of contracting deep vein thrombosis it really is horror of an aliment i doesntjust effect you in planes you know i good he gave me a look really i good here he sighed lily when are you going to stop fighting me and just talk to me i talking to you now arenti and i not fighting with you at least i dontthink i am the fighting comment got me a bit muddled fighting him sure i blow up at him every now and then but i dontactually fight with him that would mean we have an actual connection of some sort it actually had me rather confused no you re not talking to me like you would a friend you re guarding your words and your emotions and is there a problem with that i mean it not like he is actually a friend also my encounters with potter lately have not exactly led me to believe he exactly a trustworthy guy plus i dontdo emotions i dontdeal with them very well and you ve been fighting me since the beginning of the year i thought about that i have really all i came up with was huh my obvious bewilderment must have shown as james decided to elaborate ever since i met you on the train in september you have resisted me and any attempt i made to interact with you ugh that word engage not the best word choice considering my present circumstances with mother dearest resisted i dontknow about that alright when i think about it i was a little defensive but who can blame me his reputation precedes him oh sod it i made assumptions not good i hate people who make assumptions i shall have to give myself a good talking to later at first this is what intrigued me about you you werentlike the many other girls who vied for my attention and i had to work for praise from you when it poured in from all other sides i raised my eyebrows humble much what it true but you were different on the train you were so indignant and then in the kitchens you hardly spared sirius and i a second glance true that i thought that had rather angered the dastardly duo and it seems that potter really took it to heart but that just my nature i not what you would call receptive to such antics do you have any idea the number of times i tried to get your attention i shook my head of course i bloody well didntknow we wouldntbe having this conversation if i did a bloody lot and yet you seemed to just brush me off either you went off with your friends fussed over daniel diggory or ignored me completely so i entailed the help of my dear friend sirius i glared at him i knew where this was heading and i didntlike it which in hind sight was probably the first mistake in long line of many you dontsay my legs were beginning to ach to hell with deep vein thrombosis i sat down on the second couch facing potter unfortunately potter took this as encouragement look lily he raked a hand through his already insanely messy hair potter seemed to be having real trouble getting out whatever it was he wanted to say he looked at his lap and continued in a very solemn voice lily i really am sorry i sorry about daniel and about regulus black giving you such a hard time and about well everything i was starting to melt i could feel it it was starting in my knees but then something that he had said entered my mind i had resisted him and this intrigued him well then what happens when i no longer intrigue him what happens if i give in this is all a big challenge to him i the one girl who doesntthrow herself at the feet of the great james potter so he interested simply because i not considering his track record i d say he d get bored once he had over come the challenge my face must have changed because james looked wary what okay here the thing i suck at communication so i didntvoice these thoughts er nothing just thinking what an understatement james sighed he dragged his gaze from his fidgeting fingers in his lap to look into my face with such an earnest look i couldnthelp but melt completely this time damn him oh sod it i forgive him i forgive him just quit with looking pathetic i was going through an internal struggle pft try civil war the anna part had already jumped up and given him a great bone crushing hug while the lily part was convinced he deserved to rot for in hell for at least another twenty years and was mentally composing put downs james obviously saw the turmoil on my face he lent forward with the puppy dog eyes and pathetically miserable look still in place nooooooooooo not the puppy dog eyes i canthandle the puppy eyes they get me every time please lily do you think you could give me another chance please i sat there for a minute biting my lip and twisting my hands damn it i breathed i such a sucker for puppy dog eyes i was all ready to tell him to cut the puppy dog eyes and rack off but somehow it didnthappen alright i forgive you but if you ever pull any of those stunts again i swear your own best friend wontrecognise you my traitor of a mouth my treacherous mind had already come to a different conclusion the bloody anna side must have bribed the little men into pulling the wrong levers i was stunned at what i had plainly had not intended to say and was therefore unable to plan my actions accordingly insert awkward silence apparently james hadntplanned this far ahead either i ve just notice but these awkward silences are becoming a regular occurrence in my life recently and they re bloody annoying at that i fell back onto my all time favourite back up plan shall we go raid the kitchen for some cookies and ice cream i asked while quirking a smile james beamed back at me hey it the best way to start things off i have no idea what he thinks is going on now but for me i keeping him firmly at arms length only sort of friends as i ve already stated i dontcommunicate well but i think the cookies and ice cream was universally seen as a peace offering so the status is friends for now anyway we had a grand time joking around and stuffing ourselves with gingerbread men that was until the vulture returned to her nest ugh you d think that will would have learned by now to clean up after himself mother dearest caught sight of the downstairs living room and announced her arrival home with an ear splitting screech will copped it big time he only escaped a the guillotine because he happens to be mother favourite and she didntsee what became of her prized begonia i was promptly called for and told to go get ready of course its much too early to have to put all that gunk on my face so i decided to occupy myself in here i must say that is one excellent doodle of goldstein the muggle studies professor okay so it a stick drawing but it has all the essentials massive handle bar moustache pompous expression robes starched to within an inch of their life knock knock there some one at the door hopefully it just harry or someone lily are you in your dress yet bollocks it tuna apparently she been sent by mother to make sure i actually get dressed properly you know a pound of make up and a can of hairspray properly if i make it through tonight i swear i ll give up cookies for a week maybe not i ll share the joy of sweet chocolate chip baked goods with numerous people by giving them to every person i come across for a week instead yeah that sounds good should get me over the line hello everyone i sorry it took me so long to update it just i had trouble with the talk between lily and james i would really appreciate constructive criticism on the talk and on lily attitude afterward please tell me what you think and remember r e v i e w absolute shocker by jamesroxmysox disclaimer i own nothing recognisable from the harry potter books or movies that belongs to j and warner brothers studios sunday 2nd january hogwarts express a random carriage far far far away from my friends i shall explain my lengthy title for this entry with the simple statement that the twins are much too excitable for their own good and they jump to conclusions much too quickly but more on that later yesterday was all a bit of a daze i mean it was new year day i had an entirely lazy day yesterday i didntwake up till about midday and even then i was not looking forward to getting out of bed annie was a doll and made everyone hearty breakfasts to counter the effects of hangovers and she even made me cookies the afternoon was splendid i got to laze around in pyjamas watching telly while stuffing my face with the delicious freshly baked cookies i was half there awake but not sort of watching the whatever program was on but not taking much in last night however i finally remembered that we have to go back to school today i was running around like mad between my room the laundry the library where all my books had migrated to and various other rooms in the house the marauders were packing their trunks as well they had somehow lost an important piece something they wouldnttell me what and were searching the house from top to bottom in hopes of finding it i eventually found it completely by accident i ll have you know i came across a weird bit of parchment when i was collecting my school things all my books and holiday homework were in the library and from what gather claire our cleaning lady must have put every piece of spare parchment with the rest of mine obviously i was curious about since it was old and tatty and all of mine was new and clean i dontkeep notes form my friends and all my class notes were stored away i just tossed it aside as i was currently looking for my wand that i had be practising movements with as i shuffled papers around a rather large stack became unbalanced and tipped over my wand had been in said papers and fell on the tatty piece of parchment the piece of parchment promptly told me to keep my cute as a button nose out of other people business i screamed when the words started appearing very girly thing to do i know but this is to do with the wizarding world and anything that can think for itself with no indication of actually having a brain to think with deserves to treated with suspicion especially since voldemort has started his all muggleborns are scum campaign of course will harry and the marauders all came running to see what the hell was going on i looked at the parchment fearfully with big eyes that piece of parchment just told me to mind my own business i cried out indignantly james and remus looked relieved while sirius and harry both thought it was highly amusing that i was scared f a piece of parchment only will seemed to share my concern he too was wary of the danger we were in due to our muggleborn status and the threat of voldemort did you try to get it to reveal itself sirius asked i looked at him like he was mental no my wand fell on it when these papers fell over james had picked it up and will was looking over his shoulder how much of this did you read will inquired i gave him a puzzled look you mean there more i was looking at the lot of them as though they were completely bonkers yeah it something we the marauders invented it a piece of parchment that insults anyone who tries read it it quite entertaining really remus explained if you ask me he was explaining away the incident thanks for finding it for us it prototype for something we ve been working on said peter they had hunting been the whole sodding the house for that a ratty piece of old parchment must be some bleeding prototype will seemed satisfied with this explanation and was actually laughing at some of the comments made by the ingenious piece of parchment i gave them a look that said they were all mad and waltzed off to my room with my school supplies to finish packing speaking of waltzing i cantremember much past my second cup of punchat mother new years eve bash i can remember wishing i could leave i can remember wondering about the spirit to fruit juice ratio of the punch was on about my third glass and i can vaguely remember edward drakfield being a complete tosser another thing was have you noticed that the level of alcohol consumed and the level of proper behaviour have an inverse relationship i mean virginia forbes barrett is the original ms high society and even she is spotted snorting into her eighth champagne over some vulgar joke told by jeremy ravensdale who she usually avoids due to his potty mouth humour they all get personality transplants there was even singing yes that precisely what sealed the deal for me to get out of there as fast as possible i remember i went to find will and the marauders however i never quite got there i was ambushed by edward teddy drakefield needless to say he had consumed his fair share of alcohol seeing as he is 20 after all he was just gone past the tipsy state and was verging on the state of not being able to stand up straight anna he slurred you look simply stunning well that a good thing to know he his usual charming self even when he off his nut he looked me up and down okay maybe not so much with the charming i think the alcohol addled his brain and his sleazy side was allowed to escape the box it usually confined to he stared at my face for a couple of seconds before looking back at the dress talk about uncomfortable true my dress has nothing on the green one but it still categorised as sexy my hair was reminiscent of some mexican senorita with curls everywhere and the front bits pinned back with my usual side part tuna had piled on the make up as well you know the tar pits look is oh so attractive i hated the way edward was looking at me that look would be the prime reason why i usually wear jeans and overly large jumpers with my hair in a simple ponytail or bun you attract far less attention from seedy mongrels such as teddy er thanks edward you look well i smiled admittedly it was extremely strained but i was vaguely trying to be polite while he stared at my chest ted anna call me ted he chastised with a scowl on his face bloody hell does this boy have hang ups or what i mean there no reason to get all angsty on me for sod sake oh sorry ted i forgot he screwed up his face all tight and had this expression of great pain he went all red as well you forgot how do you forget i mean i am trying rather hard to get close to you and you forget his words were almost indecipherable with all the slurring really makes him seem eloquent what is it with these blokes and trying to get close i really dontunderstand it edward rolled his eyes at my bewildered look maybe you are too young to understand he mumbled understand what that you re a gigantic prat no see i got that loud and clear come dance with me that wasntan invitation it was a command that another thing people seem to think i some meek little shrinking violet that doesntmind being pushed around well ted has another thing coming if he thinks he can push me around i yanked my arm free from his grasp as he pulled me over to the dance floor and gave him one of my nasty glares if you dontmind i really do not feel like dancing i was actually going to get a drink i said it in a voice that any sane person would recognise as a dontmess with me voice unfortunately for me as i have already explained this particular person brains had been addled i said dance with me you silly little girl you should learn to respect your elders i gave him a disgusted look does this look like the dark ages or something women are no longer compelled to do everything a member of the male species tells them and even in the dark ages it was male relatives that had the power not just random men i said i dontfeel like dancing therefore i am not going to whether you command it or not teddy went purple how dare you you are nothing but an immature and foolish little girl beautiful but undoubtedly foolish you need to learn some respect ohhh now he done it and you need to learn some manners if you ever expect to find yourself a girl i dontknow what century you re living in but in the 20th century women do not have to answer to the orders of arrogant little berks like you i turned on my heel and stalked off you ll be hearing from my mother he called after me pft as if i care what she thinks okay i admit i snapped but he deserved it ordering me around just who does he think he is stupid wanker so you can tell that the evening went spectacularly well i never did get the lecture from lady drakefield or my mother so i guessing teddy realised he was in the wrong though it could have been because he was preoccupied with morgan in the rose bushes geez i never wish to see such a spectacle again in all my life they were trying to eat each other i wasntsure if they were making out or trying to maul each other they got what they deserved either way i almost positive i spent the night with will and the marauders dancing with will so that rose orwood wouldntcome over kidnap him i can remember james and sirius playing a prank of some sort just not sure what it was but it was hilarious whatever it was now that i have given an account of the last couple of days i will explain my title my friends are far too quick to come to conclusions than is good for me this morning oliver drove the marauders and myself to the train station and will came along for the ride well wouldntit be just my luck that tri and the twins happened to drive up just as we were getting out of the car had they come five minutes later i could have convinced them that we simply arrived at the same time but no they had to show up at the exact moment that sirius black was getting out of our car closely followed by james potter remus lupin and peter pettigrew sweet merlin lily at those words i froze i was not going to be able to explain this one away i nervously turned round hey bridget dana tri how were your holidays dana and bridget lunged at me thank merlin you re talking to us again sang bridget as she strangled me from the ferocity of her hug our holidays were alright you know the usual the real question is how were your holidays lily interjected dana eyeing off the marauders over my shoulders er alright i suppose will befriended the marauders so they stayed at our place over new year and i had to try very hard not to dismember them the twins got evil looks on their faces i think tri noticed because he jumped into the conversation hey lily did you like you presents he asked giving me a hug oh they were excellent thank you did you like yours tristan smiled yeah that puddlemere united book is great and cam was stoked with the ultimate pranksters kit we knew you d forgive us at one stage or another after that i returned the smile through out this the marauders had been fumbling with trunks and animals and making arrangements with will for easter so lily what was it like living with the marauders oh sod it i should have known dana wouldntdrop this i was just about to answer you should know since we do live with them already sort of any way when will interrupted oi anna are you gonna come say good bye or what once i said goodbye when went to the platform and got on the train the marauders went off to find themselves a compartment and we went to find a compartment well more accurately the compartment with rhi in it once we found rhi cam and nessa where already there time for the interrogation to begin and believe me dana and bridget put the terror in interrogation as soon as the doors shut they exploded with questions about the marauders why didntyou tell us why didntyou invite us over what did you do with them did you talk to james did you make up with him are you two going out now dana and bridget were bearing down on me with such determined looks on their faces i did the only sensible thing i could think of i ran i admit it i left my gryffindor pride in my other set of robes i ran like a scared little slater bug that knows a big looming thing that happens to be a persons shoe means the ultimate death though why on earth they would want to prolong their meaningless little lives i ve no idea seriously if i was a slater bug i would go looking for the big looming thing in hopes that my next life wouldntbe nearly as boring as my last but maybe slater bugs dontbelieve in reincarnation and think that if they do die they just sort of float off into space or worse they get to go to slater bug hell man it would suck to be a slater bug but anyway what was i talking about oh yes my cowardice well anyone with two brain cells too synapse would realise the ultimate danger of my oh so lovely friends and their interrogations anyone who is not touched in the head would run just to keep it that way also once they ve exhausted the subject of the marauders dana and bridget are sure to start about will they ve always had a crush on him and analyse him after every meeting to see if he got hotter which is just my favourite subject because you know i just love discussing how attractive my brother is ugh revolting oh sod it they ve found me i doomed doomed i tell you doomed tuesday 4th january common room why do teachers feel that the holidays are the ultimate time to set homework i have no idea why but they think that we have nothing better to do over our holidays than write essay after essay after essay bloody annoying if you ask me then once you get back to school they set even more homework to make sure you understood what you did on the holidays and to ensure that can actually do all the practical stuff related to the theory and essays you did on the holidays mad they re all bloody mad if i was a teacher i wouldntset homework for the simple reason that it would be so much less hassle i mean think about it no marking hundreds of essays no supervising detentions of those smarmy brats who didntdo their assigned work and the plus side would be that the students might actually cooperate in class knowing that they wouldnthave any that night the teachers bring it upon themselves as far as i concerned so here i am sitting at a table in the common room with dana and nessa already snowed under with homework and avoiding it spectacularly by writing in my esteemed diary okay so i the definition of procrastination i positive that it you looked up a dictionary it would have procrastinate v see lily evans but really who cares what effects newt tail has on a strengthening solution not me that for sure dana has started whining that there are no guys to perv on in the common room and that we should relocate to the library because there will definitely be some guys in there geeky but cute ravenclaws at least nessa has just told her to shut up and finish her astronomy essay before she loses her patience and sticks it where the sun dontshine nice ness real nice oh look there remus maybe dana will quite belly aching now wait he coming over here i wonder what for i ll just have to find out hi remus i greeted as he approached our table hey lily i just got a letter from my mum he paused to give me a significant look i grimaced i did not like where this was going can talk to you privately for a minute i just nodded and told dana and nessa i d be back in a second i felt their curious gaze on me as i followed remus to a secluded part of the common room no doubt i would get a grilling when i got back concerning just what i had to do with remus mother sweet merlin i haventeven told them about my coming out party let alone about being betrothed to remus you re not going to like this my mum and yours are still conspiring even after what your dad said i just received a highly encouraging letter and i pretty sure your mum will be sending you one soon as well oh my lord cantwe do anything you know burn the letters or something i mean i not exactly fond of my mother letters as it is remus just sighed and ran a hand through his hair in frustration i ve no idea what we re going to do but i hope one of us thinks of something soon or else good grief they might even come up to the school i looked at remus in shock they wouldn t remus was about to answer when sirius voice floated over to us hey nessa dana have you seen remus by any chance this was followed by dana sultry voice oh he over there talking to lily something about his mum sending him a letter remus and i both froze dreading sirius answer oh that ll be about their nut case mothers wa sirius what did you want me for remus had run over and butted in therefore stopping sirius from telling them about the arrangement oh yeah about that what was it i wanted to tell you sirius took a moment to think and that when dana pounced what do you mean their nut case mothers what do their mothers have to do with anything before remus or i could explain sirius answered oh ever since lily coming out party their mother have this whacked ou remus clapped a hand of sirius mouth thanks sirius lily what i dead oh merlin i so dead so unbelievably dead lily coming out nessa and dana both gave him a blank look you know white dress stuffy formal occasion where the young woman is presented to society sirius explained exasperatedly both heads swiveled to look at me i smiled weakly from my hiding place between remus er hi dana gave me a death glare dontyou hi me lillianna elizabeth evans you had a coming out party and you didntinvite us or tell us for that matter uh oh i can see a tint of red in her eyes not good er about that well you see i really didntwant to trouble you over this whole society thing especially when it was on christmas eve and all dana was getting worked up dontgive me your pathetic excuses lillianna i dontwant to hear them and with that she gathered her books then swept herself and nessa out the portrait hole shit thursday 6th january library well my week has just been peachy now hasntit dana immediately informed bridget rhi tristan and cam of my betrayal after her dramatic exit from the common room on tuesday since then she and bridget have refused talk to me saying that they had never been so offended seeing as they were not invited to such an important event in my life nessa tri and cam are all highly insulted however they are still talking to me if only in a very cool manner and when i talk to them directly all right so really they re all very very upset with me i even tried to apologise but the lot of them got huffy and stalked off only rhi would listen to my explanation before coming to a decision about whether she was going to be angry with me or not i explained to her that far from regarding this coming out thing as one of the most important events of my life i see it as horrendously pompous and ultimately one of the more embarrassing moments of my life which even rhi admitted was saying something rhi thankfully understood how i was upset about my family traditions but she pointed out that i should have told my friends about it she reckons the twins are more insulted i didnttell them about it rather than the fact they werentinvited because they think it means i dontregard them as friends because true friends share all their problems ugh i knew this being unable to handle feelings and the whole bottling up problems was going to get me in trouble one day i just didntrealise how badly i mean out of my six closest friends five arenttalking to me oh this is just brilliant sirius has since apologised profusely for spilling the beans and has been trying to make it up to me ever since he and remus invited me to sit with the marauders during meal times and hang out with them in between classes it a nice gesture but in all practicality i dontthink it would improve the situation it might be seen as yet another betrayal on my part as though i ve got myself new friends as nice as the marauders can be even when they arentbeing annoying snot bags i want my old friends back just how i going to do that i have no idea i better go charlie here for tutoring girl dorm i still receiving the cold shoulder most of the gryffindor girls have been giving me weird looks for the last couple of days because e it known that our dorm members dontusually have long lasting disagreements sure we have arguments on a regular basis but they re usually over petty things like whose eyeliner was pinched by who and they usually only last for about two hours at the most our dorm is known to get along the best out of the four sixth year girls dorms we re best friends and usually live together in harmony with the occasional blow up between the twins over some boy or whose jumper is nicer unlike the other dorm rooms which unfortunately dontget along as well and are know to have spats that last for up to a month before any form of reconciliation is even considered so for one of our dorm members to be ostracised is just plain weird i really hate the pitying looks i keep getting bloody annoying i just want to tell them all to sod off but i wont cos that will just get me in even more trouble on a happier note my tutoring session with charlie was highly entertaining he came in looking rather depressed and me being endowed with an over load of curiosity just had to ask what was wrong you really want to know he replied with a disbelieving look hey he got to give me a bit of credit i do care what happens to him of course i want to know you helped me with my various family problems maybe i can return the favour he gave me a calculating look promise you wontlaugh i gave him a surprised look i promise you can tell me anything and i wontlaugh he sighed dramatically fine i like this girl in my herbology class she doesnteven know i exist and i have no idea how to get her to notice me a grin threatened to over take my face i managed to get it down to a restrained smile charlie looked up from scowling at his parchment at my silence you said you wouldntlaugh he cried outraged at my insensitivity i fought to squash the grin entirely before continuing i not i swear though promise me one thing what awww he all sulky poor widdle diddums you won t under any circumstances take advice from your brother no offence but he hopeless charlie looked at me shocked you think i d ever mention this to him mr i can get any girl i want are you crazy he d laugh me off the face of the earth i bit my lip to stop myself smiling you wonttell him will you if he knew about this well let just say between him and sirius i d never hear the end of it i smiled softly as he stared at me imploringly dontworry i wontsay anything to him but you should talk to him he was in your position once too you know he looked at me like i was stark raving mad oh dontlook at me like that he wasntalways james potter hogwarts biggest bachelor he was once in the same exact position you re in i sure if you talk to him he ll give you a bit of support though for the love of merlin please do not follow any of his or sirius advice his look didntreally change i ll think about it though what do you think i should do dear lord he asking me for relationship advice of all the people he could go to and he asks me me ms i ve never been in a relationship before he definitely desperate er well you could try talking to her i mean what else are you supposed to do kidnap her about what er well um about things like er you know things herbology well it something what no that so boring the ungrateful little well you didntreally give me much to work with you just said she in your herbology class what am i a mind reader yeah well she a gryffindor as well and she really pretty and she kicks my arse every charms lesson oh well it good to see she has brains as well as beauty though the whole kicking arse in charms may not be that hard well i suppose you could talk to her about i dontknow the next gryffindor quidditch match maybe or you could maybe ask her to help you with some of your charms homework so long as you dontbrag about your own quidditch abilities i sure that d be fine and well i suppose if asked sweetly enough the girl would take pity on him with the homework but that what you re for oh merlin why was i given the thick one she doesntneed to know that now does she maybe you could talk to her over the weekend since you dontsee me until tuesday and that way hopefully you ll not stuff it up too badly yeah but we cantjust talk about charms homework i want to get closer to her ugh what am i a dating guru i ve never even been on a date well maybe you could ask her about her favourite honeydukes chocolate or something whatever you talk to your friends about it not like she a foreign species or anything though sometimes i doubt that theory but i get all tongue tied and go bright red and all that and i dontknow what to say it called being nervous a foreign concept in your family ugh well you re talking to me now arentyou for all things chocolately it not that hard yes he giving me a look that says duh i a girl arenti another exasperated look yeah but you re different am i now this ll be enlightening how so do i want to know probably not but i going to find out anyway well you just are you re my charms tutor and you re just well i dontknow but i can talk to you i just canttalk to her he mighty lucky he stopped there had he said anything else i 99 9 sure it would have been insulting right now that we ve determined i not nearly intimidating as this girl we can progress from there fine just imagine it me you re talking to me instead and that might calm your nerves a little what her name by the way charlie reluctantly answered melissa greenly right melissa greenly i vaguely know her as a gryffindor fourth year she quite nice from what i remember and it true she is very pretty she very sweet with dirty blonde hair toffee coloured eyes and a sweet face there something else though i dontthink she the show pony kind anyway i think i ll just have to go pay ms greenly a visit she shares a dorm with dianna walter who happens to have some dada notes i lent her maybe i ll get lucky and i ll see melissa then we can have a little chat about a certain scruffy haired blonde who is absolutely awful at charms charlie still isntconvinced he thinks i absolutely barmy bloody bonkers well maybe i am at the moment the majority of my friends are quite annoyed at me because they werentinvited to the most degrading event of my short life and my mother is trying to set me up with remus oh my giddy aunt i ve just realised i haventtold them about remus and my mother crackpot idea oh dear that just going to result in another one of these you should have told me spats now isntit maybe if i tell them about that straight after i apologise and explain about the coming out thing because technically i didntknow about the whole remus being my ideal match until after the christmas ball so that ll work wontit in theory yes reality not so sure ugh this is exhausting agonising sure does take it out of you the only other thing is that i haventseen potter around lately i mean i ve talked to the other marauders i just haventseen james the sad thing is i sort of miss him oh dear that not good just what i dontneed at the moment to be missing james potter well i sure it just that i used to being annoyed beyond belief by now that it just feels weird with out him hanging around trying to make me blow up i absolutely almost maybe 57 sure that the reason anyway i just reread that last part i think i should change my name to cleopatra and get it over with i so sorry everyone for taking such a long to update i really am i promise to try and get the next one up sooner i plan on letting my school work go to hell i ve had a gut full it has prevented me from writing for over a week i promise i didntleave you all hanging simply to get reviews and that the next one will be up next monday oh and sorry about the chapter title i doing shakespeare at the moment for english literature and well it just feels like it goes with the over all tone of the chapter again i really sorry please remember to tell me what you think and r e v i w absolute shocker by jamesroxmysox disclaimer i own nothing recognisable from the harry potter books or movies that belongs to j and warner brothers studios friday 7th january the astronomy tower i deeply depressed pessimistic would be too kind a word to describe me at the moment the glass isnthalf full nor is it half empty it down right dry as a bone empty and you know that drop form the windowsill looks mighty appealing at the present moment what dontlook at me like that it not like i d ever actually go through with anything of that sort i think i demonstrated that pretty clearly last time when i babbled about jumping out of the train only to go to the toilet unfortunately i far too chicken to anything of that nature i ve no idea why i was put in gryffindor but it certainly wasntfor the courage thing more likely the pride thing if my pride had depended on jumping from the train moving at 90 miles an hour it would have been a whole different story anyway enough with describing my suicidal tendencies let discuss the reasons for said suicidal tendencies my friends ugh what a mess this has become for the last week i have received the cold shoulder from five of my best friends two of which have ignored me completely the odd icy glare has been sent my way and conversations have stopped dead as soon as i approach i convinced rhi to act as normal and not saying anything to the others as i need to work this out with them on my own as you can probably tell i ve spent quite a bit of time in the library by myself this week doing all possible homework to keep my mind off things and even extra reading because i dontwant to go to the common room until absolutely necessary i think i ve handled the whole thing rather well i haventresponded to the glares or made any nasty comments about them being insensitive to my needs or lost my temper at them for refusing to listen to my side of the story and being ignorant little prats i think i ve been rather dignified about the whole thing i held my head high and got on with things just controlling my temper should earn me a round of fairy claps let alone being noble about the whole injustice of the thing and now after a week of mutterings odd silences and harsh glares i ve cracked and retreated to one of my favourite places the astronomy tower to lick my proverbial wounds in private i never have been one for large displays of emotion apart from righteous anger and idiotically euphoric happiness it true i either seething over some horrid injustice in the world or else deliriously happy without a care in the world completely unaware of the things around me dontask me why but i just dontdeal well with emotions what can i say i have issues like every other being on the planet makes me quite the individual hey but that would be the prime reason why i haventsorted things out yet with my friends it means i have to deal with emotions it not the confrontation that scares me pft this is me we re talking about i practically thrive on confrontation i was talking about it with peter today at lunch he thought i may have a few issues with facing people and potentially upsetting them i nonchalantly told him to shut up and get on with his potions essay before i showed him just how fond of confrontation i really am needless to say he quickly got on with his work and gave sirius a beware of the impending peril look when star boy decided that the library was a perfect place to stir up some trouble so here i am wallowing in self pity trying to think of ideas that could possibly get me out of this impossibly sticky mess yeah i still working on the ideas thing self pity is taking up the majority of my time and brain capacity well one good thing came out of this week i got all my homework done oh merlin i a nerd as well though that isntreally that much of a surprise i suppose considering my tendency to read every book that passes under my nose you know what i think i ll stick to wallowing in self pity about the known shambles my life has become so much safer than contemplating my life and possibly stumbling upon more shambles lily uh oh some one found me canta girl sulk in private anymore if it star boy i may just follow through with the appealing window exit lily oh for the love of merlin it just had to be him didntit the world against me i just know it my bad karma has come back to haunt me i knew i shouldnthave abused my privileges of prefect to take away 20 points from slytherin for magic in the halls rather than the usual ten it not my fault i swear the temptation of taking the lead in the house cup was too much for my weak will even so this is a rather nasty comeuppance now isntit am i truly an awful person why couldnti just be turned into a cockroach i mean little cockroaches have all the solitude in the world they want people literally run for the hills when they see a cockroach except maybe in those weird asian countries where deep fried cockroaches are a delicacy but i dontmean those countries are weird because they re asian no no no i happen to love asia and asian people they make the best food like mei goreng i couldntlive without mei goreng it just i think eating deep fried insects is rather disgusting especially ones that crawl around in the garbage but mind you asian people probably think that some of the things we do are truly disgusting like using the hand you wipe your arse with to shake someone hand but still it cockroaches were talking about oh sweet merlin i racist i racist towards asian people ugh i truly am a horrible person i can totally see why this is happening to me i a over bearing bureaucratic self righteous racist in the name of all things chocolaty shoot me now lily there you are didntyou hear me calling you ugh i wish er sorry james i sort of spaced out for a while there yes that right the one person to come and find me when i in an emotionally unstable frame of mind is the one person who usually evokes unknown emotions which i would prefer stayed unknown go figure what am i talking about unstable frame of mind unstable is my usual state of mind right now i down right erratic okay i think i may be slightly hysterical by the looks of what i have previously written in this entry and also the handwriting is hardly legible wait a second what on earth is james potter doing up here in the astronomy tower on a friday night sitting with me shouldnthe be coercing some ditzy blonde hufflepuff fifth year into a secluded corner what are you doing up here all right so my curiosity got the better of me what else is new he just looks down at me with this weird look and then slides down the wall to sit next to me i could ask you the same thing now it was my turn to give him a weird look what is he playing at i have every right to come here and sulk thank you very much even more so now that i the social equivalent of a leper well i sitting here looking at the stars like i do every so often when some couple isnt celebrating their love james doesntseem at all convinced and just raised his eyebrow at me well what does he expect that i break down and start spilling out my entire life story heh as if that will ever happen oh i just thought you might want someone to talk to is that so and just what would i need to talk to someone about the dancing chicken of mongolia i resolutely looked ahead out the window sirius shone brightly back at me stupid star boy i may just have to kill him one of these days even if he did give me half a dozen bars of honeydukes best chocolates as an apology for spilling the beans to dana and nessa well actually i thought you most likely wouldntlike to talk but decided you could probably do with some friendly company instead ruddy star boy and his big fat sodding mouth though i cantblame it all on sirius i suppose a blind man would have seen that not all in good n the world of the gryffindor sixth years i looked over at him miserably ugh am i really that pitiful the little voice inside my head has vindictively hissed back yes great even the little voice in my head thinks i pathetic saturday 8th january common room last night james giving me a sympathetic look due to how truly dejected i looked was the straw that broke the camels back i dontknow what happened but i ended up just blurting out all my problems everything and i mean everything just came tumbling out of my mouth everything from the fact that my friends werenttalking to me to my fears that harry might not get into hogwarts to the horror of being petunia maid of honour to the audacious scheme between my mother and vivian james patiently listened to every single little worry with all the patience in the world and didntinterrupt me once he just listened when i was finished he gave a small sympathetic smile pulled me into a one armed hug so that i was leaning on him and quietly told me that it would all be alright oddly enough this actually comforted me had i been in my usual state of mind i would of jumped up and shouted at him just what makes you think everything will be alright and what evidence to you have to support that what can i say i was temporarily insane and not functional at all at the normal level i think it was actually the fact that all those emotions and things i usually push in to the back of my mind totally denying while deluding myself i deal with them later i think they all finally revolted and rose up as one therefore conquering my mind sort of like the russian revolution oppressed rise up to face the tyrant only in my case that happens to be my logical functional side when i think about it it just the civil war between the lily part logical and the anna part emotional the lillianna part is clearly staying out of it till the dust settles nice evasive tactics there from the lillianna part i must say but i will admit that was jolly comfortable just sitting there with james being reassured that everything would be all right when i finally got back to bed last night the talk with james seemed to have calmed me down considerably or else the lily part and the anna part finally finished each other off well whatever happened the ever logical and compassionate lillianna was able to go into overdrive and come up with all kinds of solutions to my troubles so effectively james was right the plan considering my friends was put into full swing early this morning admittedly i had to get up early well for me it a saturday no one in their right minds would be up before 6 30am on a saturday except sports freaks but there was no quidditch practice today so even the quidditch fanatics were having a lie in not me though no i was busy being a mutated form of the easter bunny you see i got up nice and early and went down to the kitchens and collected a stash of freshly baked chocolate chip cookies and went out into the grounds to raid the green houses for some lilies sprout had some rather nice tiger ones in greenhouse two they re a bit testy unless treated with care so that why they re in greenhouse two returning to my dorm i got to work on penning a suitable note once i had got across my general message i copied the not six times and then got on with my easter bunny activities beside each bed in my dormitory i left the note a lily and cookie in a place that made them impossible to miss by the occupants when they awoke at least i hope it impossible to miss i then crept up to the boys dorm and did the same beside tri and cam beds can i just say that living a dorm of five teenage girls i am quite used to clothing exploding from everywhere but where it should be not being able to see the floor due to physical obstructions and the clutter of old parchment broken quills and old textbooks however nothing and i mean nothing prepared me for entering that cesspit they call their dorm how they manage to live in such conditions is beyond me not only is there everything i mentioned before but also mounds of old sweet wrappers rotting apple cores and other old food stuffs that looked as though it ought to have been added to the compost heap somewhere during the last century and unidentified hairy things with way too many legs that made unexplainable squeaking noises i fought my way through the man made jungle wondering about the last time fresh air ever reached the room i couldnthelp myself i had to crack a window before returning to my search for my dear friends beds though it a wonder they re still alive i swear something tried to gnaw my ankle as i passed the dirty washing pile at least i think it was the dirty washing pile well anyway on each of the notes i asked each of my darling friends to meet me in front of the common room fireplace at 1 o clock i didntsay what for but they know it from me due to the cookie and the lily so all i have to do now is wait and agonise over exactly i am going to say this with out losing my temper or insulting anyone hmmm maybe it best i prepare preferably in the library where there is no chance of meeting anyone before the fated hour girl dorm well that went well a lot better than expected actually i think that may have been largely to rhi i think she softened them up before they came up so there i was nervously perched on an armchair by the fire eagerly anticipating the arrival of my friends after having chased away a great deal of younger class men and threatened to hex a few of the older ones to ensure privacy well of sorts i was also once again wondering how well liquid shows up on my pants i stood up as they filed in from lunch in the great hall and took seats around me their faces were blank apart from rhi who gave me an encouraging smile okay lillianna calm down you can do this no i dontthink i can yes you can now go for it well here goes nothing er hi guys as you know i asked you here for a specific reason and that would be to apologise and explain since no one except rhi has yet listened to my reasons for acting as i did i had to stop myself here to take a deep breath and control my indignant anger the lily part was firmly locked in titanium strength cage to prevent me from screaming at them for the injustice of their condemnation once i collected myself i continued right i never meant to offend you by not telling you it occurred to me later that you probably saw it as more of an insult that i didnttell you about a supposedly major point of my life because as i have been reminded lately good friends share everything not just the highs so i really very sorry here the anna part had to be locked up from throwing myself at their feet and screaming for their forgiveness pathetic i know i chanced a quick glance at them to see how they were reacting but they all kept quiet waiting for me to finish the explanation part i know you probably wontbelieve me but er i was absolutely dreading this coming out thing i see it as the most boring event of the whole year that includes double history of magic which just plain sucks anyway i truly did not want to put any of you through that and i knew that you would want to come because you just happen to be like that and well quite frankly it was embarrassing being paraded around like a piece of meat was not my ideal way of spending the evening i was then cut off by the twins throwing themselves at me oh lily stop rambling you should have told us all this when you first found out about it we would most certainly of come just to offer you support aaawww isntdana sweet yeah we re really sorry we over reacted as we have a tendency to do but we are really sorry arentwe guys bridget looked over at the rest yeah sorry lily that was highly hypocritical of us to get mad at you after the whole fiasco before the holidays i smiled at them group hug shouted nessa the whole lot of us ended up a mass of arms and legs on the floor in front of the fire once we disentangled ourselves dana got back to the issue at hand so how did sirius and remus know about this if you didntwant anyone to know about it i cringed you didntinvite the marauders did you asked an incredulous nessa how exactly am i supposed to explain this one well looks like it time to spill the beans about remus no most definitely not it s er hard to explain i got a few raised eyebrows looks like it now or never you know vivian right mother friend i was met with a couple of nods yes well er she has two sons and um my mother and vivian thought it would be nice for my escort to be vivian eldest son who er happens to be remus there was some stunned silence remus was your escort uh huh i looked around since they re quite i should probably tell them about the betrothment thing seeing as all the marauders already know and there more which i haventtold any of you i thought it would be best to do it all at once i gave rhi an apologetic look the thing is my mother and vivian seem to think that remus and i make a lovely couple and are doing their best to play match maker they ve been planning weddings since we were in diapers jaws hit the floor with a loud clunk there was silence for a couple of seconds as they thought this over i couldntbring myself to look anywhere except my finger nails which i really need to repaint that completely mad i glad someone agrees seems tri isntthat much of a tosser after all that what sirius said as well the marauders knew bridget asked wide eyed bollocks well will had them over to dinner and my mother sort of just blurted out the fact that she expected remus to start courting me as you can probably tell that didntgo down to well with the marauders you mean all the marauders were there even james i nodded cam tri and nessa all cracked up with out right laughter they thought it was hilarious nessa calmed down enough to whisper poor potter before dissolving back into fits of hysterical laughter with the other two rhi was discretely hiding her smile behind her hand and her laughter was barely masked by a slight coughing fit the twins however were the pictures of misery they had identical looks on their faces there big grey eyes looking horrified oh poor james he ll be heartbroken was the sentiments of the twins i myself cracked a smile i canthelp but say i missed my friends immensely over the holidays and this last week that makes it three weeks pathetic really how much i missed them wait so what are you going to do about your mum and remus mum rhi asked the million galleon question er we re not actually sure i want to just ignore it but remus reckons they ll come up to the school that what we were discussing actually when sirius came bounding down the stairs with his humongous mouth hello hello what do we have here a sixth year orgy can anyone join ugh just what i need sirius black on a sugar high i looked at my friends before turning to sirius sort of like now hi sirius i was just talking things through with my friends after your last little interference sirius looked slightly remorseful before hitching one of his dashing smiles on to his face no knees i command you to stay solid ugh it a losing battle with sirius really he just too damn good looking well it all good now no need for hostilities i mean is it lily fault her mum and remus mum are slightly nutty course not if people held it against me just how troppo my mother is well that would be highly unjust thanks sirius you ve put my mind at ease no need to threat banana ooooh i could of murdered him for that yet another person who knows of my brothers lovely little nick name for me we spent the rest of the evening catching up on what everyone did over the holidays i told them about tuna engagement and even cam and tri were astounded that petunia managed to get a husband they know what she like even after their brief encounter with her at the end of last year dana and bridget want to come to the wedding just so they can see what tuna has planned out and then rip it to shreds with their fussy nit pickings hopefully i can invite them all over for the wedding so i wontbe bored mother wontobject i mean she loves my friends she gets along very well with the twins and adores tristan and cam she thinks nessa and rhi are both incredibly sweet young ladies so that should be no problem plus she wants to invite as many people as possible so that makes the process of allowing them to come a hell of a lot easier plus we have enough room for them to stay so i doubt she ll mind much yawn my god this making up business is tiring well at least there no more death glares that a plus monday 10th january lunch you know potions has to be the weirdest subject i have ever come across in the wizarding world even worse than divination and believe me i did that for a about a week in 3rd year it was just as much tom foolery as potions i just couldntgive up potions i mean it just like cooking really you have to improvise like today we were making some potion that actually i have no idea what it does but rhi told me to just start following the instructions i hate to say it and all but i awfully lazy when it comes to potions i just haphazardly throw things together and amazingly i still manage to pull through like today i was entirely fed up listening to yougarty the yeti from a land time has forgotten his names actually fogarty but he horrid so i call him yougarty and went about adding my own little changes to make things slightly more interesting a dash of this and a dab of that stir it this way a bit and stir it that way a bit mix things up in general rhi kept giving me exasperated looks as she dutifully followed the instructions in the book and patiently did things in their appropriate order book schmook follow instructions that no fun as yougarty came round i got rather nervous as to what he was going to say when he saw mine seeing as rhi was giving me a bewildered look as she saw the colour and texture of my potion which was quite different from her own and there was also the teeny tiny fact i didntactually know what i was supposed to be making yougarty got closer and closer nodding to some people tsking occasionally and he raised his eyebrows at some poor hufflepuff who got a bit fluster towards the end and added what seemed to be an entire beaker full of armadillo bile so you can tell i was slightly worried he came closer still he gave rhi a smile and a nod i was biting my lip rather hard by this time when he got to me he stopped and stared at my at my cauldron with a look of utter bewilderment on his face rather similar to rhi the word bollocks was flashing across my mind in rather large bold colours miss evans what exactly is the meaning of this good question personally i d love to know i was just having a bit of fun is all er it my potion black was smirking at me from across the room i had to stop myself from cursing him with one of those nifty non verbal curses stupid reggie just because he a dim witted troll fogarty stirred it sniffed it and generally checked it out he had the whole classes attention focused upon me and my cauldron by this time i was seriously regretting my little bit of fun by this stage this is excellent miss evans extraordinary you ve managed to complete your potion in such an efficient amount of time considering the level of difficulty and here i thought i was giving you a challenge i completed the potion wow though how did you manage to complete it in such a short period of time fogarty gave me a curious look er well you see er it well i oh merlin how do i answer this i er improvised a bit sir i answered tentatively with a nervous smile he beamed down at me very well done miss evans very well done indeed now that all we have time for today class please pack up i let out a breath well that was unusual rhi was still puzzled as to how i managed to pull it off she herself was only three quarters of the way through the lengthy instructions when yougarty came around she been pestering me ever since to tell her exactly how i did it i about to smack her around the head in a moment if she doesntshut up i honestly cantanswer her because i have no idea what i did and am still clueless as to how i of all people actually managed to make well whatever bleeding potion we were suppose to be making personally i think i need to pay more attention to my cottage pie so rhi can just prattle away to the others who also were in potions and witnessed my unorthodox potion making wait a second nessa talking to me she wants me to come down to the grounds after lunch and see her care of magical creatures project what fun i get to go out into the freezing cold to visit some vicious beast oh and look at that cam wants me to see his as well how nice wontwe just have fun the things i do for my friends common room i am currently sitting as close as humanly possibly to the fire without actually being in the damn thing or singeing any vital body parts i bloody freezing damn nessa and cam come and see our care of magical creatures project it not that cold it ll be fun fun they call that fun first you have to fight your way through the snow which is still here from christmas and has been increased by the large snow fall that occurred the first week back at school i could see my breath it was so cold i mean it the middle of the day and i still had steam coming from my mouth the weak sun was doing a rotten job if you ask me and yes when you walk through the snow you do get awfully wet so by the time i got down to the forbidden forest i was soaked thoroughly then i was informed we had to go a little way in to the trees i looked at them both like they were mad go into the forest on a day like today are they deranged it was cold enough in the sunlight let alone in the freezing shadowy depths of the forest that dontsee sunlight for the majority of the year wait i dontknow if most of the forest actually ever sees sunlight but what about all the nutcase animals running around wild in there my friends are balmy i tell you absolutely balmy though when i think about it it was probably too cold for any formidable beast to be skulking around the place waiting to attack innocent students apparently nessa had set up a doxy breeding program for her personal project personally i think she mad they re horrid little things quite aggressive nessa reckons the eggs and venom are actually quite useful in potions she been collecting the stuff for the student potions cupboard and selling it to the local apothecary in hogsmeade quite the entrepreneur like wise cam has been quite successful in breeding these weird green lizard things mocks or something sorry they re mokes harmless enough but they kept shrinking all the time cam said it was just because they didntknow me oh silly me i haventformally introduced myself to the scaly monstrosities with tail rot cam was just explaining his dilemma about selling them off because their skins are use for purses and wallets due to the whole shrinking when a stranger touches them thing the only thing is he become rather attached to them he even named them well i have to say they are rather cute we were just discussing what he could possibly do with stevie and stella his favourites when i was attacked by nessa bloody doxies they have to be the most horrible little things i have ever met of course i screamed my lungs out as the pulled my hair and started swatting the little beasts off me nessa started yelling at me not to hurt her little moneymakers me not hurt them they attacked me and it was unprovoked i was just minding my own business not interfering with them in any way what about they return the favour huh just stand still lily and i ll freeze them stand still why in the name of merlin would i stand still the little horrors are trying to rip me shreds and she tells me stand still nessa finally stunned them all and stuffed them back in their cage sorry lily they were attracted to your hair they ve never seen anything quite as colourful as your hair they re quite attracted to bright things i didntquite know how to respond to that so i just kept my mouth shut cam took pity on me even though he thought it was quite hilarious that the doxies broke free from their enclosure just so they could get at my hair it okay lily i sure you ll be fine now just sit here and pat stevie he quite friendly so i sat on a log patting stevie muttering dark curses about deranged doxies and incompetent schoolgirls as their owners boo i shrieked for the second time this afternoon jumped about a mile in the air and stevie shrunk to the size of a pea i spun around and who should be standing there remus and james lupin potter i snarled they both looked completely bewildered er some ones a little on edge nice observation potter my heart was still going about a million miles an hour but stevie made his miraculous reappearance i gently stroked his head as this seemed to calm me down slightly as remus and james continued to survey me warily nessa came over to see what all the commotion was about she rolled eyes at the two of them you really shouldntsneak up on lily while we re in here she a bit skittish about the forest plus she was just attacked by the doxies they quite like her hair i gave nessa an indignant look i am not skittish i was merely still a little rattled by those blasted doxies nessa snorted sure anyway what are two doing down here we came to see how alfred is see if he settling in well nessa smiled and shook her head in an amused way alfred they looked at my confused face then realisation damned on remus of course you haventmet alfred then james got excited you have to met him i gave them a sceptical look do i want to the number of possibilities running through my head as to what they could possibly be showing me was endless and what sort of animal do you call alfred yes lily you definitely do he magnificent james and remus will take good care of you nessa assured me i looked at her horrified your not coming no i have to fix up the doxy enclosure she took stevie off me and have me a little push to where remus and james were waiting for me alright be brave lily be brave so what exactly is alfred james grinned you ll see i couldnthelp but grimace when we finally reached our destination we were faced with a sturdy pen and some dark shadows hold on a sec i ll go get him with that james jumped the fence and disappeared into the shadow i cast a worried look at remus a couple of minutes later james came back accompanied by what i could only recognise as a baby hippogriff it was so sweet i wanted to just jump the fence and hug it but how on earth did they get it or convince professor kettleburn to let them keep it for another matter i voiced my questions remus smiled and answered ah well we convinced kettleburn that all the marauders would take care of it and since he only young we persuaded him that he would be easy to train i couldnthelp but stare fascinated can i pat him go ahead i bowed first and alfred sunk gracefully to his knees they must be more trusting as babies like unicorns he was so soft at some point remus left to help nessa with her doxies as we could hear her cursing them even from alfred enclosure james and i eventually put alfred back after giving him his dinner as we made our way back my klutz factor kicked in though i have to say it wasntstrictly my fault aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhh we were walking near the little stream and the mud monster struck well not literally but still my foot was literally swallowed up by the mud i could feel it seeping into my shoes stupid mud at first james was alarmed but when he saw it was just mud he started cracking up you think this is funny do you james was leaning on a tree for support and managed a choked yes well i wasntgoing to let him just laugh at me now was i i scooped up a handful of mud and threw it at him getting him square in the chest he stopped laughing immediately and stared incredulously at me and what was that for i rolled my eyes laughing at me of course honestly he is quite thick sometimes he narrowed his eyes and within seconds it was all out war by the time we caught up with nessa remus and cam we were completely splattered with mud james was worse than me as i managed to get a big glob of mud smushed into his hair we looked alarmingly like bog people nessa choked on her cauldron cake when she saw us what have you to been doing i gave james a playful glare avenging an insult james looked scandalised pft more like retaliating to unprovoked attack that set us off on another one of our arguments unprovoked was it chuckles yes unprovoked you dirty toerag watch who you re calling dirty and you may want to stop your hair dripping onto your uniform it because of you that it is dripping before this encounter i didntknow mud could drip you might want to wipe your glasses as well how you can see through the grimy things i ll never know they wouldntbe grimy if you hadntthrown mud on them i wouldnthave thrown mud on them if you hadnttried to throw me in the brook by this point we were staring each other out waiting to see who would crack first it was james he couldntkeep his laughter in any longer of course our three companions were desperately trying to smother their own laughter i narrowed my eyes at cam who was the least successful at covering his mirth do you think this is funny cameron davies he tried to compose himself it was a very good try considering the circumstances but didntreally work no it not funny at all lillianna oh really you look awfully twitchy perhaps you d like a friendly hug to calm your nerves with that i ran up and gave him a big bear hug so he ended up nearly as muddy as me at the same time james had thrown his arms around both remus and nessa and shook his hair like a dog james and i ended up chasing nessa remus and cam all the way up to the castle when we eventually got to the common room narrowly avoiding filch sirius and peter looked up from their latest pranking plans and the twins and tri just stared do i even want to know what lily done this time i made and indignant hmpf james started it i merely finished it yeah getting the three of us in the process nessa added as she swept up the stairs to the dorm so after a delightfully roasting shower i am now trying to raise my internal body temperature to a normal functioning level which is proving quite difficult nessa is curled up next to tri complaining about being covered in mud and relating the tale of the obnoxious doxies and their fascination with my hair rhi off on a date with her ravenclaw bloke robin or something so i think i ll wait up for her that if i dontfall asleep first do you know the most obscure thought occurred to me just then james looks awfully cute when he dripping with mud hello poppets long time no see sorry about that i haventhad a moment to myself for about the last month and a half what with exams assessments sports carnival that went for a week revision coure thing ugh it been hectic but now i have no excuses winter break has ended i live in the land of oz in the southern hemishpere andi am now able to actually work out a time when i can devote myself to writing anyway thankyou all so much for your wonderful reviews and for being so patient with me happy summer holidays to all those of you lucky enough to be in the north hemisphere of the globe hope you re having a glorius time with all that sunshine for those of us stuck in the south dontworry summer not to far away sort of tell me what you think of the chapter and of the half blood prince i dying to talk to someone about it thanks so much to all readers jen absolute shocker by jamesroxmysox disclaimer i own nothing recognisable from the harry potter books or movies that belongs to j and warner brothers studios wednesday 12th january charms when did fourteen year old boys become so whiny i thought that just some of the girls were supposed to be whiny i mean seriously i think charlie changed his gender overnight he wouldntquit moaning over this melissa greenly i enquired how his weekend went during tutoring last night big mistake apparently the little talk i recommended he have with her didntgo over quite as well as he hoped in charlie words it was a complete and utter disaster i being the idiotically curious person that i am just had to ask how so well that certainly set him off now didntit how so how so i ll tell you how so i kept mumbling and stumbling over my words and i stupid things just kept spilling out and to top it off i accidentally gave her one of james trick lollipops she was still squeaking an hour later he let out a long suffering sigh and rested his head dramatically in his hands with the most forlorn look i ve ever seen on his face well i felt a little better at least i not the only one with a traitorous mouth but he still seems to be having trouble with this concept of nervousness it still completely foreign to him i had to bit my cheek to stop my amusement creeping onto my face feel better he gave another one of those woe is me sighs yeah a bit but that doesntchange that fact that i acted like a complete prat in front of melissa he sure is hooked on this bloody girl now isnthe he going to drive me balmy what he thinks i can do about it i ve no idea seeing as i am about as experienced in the dating realm as mcgonagall is in divination about as fond of it as well however i can relate to the whole messing up thing i frequently cause accidents inflicting suffering on others as well as myself my latest victim was a 7th year hufflepuff i some how managed to knock him into the path of vindictive peeves as he was assaulting passing students in general with ink pellets some how the poor blokes books went everywhere and he ended up with a broken arm he landed on it funny so it not really my fault well technically it was my fault he has a broken arm just not directly i really should find him and apologise i mean it was entirely my fault but i couldntreally see you see i was walking backwards talking to nessa and rhi while i was looking in my bag for the notes mcgonagall just gave us as neither of them had bothered to get them down because they saw me taking them down so yeah i probably owe him an apology anyway back to charlie look it not that bad at least compared to my numerous mishaps anyway it was an honest mistake i sure she ll forgive you if you explain properly his the end is nigh look is still firmly in place well the thing is i didntreally get a chance to explain things as she ran away when she sprouted whiskers pft that the least of your problem er well just apologise i mean i ve done it often enough and it usually turns out okay key word there usually there are the rare few such as rosie who just cantget over their own pride to take an apology gracefully they re just prats really but i sure melissa is not one of those rare few charlie looks at me disbelievingly what is it with you and those looks i donthave the faintest clue what you should do go talk to your bloody brother i sure he can give you some pointers charlie raised his eyebrows are you referring to his reputation as a ladies man what no you little fool i was referring to the fact that he your older brother and of the same gender and has been in this exact same situation at some stage in his life i was refering to the fact that he able to understand what you re feeling and would probably be able to give you a few pointers that i am not privy to ugh stupid males and their assuming natures i tried to calm myself down no i was simply pointing out the fact that this is an area where james would be more apt are providing advice i still think you should talk to him about it no are you crazy dontyou remember what i told you you know the whole laughing me off the face of the earth thing no i wonttalk to him and dontyou dare mention it i opened my mouth to argue donteven bother to defend yourself lily you and i both know you were planning to ask him to talk to me bugger he knows me to well oh well i can still ask james on charlie behalf he never need know that i talked to james and then i can give him the advice he so desperately wants and i thought you said no to take any of his advice i believe your exact words were he hopeless well yes that true it probably best he doesn t but i must say james would be far more suited to giving this type of advice than i ever will be i said pointers didnti you should probably just run them past me first to make sure their not completely absurd alright yes i was a little ticked by this time but come on i was listening to a fourth year whinge about his love life i donteven whinge about my love life or lack there of to my friends as i know how annoying it is precisely why i find this diary thing so appealing i can moan to myself and then never have to read it again that shouldntbe a problem seeing as i am most definitely not going to mention it to him and neither are you well someone has their knickers in a knot now dontthey after that he became very sulky and got quite upset when he couldntget the flick right moody little bugger uh oh flitwick wants to see everyone bubble head charms i better go practice so that my chances of embarrassing myself in front of the class are slimmed significantly astronomy tower you know during winter there really is a limited number of places you can go in the afternoons in winter the number becomes significantly smaller if you want some peace and quiet so the library is my new best friend but tonight i mixing things up with a trip to the astronomy tower i actually supposed to be doing my astronomy homework something about making observations as to how the planets and stars are arranged or something i ll check it later it quite chilly at night still well you d expect that wouldntyou it being january and everything but that precisely why i up here is this draughty tower this is the first clear night in ages so it seems like a perfect time to complete that astronomy homework i ve been neglecting ooooooh the moon coming up it so pretty i think it a full moon poor remus he must have an awful time i can only imagine how painful it is i know i joked about us being similar turning into monsters every month but really i have no idea how he must feel so lonely so isolated i mean he really is a minority at least i have others who understand my pain but remus well he has no one really who understands him fully awww schucks poor remus i ll go see him tomorrow in the hospital wing at break speaking of the hospital wing i apologised to that 7th yea i almost indirectly killed this morning i managed to find him at the hufflepuff table during dinner longish brown hair tanned average build and sort of hansom really my darling friends nessa in particular thought my attempt on the poor guys life was quite entertaining and were almost begging to be allowed to witness the apology up close i eventually got them to remain in their seats as i made my way over to the hufflepuff table i started getting jittery as i got closer what exactly do you say to someone whose life you have just recently endangered buggered if i know though really i should be an expert by now with the number of accidents i ve caused i tapped him on the shoulder er mick he turned around woah he has the clearest lightest blue eyes i ve ever seen he just been promoted from sort of hansom to dashing prince on the attraction scale how is it that i manage to embarrass myself in front of the most inappropriate people i think i cursed i can probably blame rosie for that the swotty knickered cow i was momentarily mesmerized by his eyes fortunately i was snapped out of it by the sound of his voice it nick actually bollocks right sorry nick i cringed anyway i er just wanted to apologise for the this morning all his friends were watching me as well there was some smug little swot of a girl smirking at my discomfort yeah well up yours curly sue i dontthink i really got a chance to say sorry what with you lying on the floor withering in pain and all so yeah i really sorry i offered a sympathetic tentative little smile here curly sue just smirked some more i looked at nick i let out a relieved sigh he was smiling that okay i got it fixed in a matter of seconds maybe you should just try not walking forwards not backwards i opened my mouth to insult the hell out of him when i noticed the teasing twinkle in those simply gorgeous blue eyes i changed tactics immediately oh is that so well since you have admitted to the recognising i was walking backwards maybe you would like to take a share of the blame seeing as you obviously didnttry to avoid the situation i looked at him accusingly he laughed okay so it was partly my fault as well sorry about not looking where i was going that made me more than a little guilty nah it was mainly my fault my name lily by the way i offered my hand and he shook it curly sue gave me a sour look yeah i know the infamous gryffindor redhead i infamous now am i and just why would that be on second thoughts i dontwant to know well again i really sorry nick i ll let you get back to your dinner ugh i need a cookie wait scratch that a need a dozen cookies i need a gross of cookies he nodded i ll see you around lily when i got back to the table the twins were goggling me and nessa looked thoughtful that was the guy you ran into the this morning and half killed demanded bridget hey that going a bit far i only broke his arm i didnthalf kill him he merely broke his arm nessa snorted yeah he just broke an arm he got off lightly really she paused for a second i definitely dontremember him being that dishy though there was an out cry from tristan here what he is dontlook at me like that tri i not about to waltz up to him and snog him senseless i was simply commenting on his physical attractiveness he wasntpacified in the least oh shut up tri nessa right he hotter than a potion fire what do think bridge dana looked over at her twin bridget was still salivating over nick and his newly recognised hotness dana clicked her fingers in front of her face what were you talking to me dana rolled her eyes honestly rhi back me up on this he did not look nearly as good this morning did he nessa was back on the case after effectively reassuring tri that there was no competition well rhi considered the case carefully i think he looks pretty much the same if you ask me we just didntsee his eyes this morning since he was too busy howling with pain nessa conceded that she was probably right rhi then added though nicholas fibonacci always has been a looker the rest of us just stared at her you knew about that boy existence and you never told us screeched dana and bridget together rhi didnteven blink well i thought it was common knowledge i dontknow how you could miss him he has the most amazing eyes the twins were dumbfounded yeah i realised that they took me a bit by surprise rhi smiled in sympathy they tend to do that i was slowly recovering from the shock of meeting the incredibly handsome nicholas fibonacci then the embarrassment hit me i groaned and hid my head in my hands what the matter i looked up at nessa she had torn herself away from stroking tri ego to enquire about my despair i er called him mick by accident through out this whole encounter cam found the whole thing rather entertaining but at this he cracked up completely and started laughing like a deranged psychopath and curly sue was smirking at me like i was some idiotic 1st year stuck in a trick step who the girl with brown curly hair and the nasty look on her face six heads turned to look back at the hufflepuff table you mean ellen hicks cam asked if she the brown curly haired one who is currently glaring at me then yes it was cam turn to surprise us all yeah that her she a great admirer of nick s he was trying to hide from her all summer you know him personally that came from guess who yeah he lives near me we get together every now and then over the holidays for a bit of quidditch the twins eyes glittered never a good sign you can just see the wheels turning as they cook up some elaborate plan so as to acquire some alone time with nick i still cantget over the fact that i called him mick it was an accident how was i supposed to know his name i ve never met him before in my life i ve just broken his arm is all so now dana and bridget have a new victim i pity the poor bloke first he gets bowled over by hogwart resident klutz which leads him to breaking his arm and becoming the newest victim of the mad man eating declour twins that boy is going to need all the help he can get oh well i better get this homework done or else i shall be shattered in the morning wait i never go to ask why i infamous that is something i ll have to look into along with those cookies thursday 13th january girl dorm well i was right about being shattered this morning normally anyone who knows anything about me doesnteven bother talking to me before 10am as it is pointless if you want an even semi civil response this morning it was particularly bad and took me till at least lunch to be able to open my mouth without a bitter and twisted comment escaping rhi took pity on me seeing as i missed breakfast and she happens to be extremely well organised she went and got me a stack of cookies from the kitchens before our first class transfiguration needless to say the cookies were the only things keeping me from telling mcgonagall to put a sock in it they were my favourite chocolate chip and they were still warm so the chocolate was slightly soft and delicious rhi is formally inducted into my book of those too saintly to be considered human tutoring was especially painful tonight charlie still sulking about melissa and hasntgiven up the deluded notion that i can actually give him worthy advice he convinced i with withholding information nutter on that note i had rounds with james and i decided that it was about the right time for a grilling inquisition only problem was he seemed to have the same idea we started out fine wandering the halls looking out for students skulking in the shadows we re actually both big softies it seems neither of us has the heart to take to many points or arrange an interview with the head of house probably due to our own night time wanderings i already feel like a complete hypocrite doing rounds in the first place any way i was just figuring out how to approach the subject of charlie and his problematic love life when james sparked up conversation i hear you almost killed hufflepuffs golden boy they re most upset you know the charms club would never be the same without him i nudged him in the side with my elbow i did not almost kill him no matter what nessa says i just caused an accident is all nothing out of the ordinary really he looks amused smug prat actually i heard it from ellen hicks i share a table with her in herbology she was telling me how some horrible little gryffindor red head half killed her nicky she not at all pleased with you i stared at him that girl really does not like me now does she well hang on a sec there curly sue i ve never even spoken to her before and she doesntlike me already good grief i good at acquiring enemies arenti i ve progressed to the stage where i donteven have to interact with them any more to cause the malevolent hatred well it a skill is all i ll say but i ve never even talked to her before that true but you did endanger nicky life so you re not exactly in her good books i scowled stupid woman what does she know she doesntknow the half of it he become the twins newest conquest and they will conquer believe me he interested now you mean he only just come to their attention i gave him a calculating look how much should i tell him well he may as well get the truth yes he only recently made a blip on their radar the last couple of years have been devoted to co captaining the potter and black fan club the number of rants i ve been subjected to detailing the unique hotness that is sirius and yourself is phenomenal just ask cam he had to endure them as well we usually end up holding each other just to protect the twins in case one of us snaps and tries to cause them grievous bodily harm he gave me a surprised look sirius and i have a fan club i glared at him i am not going to stroke your ego any more than your fan girls already do so let not go into it shall we i dare you to ask dana or bridget that question next time you see them he just grins okay i ll do that i hid my smirk very well if i dontsay so myself he has no idea what he in for now it was my turn to question him alright i have to ask your advice on some thing but i not sure how to go about it he looks at me curiously what it about how exactly do i put this preferably without charlie having to hunt me down and kill me romance he gave me a startled look not mine though someone else s uh oh james doesntlook convinced no seriously this is on behalf of someone else believe me i would never personally ask you for advice in this area it would be weird like now when you dontbelieve me what no i do believe you i gave him a skeptical look there was a strange glint in his eye that wasntat all comforting sure anyway on with the questions what exactly are you supposed to talk about with the person you have a crush on and how do you over come the whole nervous component he surveyed me for a moment are you sure this isntfor your personal benefit to keep me sane yes no now would you answer the damn question well whose it for then i cantsay why not stop being so suspicious who the advice for i canttell you or else i ll be hexed to within an inch of my life and fed to one of hagrid pets while i still alive i was yelling by this time and james had gone all red with what i think is suppressed anger we stared at each other for what seemed like half an hour ugh cantyou just fulfill your big brotherly duties just sit your brother down and give him a couple of pointers would you before he drives me completely mad bollocks bollocks bollocks bollocks charlie ll kill me james looks stunned oh lord i dead hagrid newest pet is about to be introduced to a suspiciously fresh dinner in the very near future please please please dontsay i said anything he ll kill me if he finds out i told you so please whatever you do do not mention this conversation i was just collecting myself in preparation to run as fast as i could back to the common room when james spoke charlie was asking you for romance advice yes he was driving me bloody balmy as well being nervous is a completely foreign concept for your family isntit it freaks him out to no end that he canttalk to melissa greenly with out stuttering i clamped a hand over my mouth to stop myself talking bugger bollocks sodding hell i cannot believe i just said that damn my traitor of a mouth he wontstop at killing me he ll torture me as well for that one why didnthe ask me i am his older brother james seems to have completely missed my last comment he to busy being indignant that his younger brother had no faith in him which i have to say is an entirely good thing charlie may now just find in his heart to bypass the torture because he thought you would laugh at him aaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhh my mouth has a mind of it own i bet it bribed the little men to pull the levers for it though mind you those little men are far to easy to bribe i think i need to get new little men sigh it so hard to get good staff ugh i think i ll have to go down to the common room dana and bridget are on a sugar high and wontstop cooing lily and james followed by obscene noises it truly disturbed especially since we spent a large part of the evening debating over what to do about his younger brother love life common room thank god i got out of there the twins both made suggestive comments involving myself the third floor broom closet and the resident head boy perverts i shall have to give rhi and nessa a talking to they kept egging the twins on and fell about laughing their heads off prats anyway where was i oh yes james and his inability to get over the fact that his little brother doesnttrust him he thought i d laugh at him honestly males they re so confusing they act like they have the emotional range of a teaspoon but then they get all out of sorts if they re not included in the circle of trust that discusses feelings take tri and cam for example if we were to leave them out of any personal crisis they would go off in a huff as demonstrated by the coming out party episode they were most put out yes he thought you would laugh him off the face of the earth to use his exact words and something about you being mr i can get any girl i want he has quite high opinions of you actually hopefully that ll satisfy him laugh him off the face of the earth can get any girl i want nope that wontdo it he went into shock after that he looks like he been betrayed poor little schnookums yes now can we get back to the matter at hand good now will you please talk to him you know just sort of generally enquire as to whether he likes anyone and take it from there he appear not to have heard me james he giving the wall a dazed and confused look james nope nothing i give up sod him see if i care if their brotherly friendship falls apart i did try james snapped out of it and turned to me where charlie now i gave him a bewildered look how in the name of chocolate would i know what do i look like his keeper i his tutor not his mother i donthave a tracking charm or anything ridiculous i d imagine he was in his dorm asleep we finished patrols in silence james got this sort of set look on his face and when we got to the common room he hardly said goodnight before bounding up the boys stair case i have a very bad feeling about this not just a it time for potions assignments to be handed in bad feeling but a my mother wants to take me out for a day of shopping so we can bond bad feeling i think the thing that gives me the willies the most is james eagerness to get up those stairs that is what seems rather startling usually he dithers around doing this and that he usually never goes up until after me so as you can see his beha boom uh oh that doesntsound good a huge explosion has just erupted from the boys dormitory for some reason i have the distinct feeling it has something to do with james and is a fore warning of my own mortal peril oh bollocks i right i hear charlie yelling at james and also the death threats that are directed towards me something along the lines of she worse than dead i think i better skedaddle before he gets a chance to mutilate me well tonight at least hey everyone sorry it not as long as the last one but oh well at least the update came faster but wow the number of people reading my story is just phenomenal thankyou so much for all your encouraging messages in answer to some of the questions asked last time have a look at my profile i answered a couple of them at the end thanks and remember to r e v i w absolute shocker by jamesroxmysox disclaimer i own nothing recognisable from the harry potter books or movies that belongs to j and warner brothers studios friday 14th january hospital wing humpf bloody boys stupid exceedingly dim creatures that we rely upon for the continuation of our race all i can say is that based on my observations the future generations are doomed now i like charlie really i do but that boy cantperform charms to save himself that is the exact reason why i happen to be in the hospital wing because no matter how much tutoring i give him he still cantget the hang of charms to be more precise he cantget the wand movements right after that magnificent explosion that sent james flying into a particularly hard wall charlie can storming down the stairs in search of me i was unfortunately only halfway to the stairs and freedom when charlie spotted me oh no you dontlily you get back here of course i did the sensible thing and ran for the stairs one problem he happens to be faster than me he some how got between me and the stairs leading to the girls dorms uh oh very big uh oh you told he sounded very annoyed and not at all as though he was going to take this with grace just between you and me that glint in his eyes reminded me of a serial killer i had seen on a television special over the summer it was rather unnerving okay okay i admit i was rather afraid of what he might actually do he went all red and purple and white splotches started appearing on his face making it look like homemade blackberry ice cream and it was all scrunched up in suppressed anger plus there was the fact that he was holding his wand like a maniac and it was pointing straight at my chest after all i would be doubting my own sanity if i hadntbeen slightly concerned you promised you wouldntsay anything oh dear he sounds rather hurt okay time for damage control well you see i didntactually say anything as such i just thought since you didntwant to ask james for advice i could do it on your behalf charlie stared at me like i mad he does that a lot actually but this time he just sort of blinked at me and stared disbelievingly well come on what was i supposed to do he was driving up the wall asking me all those silly questions that i cantfor the life of me answer i bet that went down well have i ever expressed my passionate hate for sarcastic smart arses well i am now yeah it went down a treat i was just trying to help geez oh dear he gone all red and splotchy again what do you mean just trying to help you were meddling okay so he has a point with the meddling thing but i was doing it in his best interest hey i was putting myself on the line to help you you could be a little more grateful that seems to have been the last straw he promptly tried to blast me across the room key word is tried unsuccessfully may i add instead of being hurled against a wall like james he managed to turn my hair into snakes bright orange snakes talk about embarrassing i just stared at him what the hell was that how many times do i have to tell you about wrist mov aaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh halfway through my lecture one of those horrid little animals that i previously called my hair copped me in the eye with its tail can you say ouchies well i say bloody hell i then stumbled around in agony being poked in the eye by a rattle tail really hurts and i only managed stopped when i collided with an innocent footstool while i was going backwards crack that would be one of my many leg bones breaking as i awkwardly landed just my luck charlie was still yelling even though i was lying semi unconscious on the ground passed out with pain it took him a good couple of minuted to realise that i wasntabout to get back up but i think it was the fact that i wasntyelling back that really got his attention all of a sudden there was a mop of blonde hair and an anxious face staring down at me and high pitched noises started coming from it i have no idea what he was saying but i do believe he was panicking and from what i can gather his high frequency babble was enough to rouse james from his wall induced stupor and between the two of them they were able to get me up here madame wilks was raving about it this morning how boys really need to learn to control their wands she was also muttering about shock again and that would be why i am yet again confined to a hospital bed last night i pretty sure i passed out right after i choked down those god awful potions wilks always insists on giving me this morning i woke up in time for class but madame wilks is insisting i stay at least until lunch if she had her way i d be stuck in here till at least sunday morning charlie came to visit me this morning and apologise over and over and over again he also presented me with a bunch of honking daffodils he said they always cheer him up so he thought i might like them aaaawwww isnthe sweet i felt so bad i tried to apologise for the whole talking to james thing but he just waved me off i then asked him if he could please retrieve this diary from the common room for me before classes start i would hate for this to fall in the wrong hands say the hands of rosemary macdonald ugh that would be an absolute nightmare imagine all the dirt she could get on me like the infatuation with daniel or our night time wanderings or my slightly less than legal actions which i would prefer remained confined to this diary and my friends all of it neatly laid out in chronological order and in painful detail what i never said i have an interesting life this diary in itself shows i have far to much time on my hands what with all the documenting i do honestly most people who picked this up would probably toss it away after the first couple of lines in favour of last february issue of twinkle toes the magazine with all you need to know about the latest toenail care oh joy a whole day in the hospital wing i may just lose my control in all the excitement and end up with wet knickers bollocks i ve just remembered flitwick was suppose to show use this really cool little charm during charms today and i have to miss it because of madame wilks and her shock theories hey there rosie what she doing here it the middle of the morning for chocolate sake i think i may have to go investigate i can try to sneak out while i at it i can still make it to charms if i run humphf she found me out i was barely three feet from the door when wilks caught sight of me and hauled me back to bed i thought school nurses where supposed to encourage their patients to attend class not restrain them if i fall behind due to this i will be giving madame wilks a piece of my mind not a large piece admittedly i need all the working brain cells i can get but still a substantial amount but on the other hand i found out what rosy was up to it seems that charlie isntthe only one who needs a bit of extra charms tutoring rosie seems to have been feeling a bit down today and decided cast a bit of a glamour charm on herself it went wrong horribly horribly wrong all i can say is that you should never trust those beauty tips in teen witch dana leaves them lying all over the place and some of the tripe they print is absolutely unbelievable i actually checked up on one of the pimple squeezing spells and you were more likely to set your skin on fire than remove a black head and rosie did quite the number on herself there boils and pus everywhere no wonder she came down once everyone was in class i wouldntwant anyone to see me looking like that either i actually feel kind of sorry for the poor girl i mean she was just having an off day and all she wanted to do was perk herself up a bit admittedly it was probably so she could lure in some poor fool and then crush his poor little heart to pieces but still ugh i such a softie i disgust myself i make a toasted marshmallow look impenetrable alright yes i caved but come on she was sitting over there looking all dejected i couldntjust let her suffer it against my nature i tell you i just went and offered one of the traditional chocolate frogs i receive every hospital wing trip from my friends to rosemary and a honking daffodil to go with it i know i know she horrible and manipulative and self centred and would never do that for me should our roles be reversed but i couldnthelp it she was just sitting there looking all forlorn damn her and her baby blue eyes all big and innocent looking no wonder so many innocent males get sucked into her little game i know what she really like and even i cantresist their power imagine the poor sods who base things entirely on looks they have no chance she was actually surprisingly grateful about the whole thing took my gestures with grace i suppose rosie not all that bad after all sunday 16th january common room heh heh heh i love sunday afternoons especially when entertainment is provided what this entertainment you ask well it seems that i not the only one with an over load of curiosity this afternoon james finally asked dana about the fan club thing everyone else groaned while i grinned like an idiot rhi quickly excused herself to go meet robbie for their walk around the lake pft walk around the lake more like an in depth examination of the human mouth nessa buried her head in a couple of pillows while tri smacked his head against the table a couple of times and bridget eagerly joined the conversation cam had his head in his hands but noticed my cheerful demeanour and gave me a suspicious look in all honesty i didntreally try to cover up my childish vindictive joy plus my smiling was a bit of a give way of my guilt seeing as i usually the first to start complaining and conspiring with cam as to what we can suffocate the twins with when they start up on this dreaded subject why do i get the feeling this is all your doing cam asked me with a mock glare deny everything that the best advice known to man i acquired an innocent look me what could i do cam wasntfooled in the least an awful lot just what is the question i just smiled and turned back to the scene before us dana is babbling continuously with bridget interjecting every now and then with some outburst james is staring at them a little dumbfounded heh heh heh take that potter next time you wontbe so nosy though i really shouldntbe mean the twins are absolutely shameless about their obsession with the sexy duo and i bet they re just thrilled that they can discuss it with the one of the actual objects of their fixation oh dear i do believe they ve moved into marathon mode tri and nessa have skedaddled muttering something about quidditch practice hmmm is that what they re calling it now they never could handle the twins obsessive ramblings luckily cam and i have built up a resistance to their voices and are gradually learning to tune them out key word there is gradual we haventquite managed it yet cam shooting james sympathetic looks do you think we should save him now i gave him a are you nuts look why would i want to do that james is getting a well deserved dose of medicine my style of medicine that will hopefully deter him from purposely ticking me off i say purposely because he bound to do something to annoy me it like genetically encoded or something and we should do that why cam rolled his eyes give the man a break there only so much one person can handle pft he can handle it show me a man and i ll give him a break well i mean really cam is attempting to take away my sunday afternoon entertainment i am not going to agree to this quietly and passively where am i going to find substantial entertainment for the rest of the evening uh oh cam just gave me the look ugh fine we ll get him out what the plan cam and i usually scheme up ways of getting ourselves away from the twins now we have to concoct a way to get an additional third party out of their clutches oh joy well how about i distract the twins by mentioning nick while you quickly whisk james off to feed alfred oh and could you slip stevie a couple of drops of pepper up potion he been a bit off colour lately well it sounds reasonable right on the count of three one two three why do i get the feeling that this will lead to trouble for me at least wednesday 19th january the art of boring students to death as perfected by professor binns the morning of notes exchanging them that is no one ever mentioned anything to me about taking any down yes our weekly lesson of boredom aka a history of magic lesson with binns that we effectively combat against by entertaining ourselves with amusing anecdotes scribbled on scraps of parchment that are passed from table to table last time it was something about sinistra bolivian tree frogs and the cancan why does he have to make everything so boring i mean really a bloody goblin revolution in which many heads literally rolled should not be this boring it against the laws of nature or something vh definitely the man been dead far too long le it hard to imagine him alive let alone our age i doubt he can either you know what we need a list precisely a list the only question is what sort of list something involving chocolate and it advantages i know vanessa halleway and lillianna evans present why chocolate is better than well other things 1 you can get chocolate very true it easy to find unlike other things such as good men hmmm i dunno about the good men comment you seem to find them pretty easily e g the infatuated quidditch captain i shall ignore that comment and continue as though you never wrote it next 2 if you love me you ll swallow has real meaning with chocolate now this one i can agree with remember the dilemma amy from ravenclaw was facing last term with the egocentric drip of hers you d never have that problem with chocolate for some reason chocolate just seems to be so much more understanding and he was such a tosser i glad she got rid of him 3 chocolate satisfies even when it goes soft you know this one depends what you re talking about because in certain circumstances softness is not at all favoured but other times being soft is an advantage are we coming back to the hunky quidditch captain again no why would you say that oh it just that you have definitely softened up to him lately ugh i think we ll leave this one right alone 4 the word commitment doesntscare off chocolate unlike certain redhead i know oh who that ugh dear merlin why do i have to have such a dimwitted best friend you you blind flubberworm hey i resent that i am nothing like a flubberworm okay so maybe you donthave any flubberworm tendencies but you are afraid of commitment i am not yes you are why else would you completely ignore james attempts to engage you in a romantic relationship ugh what is it with people and that word i hate thatword what word the e word huh engage it a horrible word that may be so but it beside the point you re avoiding the subject oh and just what is the subject you and james what about james and i sweet merlin you re annoying thankyou i ve been informed of that on numerous occasions well the fact of the matter is that you are ignoring james i am not i hang out with every now and then just last sunday we went and visited alfred well you are ignoring all those little signals he sending you he sending me signals uh huh lots of them why haventi noticed because you ve been preoccupied with various other issues that have been claiming your attention like well us your friends for start charlie and his confusing 4th year love life your sister wedding i noticed she owled you the other day dontremind me she was quizzing me on whether i had finalised the design of my maid of honour dress i mean really as if it matters what i think the old bat is going to swoop in and change everything anyway true which brings me to my last point your mother and her plans to bring you and remus together it sort of been taking up most of your time worrying about it no wonder poor james feels rejected poor james now is it never mind poor lily with all this on her plate yes he so very sweet oh yeah and er this came for you this morning but you were away in lily land so i took it and let the poor owl go get it breakfast which happened to be your bacon coincidently lily friday 22nd january astronomy tower my mother is insane the woman is truly deranged the old bat is definitely bonkers and needs a bed reserved for her in st mungo i ve been coming up here fairly often lately even though it absolutely freezing but happens to be absolutely void of people which is a wonderful attribute at the moment as it means i can scream obscenities and no one hears them and yes i do believed i have been pencilled in for a bed near my mother in st mungo s between tuna incessant whining about her wedding and my mother continual encouragement i ll never make it till summer with out attempting to curse myself at least once when nessa handed me that letter in history i almost fainted the overpowering lavender scent and neat flowing script meant it could only belong to one person an unhinged bored housewife more commonly referred to as my mother and you ll never guess what that oh so long letter was about it had me wanting to pull out my hair in frustration when i was only a quarter of a way through it was to use remus terminology an encouraging letter in which the old bat explicitly told me that i would be dating remus by the en of the month and that when he asked me to hogsmeade because he most certainly would be asking me that i was to accept pft as if remus is even going to ask any such thing the rest of the letter went on to explain that i would be spending the easter holidays with remus as our families had decided to go on holiday together ugh i dontthink i handle this i really cant i was also informed that remus shall be my date for petunia s as if i really care anyway and then came a long winded explanation of my mother expectations i guessing that daddy has no idea about this seeing as he was still entirely off the old bat when i last saw him the best thing to do would be beat the deranged old bat over the head with my transfiguration book until i knock some sense into her wait i think my book would fall apart first i rather need that one unless i could just use my potions book it not like i use it anyway it has at least an inch of dust covering it it has a new life shielding from my view the carob chocolate mother sent me when she was on one of her health thing carob chocolate i mean honestly who eats this stuff it doesnttaste nearly as good as the proper stuff if you are going to treat yourself you may as well do it properly anyway what was i talking about oh yes my encouraging letter i think i ll have to talk it through with remus and see what we can come up with monday 24th january common room it my free study period so i thought i d take this moment to document my continuing troubles with that damn letter i finally caught up with remus in the common room the other night seems he been getting similarly encouraging letters from his mother the marauders were grouped around the fire planning something no doubt as good a time as any to get this ruddy thing over with remus the whole lot of them looked around and stared at me geez address one and you re effectively addressing them all okay now would be the time for my gryffindor courage to kick in if i have any that is er remus could i please talk to you for a second privately i had to add the last part as they seemed to expect me to just blurt it all out the marauders may know about my little problem but i would rather just discuss it with remus for the moment at the moment i under way to much pressure to have to deal with their various responses remus followed me over to the other side of the common room remus had a knowing look on his face he got things started before i could open my mouth this is about the hogsmeade trip isntit i looked at him slightly startled but i should have known that he would be clued up seeing as he been getting the same sort of letters yes it driving me absolutely balmy my mother basically ordered me to date you deluded old cow yeah she can be rather forceful remus pulled out a something from his pocket and i caught a giant whiff of lavender she wouldn t i recognised the neat flowing script immediately she did my mother has written to remus oh lord that woman needs a serious talking to just what does she think she playing at let me guess it informs you that you will ask me to the next hogsmeade trip and that we are spending the easter holidays together remus have me a half smile right in one at this point i had to clutch the arms of the chair i was sitting in to stop myself from losing it it didntwork ugh i cantbelieve her who the hell does she think she is messing around with my life like this i hate when people do that i looked over at remus he just looked as though he agreed entirely how are we going to solve this i mean no offence remus but i could never date you and i pretty sure the feelings are mutual so what in the name of merlin wand are we going to do remus seemed to be thinking something over well it definite that we will not be dating one another as to what we re going to do you can start by taking a few deep breaths we can deal with this believe me lily you re forceful enough to get through to your mother you just need to calm down first i hate it when he does that he all reasonable and what not but i did as he said i tried to calm down okay now let think what can you say to her that will convince your mother to give up her ridiculous ideas i think of a variety of things to say to her none of which are appropriate or would convince her to change her ideas hmmm i not really sure how to appeal to her other than t tell her she a cow remus just smiled that might not be the right way to go about it he paused for a moment how about you write her a letter expressing her views i ll do the same with my mum but we have to show them to each other first after that he left me to my letter writing well he thought i was going to write my letter pft as if i have time i have to perfect my non verbal incantations for human transfiguration revise for my potions practical i may have to actually view the carob chocolate for a while seeing as this next antidote thing accounts for a large percent of our end of year mark plus there the essay due for defence that requires tedious amounts of research in the restricted section yeah i really going to write my letter when i have all that to do i watched remus rejoin the marauders i saw their questioning looks and sirius no doubt was asking what that was about but remus just shook his head see some people can keep their mouths shut wish i was one of them anyway seeing as it my free period and i am at the moment unsupervised by friends acquaintances or the like i may as well start my letter to my mother can i just say this letter business is a lot harder than it seems i think this going to take a while okay so this is the best i have come up with so far dear mother i couldntvery well write hey old bat now could i it very tempting though in response to your previous letters i have decided that i need to put a stop to this once and for all i am not going to date remus lupin or indeed marry him so i would suggest you redirect your efforts to petunia wedding there is attraction between remus and myself there never has been and there never will be we have a platonic friendship that will not progress to beyond that and i hate to point this out mother but i think you should realise that you can make as many demands as you like however that does not mean that i shall pay any attention to them i will not be escorted to hogsmeade by remus next weekend or any weekend for that matter you may owl me all you like but i have to ask that you leave remus alone he will actually read your letters as he is far too polite to follow my example of putting them in the fire what i plan to do for the easter school holidays is no concern of yours either if you insist on holidaying with the lupins in order to create time for remus and i to spend time together i shall be remaining at hogwarts for the holidays and if you decide to come to hogwarts to forcefully remove me from school i shall not co operate in any way shape or form remus will not be my date for petunia wedding i will not be told who i am and am not associating with let alone in a relationship with during the holidays i will plan my maid of honour dress not before as my workload is far too high i also have to ask if daddy is aware of your incessant badgering to date remus as last time i talked to him he still disapproved i hope i have made myself perfectly clear that this scheme between vivian and yourself will not succeed kindly refrain from employing any more of your little tricks to achieve your ridiculous objective lillianna hhhhmmmmmmmm that looks pretty good to me straight forward to the point and leaves no room for interpretation exactly what is needed when talking to my mother oh for the love of chocolate i going to be late for transfiguration transfiguration thank merlin i not too late mcgonagall lips are rather thin never a good thing sorry i late professor peeves was terrorising the first years again which is strictly true seeing as he was indeed trying to scare the first years that were waiting out for charms i just shot a couple of sparks at him a i ran past technically i wasntlying though i tried to clear my mind seeing as i have my suspicions that mcgonagall is actually a legiliumus she manages to catch out students every time just by looking at them i swear she can do the weird thing where she accesses your memory but i didntactually have to worry because mcgonagall wasnteven looking at me she was still staring at the back of the room thankyou ms evans please take your seat so we can get started i made my way to my seat next to cam and rhi waving to tri nessa sirius james and the twins as i went wait sirius and james what in the name of chocolate are they doing here i cast them both a confused look as i sat down when i looked back at mcgonagall i realised what she was glaring at sirius and james had obviously done something but it only the beginning of the lesson today we will be continuing with self altering human transfiguration once you have accomplished changing the colour of your eyebrows please continue on to eyelashes and as many of you will have noticed we have two guests today messrs black and potter please take no notice of them mcgonagall left us to work while she helps mitchell cook with his eyebrows last time he ended up with furry caterpillars and the addition of massive side burns i wonder why james and sirius are here cam what are james and sirius doing here le they got kicked out of class cd but it the beginning of the lesson well it seems biggles wouldnteven let them in the defence room he just ordered them to come to mcgonagall bet she loved that oh yeah that why she in such a wonderful mood she has to supervise the rowdy half of the marauders twice today what did they do to get biggles knickers in such a knot well biggles isntsuch a great teacher anyway but i heard mcgonagall muttering about carnivorous pink flamingos so that could mean anything oh dear no wonder she was glaring at them i looked over to james and sirius sirius was leaning back in his chair with his feat on the desk playing dragons and brooms with a very laid back james they dontseem all that concerned now do they of course they don t it james and sirius they never exert themselves in classes anyway dontlook now but i think mcgonagall noticed their lack of remorse as well all we have to do now is sit back and watch the show where the popcorn mcgonagall is now towering over the two prats who are blatantly playing a game during her class such idiots just what do you think you are doing mr black mr potter sirius just looks up casually enjoying a nice game of dragons and brooms care to join us minnie uh oh i dontthink i can watch mcgonagall response bam aaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhh get it off get if off oh my giddy aunt er cam why is there a racoon attacking mitchell cook that racoon would be melissa darlington oh she doesntseem too happy about her new racoon status from the way she trying to gouge his eyes out i d say your right oh dear i dontthink she going to come quietly no if mcgonagall tries to pry her off cook again i think she ll get more than just a bite on the hand is it just me or does darlington seem a little racoon like still well i pretty sure that melissa hair wasntnearly as bushy as that or quite so stripy and i positive she didnthave rings around her eyes what were you thinking cook it is self alteration there was no reason to point your wand at a fellow class member honestly professor i didntdo anything i as just trying to change my eyebrows like you told me when there was a big bang and then there was this racoon jumping on me cook i would like to believe that but your spells often misfire you need to learn to take better care when casting spells professor i honestly didntdo anything my wand wasntanywhere near melissa i swear that is enough cook 10 points from gryffindor and be grateful it isntmore does this seem a little weird to you i mean i swear if mitchell had misfired his wand it would have gone the other way yeah it look like that to me before as well you dontthink not even they would sink that low at least i hope they wouldnt i think they would take a lot at black grin and potter smirk ooooooooh they are worse than dead girls dorm ugh regulus black needs a muzzle preferably one that would cut off his air supply that silly little boy just cantkeep his mouth closed can he he always has to put in his two cents worth he was making rude comments about dana and bridget at dinner concerning their ability to go through boyfriends extremely fast i almost socked him one but cam decided that wasnta good idea since mcgonagall was still annoyed about the marauder and physically restrained me apparently they created even more havoc in her 7th year transfiguration class by smuggling in a couple of nessa doxies and letting them lose on the rest of the class wait there someone at the door it all right nessa got it hi melissa what can i do for you i was wondering if i could borrow some of the twins make up for my eyes madam wilks ran out of one of her potions and said she couldntget anymore till tomorrow afternoon i dontwant to go round looking like this till then sure dana and bridget have enough concealer to hide a small country nessa led melissa over to the twins vanity and they re now trying to find the right stuff which quite frankly could take forever seeing as there is so much rubbish to paw through personally i couldntdo it the sacrifice is too great i think i d be driven mad by the number of identical looking labels thank god dana just appeared hey mel how are you feeling after the racoon thing melissa face just turned sour like i could ditch mitchell off the north tower that a bit harsh but melissa how do you know it was mitchell i mean his wand was pointing in the completely opposite direction she seemed to be thinking about this so i continued if you ask me it was sirius or james who did it they were just about to be blasted by mcgonagall when you conveniently turned into a racoon and attacked mitchell even cam thinks they did it nessa and dana rolled their eyes melissa however took me seriously well that does make more sense but i dontwant to go scream at them huh what is the woman mad if they did this to me they d be lucky if they werentracoons themselves racoons that were being introduced to a balisk they seem to like rodents er why not melissa looked at me horrified are you joking while i look like this you must be mad oh for the love of well yes then you could ask them to fix it i just got three blank stares in return for my stab at bringing logical reason to the world of teenage girls actually it was only two melissa look of horror had just gone up to the i staring voldemort in the face he has a wand and i don t level what about lily asks james to fix seeing as she ll see him tonight at the prefect meeting would that be okay nessa directed this at melissa to calm her down but i was to understand it as more of an order than a request aimed at me wait a second what prefect meeting the three of them just stared at me again dana enlightened me the one you re going to be late for if you dontmove your arse right now crapolla i late again today and i have to talk to james about the racoon thing oh bollocks hey everyone i reposted because firstly the dates were off and second the last time it was done in such a rush a number of things just went wrong hopefully it now easier to read thanks again to everyone who reviewed r e v i e w absolute shocker by jamesroxmysox disclaimer i own nothing recognisable from the harry potter books or movies that belongs to j and warner brothers studios tuesday 25th january library i ve had enough of this prefect business i think i should resign seeing as how bad a prefect i actually am i mean i never do anything that would be describe as prefect worthy sure i go on patrols but that because i have to and i only do the whole saviour thing of younger students when it absolutely necessary far too much trouble otherwise it completely overrated anyway all we do is sit around gossiping about who got caught with who in the 3rd floor broom closet note to self never use the 3rd floor broom closet for privacy aka snogging session as it never stays private for long this is actually a useless note seeing as i dontactually have anyone to be private with aka snogging partner but it may be a good piece of advice to pass on to say charlie i think it one of the few pieces of advice to do with the dating sector i could actually pass on to him oh my chocolate a fourteen year old is more inclined to be romantically linked than i am i truly am pitiful i think i ll dwell on that for a while okay enough dwelling it too depressing let get back to the subject at hand what was that again oh right the prefect meeting ugh i beginning to notice a trend at these meetings amy gets stressed due to well being a seventh year and head girl she then takes it out on james and the rest of us by screaming her head off james then tries to calm her down and takes over the meeting so that important issues are still discussed in a rational manner who count moaning myrtle flooding the girls bathroom as an important issue anyway i mean really she always doing that anyone mentions breathing she throws a tantrum and water goes everywhere now if myrtle were to be peeking in the prefects bathroom that would be a different matter she truly a weirdo that one the meeting then dissolves into multiple disagreements with more than one lot of people screaming at each other with the occasional hex thrown in but i think that was because one of the ravenclaws insulted the hufflepuff quidditch team idiot the meeting then ends with amy screaming again and james shooting up sparks as you can probably tell daniel and i usually have a good laugh about all this remus sometimes joins us to laugh at james frustration as he takes yet another ear bashing from amy tonight didntdiffer from this formula at all the important issue this week was the dear desire of many students to kick mrs norris hmmmm i have to say i agree with this one of course amy thought it was preposterous that authority figures even voiced such a disgraceful idea such a bad example for younger students pft like she hadntwanted to give mrs norris a swift kick up the anyway the disagreement quickly escalated when a couple of ravenclaws mounted there high horses waffling about morality daniel remus and i were in hysterics as bill watts the gryffindor 5th year prefect put forward a very convincing argument to set up a student based organisation with the sole aim of capturing mrs norris and stuffing her in the vanishing cabinet amy turned purple while one of the ravenclaws put forward some snooty reasoning only half of which was heard due to the multiple shouts of support for bill it one of the few times i ve seen gryffindor and slytherin so united on the one subject james was trying very hard to keep a straight face but even he had to turn away when he caught our eyes to stop himself from cracking up completely after that i was slightly more optimistic about getting him to first admit that he had turned melissa darlington into a raccoon and then tell me how i could fix it have i ever mentioned that being optimistic is completely against my nature and that whenever i do try my hand at it things usually dontwork out yes i achieve much more when i cynical and pessimistic i told remus and daniel my mission to extract information from james daniel just smacked his hand to his forehead and shook his head i believe he has given up on trying to tell me anything most of the time i dontlisten anyway he made the wise decision of saving his breath he ll probably just gripe about my stubborn pigheaded nature to the remus all the way back to the common room remus however was slightly more supportive good luck lily you re going to need it did i say supportive i meant extremely unhelpful note to self must find more supportive friends who believe in me psh now where would i find people like that but despite what people think i do realise that i will need all the luck in the present vicinity in order to get james to cough up the counter curse for melissa not to mention some arm twisting make that a lot of arm twisting i waited till everyone else had gone amy just go it fine i can handle it you go do whatever i head boy i can handle a simple cleaning spell to put my persuasive charms in action hi james ha persuasive charms i just crack myself up he jumped about a foot in the air and spun around to stare at me like a deranged deer caught in some startlingly bright headlights merlin lily you scared me i thought everyone had gone scared of little old me the silly boy has lost his proverbial marbles well they haven t i just sooo witty but i need to talk to you about something he gave me a suspicious look this would be anything like the last time you talked to me would it see what i mean about boys and their assuming natures though if i had been thrown into a wall as a result of the last time someone talked to me i would probably be wary as well i glared at him for the stupid assumption making no it has to do with transfiguration raccoons and melissa darlington his mouth formed a little o shape as though that was the last thing he expected this talk to be about well honestly he didntthink no one would notice his turning someone into a racoon now did he really and what do all those things have to do with me i gave him a look blasted marauders they never admit to anything everything he raised his eyebrows and just how did you make that little connection because you donthave a subtle bone in your body when i pointed out this lack of subtlety his face took on a very grim look made him look quite striking actually bad lily bad you re supposed to be wrangling information out of him not admiring his physical appearance or berating him for that matter there plenty of time for that later especially the former reading that previous statement i can only claim temporary insanity note to self must stop admiring the physical attractiveness of the head boy as it seems to addle the brains especially when in an argument or trying to extract information or doing homework or how about we just leave it at stop admiring the head boy altogether anyway i changed tack to wrangling mode as taught to me by dana and bridget james i was wondering if you could please help me with a problem i having in transfiguration sweeter than sugar that the trick james surveyed me with a wary look due to my sudden change in demeanour okay he doesntlook very willing to cooperate say you accidentally turn your friend into a raccoon and when you restored them they retain some raccoonish characteristics how do you return them to there true previous form i ended with a piercing glare to make it clear that i knew he had turned melissa into a raccoon and that he was going to help me get rid of the raccoonish attributes and would you believe he had the nerve to smirk yes smirk and at me of all people oh i could have smacked him one i sorry i canthelp you i ve never accidentally turned someone into a raccoon this time i did smack him only on the upside of the head though ow he rubbed his head and gave me a hearty glare pft he glared at me me the queen of death glares what a pathetic effort dontbe a prat and just help me would you why does he have to be such an arse about it i a prat am i that not the best way to treat someone you re trying to get help from oh dear he gone into that defensive i m an arsehole mode only one way to deal with this i grabbed him by the tie and pulled him down to my level so that our faces were inches apart stop being such an arsehole and just tell me how to put melissa right or else i ll tell mcgonagall about who really disrupted her class i hissed in a deadly whisper sweet merlin i such a snitch i kept glaring at him as he thought about this all the while not letting go of his tie and receiving quite the glare myself fine give her two table spoons of this he pulled away and gave me a small sealed bottle of potion i eyed it and then him suspiciously once i was satisfied i just gave him one more annoyed look and walked towards the door what i donteven get a thankyou that a bit harsh no lily you are not under any circumstances allowed to kick him not even just in the shin anna no that would be cruel and as you have no self control would probably escalate to a full on beating which incidentally get you in trouble him being the head boy and all stupid conscience note to self acquire new conscience as this one is completely off the rails a new personality wouldntgo stray either the present ones seem to be working together to plot my downfall wait downfall from what if i fall from grace i wonthave very far to fall now will i oh dear i confusing myself let move along shall we not when you re the one who caused the problem it was that or nothing terrible comeback i know but i all my energy was concentrated on controlling the urge to just sock im and wipe that smirk off his face i turned to go and next thing i know i staring at james blasted chest not that he doesnthave a very nice chest it just that it was unexpected i mean really how do they keep doing that am i just abnormally slow or are the potter brothers just incredibly fast how is it that they always manage to miraculously cut off my exit just after i ve turned my back on them they re a pair of weirdos i tell you complete weirdos yes i am completely aware that my name calling has a distinct resemblance to the saying the pot calling the kettle black but i the self declared queen of hypocrisy so it all good james had a funny little smile on his face one that communicates to any normal person that things have just turned against them a signal to run away from the smiler as fast as possible see how i said normal well i ve never classed myself as normal and i definitely didntpay attention to that smile well not the way i was supposed to it sort of put me on edge but i just gave him a get out of my way look which he rudely ignored prat now that not very nice lillianna i narrowed my eyes at the formal use of my name you should be a little more polite to your saviour i do believe that two favours you owe me now now i was openly staring i opened my mouth indignantly to reply but he cut me off you re so cute when you re angry beyond belief this alone unnerved me but the weird look in his eye really had me reeling i was well beyond my comfort zone hey what was that about being cute i not cute i refuse to be cute cute me ugh what am i an ugly puppy actually i think i d prefer not to get an answer to that one he lovingly put my hair behind my ear before giving me one last smile and disappearing without a word that boy has some serious issues i think i mentioned previously that he has split personality disorder the question is how many times exactly can the personality split well whatever that was about i resolutely refuse to acknowledge it it took me a couple of minutes to get over the shock of that little exchange but once i did i rushed back to the girls dormitories gave melissa two spoonfuls and hopped into bed with hopes of never having to go over that little incident ever again note to self never again approach the head boy individually always bring reinforcements that way if he has one his little personality altering episodes there will be someone to protect you or at least witness his weirdness so that you can reassure yourself you re not going mad wait that wontwork seeing as i have to do patrols with him bollocks all round bloody weirdo that the only way i can think to describe him speaking of weirdos here charlie for his tutoring which he doesntreally need anymore he just dumped his stuff on the table and is now glaring at it i hope this has nothing to do with my talking to james or the melissa thing because in all honesty i cantdeal with either of those things at the moment i need to get a new tutor what an opening line now that was totally unexpected what i said i was sorry didnti i distinctly recall apologising profusely for talking to james on several different accounts you cantstill be mad at me can you charlie just looked at me startled for a second i guessing from that reaction you haventheard then i stare at him heard what i managed to say through clenched teeth charlie gets a bit fidgety the rumours he looks positively scared what rumours my voice is getting quieter and deadlier with each answer charlie takes a deep breath the rumour that you and james are having a passionate secret love affair and that i blasted james and cursed you on thursday in a fit of jealous rage when i found you together in the common room as i have fallen deeply in love with you while you were tutoring me it took me a moment to decipher exactly what he said because it all came out so quickly what where in the world did that come from i looked over at charlie who had taken cover under his copy of the standard book of spells grade 4 he was using it as a head protection as he had sunken in his chair so all i could see was a pair of frightened brown eyes peering out at me sorry charlie you can come out i promise i wontshout at you again or cause any grievous bodily harm the batty old madam pince stuck her head around the corner what is all this racket about this is a library and that means there should be silence i will have to ask you to leave ms evans if you do not quieten down it a library wow i didntnotice what with all the books everywhere stupid woman although she is very talented in the way that she can scream at you without raising her voice above a whisper okay lily now is not a time for sarcasm but for bullshitting i mean creative answers i so sorry madam pince it just that someone scribbled in this book i thrust a random book at her she opened the book and examined it by merlin wand your right tsk tsk tsk i will have to clean it immediately and punish the culprit thankyou so much for bringing this to my attention ms evans please continue with your work i let out a deep sigh thank merlin for over active imaginations that was close charlie had finally emerged yeah we have a nutter for a librarian what do expect and there was no need to act as though a nuclear bomb was going to go off a what was going to go off purebloods i tell you they have no concept of the danger the arms race between the superpowers has created and they call muggles ignorant an nucl oh never mind i wasntgoing to hex you or anything he gives me a measuring look better be safe than sorry you re not famous for your temper for nothing i famous for my temper that interesting wait who was it who said something about me and famous nick i believe he called me the infamous gryffindor redhead i wonder if my temper what he was referring too anyway back to this rumour note to self must stop behaviour that has resulted in the multiple rumours that have been started this year i mean it not like i an interesting person they could at least find someone interesting to whisper and conspiracise about anyway technically i have not done anything that would be considered controversial stupid people and their stupid theories where did you hear that rumour from charlie collapsed onto the desk everyone i need a cookie and i need one now thursday 26th january library charlie just left the whole love triangle thing is taking its toll on the poor little thing apparently melissa hasnttalked to him all week and he devastated i can relate to that so i didntmention anything when his wrist movement was a bit off this afternoon he not the only one feeling the effects of that stupid rumour i ve had numerous knowing glances thrown my way some jealous glares and various crude comments but really i think charlie is worse off than me i mean i only romantically linked with james i love how i just said only romantically linked had this rumour gone round at the beginning of the year i would have been very very distressed but all i can say is at least he good looking bad lily bad and appear to be highly desirable this in itself should have been an indication of the ridiculous nature of the rumour whereas charlie is apparently insanely jealous of his older brother and has fallen in love with said brother girlfriend he comes off a little unbalanced to be honest and not at all likeable which again is another indication of how off this rumour is seeing as i am yet to meet a person who doesntlike charlie once they ve met him excluding some slytherins i mean honestly who takes anna and judy seriously the pair of them are a rumour mill in themselves at first dana and bridget came running up to me demanding to know why i hadnttold them these would be the type of people who take anna and judy serious of course the rest of them thought it was just plain hilarious cam tri and nessa wouldntshut up i thought they were going to stop breathing at one point they all ended up in pain though due to the stitches they got from laughing so much serves em right the twats rhi at least had the decency to just smile and shake her head once the twins realised it was the twisted workings of anna and judy imaginations they dissolved into a fit of giggles cam finally calmed down enough to talk he thought it would be good to console me seeing as i was looking a little down and at not at all humoured by this ridiculous rumour think about the irony lily you and james together charlie madly on love with you and then attacking you both it so ridiculous it laughable as he said it a smile crept on my face as i thought about it i ended up laughing just as loud as nessa tri and cam we were interrupted from our musings and laughter by remus do i even want to know what that was about remus must have witnessed dana impression of the rumour where charlie catches james and i in the common room there was a large amount of slapping hands to the face and horrified looks cam and i were leaning on each other for support we were laughing so much it took me a moment to collect myself probably not but it was dana impression of that ridiculous rumour remus considered it for a moment which one i had to laugh the one about james and i having a secret passionate love affair and charlie attacking us in a fit of jealous rage remus just stared i know it ridiculous in every account was there something you wanted it took him a moment to remember what he d came over for oh yeah letters to deranged determined mothers i went and got my letter to show him remus had his as well his was a lot more informal and far nicer but we both agreed that a firm line had to be taken with my mother so my letter was fine remus said he would send them both away tonight hopefully that would be the end of the problem now what with this rumour i looked at him searchingly you haventheard it before just now he shook his head well you know the fifth years anna and judy who doesn t yes well they started it as they didntknow the full story of what happened on thursday and the rest of hogwarts has pounced on the scrap of seemingly juicy gossip so what were they saying exactly how do i put this keeping a straight face would be an excellent start firstly james and i are apparently secret lovers we ve been sneaking around hogwarts didntyou know but that not all i being the scarlet woman i am have enchanted the younger brother charlie who has fallen madly and deeply in love with me remus was staring at me again now what has brought all this to the attention of the hogwarts public was on thursday night when charlie discovered james and me in a passionate embrace in the common room sending him into a fit of jealous rage he then proceeded to take out his revenge on james for always being better than him by thrashing him multiple times against a wall and apparently he cursed me all the while calling me a filthy whore remus just blinked yeah it takes a couple of minutes to process but when you think it through it hilarious i mean as you know charlie was trying to hex the living daylights out of me because i told james he likes melissa greenly we sat in silence for a minute that has to be the most ridiculous thing i ve heard all year i smiled you can see why we laughing about it now cantyou remus just shook his head i feel really sorry for charlie though seeing as everyone seems to think that he likes me when he been agonising over this greenly girl for weeks now remus is smiling now and seems to be seeing the funny side note to self never mind about the finding of new friends thing the ones i have are just fine including remus i glad to see it not getting you down i ll go and post these letters now i ve got a horror of a defense essay to write tonight see you later lily more like he gone to tell the rest of the marauders well here i am in the library i should be doing my potions but really who cares it not as if fogarty ll read the silly thing anyway oh bollocks i have to do patrols tonight with james hmmm i dontknow if he ll be pleased to see me but i for one am dreading it seeing as what happened last time we met note to self reminder do not under any circumstances consciously admire head boy obvious physical attractiveness what a task i ve set for myself but hey i can still admire on a sub conscious level i love loop holes dorm room well that went it was i suppose interesting could explain it sort of i was right about remus telling the rest of the marauders james was a little weird about the whole thing tonight he didntquite know what to do or say quite funny really i dropped my stuff in the common room with rhi and met james at the portrait hole as i was leaving i smiled as he let me go through first and waited for him my first tip off was that he wasntwearing the usual grin as we started off in silence james seem to be brooding about something i thought it would be best to leave him be draco dormiens nunquam titillandus after all i could sense trouble when we got to the astronomy tower i hate having to check the astronomy tower there almost a guarantee that some idiot will be up there trying to wow his girlfriend with a romantic night under the stars gag note to self never let a boy take you to the astronomy tower as it is unimaginative and it a definite that you ll be busted what am i talking about no one of the male species is about to take me up there usually i get james to do the whole stop desist thing but he was off in another world so i had to do it that bloody ravenclaw prefect and his girlfriend ick ick ick ick that boy has an unusual fascination with this place i just pointed my lit wand at them out now james has sort of come to jacobson not again how many times do i have to tell you the astronomy tower is not your personal cocoon of love get out ten points from each of your houses the poor girl looked mortified you mean it not only 8 30 oh dear why do i sense that jacobson has been up to something no now get going before i give you both detention the girl turned furiously on jacobson we could hear her berating him all the way down the hall bloody jacobson well at least he talking now that something should we check the roof for anyone else he turned and smiled at me if by we check the roof you mean will i please check the roof then sure wait here i beamed at him as he disappeared up to the roof he catches on quickly this one at least he realised that i hate having to bust people i began to get worried i mean james was taking a while and i hadntseen anyone come down yet i decided to go up and see what he was up too james what are you doing is there anyone up here that when my heart leapt into my throat my palms started sweating and my eyes went very very big there was no one up there i nervously approached the edge of the tower and peaked over please please please let there be no tormented looking body at the foot of the tower hey james may annoy me beyond belief but i dontwant him dead no matter how many times i would actually like to kill him personally plus i dontthink the female population could handle losing one of the better pieces of eye candy it may destroy what little faith they have in the human race nope no body tormented or otherwise that a relief i can tell you the only problem now is where is the over grown idiot note to self never let patrols partner go on to the top of the astronomy tower alone you re practically assured of a heart attack i went back down into the tower and james was there looking around like he had lost a favourite toy or like me when i lose a my homework where have you been he immediately demanded from me well if that just doesntbeat all he disappears off the face of the earth and gives me a heart attack and then demands to know where i am the nerve of some people where have i been where have you been you went up to the top of the tower and didntcome back and when i went up there the place was deserted you scared the life out of me you over grown moron he has the decency to look a little ashamed too right he should stupid wanker oh right there was a couple of hufflepuffs on brooms that were hovering around the tower and were pretty pleased with themselves so i decided to give them a bit of a fright and jump onto one of their brooms and got them to land in here and yeah i stared at him as he trailed you jumped on to one of their brooms i asked incredulously are you completely insane what about if you didntmake it has he hit his head lately brain damage can be the only explanation i mean why else would someone jump from a tower to a broom with and i donteven want to think about how far down drop but i did i stared at him again and that makes it alright does it you re mad bleeding deranged completely out of your tree he was looking a little uncomfortable i was still in disbelief that he had leapt from the top of the tower onto a moving broom so i just walked out to continue the rounds james came running after me lily wait up i sorry please dontbe mad i wasntthinking and well the hufflepuffs are really getting on my nerves with their winning the quidditch cup nonsense i just looked at him quidditch cup nonsense i asked with a raised eyebrow he sort of paled a little well er what i meant was uh that their boasting and all i stopped him from his mumbling with a cheesy grin it all right i want to ring their necks most of the time too when they start on about how they re destined for the cup i mean who are they kidding they dontstand a chance against gryffindor i looked him in the eye you had better thrash them this weekend especially after that reckless dare devil stunt you just pulled i was smiling to show that i wasntreally serious or mad at him though why he would think i was mad at him is beyond me i thought he would just roll his eyes and tell me it was none of my concern what he does because to be honest it isntreally but still you cantjust go throwing yourself off towers willy nilly awaiting brooms or not so i take it you will be cheering gryffindor on this saturday good thing i good at reading code oh yes i ll definitely be cheering you on james dontyou worry about that nessa and tri would slaughter me if i tried any thing else james face fell a little bit plus i a gryffindor i want to see you lot wipe the floor with the hufflepuffs he brightened a bit well well well if it isntpotty and evans been in any broom closets lately or are we avoiding the wrath of the younger potty ugh peeves the idiot of a poltergeist note to self must discover some way of buying peeves so that he keeps his abnormally large misty nose to himself bugger off peeves we re on patrol yeah he ll really listen to that james now now no need to get narky peeves looks positively gleeful you know the bloody baron was around here earlier muttering about not wanting to be interrupted so i would be careful if i were you peeves the gleeful look just melted to one of upmost fear he mumbled something about catching students out of bed and zoomed away who knew he was so easily fooled but it says more about peeves fear of the bloody baron than anything else james is looking thoughtful again it definitely about that bloody rumour ugh i think i ve mentioned my intense dislike for awkward silences before and it was one of those moments when the awkward silence was overbearing i just had to break it knut for your thoughts james looked up only worth a knut are they i gave him a look what re you thinking about it seems to have you quite distracted he didntanswer and just kept looking off in space so i decided to bring up the subject we both knew was being avoided is this about that rumour about us and charlie i let out a little laugh it ridiculous you have to admit oh dear he giving me one of those looks you know those odd looks that are sort of sad and hopeless and make you feel guilty as hell as though you ve done something wrong not that i have done anything wrong that i know of anyway yes well it was a very weird look i thought i better explain what i was on about i mean charlie jealous of you no one who knows him would ever say that and as for being in love with me here i really did laugh i do believe he told me that it was easy to talk to me because i different and his charms tutor to put it nicely where as he been agonising over this greenly girl for weeks oh and did you know that being nervous is a foreign concept in your family charlie was bewildered by the fact that he got tongue tied and went red when he tried to talk to the girl i dontthink he ever had that problem before i looked over at james he seemed rather amused yeah well we do have a tendency to be slightly over confident i gave him a disbelieving look slightly over confident the poor boy looked as though he d been contacted by extraterrestrial beings james just looked at me rather confused what is this i cantsay anything in relation to muggle concepts with out half the people in this school looking at me like i mad he looked like he d never been so insecure before would you believe he didnteven realise he was nervous charlie just thought he was a weird creature from the black lagoon james smiled yeah well he always was a cocky little prat i raised an eyebrow as opposed to you a cocky big prat he laughed at that have you talked to him though about the whole dating thing and reassured him that it normal to be nervous great just great i sound like a broody mother hen because he even more paranoid about talking to melissa now because of this whole rumour thing poor little chap i beginning to think i really will have to say something to ms greenly to clear up the whole mess yes i did my brotherly duty as you so kindly put it but i ll talk to him again if you want me too thanks that would make me feel better i answered with a smile we reached the portrait hole and i went through first i said good night to james and i noticed that as i left he became rather serious and sober again i hope he isntto put out by the rumour thing or how lightly i taking it i mean those nosy fifth years came up with it and it is essentially ridiculous you know what though i cantwait till saturday i was serious about the hufflepuffs being used as floor rags if i have to listen to one more rant about the supremacy of the hufflepuff quidditch team at a prefects meeting i shall throttle someone and hopefully those extra quidditch practices will be worth it and then nessa tri daniel and the rest of the quidditch team will shut up about how gruelling they are but i do admire james for that he not willing to underestimate the opponent even though it probably all talk he still putting in the extra work just in case the hufflepuff team are half as good as they say speaking of james he definitely not too happy about something hopefully he ll snap out of it soon or else i shall be bored to tears on patrols usually i can at least have a semi decent and intelligent conversation about weird things now he just sulking and that gets boring extremely quickly well the quidditch match should cheer him up oh bollocks i forgot about my potions essay i better go do that now before i temped to go read the new soppy romance novel dana just finished what can i say i a sucker for romance note to self must find more suitable and substantial reading material as present reading material is turning me into a romantic sap i though a couple of fifth years acting all shy towards each other was sweet ugh kill me now and i happen to hate romantic sappage it also makes more susceptible to getting carried away with my own little dream world and a lap over between fantasy and reality seems to be created i really need to get that sorted out hey everyone arentyou glad to see me i mean i updated in what a week i have to say i pretty proud of my effort also i extremely proud of the fact that i now have over 1000 reviews thanks so much to everyone who has reviewed i really do appreciate the feed back about the story and how readers think everything is going i also happened across the new hits section of my account and my chocolate i got quite the shock according to the fanfiction recording system i have had approximately 1500 hits to chapter 34 alone well blow me done i had no idea how many people had actually looked at it but can i just say i truly appreciate the fact people are reading my story thank you to all that reviewed or read i ll update soon and dontforget r e v i e w absolute shocker by jamesroxmysox disclaimer i own nothing recognisable from the harry potter books or movies that belongs to j and warner brothers studios sunday 29th january library i hate potions i suppose to be doing a potions essay on a potion of my own choice that held some significance during the last great wizarding battle with grindwald or whatever his name was and then i have to say how it could be used in today society against the rise of voldemort i refuse to call him lord as he obviously made the whole thing up and i am not going to show him any sort of politeness let alone respect oh and that reminds me on friday the daily prophet reported mass muggle disturbances and tortures all claimed by old voldy and didntthat turn out to be such a lovely day first my favourite type of tea was missing and i had to trek all the way over to the ravenclaw table and had to fight off some stressed out seventh year for the tea pot that boy seriously needs a calming charm or something draught of the living dead anyone then i read about voldemort latest antics which by the way were rather distressing seeing as how comfortable his followers are going out in broad daylight to engage in a bit of muggle sport sickening really this was then followed by a lovely double period of potions someone up there really rather likes me now dontthey and the fun didntstop oh no as i was leaving the great hall at lunch i managed to walk straight into someone meaning i fell backwards as said person was rather tall and muscular and not at all effected by my bashing into them and all my stuff scattered across the hall fabulous absolutely bloody fabulous but of course that not all it just so happened that i slammed into james potter of all people who may i say did not seem at all happy to see me lying there staring up at him he actually seemed quite preoccupied with his thoughts and i dontthink he even recognised me but yes he quickly helped me up and went on his way in the still dazed state queer boy well no not in the sense that you re probably thinking there enough witnesses to account for that though given thought that would explain a lot my marvellous day didntend there though when i was coming out of the library on the way to dinner i found a couple 3rd year boys in an all out muggle punch up their wands lay forgotten by their bags it was a hufflepuff and a gryffindor and apparently they had come to blows over a disagreement about the outcome of the quidditch match tomorrow i the first to admit that i a shocking prefect but even i cantjust let it slide when i happened to walk in on two kids trying to smash each other brains in i had to act i gave them both detention and sent them on their way in opposite directions of course measly punishment i know but what can i say i lazy surprisingly though they took this as a form of kindness that i didnttalk to their heads of house this meant that i had to spend my friday night supervising a couple of third years scrubbing moaning myrtle toilet of course myrtle seemed to enjoy it you know vindictively throwing water every where and occasionally at the boys admittedly i egged her on though we actually got on quite well discussing a great number of things i think i shall have to schedule more detentions there when ever i get round to the whole prefect thing and actually punish bad behaviour myrtle makes it quite entertaining see i had a shockingly exhausting day it was no wonder that i slept in late the next day and having had enough of the twins and their quidditch fanaticism i charmed my bed curtains with a silencing spell and imperturbable charm i did not want to be hauled out of bed at 6 30 in the morning after my delightful day in the world of me this of course meant that i was late getting up and going down to breakfast which i have to say turned out to trigger a rather unfortunate series of events i was quietly making my way down to breakfast minding my own business admiring some of the more unusual painting subjects when i heard scuffling and groaning and all other things that indicate a fight is taking place well me being me i thought it would be best to let the frustrated students work it out between themselves i mean the hallways were deserted everyone was down at breakfast eagerly anticipating today quidditch match why not let the little cretins work things out for themselves well it made sense to me but for those who disagree you ll be happy to know i did indeed intervene alright so i had to intervene but i would have done so of my own free will eventually maybe if it didntmake me late for my date with a bacon and egg sandwich when i turned the corner they were right in front of me but i still acted in a surprisingly prefect like manner that must get me some credit surely anyway it was the two little toerags from the night before when i realised this i really was tempted to just keep on walking and let them finish each other off but then my conscience caught up with me and i blasted them apart they rounded on me both looking quite annoyed that their little get together had been interrupted the hufflepuff gave me a rather hearty glare well right back at you buddy i suppose i have to do the prefect thing now bugger what the hell do you think you re doing this question was met with silence did detention mean nothing to you again they both just stood there glaring at one another rather than me for which i have to say i was thankful is this really just over the quidditch or is there something else well i had to ask i mean really who repeatedly comes to blows over quidditch what do you mean just over the quidditch they both hollered gryffindors and hufflepuffs apparently i rolled my eyes right two nights of detention for you both next week you will be notified of your detention times by owl the gryffindor boy did not take to kindly to this what with all the homework i ve got you want to give me another two detentions he rather indignant about a punishment for someone who was just involved in two consecutive punch ups be grateful it isntmore the only reason you got off so lightly is that i have to supervise your detentions sweet merlin what have got myself into you wait till i tell james potter about this oooh i shaking in my furry little boots oh please don t the head boy will be ever so displeased that i actually performing my prefect duties i pleaded in my over dramatic damsel in distress voice would you believe the horrid little monster grinned at my sarcastic comment yeah but he might be annoyed about the fact that his girlfriend doesntsupport his quidditch team shouldntyou be down in the great hall giving him a good luck kiss not that he really needs it since it hufflepuff but any excuse will do why that cheeky little sod i was about to give him a good slap on the upside of the head but the hufflepuff beat me to it through out my exchange with the gryffindor the hufflepuff had looked torn between giving me a good thrashing and finishing what he started it appears that last quidditch related dig swayed his decision so here we are again the two third years desperately trying to cause each other as much pain as physically possible wands and magic completely forgotten quidditch brings out their primitive instincts anyway this time i really did get angry i started yelling and sounded suspiciously like my mother which of course just aggravated me further enough i blasted them apart again i really didntwant to have to do this but you re forcing me ten points from each of your houses for fighting in the corridors and now we are going to go see your heads of house i grabbed them both by the collar and hauled them off to see hufflepuff head of house professor williams she was in her office and just preparing to go down to the pitch when i knocked ms evans how can i help you professor williams asked with a cheery smile her welcoming smile slid off her face when she saw the two boys i was dragging behind me i explained how they had been caught fighting twice in two days with one detention already issued williams just thanked me and told the boy simone watts or something to sit next it was to see mcgonagall something i really wasntlooking forward to i looked at my watch nine forty five i had an hour and fifteen minutes to get down to the pitch hopefully mcgonagall would be feeling gracious and not rant about my prefect duties you better not make me late for the match i hissed at the gryffindor third year i think his name is greg carpale or something he just glowered up at me since i about a head taller than him and had my wand out i think he just saw it as reasonable to not retaliate when we reached mcgonagall office she opened the door just like professor william s rather cheery and pleasantly surprised and then her face fell when she saw carpale or whatever his name is mcgonagall raised her eyebrows what is the meaning of this ms evans i sighed greg here george the kid interrupted indignantly fine george was caught fighting with a fellow third year of hufflepuff twice in two days yesterday they were assigned detention and today they were caught trying to cause each other grievous bodily harm again oh dear she doesntlook happy hopefully she ll concentrate on greg here i mean george i was almost right i got the g thing were you the one to intervene in both their interactions ms evans oh bollocks yes professor here it comes i can see mcgonagall puffing herself up really ms evans you should have reported this type of behaviour to the young gentlemen heads of house immediately instead of letting this go unresolved what a wonderful couple of days i having now it time to appear caring rather than lazy i sorry professor i thought it was just pre match tension billowing over and that the boys would get over it i assigned them detention and thought that would be the end of it i didntthink there was a need to involve the professors please please please let her take that as an acceptable answer mcgonagall gave me a piercing stare before dismissing me and told campbell to have a seat i admit i was way off on the name thing but i have to deal with a number of little snot bags every day you cantexpect me to remember all their names but at least mcgonagall let me off by the time i got down to the quidditch pitch it was about ten to eleven i had ten minutes to find my friends in the crowd of what looked to be whole student body crammed into the quidditch stands i doubt culhwch could even do it and look what he accomplished to be with olwen mind you he had arthur knights to help him so maybe that not the best example there was no possible way i was going to find my friends even with the twins decked out like they usually are and reach them before the game started even then i had to count on them saving me a seat which wasntlikely considering they probably thought i wasntcoming seeing as they hadntseen me since dinner the night before but i decided to take a crack at it anyway very foolish i know but i had to at least try it was impossible to tell if was even going in the right direction of actual gryffindors as the majority of the stands were decked out in red and gold i mean usually it guaranteed that the slytherins as well as half the ravenclaws will support the hufflepuffs the rivalry between the slytherin and gryffindor houses is so great especially when it comes to quidditch the slytherins barrack for the opposing team just to nettle the gryffindors the ravenclaws on the other hand just like to be fair minded about things and support both teams as they get along just fine with both gryffindor and hufflepuff but today the hufflepuffs had pushed the rest of the houses a little too far the ravenclaws were well and truly fed up with being told that hufflepuff was going to slaughter them so today every single one of them were wearing gryffindor colours and cheering our team on just to spite the hufflepuffs even the slytherins were fed up they were glaring maliciously at the hufflepuffs and a few were even sporting gryffindor colours slytherins wearing gryffindor colours oooh the hufflepuffs have really done it this time what with their ridiculous carry ons about quidditch supremacy the chants banners and demonstrations just proved to be going a little to far even by quidditch fanatic standards i was just starting to lose all possible hope of sitting with a familiar face when i heard my name lily lily over here i turned around and there was nicholas fibonacci waving we over like a mad thing uh oh one thing worse than mad hufflepuff fans mad hufflepuff fans you know personally this does not look good i made my way over and smiled tentatively at his friends who all seemed nice enough considering i was wearing a gryffindor scarf and rosette hey lily well at least nick all chirpy i got a few hi and a couple of head tilts from the people he was sitting with hi i practically squeaked would you like to sit with us it just you seem to have lost your friends i hesitated for a moment and opened my mouth to politely decline when nick quickly interrupted dontworry we re not crazy quidditch fans we wonttry to bring about your death for being a gryffindor i looked at him for a moment i discovered you really cantsay no to those big blue eyes and was compelled to sit down next to him one person decked out in red in a sea of yellow but he was right the people up here were pretty relaxed and easy going true hufflepuffs anyway the real fanatics are down the front you can see ellen down there with terry those two are really wound up about this quidditch thing nick pointed down to the front of the stands i could indeed spot the curly brown haired girl who had previously given me her best glare the last time we met she was screaming something across the pitch at the other stands i followed her line of sight and found my friends all sitting up the very front bridget and dana appeared to be telling curly sue over here exactly what she could do with those pompoms of hers rhi and cam appeared to be bent over in laughter at the ridiculous bravo being exchanged i pointed this out to nick he laughed and pointed it out to the girl next to him nadia her name turned out to be and darren the boy sitting next to me both nadia and darren found this rather entertaining and before long the four of us were sitting there sniggering at the furious battle of words taking place across the pitch the fun really began though when the game began now i the first to admit that i know very little about quidditch but even i have to say that was a very good game the hufflepuffs were right when they said that their team had improved beyond recognition because in all honesty they had but mind you last year gryffindor beat hufflepuff 360 50 and it was over within two hours not really something hard to improve upon the game was excellent there was no foul play and there were no easy points for either team i can understand from this game why the fanatics act the way they do i myself am a football fanatic i love it both the english premiere league and the european competitions i took my friends to football game once they werentreally that impressed well bridget and dana were but for different reasons than myself apparently football players are much better looking than quidditch players i have to question that though there are some pretty fit looking quidditch players about but back to this game it was so much fun to watch i think that was partly due to the company i was sitting with darren was cracking jokes the whole way through about both sides and i was able to get into playful banter with the three of them about the superiority of our respective quidditch teams it was just a lot of fun towards the end of game the score was even the goals were few and far between and one team was only ever in the lead by ten points the pressure on the seekers was doubling with each passing minute nadia and i were having a competition of who could yell encouragement for our seekers the loudest and i proud to say i won that one mikey and malcolm hufflepuffs seeker took absolutely no notice of us but nick and darren thought it was just plain hilarious when we asked what was so funny they pointed to curly sue and the twins across the pitch nick composed himself enough to tell us that we looked just like the fanatics before bursting into a fresh round of laughter nadia and i both looked indignant for a moment before we caught each other eyes and started laughing just as hard as the boys we got quite a few curious looks for that there we were the four of us killing ourselves laughing while the rest of the crowd was going crazy looking for the snitch i think the cheshire cat sums it up quite nicely we re all mad here then quite suddenly the whole stands went deathly quiet mikey had gone into a dive and malcolm was racing up from the other end of the pitch people began squinting to spot the snitch trying to see where exactly mikey had fixed his eyes so resolutely the whole crowd started whispering about the snitch and who was going to get there first at the last second mikey pulled out of the dive and race off in the direction that malcolm had come from malcolm tried to follow but was quick enough to react and ploughed into the ground the crowd cringed for malcolm but soon all eyes were diverted to mikey who had charged through the chasers to the gryffindor goals next thing we know he holding his arm high in the air and landing the gryffindors exploded into cheers fireworks sparklers and rockets went off simultaneously the gryffindor quidditch team looked as if they one big blob of red i hate to think how mikey was feeling since he was in the middle i wonder if he could breath the ravenclaws are joyfully cheering and some are even consoling the devastated hufflepuffs the slytherins well to be truthful i canttell if the slytherins are depressed by the result of the game or happy about it half look as though they ve just swallowed a bowl full of doxy droppings and the other half are smiling smugly and taunting the hufflepuffs wait that not really out of the ordinary it completely normal actually nick darren and nadia applauded both teams and smiled sadly well we gave it our best shot i dontthink we did too badly at all said nick the final score was 350 210 with the capture of the snitch as the decider definitely an outstanding effort by both teams nadia sighed we never expected to win you know i gave her a disbelieving look well they did she indicated to the true fanatics at the front of the stands who all looked quite devastated but the rest of us were well aware that we could never beat potter team i just laughed to what size would james ego swell if he heard that i think i d rather not know oh well better luck next time i better go and congratulate the team thankyou for letting me sit with you and have a good night nick smiled any time lily congratulate potter and the rest of the team for us see you around i yelled good bye as i made my way to the pitch and i managed to run into mikey quite literally and hugged the life out of him he was quite chuffed with himself even when a crowd of fourth year girls came and mobbed him so last night the whole population of the gryffindor tower was a wee bit merry with the celebrations going on late into the night when i finally found my friends they seemed to have moved on to the fire whiskey stage of the evening i had got caught up talking to sophie baxter who was babbling away again about well in all honesty i didntreally listen doubt i could have understood her if i had i think she started on the fire whiskey earlier than most but apparently it was important anyway back to my friends dana and bridget were off dancing but nessa tri rhi and cam were siting on some couches when i made my way over nessa was the first to pounce and just where have you been miss evans she didntlook happy talking to sophie baxter she was rather happy to see me for some reason i trailed off trying to understand where this was leading nessa snorted why werentyou at the match where you off with some boy completely forgetting about your wonderful friends who happened to be playing against the bloody hufflepuffs her words slurred a bit so i guessing she d had a couple of fire whiskeys by the time i got there er nessa i was at the game i saw every one of the seven goals you scored and tri six goals nice faking around the keeper by the way she squinted at me for a second before nodding and turning back to her glass where were you then we didntsee you all morning or anywhere during the game asked cam oh well i slept in and then as i was coming down to breakfast i had to deal with those third years who were trying to do each other in again by the time i got down to the pitch i only had a couple of minutes before kick off then nick invited me to sit with him so i did there was a bit of silence after this nick as in nicholas fibonacci asked cam er yes nessa and tri both rounded on me you sat with the hufflepuffs oh dear yes but i was going for gryffindor we were just sitting together it not like i was barracking for hufflepuff we were even having arguments over who team was better the pair of them were so annoyed at me they couldntspeak oh and nick said to say congratulations from him some of the hufflepuffs really arentthat bad you know nick nadia and darren are all perfectly nice and very gracious losers they just got angrier the more i talked so i decided to shut up thankfully rhi decided to intervene before they could kill me you sat with nick fibonacci hell if he d invited me to sit with him i would have been there in a shot nessa and tri just glared at her i guessing ellen hicks wasntthere then cam commented ahhh cam my saviour always ready to swoop in and save the day though mind you he didnthave any problem with me sitting next to the hufflepuffs in the first place i knew there was a reason i liked him so much but he did start this off with the whole questioning of where i was so it only fair he gets me out of it no she was down the front i surprised you didntsee her dana and bridget were having a rather spirited argument with her across the pitch cam and rhi face lit up with surprise oh so that who it was should have know it to be some obsessive wacko like her we all started to laugh and pretty soon nessa and tri forgave me for my act of treason the rest of the night was spent recounting and arguing about the match dancing to sirius queer music and playing ridiculous drinking games which probably explains my lack of interest in my potions essay wait i should say my extreme lack of interest in my potions essay seeing as i was never really interested in the first place though i did talk to sirius at one stage last night and i do believe it was the one too many fire whiskey stage as i can remember it well enough to know there was a lot of laughter and some actual serious conversation which is escaping me at the moment but i sure it ll come back to me some time in the distant future right enough about my weekend lets get down to potions reading that i think i may reconsider myself as a lover of self inflicted pain i did tell aunt lizzie she off her rocker when she suggested that i bring most things upon myself but now that i willing to do potions homework i think she may have a point but it has to be done so let get on with it i was originally going to do poly juice potion but then i figured that most of the class would choose it the problem with that is that you have to do a lot more work and research to get a good mark so why not just do a mediocre job on some obscure little potion there nothing to compare it too making you look like you know what you re talking about that my philosophy and i sticking to it it got me through five and a half years of potions so far why should it fail now right off to find the most obscure unheard of little known potion this library possesses wish me luck monday 30th january charms well that was mortifying i ve just had breakfast and normally i dontwrite that much during first period charms but i feel this takes precedence over some silly little non verbal charm i ve had down since the end of last year my mother has just sent her response to my letter remus sent last week all i can say is that i am embarrassed beyond belief and that i think i should well and truly disown my brother how does will come in this you ask well being the little suck up he is and due to his infinite need to cement himself as the old bat favourite he and tuna are in a constant battle for this title will usually wins though he felt it necessary to show the silly woman how to use wizarding mail all wizarding mail can you see where i going with this i think you can a bloody mole could see where this was going this morning i was contentedly eating my breakfast all right not contentedly i was rather tired and grumpy seeing as i d had a late night with that sodding potions essay and then rhi got me up extra early muttering about extra time to get ready to look extra nice i sincerely hope she was referring to herself there as i most certainly didntdo anything to look extra nice wash my face put on school uniform put hair in pony tail collect books same as always though when i think about it she did give me a rather exasperated look but back to breakfast i was sitting there muttering into my tea thankfully i didntneed to wrestle any seventh years for it this morning reading the morning post when i caught sight of a silver owl coming my way what in the world is nemain doing here nemain is mother owl and is named after the irish goddess of battle who can supposedly influence the outcome of conflict by inspiring the combatants with fear or courage and i have to say nothing could be closer to the truth especially when she carrying a scarlet envelop first thing that came to my mind was run but before i had even put down my cup of tea nemain had landed in front of me with the letter dropped it off snitched a bit of bacon and was already flying back out the window that one smart bird wish i had the reflexes to act as quickly of course howlers dontlike to be left unopened so i had to open it if i didntwant to set the table on fire and quite frankly i was going to be attracting quite enough attention to myself with just the howler and decided that igniting school property would only cause more trouble so i opened the dreaded envelop my first thought i am so sending will one of these power radiating from the envelope was so strong that my hair was blown back and i could literally feel the waves of sound crashing down on me it was horrid she used her i extremely angry and you are grounded for the whole duration of all your remaining school holidays and possibly the rest of your life voice sort of like the cutting glass voice she used when she found out i hadntinformed her of remus and i attending the same school lillianna elizabeth evans how dare you address your mother in such a manner i almost fainted when i read your last letter never have i been shown so much disrespect by one of my own children even from you which is saying something lillianna ah yes the dysfunctional middle daughter who is always causing trouble yep that definitely me you always have to go one step further than the others dontyou your sister has never given me this much trouble i am trying to secure a suitable future for you and you fight me all the way oh wonderful she just had to include perfect petunia now didntshe william and henry have never behaved in such a manner just who do you think you are you little madam you will do your duty as my daughter and remus will accompany you to hogsmeade or you shall never see another football match again do i make myself clear as crystal she really knows where to hit me where it hurts now doesntshe dontyou bring your father into this he is not included in this discussion you will be courted by the lupin boy whether you like it or not of course the whole hall was staring at me rather strangely after the howler had finished every single face in the hall was turned in my direction most of them didntunderstand it but those that did gave me questioning looks with their eyebrows raised i refused to be openly embarrassed by my lovely mother words of endearment even though i was horrified beyond belief that she said half the things she did instead i simply took a sip of my tea brushed the remaining ashes of the howler onto the floor and went on to read the daily prophet enjoying some toast along the way meanwhile a majority of the hall was still staring at me in shock eventually they got bored since i hadntbroken down into tears or shown any form of reaction what so ever see being an ice queen with out emotion has it perks i was saving my mortification for a more private setting like our dorm room i donteven want to think about the amount of rumours that damn howler has started but i think it may have cemented the rumour regarding my promiscuity which is complete and utter poppycock considering i ve never been in a relationship sweet merlin this place is full of idiots dorm room well today been fun i managed to maintain my composure through out the school day and even wrote a polite note back to my mother that was completely free of profanity of any kind which is a miracle considering what i would dearly like to say to her it went something like this mother as much as i appreciate your opinion of my character and encouragement towards the development of the relationship between remus and myself i will kindly ask you to keep them to yourself as i have already stated i will not be engaging in a romantic relationship of any kind with remus lupin this is the end of the discussion lillianna p s about the football i d like to see you try okay so i got vindictive towards the end with the postscript but come on she was asking for it i mean she entered perfect petunia into the discussion the whole of hogwarts is now aware of the fact that i am the dysfunctional member of my family a fact i would have preferred to keep private i get enough weird looks around here as it is as i was saying i managed to maintain my composure through out the school day and even lasted through out dinner after dinner well that a different matter bridget had a date and was slinking off to find a nice broom closet somewhere i warned her about the third floor broom closet and i believe dana was going to go charm some clever ravenclaw into doing her history of magic essay the rest of my friends were just going to retire to the common room to do their homework this suited me perfectly it meant i could vent my frustrations in our empty dorm room and believe me i did just that as soon as i shut the door i threw my bag down ditched each of my shoes at the opposing wall and screamed my lungs out i then proceeded to trash the dormitory all the while screaming profanities at my mother and hoping that she could through some mystical act divine intervention hear me alas my mother did no hear my thoughts on the matter at hand the common room however heard a good deal of the screaming thumping and smashing so much in fact that amy came up to investigate what the bleeding hell is going on up here amy demanded as she came bursting in through the door i was in the middle of punching the stuffing out of my pillow when amy came in imaging it to be either my mother or will in all honesty i couldntquite make up my mind which one i wanted to hurt more i looked up at her with adrenaline and rage still coursing through me amy took a step back must have been the deranged homicidal look that had taken over my face oh it you lily she gave me a pitying look well try to keep it down we can here you all the way down in the common room she started to leave and then stopped by the way remus is looking for you he down in the common room and with that she left me to my thoughts i quickly composed myself and said a quick spell to return the room to its original state i then made to follow amy down to the common room as i was about to round the corner to the common room amy voice floated up to me i certainly wouldntlike to upset her she looked about ready to kill when i walked in if that what she can do with just her physical strength imagine what she could do with a wand then a different voice answered her she certainly has a temper hey that james they must be doing heads stuff i got a pang of guilt there for disturbing the rest of the tower a temper lily can make a hungarian horntail look positively friendly i d hate to be on the wrong end of her wand sirius well he certainly thinks highly of me leave off her mum an over bearing cow i thought you of all people would appreciate that sirius have i ever mentioned how much i love cam well i restating it that boy is truly a wonder yeah what would you feel like if your mum continually compared you to your perfect elder siblings and then tried to force you to marry someone you d be slightly put out as well nessa such a doll there was a pause in the conversation and i took that as my que to enter none of them noticed me enter amy and james were bent over their work sirius and cam were engrossed in a game of chess while nessa and tri were engrossed with one another rhi and peter were the only ones actually doing homework i spotted remus reading by the window and silently made my way over i sunk into the chair opposite him and waited for him to notice which didnttake very long i believe he just finished the sentence he was on before he put down his book and smile softly at me feel better you certainly made a bit of noise i blushed feeling that pang of guilt again yes actually i do i looked out the window admiring the last of the winter snow remus what did i do to deserve this no matter what i do i can never live up to her standards and now she wants to push me into some society approved match i continued to stare out the window more watching the reflections in the glass this time no offence though you re a great guy it just that i dontthink i could ever feel that way about you no i definitely couldntthink of remus in any other way other than platonic and i certainly wasntgoing to back down from what i believed in just to make my mother happy dontworry lily i know what you mean i can only think of you as a little sister we sat in silence for a while the mere company of someone who understands even slightly how i feeling comforted me what are we going to do she isntgoing to stop here you know that howler was just the beginning remus sighed and took my hand dontworry we ll deal with it later but you dealt with that howler very well today your mother would have been astounded by the new level of disrespected i laughed a little bit yeah the old bat would not be happy about the fact that i completely ignored her message i think it would be best if we both went to bed and dealt with this in the morning i nodded my agreement and said goodnight before returning to our dorm well let just hope that what ever the old bat has in store for us will be a while coming and that reminds me i have to address the problem of my appalling older brother who is yet to learn the concept of sibling loyalty wednesday 1st february library i really need to have a talk to this melissa greenly girl charlie still in his mode of depression wallowing in self pity that miss greenly wontgo near him yesterday i had to put up with his moping during his tutoring session which i have to say are becoming far less necessary i do believe my incessant nagging about wand movement is finally paying off but i suppose i should count myself lucky as yesterday mikey decided to join us the fourth years have a particularly difficult essay to write on summoning and banishing charms mikey is actually pretty good at charms he was there half for help and half as charlie moral support once charlie went off to find some books mikey told me how charlie just been too embarrassed to talk to melissa because of the whole infatuation with his charms tutor rumour while she far to nervous to talk to him as she thinks that he doesntactually like her but is infatuated with me due to said rumour and doesntwant make a fool of herself fourth years really are queer little creatures mikey has tried to talk sense into them both but they just wontlisten speaking of listening i er accidentally over heard something i shouldnt and i truly mean it when it was accidental i had no intention of listening their voices just happened to be rather loud which is so not my fault okay so i could have blocked my ears but i didnt okay so i listened to what was said but i didntintentionally eavesdropped i just sort of stumbled across the conversation well i went to find a book for my fourth year charges well more left mikey to try and talk a little sense into charlie however as i was wandering aimlessly through the charms section i heard that dreaded voice no it wasntmadam pince come to hunt me down for defacing one of her precious books it was worse far worse i heard sophie baxter chattering away with one of her friends at the end of the aisle my heart started beating a thousand times a minute and my palms were instantly slick with sweat ever since the beginning of the term she been trying to talk to me i have a sneaking suspicion it has something to do with last term and the whole thing with james something that is being suppressed into the back of my mind until a suitable time arises in which i can assess the situation properly personally i hoping never anyway so i was absolutely terrified of sophie i did the best i could to blend into the books buy concealing my face behind a rather large copy of charms for nacies dontask and leaning as far back into the bookshelf as the books behind me would allow i would have cast a concealment charm on myself but alas i left my wand on the table bollocks all round so there i am trying very hard to be inconspicuous when suddenly i hear a whispered conversation going on behind me are you sure it okay to talk in here i mean wasntlily supposed to be in here today my ears instantly pricked when i heard my name now just who was talking about me and more importantly what were they doing having secret meetings yeah but she presently trying to coax charlie out of his pit of despair with the help of michael tuttle so she quite preoccupied pft shows just how little these people know so about hogsmeade oooh is this a secret lovers rondeau has everything been arranged we re all meeting in the three broomsticks at 5 o clock no rondeau then yeah i told every one i just have to convince our subject into letting me play oh merlin beard is that you lily oh chocolate sophie found me i spent the next 10 minutes fending her off she quite persistent that she speaks to me sober i managed to get away after telling her that i really needed to get back to tutoring and promising to find her later hmmm yes i fully intend to keep that appointment the really annoying part was i didntget to here the rest of the conversation but i almost positive after much analysis that it was in fact remus and rhi whispering behind the bookcase i wonder what those two are up to actually i not sure i want to know and i didntget a chance to interrogate them at dinner as nadia had invited me to sit with her i was in library after class looking up a book for that blasted transfiguration i swear i shall never truly get the hang of that subject i have to stay two weeks ahead of schedule just so i have time to practice the spells correctly so i dontmake a fool of myself in class i really should do this for potions but i cantbe bothered so i was just trying to find a book on advanced self transfiguration when i bumped into nadia literally i was walking backwards yet again along the bookshelf searching for one book in particular when i collided with nadia who had been standing there minding he own business of course we got into conversation and it seems that she finds transfiguration just as horrid as i do she also assured me that transfiguration in 7th year just gets more intricate and fiddly lovely just what i needed to hear in my hour of need but i did indeed end up having dinner with the hufflepuffs and they re all quite nice well no curly sue isntthat nice she was glaring at me again but the rest of them were very welcoming considering gryffindor just flattened them on the weekend they were extremely welcoming but i was given a few pointed glares from the gryffindor table mainly the twins as they are still contriving ways in which they can sink their claws into nick i got quite the talking to for sitting within nick vicinity and not inviting dana and bridget though bridget and star boy seem to have become involved in this continuously confusing on off relationship which it appears no one truly understands not even them so mainly it dana pursuing nick bridget just drools you know the library is becoming my second home i spend almost every night in here mainly because it has all the resources i need to complete my homework but also because it quiet something the gryffindor common room is never described as imagine trying to get the 4th years to shut up and quit their yelling impossible plus all the stressed out fifth and seventh years give the place a tense feeling not exactly a comfortable working environment at the moment i am trying to do this insufferable star chart and accompanying essay on the relevance of jupiter many moons well in truth the chart isnthard at all it more the stupid essay why oh why did i have to choose astronomy as one of my newt subjects because i an idiot that why but mind you i doing seven newt subjects so i really must have something loose hey there james i wonder what he doing in here usually he in the common room or proclaimed awol by amy and his friends more amy than the rest f the marauders you know i haventtalked to him in a while we have rounds every week but most of the time we just prattle and make bets about who we ll find in which broom closet or else we just leave each other to our thoughts he quite all right really james i mean once you over look some of his more pricky attributes he quite nice and i ve never denied the fact that he one of the finer male specimens he just so damn fine oh god listen to me i sound like some i dontknow love sick fool this is happening rather a lot and i dontlike it i think i shall have to put a stop to this mooning over one james potter it not healthy oh crapolla he coming over what do i do for a start i think i should maybe put this diary away and look busy with my star chart completely innocent and like i was just contemplating his better points me contemplate james potter better points never not in a million years my chocolate i canteven lie to myself that has to make me one of the worst liars in all the world hey lily aaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh better get that star chart out hi everyone surprise it me jen back from the dead well actually the real world but never mind that since we last met i have completed my tertiary entrance exams graduated from high school gone on holiday with the rest of my peer group and got myself a job when you look at it like that it almost seems as though i have accomplished something well i extremely sorry i ve taken so long to update i ve been lazy i admit i also extremely sorry this chapter isntproof read my beta has gone awol by the way hi amy if you read this anyway yes the next chapter should be up shortly but till then i hope your enjoying the holiday season please remember to r e v i e w absolute shocker by jamesroxmysox disclaimer i own nothing recognisable from the harry potter books or movies that belongs to j and warner brothers studios thursday 2nd february ancient ruins ugh dontyou just hate plants well i for one dontlike them well more like williams special trees evil creatures i just brushed past it while on my way to collect more manure and wham it lashes out and tries to strangle me pulling me forcefully towards its dense foliage as if i about to let it get me any where near those creepy looking shadows i did what any sensible person does when attacked by a maniac tree screamed my head off till someone rescued me i would have rescued myself had i had my wand but as i said i was innocently collecting fertiliser i didntrealise there was deadly trees lurking in the shadows just waiting to harm innocent girls had i known i would of course been appropriately armed and wary but as it is i had to be escorted to the hospital wing cam shaking his head interrogating me the whole way as to why i went near the blasted tree and lecturing me about how i should have know better seeing as the tree was in greenhouse 3 and therefore must be dangerous well i sooo sorry that i not as magically up there when it comes to plants as you cameron davies but we must keep in mind i grew up in the muggle world and trees in the muggle world do not attack innocent bystanders idiots rosie was having a right giggle at my freshly bruised and winded state i surprised i could scream at all the way that blasted plant was trying to squeeze the life out of me yes well rosie seemed to enjoy it see i told you i provide daily entertainment for my classmates no that i want to provide entertainment for that particular classmate when i was in the infirmary i met sirius apparently he pushed remus a little too far with his teasing suggestions and he paid dearly for it his face looked as though it was suffering a bad case of tinea to put it mildly sirius was rather distressed about his face resembling foot fungus read that as sirius was yelling for wilks to hurry up with a potion of some kind to make him bacteria free remus had steadfastly refused to turn him back wilks was threatening to cast a silencing charm on him and leave him for the rest of the day when we came in she compromised and left him to wallow in misery while attending to me all the while giving me friendly advice on how to avoid these situations really miss evans i dontknow how you manage these things touching a dangerous plant what were you thinking i dontknow what i going to do with you i dontknow who i see in here more often you or mr black yes i coming black stop whining of course i just did what i normally do and look up at her in a would be attentive manner my eyes sliding out of focus and an expression that clearly states the lights are on but nobody home takes over my face wilks sent cam back to class and refused to let me go until break i swear that woman purposely keeps me from my classes most normal school nurses would cure you and send you back to class as quickly as possible but no wilks has to different purposely prolonging my stays in her domain i confronted her about this last year and she said she did it for my own benefit as i was far too stressed well that may have been the case last year but this year i as mellow as they come okay so maybe not but compared to last year it not that big a stretch last year was my owl year i was taking 11 subjects i was a prefect i had to deal with new bodily developments i was a rather late bloomer much to my relief i thought i was going to remain an androgenous blob forever but that fear was soon replaced with the where the hell did that come from feeling not pretty i can tell you of course i was stressed this year though i am only doing seven subjects and i taking it as a break year before i really freak out about my newts which i must say i not looking forward too so really wilks has no excuse to keep me here silly woman so there i was stuck in the infirmary with star boy still whining away about his festering face wilks disappeared somewhere saying she had to find a potion this seemed slightly suspicious as i was staring at a cabinet full of potions personally i think she just wanted to make sirius suffer yes wilks was my favourite person for the full two seconds it took me to realise that i was alone with said whining sirius and he decided to strike up conversation then i decided that she was a self serving wench who delighted in my torture wilks wilks get back here and put me right my face my gorgeously handsome face he so very deep and profound considerate of other people too i didnteven get a so lily how you feeling he just kept whining about his face finally it became clear to him that wilks wasntcoming back for a while and sirius became sullen that was when i decided to be compassionate i tell you this hospital wing does queer things to my head first i comforted rosie the most evil cow known to man and now i consoling the king of chauvinism yep there definitely a wire shorted out in that screwed up place called my mind it not that bad sirius i mean you ll be back to your normal self soon enough he glared at me for a moment the way things are going i could be like this for days well that was over dramatic and that matter how i got an incredulous look for that question okay so yes i would have been freaking out as well but that beside the point the point is that i get to take the moral high ground in this situation very unusual for me what it not like it effects your health it a purely superficial aliment sirius continued to just stare what do you mean it doesnteffect my health it affects my health in a number ways uh huh and just how does it affect your health it affects my sexual health for a start it ll ruin my libido he declared dramatically can you say over share speaking of sexual health james suffering rather badly ugh i gagged so bad i almost choked on my own saliva what is with this boy i mean really you dontjust go spurting out this sort of thing to random strangers well i may not be a random stranger but i dontknow sirius or james nearly well enough to be provided with this information actually when i think about it no matter how well i ever know either of them i should never be provided with this information it just weird what can i say i grew up in a household where the sex word has never been discussed openly or at all for that matter it was my turn to stare incredulously at sirius what he asked with an air of innocence i just thought maybe you should be aware of that i opened and closed my mouth multiple times doing an excellent impression of a gold fish but completely unable to say anything i not sure what got me more what sirius actually told me or the fact that he felt comfortable telling me this i thinking it was the whole comfort level obviously i ve missed something rather important in the development of our relationship which has seemingly been taken to a whole new level the only question is when did this development occur well i thought after our little talk during the quidditch celebrations everything should be out in the open oh well that explains why i dontremember christ i must ve been out of it wait he actually remembers that when i voiced this thought he gave me an astonished look you don t to be truthful in a word no care to refresh my memory i asked hopefully sweet merlin you re a cheap drunk hey i am a lot of things but not cheap just because not all of us have iron clad stomaches that can withhold indefinite amounts of alcohol plus how on earth would he know how much i ve had to drink unless of course he dragged me into one of his deranged drinking games however it entirely plausible i dragged him into said deranged drinking games i was just about to tell him what i thought of his comment when wilks came back she gave sirius his potion and he was out the door once his face returned to it usual flawless self he was off with a swift cheerio before wilks could so much as say boo i really have to work on my reflexes had i been as fast as sirius she would never have had time to order me to stay till break and then i wouldnthave been exposed to the ramblings of star boy ugh why oh why did i have to enter into conversation with sirius of all people and what he said about james well i have no idea what our conversation was about on the weekend but i am hoping that sexual health was not a subject that was breached oh bollocks i have rounds with james tonight i think i going to turn into a giant tomato for a majority of the night speaking of james yesterday was actually pretty good james was writing some essay on alfred for care of magical creatures remus and peter had already done their bit sirius was a lost cause he was too preoccupied flirting with michelle lambert for the time being which is probably why he got so upset about the face fungus i still haventmanaged to wok out what bridget and he have going james said that he thought i might like to keep him company seeing as i too was writing an essay and i still owe him multiple favours i had almost forgotten about those it was actually quite fun and i got all my work done which was entirely surprising for me seeing as i usually procrastinate until the night before and then stay up to the wee hours of the morning why do it now when i can do it later james was heaps of fun to hang out with it was almost like the christmas ball never happened except for that damned tingly feeling that makes you feel all warm and gooey and well all that mushy romantic crap i read about i really will have to find some new reading material it starting to have a drastic impact on my reality saturday 4th february the three broomsticks my mother if i can call her that is the most vile most heinous most evil oooooh the things i would like to say about her but i will not waste my breath or my ink on such a creature i shall never talk to that thing so long so long as i live and even in the after life and when i reincarnated as a cockroach i shall never speak to her again not that cockroaches can talk i wonder if their brains even have the capacity to recognise and differentiate individuals wait do their brains even have the capacity to breach such subjects as reincarnation and past lives oh dear this is making my head hurt i think well return to the subject of my saturday far less tiring more painful but not nearly as much effort required you will never believe what that thing did never in a million years would i have believed it if anyone had told me or forewarned i would have told them they were off their rocker actually i believe remus did warn me at some stage but i thought not even my mother would sink that low how very wrong i was i suppose i should explain what the hell is going on you know i really should have expected something like this seeing as i never did get an answer back from my last note i sent mother dearest and when i get a hold of will he so dead they ll have to use dna samples to identify him family identification and dental records will be of no use when i through with him the festering little maggot never even warned me when i woke up this morning i was in a wonderfully elated mode it a hogsmeade weekend and i would be spending the day with rhi cam and dana the others had romantic interests to attend to but we were going to met later i swear it has something to do with the three broomsticks at seven as remus and rhi discussed not that i said anything i was just waiting to see how things panned out this morning rhi was in one of her giggly bubbly let s annoy lily to death moods she insisted upon picking out an outfit for me seeing as i refused to get up at whatever unmentionable hour she had deemed acceptable weekends are made for sleeping and homework i think my dorm mates need to be reminded of this once i did get up had a shower i wore whatever it was rhi picked out for me because a there was no green in sight and b i honestly couldntbe bothered mucking around looking for something to wear rhi then tried to play barbie dolls with me and do my hair and make up i told her quite politely well for a morning person who hasntyet had her tea anyway to go away and that she would be doing no such thing it went much along the lines of sod off rhi before i hex you into next week which we both know is a definite possibility little did i know darling rhiannon had been looking up her beauty spells two flicks of her wrist and i had on soft make up and my hair was half pulled back and tamed significantly i could have smacked her one i fact i gave it quite the shot i chased her all round the dorm and then down to the common room verbally abusing her and her personal attributes the whole way in the common room rhi managed to find refuge behind the marauders who had come down looking annoyingly bright and perky for this early in the morning rhiannon grey you undo whatever silly little charms you put on me before i use another silly little spell to hang you up by your ears my my we do have a temper on us this morning and when you look so radiant too bloody sirius not now sirius i have bigger issues to deal with would that bigger issue be the darling little creature currently using me as a human shield questioned remus i glared at rhi who was peaking over remus and james shoulders yes that would be my bigger issue now if you would oh so politely move aside so i can appropriately strangle the darling little creature it would be immensely appreciated the whole lot of them were looking rather amused by this time sorry lily pilly but we cantallow such acts of violence to be carried out so undeservingly right in front of us especially not on helpless damsels answered peter and with that the marauders as one escorted rhi to the portrait hole and ultimately safety i shot them some evil looks before returning upstairs to retrieve my cloak and money for hogsmeade rhi already had hers and she wouldntbe returning to our dormitory till later tonight that meant there was no point waiting for her to get revenge i can probably manage that in hogsmeade anyway when i came back down the stairs james was waiting for me i gave him a questioning look and he merely replied with a charming smile and some guff about rhi not being the only damsel in need of an escort i decided to humour him and let him link my arm with his own everything was going swimmingly until we got to the entrance hall the image that met james and i is forever burned into my memory it wasntuntil we were about a third of the way down the stairs that i realised something was up standing in the middle of the entrance hall was a an exasperated looking albus dumbledore a very frustrated remus lupin a nervous and extremely ruffled vivian lupin and one highly annoyed elizabeth marie evans i of course stopped dead when i saw them james didntcatch on straight away but soon understood when he got a look at the small party of people waiting at the foot of the stairs it appeared my mother was having a rather heated discussion with dumbledore and i hate to think what it was about i finally found my voice when i realised what she was about to say mother well that certainly caught her attention i mean it not every day you hear mother in a boarding school as a form of addressing someone unfortunately i was in a state of shock and had not yet let go of james arm i also had yet to get rhi to reverse her lovely little spells so you can imagine what conclusion my mother scandalous mind immediately jumped to lillianna so this is why you refuse to go be courted by remus is it she indicated to james with a head tilt when she said this i quickly made my way down the rest of the stairs james following closely behind me what are you doing here i asked completely ignoring her question and insinuation i am here to force you to fulfil your duty as my daughter which you are otherwise refusing to carry out of your own free will i really shouldnthave asked but you know me i really cantstop myself when it comes to her which probably explains why i reacted the way i did next i am not going to be courted by remus and i am not going to marry him why cantyou get that through your seemingly impossibly thick skull well that of course went down an absolute treat the result was an all out now famous evans vs evans shouting match the likes of which hasntbeen seen since around the easter of my fourth year our dulcet tones where heard through out the castle many have since commented on my impressive lung capacity and ability to raise my voice to such heights how nice of them to point that out my mother of course made her case and barbs based on entirely false information and that of her own imagination apparently james is a very good match being head boy and all but it depends entirely on his family as to whether or not he up to standard i apparently know how to pick them i was informed that edward drakefield was really an arse and that i was perfectly right to refuse him turns out he and morgan le fay there had been getting it off with one another for quite a few months i couldnttell if my face was red from anger or shame half of hogwarts came out into the hall to see what all the commotion was about of course the majority had no idea what was going on but ever since i have been told with increasing frequency how alike my mother and i are how lovely just what i want to be compared to a heartless shrew it got to the point where we were no longer just arguing over my dating remus other things were getting dragged up such as my avoidance of makeup and my choice of clothing both of which she commented had improved with james company i believe the nanny incident was even dragged up again i ended up shouting all kinds of obscenities at her before storming out of the hall to hogsmeade i was only dimly aware of the fact that dumbledore was talking to her and trying to restore calm i was still seeing red and i didnteven notice that someone followed me out of the hall i was in a god awful temper when i left the hall and stormed all the way down to hogsmeade and plopped myself down in the three broomsticks readying myself for a good sulk so you can imagine my surprise when someone slipped into the seat next to me i mean most students would be having breakfast before they came to the village and anyone who sat next to me after that little display up at the castle is clearly deranged yep i was right the person who sat next to me was deranged james potter the boy is infinitely screwed up in the head i stared at him like complete nutter he is he however just looked back evenly at me a sympathetic smile on his face he mumbled something about letting me think and then went to get some drinks so of course i promptly whipped out my handy dandy notebook that is this diary and proceeded to let out all my frustrations which was surprisingly therapeutic aunt lizzie was actually right about this whole write down and release your feelings thing but wait a second james has been gone an awfully long time to just be getting drinks hmmm he must be up to something the pub is relatively quiet at this time in the morning i can make out james messy head at the bar but as to what he doing oh look here he is now sweet merlin my opinion of that boy has just increased ten fold james is carrying a tray with a rather large plate of chocolate chip cookies and what i suspect is a pot of my favourite tea i am now suspicious of his mortal status because this is an act worthy of an upgrade to guardian angel oh the cookies are fresh i can smell them heaven right that it james potter is officially my favourite person for the moment now about those cookies girls dorm for a day that started out so exceedingly awful i had a wonderful time james was all supportive and light hearted and practically forced me into having fun which i did it did nothing to squash the mushy romantic feelings that have been multiplying in the pit of my stomach if anything it encouraged them stupid feelings but anyway those cookies james got from madam rosemerta tasted as good s they smelt which was pretty good considering i was drooling from the mere smell of them the tea was just as i suspected my favourite and it was never so calming or more enjoyable i think madam rosemerta may have slipped me something to help with the calming the removal of those stupid beauty spells helped as well james apparently knew the counter curse the entire time but only just decided to reveal this knowledge after the encounter with the thing as i ve taken to referring to her and i must say my hair going back to it usual disastrous state was incredibly reassuring see not everything changes my hair is still stubbornly unmanageable it was also a relief to get rid of the crap on my face the mascara makes my eyes itchy james decided to lighten things up a bit after my feast of cookies and tea and took me to zonko s that was a lot of fun seeing as james knows the guy behind the counter and we got to test a few of the products on unsuspecting customers i also bought a few things to send to harry seeing as he wants to come here so bad okay so a bought him a lot of things with the intention of him using them at home and annoying the thing all the more but well he sure to enjoy himself and if i happen to derive a little enjoyment from the knowledge that he reeking havoc all the better it a very passive aggressive way of doing things which is bound to rack me up some bad karma points but it ll be worth it as i ve said before my ego is a proud little creature and doesntdeal well with public humiliation but i did have a lot of fun today with james we had fun running around like idiots in the rain and jumping in all the puddles i got him a good one to it splashed him all the way up his side to his elbow he ended up completely drenched from the waist down i on the other hand managed to stay a little bit drier admittedly i wasnt that much drier but i was still drier i was merely spattered with rain rather seeing as james didntmanage to inflict a wave of water on from one of the surrounding puddles james mentioned how he always end up completely filthy after spending time with me i think he mentioned both the mud incident and the food fight incident what can i say we both have highly competitive natures plus it so much fun so yes my hogsmeade visit was surprisingly eventful the only thing is i didntsee my friends all day well that was to be expected for half of them but i thought i would at least glimpse cam rhi or dana well maybe not so much dana seeing as she was probably stalking nick or something similar but still the complete absence of my friends worries me more for my own well being than anything else they get up to mischief when i leave then alone at the moment nessa in the shower that was the first thing she did when she came up the stairs earlier commandeered the bathroom as for the rest of them well i have no idea what they re up to oh wait here they are rhi dana and bridget have just made their entrance dana is now demanding nessa give up the bathroom and bridge is gushing to rhi all about her day with star boy wait i think she was out with star boy today i ll just ask nope today it was roger cooper from hufflepuff apparently he quite the catch and quite the gentleman does sirius know about this yes and he didntseem too phased seeing as he was escorting some 5th year gryffindor but he was a bit more aggressive than normal when he and bridget met in the three broomsticks that afternoon i donteven want to know what bridget meant by the aggressive comment oh dear i shouldnthave asked about her day now she inquiring about mine well making assumptions is a more accurate description of the teasing that taking place so lily did you have a good time with james today i dontlike the way bridget said james it was kind of unnerving er fun she just smirked at me i sure it was you two always seem to have fun when you re together now i really dontlike the way she said that yeah cam and i saw you and james out in the rain it good to see you finally found someone who enjoys the rain as much as you do oh great now rhi joined in thank the chocolate lords dana loves her showers yeah even nick commented on how well you two are suited when i was talking to him i believe you were jumping in puddles by that stage and james was trying to kill you for soaking him i spoke too soon the three of them have now decided to join ranks and pester me about my day you know remus and i were conspiring to set you up for an evening on your own but then your mum showed up and well he went after you and you spent the day together so really things worked out better than expected see i knew it i knew she was up to something this would be why i can never leave them by themselves my friends are far too devious for their or should i say my own good i glared at rhi i knew you were up to something those bloody beauty spells were over kill rhi just beams at me well at least you re catching on i see you re no longer plagued by them did you finally work the counter curse out i really didntwant to admit that james was the one to undo them for me i mumbled no what was that lily we couldntquite hear you they know perfectly well i dontknow the counter curse fine i said no i do not know the counter curse james kindly got rid of your stupid charms for me they all just smile gleefully at me i hate you that was met with laughter we love you too banana bridget yells as i stalk out of our dorm stupid friends monday 6th february herbology i think i may end up killing my friends they haventlet up about the james thing for some merlin only knows reason they seem to think that if they keep dropping hints about how wonderful james is and how happy we make each other that will some how encourage me to fall head over heels for him hate to break it to you lovelies but i dontneed any help in that department i managing to do that just fine on my own why does james have to be so damn wonderful why but you would think that after five and half years of friendship they would have figured out by now my natural resistance to authority one of my major character flaws is my abhorrence of being told what to do another is my stubbornness both seem to have gone completely over the heads of beloved friends if they were to just leave me a lone i could work things out for myself but no not them they have to shove it in my face as if that will make it all the more clearer idiots if you order me to pick up a bunch of books that have fallen over i will probably tell you to shove them up a not so nice orifice but if you were to ask me to pick up the books or better yet just not say anything at all i would most likely automatically pick up the books dust them off and arrange them in alphabetical order as is my nature so as you can see they were coming at this james thing from the completely wrong direction by being so pushy about it they just trigger my natural reaction that comes about when ever any one tells me what to do i have this overwhelming urge to tell the stupid sod to bugger off and annoy some other unfortunate soul though i am thankful that none of my friends have mentioned the thing well not to me anyway they have decided to completely bypass the whole affair they all saw it and witnessed the screaming match i saw their slightly shocked faces in the front row of the crowd though i think it was due to my ability to shout as loudly as i did rather than who i it was aimed at so they know what happened but appear to have come to an agreement not to bring it up in my presence the marauders have also ignored the situation mind you they ve witnessed these screaming matches before so they werentshocked in the least they re just getting on with things as normal i plan to catch up with remus today and see what happened after i left and i have to thank james as well oh great caring for those stupid trees today william just gave me a significant look while explaining how delicate they are and how we must be gentle while handling them oh yes i ll be sure to be gentle with it i ll carefully cut it limbs off with a chain saw before tenderly gouging it heart out with the hedge pruners oh yes i will be ever so gentle with those adorably sweet trees hmmm reading over the last couple of lines i d say i have a few anger management issues the tree hugging hippies that hold protests down at the local shire at home would be horrified to read my intentions for that tree even if it does attack innocent bystanders they are after all the original landowners and caretakers of the earth i all for the environment and all but these people are over the top even by my standards and i really shouldntcal them tree hugging hippies even though they call themselves that they re environmentalist that would like to think of themselves as hippies i met one once and he was the biggest walking contradiction i ve ever met and considering i myself am a bundle of inconsistencies you know the guy was truly screwed up in the head when it came to ideals and rules to live by i not saying all environmentalists are just these ones oooh look it raining i love spring all the snow melts and everything gets really damp and lush uh oh williams is less than pleased with me it seems my staring out the window at the rain was brought to her attention by the fact that the tree she placed in front of me was moaning and looking forlorn like a kicked puppy drama queen wait one cotton pick en minute she gave me that tree if i not mistaken and i pretty sure i not the tree in front of me would be that the one that damn near killed me williams has realised i just noticed the identity of the tree sweet merlin that sounds so wrong how does a tree have an identity oh god now she waffling on about how we have to reconcile our differences it a tree a blasted tree i dontthink it even capable of intelligent thought beyond squeezing things to death let alone understanding as complicated an issue as reconciliation most fully functioning people dontunderstand the notion why would a tree dear lord i actually taking this seriously i think i need to go see madam wilks oh dear i think it getting worse i can actually make out figures running around in the rain i hallucinating i wonder if i coming down with something oh wait it okay it just the marauders i not hallucinating after all that really had me worried for a moment williams has just seen james sirius and peter out in the rain she gone off to shout at them but not before telling me that that blasted tree had better look a whole lot happier when she got back as if i going tend to the needs of suck up drama queen tree oh christ i really am losing it i now resenting a tree i ve gone over the edge hey there remus why isnthe outside with the rest of his motley gang wait the marauder dontusually get themselves into trouble unless they have some other purpose i wonder what they re up too i seem to be the only one who noticed remus the rest of the class is too busy pushing their faces up against the glass to get a better look at the show the rest of them are putting on i believe they ve started a mud fight and sirius has just decided that professor williams wants to join in i mean why else would she be out in the rain with them he is so going down now what oh what is the good remus lupin up to i ll go ask i ve got nothing better to do any way the stupid tree is trying to take swipes at me if i didntknow better i would say it was trying to be intimidating remus nearly jumped out of his skin when i asked him what exactly was he planning to do with that plant petals he looked rather relieved when he realised it was just me i must seem like such a push over to the marauders when i think about it i actually assist their trouble making most of the time i ll have to look into that remus just gave me one of those mysterious marauder smiles and disappeared back out the door hogwarts should be afraid very afraid evans looks like williams is back yes professor sirius really did a number on her she covered from head to foot in mud her rosy cheeks are ruddy with what i guessing is aggravation and by the looks of it she shaking with anger must not laugh do you have any idea how hard this is what have you done to my tree bollocks i should have know their was something special about this tree i ve never heard of williams trying to reconcile people and plants before even after all the disastrous accidents that have happened in here with me playing a large role in a number of them why on earth would place your own beloved tree in the care of the known resident klutz it just doesntmake sense i didntdo anything to it well i didn t i left it alone i thought that what would give it the best chance of survival given the mortality rate of things entrusted to my care williams didntsee it that way though miss evans really you could at least take responsibility for your actions what on earth is she talking about i spared a glance at the tree and did a double take it was all shrivelled and brown trembling slightly and looking not far off a nervous breakdown if trees can have nervous breakdowns that is what happened to the tree probably not the best thing to say seeing as i was suppose to be looking after the inane thing exactly what i would like to know wait williams thinks i did that you think i did that i stared at her incredulously hey i may not like the tree i may voice my resentful feelings towards it imagine horrible things happening to said tree even write about doing horrible things to said tree see above but i would never actually harm it what do you people take me for satan spawn wait they donteven know what satan spawn is so bad example but still you d have to be pretty heartless to attack a tree even if it can attack you back i just went to get it some plant tree food stuff i didnttouch it i swear williams still had her eyes narrowed i swear i didnttouch the tree or harm it in any way we were reconciling i got a few sniggers for the reconciling comment williams still looked livid but then she just put her hand to her head and let out and exasperated sigh i get that a lot to be honest fine miss evans escort messrs black potter and pettigrew to the headmasters office we will deal with this when you get back i sort of just stared at her opened mouthed she didntbelieve me she thought i seriously attempted to harm her tree she bloody mad well get going miss evans we haventgot all day how can she not believe me just because the tree looks like it dying doesntmean it is it just acting i never i wouldn t oh my god people will think i a tree killer dinner how i made it up to dumbledore office i ll never know i just trailed behind the marauders in a sort of daze how could williams think i was so malicious as to kill her tree it unnerving to think some one has that little faith in you or worse yet that you re capable of such a malevolent act james sirius and peter had all been out side when williams was having a go at me so they werentup to speed on what i had been accused of they were laughing and joking all the way up to the castle sirius was the first to enquire about my usually quite disposition he started to walk beside me and slung an arm around my shoulder come now lilly billy tell old sirius what wrong i think my reaction sort of shows for itself how unstable my mind was at the time i didnthit sirius for the lilly billy comment i didntshove sirius arm off me like i usually do i didntmake any sarcastic comebacks i was devastated at what williams thought i was capable of she thought i tried to kill her tree i just stated it with no emotion the marauders shared a look obviously catching on that i wasntin my correct state of mind er who thought you tried to kill their tree sirius looks sort of concerned for my mental health yeah well he not the only one williams she thinks i tried to kill her tree just because it tried to strangle me last week and i was understandably upset by the fact that it had launched an unprovoked attack on me and then this week she was trying to reconcile me the blasted thing because i have to learn to respect plants and then i went and said hello to remus and when i came back it looked as though some one had threatened it with a chain saw but i swear i never laid a finger on it i didnteven go near it i didntwant to go any where near it but now williams thinks i purposely tried to kill her stupid tree why does she care so much about the bloody tree for anyway but really do you think i capable of killing an innocent tree sweet merlin i an accused tree killer we had stopped walking by the this time and sirius was standing sort of shocked like he couldntquite comprehend what i had just said and i on the other hand was having a mild panic attack hyperventilating and everything admittedly i did say it all pretty fast and you probably wouldnthave a clue what i was talking about unless you knew i was an alleged tree killed plus i dontthink they understood the chainsaw comment peter was sort of the same as sirius both of them had open mouths and the arms limp at their sides i was looking anxiously at sirius waiting for an answer then to my surprise james steps in look lily calm down i sure you didntdo anything maybe the tree was just sick before you got anywhere near it wow james could actually understand my hyperactive chatter i wonder if he understands chipmunk i turned to james fully but that the thing it was fine before williams left and then when i came back it looked as though some one had taken their wand to it is the most horrible way and it was williams personal tree she ll kill me when i get back james looks thoughtful for a moment wait it was williams personal tree i nodded he sighed with relief dontworry then it ll be fine the tree will be back to it normal spiteful self in no time now that was a weird thing to say sirius and peter had come back to life and sirius was even grinning oh you got involved with pandora williams child substitute tree james just rolled his eyes sirius affectionately named the tree pandora after he got into a bit of a fix with it a couple of years ago he explained in a bored voice sirius on the other hand got all excited yes pandora and i go way back our relationship started in fourth year when almost lopped off one of her limbs with a misfired severing charm williams almost killed me i sort of stared at him before turning back to james so i not the only person to be accused of being an attempted tree murderer james just smiled and gave me a comforting hug can i just say it was a very comfortable hug yes i think i can no far from it williams is over protective and the tree is over dramatic pandora likes to make sure she the apple of williams eye well at least i not the only mental one around here well not when it comes to thinking that trees can be overly dramatic anyway maybe i underestimated that tree or should i say pandora i cantbelieve the marauders have a name for that blasted tree sirius treated me to his entire shared history with pandora they ve had quite the relationship starting with the almost severing of the limb to the attempted strangulation to pandora makeover in sirius hands to the most recent revenge by wedgie by pandora and the entire time williams has given sirius the look of death while tending lovingly to her beloved plant according to james pandora was given to williams by the love of her life before he went off to fight against grindelwald and when he didntcome back she turned to the plant for comforted and ever since it has been her baby the only thing that can addle the brains of the grounded hufflepuff head of house is a temperamental plant christened pandora by the students go figure by the time i got back to the green houses it was almost the end of class and williams had sort of calmed down a bit and was her usual brisk self pandora was nowhere in sight thank my lucky stars oh my would you look at that there a great plate of mei goreng just staring me in the face very unusual seeing as i usually have to request that sort of thing hmmm maybe someone looking out for me well whoever they are they are thanked very heartily wednesday 8th february common room some people hate the rain more specifically tristan despises the rain he cantstand it he more of a summer person what with his quidditch obsession and all i tried to point out to him that flying in the rain is one of the best feelings in the world at least i think so tri just looked at me like i was raving mad gave the rain one last scowl and disappeared off to the fire so here i am sitting on the window sill with the window slightly open so i can still feel the odd splatter of rain on my face every now and then it so nice out side the constant drizzle has created a mist that has swept across the grounds giving them an eerie feel with the lake so still and picturesque it sort of reminds me of the avalon and the mysterious women who accompanied arthur so that he may be healed and rise up to once again lead his people sigh i read way too much mythology crap though i bet if i looked it up in the library it would all be there in wizarding history what with merlin being their god and all i was down by the lake having a lovely conversation with the giant squid well i did most of the talking but he did respond with a few tentacle twitches plus he was more than happy to humour me seeing as i was sharing my cookies and generally enjoying the feel of the rain and my surroundings unfortunately all that was put to a stop as mcgonagall spotted me from window and felt it duty as my head of house to haul me in from my peaceful spot lecturing me the entire way about catching my death of cold er excuse me but dontwe live in the wizarding world are there not such things as pepper up potions when i pointed this out mcgonagall did the exasperated sigh that so many people use when talking to me and told me to get to my common room and not let her catch me outside in the rain again fine next time i ll stay out of view of the windows i think mcgonagall caught onto my thinking though as she narrowed her eyes at me and escorted me to the fat lady so now i stuck inside staring longingly out the window on a happier note i talked to remus yesterday afternoon while everyone was at quidditch practice he said there wasntmuch to tell and that once i left dumbledore stepped in and whisked our beloved mothers off to his office hmmmm i dontthink that a good enough explanation and i told remus so he bent a little after that and told me how the thing had fumed about my ungratefulness to the whole hall and had promised to make me sorry for being so disrespectful every waking moment of my holidays will now be devoted to polo meetings and the like i just know it she ll making social arrangements for my every waking moment of my summer as we speak well as i write anyway apparently dumbledore was able to get through to my mother and she has decided to lay off a bit and let me do what i want with who i want finally someone got through to that woman so thankfully remus and i are longer being told that we will be courting each other and we are free to have romantic relationships with whom ever we like for some reason remus didntfind the latter as exciting as i did he says he never wants to get involved romantically due to his er furry little problem as james puts it from that description you d think he had a dysfunctional hamster that chewed everything in sight and was very sensitive to change not that far off actually oh i still have to say thank you to james for all his help on saturday it was so sweet of him to come after me and cheer me up last time i saw him i was in the shock of being accused of murdering that bloody tree oooh i wish i really could make that tree bloody enough about stupid trees i have just been hit with a brain wave okay so i got it while coming up with ways to inflict the most pain upon said stupid tree but still it a good idea why not go up to the astronomy tower i can go out into the rain it got an excellent view and mcgonagall will never know brilliant girls dorm what do you know i not the only one who thought the astronomy tower was a good place to experience the rain and not get busted for it the silly woman i mean honestly there nothing wrong with a little bit of rain or a whole lot for that matter anyway i snuck up to the astronomy tower successfully avoiding mcgonagall filch and his dirty flea ball of a cat but as i was congratulating myself on a job well done i realised there was in fact someone else sitting out in the rain my my we have an uncanny knack for meeting in the most peculiar places james was sitting in the middle of the roof legs crossed and face upturned just enjoying the rain do you mind if i join you he jumped about a foot in the air and stared at me with startled eyes he recovered himself after a second and shook his head motioned for me to sit down i didntmean to startle he just nodded and continued to look straight ahead out towards the lake oh well if he doesntwant to talk that fine with me i just happy to be out in the rain again i closed my eyes and leaned back on my arms just savouring the feel of the rain it makes my skin feel so soft and smooth washing away all the dirt and worry just like it cleans the grounds the trees seem to shimmer with renewed vigour and everything seems brighter my god i such a romantic it unbelievable those rose coloured glasses are permanently addling my brains damn those romantic trashy novels i opened my eyes and james hadntmoved so i cast my gaze over to the lake the giant squid had moved from my spot under the tree to the middle of the lake where he was partaking in a complicated danced with the falling rain drops maybe i shouldnthave given him those cookies i dontknow what effect chocolate chip cookies have on giant squids but from what i can see it isntgood but i didntgive him that many five maybe but that was all oh wait the basket of cookies the house elves gave me is gone from where i was sitting under the tree the giant squid must have had the rest well it no wonder he acting like he is i mean that basket was pretty big why do you think i was feeding the squid some the giant squid did a complicated twirl with half of his tentacles coming flying out of the water and i couldnthelp but laugh out loud james snapped to attention and gave me curious look i couldntstop laughing so i just pointed towards the squid who was to his credit still continuing with his ridiculous dance moves it was like seeing a six armed elephant do the waltz that got a smile out of james just a small smile but at least he had a reaction i was beginning to worry for his sanity i mean here is the giant squid performing perverse synchronised swimming moves on a sugar high and all he can do is curl his lips up slightly what is wrong with him once i got over my mirth at the squids expense i am so feeding him cookies more often i decided to thank james properly for saturday james it took him a minute to register i was talking to him yes he looked down at me with an unreadably blank face i decided my shoelaces were far more interesting nessa and i had charmed them to be rainbow coloured the other day while we were supposed to be taking notes in dada i just wanted to say thank you for saturday i really appreciate your help and for not letting me dwell on the mornings events i had a lot of fun and i hope you did too because it really meant a lot to me and that ladies and gentlemen is how lillianna elizabeth evans shows her appreciation for someone who has come to mean so much to her she mumbles thanks and gratitude to her knees i looked up with a small smile waiting for his reaction before i go on can i just say what happened next was completely unexpected the next thing i know james potter is kissing me senseless in the pouring rain on the top of the astronomy tower i was shocked accordingly but some how managed to show my er thanks the only question i have at the moment is how do i keep it from my friends while i try to figure out just what i am going to do this is going to be tricky hi everyone yes i am well aware of the fact that most of you are overly frustrated at my lack of updates but what cani sayi had a temporary block i got stuck with where to go but it alright i back on track and have worked out what i doing sort of anywayi would just like to thank all of the reviewers for their lovely comments and messages of incouragement and thankyou to everyone who has read my story however the next person to post a comment such as when are lily and james gonna get together already or where are your full stops i cantsee any will die a horific death by a toaster i happen to be very good at blowing up toasters i think i ve killed three to date the relationship between lily and james is moving at the pacei want it to move so deal with it the writing style with no full stops seems to bother rather a lot of you well i am dreadfully sorry but that is the way i write the story on purpose it is not a grammar malfunction it is ment to be a stream of conciousness that is how i personally wrote diary entries and notes to my friends whilei wasat schooland in fact i still do it in other words stop telling me to put full stops in because i am not going to do it i sorry i ranted like thatbut if you go and read the reviews the vast majority of them comment on these to issue or in some cases both i really appreciate revies i do i love the fact that people want to help but commenting on the same thing over and over agian does not help and is merely annoying but moving right alongi invite you to comment on this chapter all you please in fact pick it to shreds i insist comment on the lack of full stops if you really must but please just tell me what you think particularly about the last entry you see my beta has is awol and i cantcontact her for her valued imput so please tell me what you think and sorry agai for the rant about the reviewsi really do love them no matter what they say absolute shocker by jamesroxmysox disclaimer i own nothing recognisable from the harry potter books or movies that belongs to j and warner brothers studios thursday 9th february girls dorm now i dontusually write in here as soon as i wake up but today i thought it to be entirely necessary may i add that it is actually 6 55 am i never get up this early so what i have to write must be significant anyway i just had the most peculiar dream weird in itself as i never usually dream just doze but this was really weird want to know how weird well first off i was kissing james potter where the hell that came from i have no idea second of all it was on top of the astronomy tower and it was raining cats and dogs and oh sweet merlin wait a moment oops i screamed out loud now i being bombarded by worried friends who think i being attacked lily are you okay are you sick what the matter what happened banana just realised how perfect james is for you you have no idea how close you are to the truth dana i fine i just er found a spider on my bed is all it gave me a bit of a scare all i can hear now are a few muffled groans and dana mumbling about my blindness and how i need to hit by a sledgehammer or some other piece of heavy machinery sledgehammer i think i ve just been directly hit by a freight train one of the really massive ones that have about a million carriages oh god what am i going to do i dont know what to do how am i supposed to deal with this bollocks breath lily breath all will be well if you just remember to breath in out in out that right now continue to repeat oh my bloody god all right dontpanic do not panic let just think this through reasonably and logically and i sure it will be fine how can it possibly be fine oh lord now i trying to lie to myself and failing miserably might i add okay first thing to do would be to reread my last entry as i clearly remember writing before i went to sleep last night oh my well that was hem enlightening i official the biggest sap to ever walk the earth i vow that starting now i will never read another romance novel ever again so long as i live all i can say is that thank god no one will ever read this besides myself that is i remember everything very clearly but this just sort of confirms my fears not that kissing james potter was a bad thing certainly not the stuff of nightmares but the thing is i dontknow what the hell happens next i mean seriously we kissed so what happens now more importantly what do i want to happen now i mean james put a hell of a lot on the line there what with just going in for the kill actually i think i admire him for that one i mean he just sort of put all his feeling out there and now it my turn to respond the ball is in my court my god it feels like tennis or something what worse is that i was always horrible at tennis or chess you now the battle of wills thing but the thing is i worse at chess than i am at tennis bollocks okay lily remember calm but how am i supposed to make a move when i donteven know what i want to do or the game rules for that matter i mean i like james he a great bloke and all but i dontknow if i like him that way i mean he still a git at times and then there the whole anonymous boyfriend thing but mind you i no miss perfect either i mean i unorganised a dreadful procrastinator a terrible role model and horribly judgmental who am i to judge the poor bloke but still i cantjust string him along if i dontlike him that way i have to tell him and from what i recall that could be rather messy considering how i reacted last night what with the kissing back and all really this is just as much my fault as james i mean i encouraged him bollocks what am i going to do first things first i think i ll go have breakfast oh chocolate it only seven thirty see what this is doing to me normally i not even awake at seven thirty and here i am going to breakfast i going mad i tell you just plain balmy library well today been fun i ve had to dodge just about every person i know so that they wontask me about well anything i terrified that if i open my mouth words will just start pouring out and i wontbe able to stop them my mind has become an absolute disaster area well it was before but i talking post world war two eastern europe disaster area country side bombed to bits and millions of misplaced persons included actually i feel a bit like a misplaced person only this misplaced person doesnteven know which way is up this morning i threw on my clothes grabbed my bag and ran out the door leaving a behind one very messed up bed and one very confused vanessa halleway nessa big blue eyes just stared at me as i fled down the stairs probably wondering what unholy spirit had invaded my body i was in such a hurry to escape from my dorm mates that i only grabbed my headband bad move at the time i wasntreally giving much thought to physical appearance so i gave my hair the day off and let it do as pleased a labour day holiday for my hair if you will and it seems to have made the most of the situation rejoicing in the fact it not in a braid all day going out of its way to annoy the hell out of me or maybe i just aggravated but enough about my hair the rest of my day was far more interesting i actually ended up having breakfast in the kitchens why not have it in the great hall well because a i think most people i know would die of shock if i was to enter the great hall of my own free will this early in the morning arenti selfless and more importantly b james was waiting for me in the entrance hall i heard people talking in the entrance hall and thought nothing of it until i heard sirius voice come on prongs i starving let just go to breakfast you can find lady lily later i stopped dead sirius i told you go ahead eat your breakfast i ll be there in a minute he sounds slightly irritated maybe it because star boy has been whining he tends to do that a lot sirius whining i mean why do you want to speak to lily so badly anyway remus ever the reasonable one tries to find the root of the problem wait a minute he didnttell them about what happened oh lords that just hit me yeah i mean dontyou have rounds together tonight anyway where oh where did i put that sickly pack will gave me a couple of years back it was his attempt at corrupting me told me to eat a chocolate any time i didntwant to go to class and it would make me as sick as a dog hopefully it actually works and that way i can avoid my prefect duties tonight peter seemed to have convinced james to go to breakfast as i didnthear anything after that but i wasnttaking any chances i used a lesser known passage to get me to the kitchen nicked a bit of toast and made my way to my first class for the rest of the day i ve sort of tried to keep to my self and sort a few things out not that i actually got anywhere with that one i have new respect for the post war leaders what exactly are you meant to do with all those misplaced persons and what about all those buildings that suddenly lay in ruins their foundations strewn about for miles my friends were of course completely baffled by my decidedly antisocial behaviour and have tried all day to discover the reason behind it good luck with that like i going to tell them about what happened with james when i myself arenteven sure what going on speaking of james i have successfully avoided him all day which may or may not be a good thing i not sure yet i even managed to avoid remus successfully when he sought me out at lunch i told him i had a counselling session with williams and her beloved pandora though some how i dontthink he believed me it may have been the anxious look on my face my terrible lying abilities or the fact that i then ran in the completely opposite direction i think i may be tempted to go for a combination of the three but mostly the last one what i going to do about rounds tonight i have no idea aaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhh sorry someone just covered my eyes with their hands and considering the number of people i avoiding at the moment it freaked me out a bit thankfully it just charlie er hi lily i just thought you could maybe help me with a couple of charms but if this is a bad time he sounds slightly wary that could be due to the fact i was clutching my notebook to my chest as though clinging on to dear life but whatever charlie now giving me one of those concerned glances i seem to be attracting a lot of them today remember lily calm hummmmmmmmm you know higher places and all that really charlie it fine you just startled me is all he gives me a disbelieving look really it fine i was just spacing out slightly he doesnt believe me mind you i dontbelieve me so oh stop it show us the stupid charm you want help with we dont really do structured tutoring sessions any more charlie just gets me to help him with the odd charm every now and then hopefully this will take all night and i wonthave to lie about not being able to do patrols and i can just help charlie all night surely james will understand what with it being his little brother and all some how i doubt it friday 10th february the lake making a complete git of myself well last night i helped charlie with some charm that was giving him trouble what that boy was doing with his hands i ll never know until we got kicked out of library and even then we kept at it once we had relocated to the common room apparently he had to do a demonstration in front of the class today and he didntwant to make a gigantic prat of himself in front of melissa the two of them have actually started talking thank the heavens and wouldntyou know it the screaming match between the thing and i is what triggered it melissa happened to comment on how ahem desirable i seem to be the girl has addled brains i tell you anyway charlie didntrealise it was her talking and answered saying how nuts my mother was and how he had fears it was hereditary and some how it just went from there well at least my insanity is benefiting someone i continued with the antisocial thing today my friends seem to be treating it as though i having a bit of break down they re not far off and have decided to leave me to be though nessa did seek me out at lunch today when i was hiding away in one of the darker hallways how she found me i ll never know lily i must have jumped about a foot in the air i had been daydreaming out the window as i am prone to do when she came up behind me lily i worried about you we all are i didnt really know what to say so i just kept quiet you know that you can tell us anything and we ll all try our best to help she looked so eager to help i felt horrible for not being able to answer i mean what could i say james potter kissed me and now i in emotional turmoil that sounds far too teenage angst like when i say it to my self let alone any one else when you re ready banana we ll be here for you oh gods i feel horrid they must think that something seriously wrong like my father died or aunt dotty finally decided to behave like a dignified woman of her age wait until the find out this is all due to some silly little kiss but it not a silly little kiss and it really is causing me some anxiety especially after what just happened james found me i knew he would sooner or later i just tricked myself into believing it would be later though i still dontunderstand just how he found me out here by the lake under one of the far off beech trees i was extremely careful about staying out of view of the windows seeing as it raining and mcgonagall would surely be on the look out but some how james potter being james potter managed to find me still not completely sure if it was a good thing or a bad thing but it certainly didntput my mind at all to rest i was under one of the trees that completely shielded me from view of the castle the giant squid was milling around trying his luck for some more cookies had i thought about it i probably would have brought him some but the mine field that is my mind wasntreally concerned with giants squids on sugar highs at the moment and i was just sort of staring out at the forest thinking and playing with my hair which by the way i have completely given up on all of a sudden some one sat next to me what is it with these people and sneaking up on me dontthey know it a common curtesy to let people see you coming so that they may quickly duck out of view and avoid a meeting if they wish they obviously missed that particular etiquette lesson well when i realised it was james i sort of stared at him in absolute horror for a moment before quickly looking back at the lake he sat there sort of staring at me for a while as though trying to fathom what the hell was going on in my head well good luck to him if he found any form of logic or reasonable thought i would love for him to inform me of it via a quick memo as i dont think he ll be speaking with me again any time soon so james continued to stare at me thinking that the side of my face was going to reveal the secrets of the universe or something meanwhile i could feel myself going redder and redder and well yes i felt like one big strawberry tart the tart bit being that i snogged a guy senseless on the astronomy tower two days ago and haventso much as said hi to him since plus i feeling a bit mushy like the custard oh dear i ve started comparing myself to desserts admittedly very nice yummy desserts but still desserts obviously james hadntcome out here just to stare at me and have me completely overlook his presence he wasnttoo pleased about the whole not talking to him thing which i really dontblame him for that actually lily we have to talk about this i turned and looked at him as though he was mad havent we been through his before i almost positive i ve heard him say that before admittedly it was a completely different situation but the connotations are still the same okay so maybe we do need to talk about this but preferably later once i have some understanding of where my mind is going with this at the moment mad mothers and friends with ridiculous love lives are far from my mind i trying to decipher my own mind which in all honesty is no easy task james took my silence as indication for him to continue about wednesday night on the astronomy tower i sorry i took advantage of you like that i should have asked first but oh merlin i dontlike where this is going i think i shall have to stop it before it goes any further it alright james you re not completely to blame i mean i didnt exactly discourage you now james is the one looking wide eyed again my eyes are just drawn to my knees and in all honesty i shouldnthave it was a mistake what happened what do you mean it was a mistake my eyes flew up at james indignant tone what i mean is that it happened for all the wrong wrong what was wrong is this just a game to you or something have you just realised you re in too deep is that why you ve been avoiding me what to answer first when i can get a word in that is no you see er i it hard to explain james was not at all satisfied with my dreadful attempt at explaining what the hell was going on hard to explain what is so hard to explain i couldnt hold it in any longer everthing just everything okay i have about a hundred different things going round in my head and i dontknow what to do about most of it especially when it comes to you between my mother my friends and now this i sort of stretched here that didntgo down well either it appears james doesntlike being yelled at i know lily i know you re worried about your mother your sisters wedding your brothers your nutcase friends even my bloody brother and his demented love life he was throwing his hands about by this stage but for one minute i asking you to worry about me and more importantly you for a second all i want is for you to answer me this how do you feel about me i just stared at him with a pained look on my face that would be the million galleon question mate answer me lily i was shaking by this time knowing my answer wasntgoing to satisfy even if it was honest i hung my head and mumbled to my beloved knees i dont know at first i thought he hadntheard me but he did oh yes he heard me all right james was silent for a moment and just stared down at me i really wished in those couple of seconds he would say something but then once he did i really wanted the silence back i cant do this any more lily the heartbreaking thing was the resigned tone of his voice that when the tears started to well up lat me know when you do know and then he just walked off just like that he walked away he didntgive me a chance to explain what was going on or anything he just walked off with out another word i feel so guilty for not being able to answer like he wanted but in the same sense i absolutely seething at him for making me feel guilty and not letting me sort things out but mostly i feel miserable like i ve had my heart torn out and stomped on because i let him walk away when i think about it it probably has saturday 11th february kitchens at a disgustingly early hour of the morning when other normal people are in bed i near positive it is now saturday but i have been here so long it could very well not be saturday and i am merely over estimating the period of time i ve been here well after my last entry i promptly burst into tears that seemed to last for bloody ever i quite embarrassed by it now but at that point i was beyond caring i think i just let out all my frustrations thank god there was no one around to witness that not even james he has a peculiar knack for bringing out my emotional side i dont know how he does it but james somehow manages to drive bloody insane infuriate me to no end make me want to laugh until my sides hurt and want to snog him senseless all at the same time he just takes the rules of my well organised world i ve learned to live in and bended it all about so the guidelines i constructed for my self donteven apply any more everything just gets so jumbled up when i around him it hard to explain i mean sirius is just as good looking as james he infuriates me at times and he makes me laugh but i dontfeel the need to snog him remus is increadibly sweet and lovely but i never just want to wrap my arms around him and hug him until i fall asleep it just james and for some reason that scares me witless after crying until i was exhausted and dehydrated crying really takes it out of you i dragged myself up to the gryffindor tower i trailed through the halls not really seeing where i was going just following the normal path back to the common room i wasnteven bothering to look out for filch i think i did bump into mrs norris at one stage i may have even patted her absent mindedly once her presence was brought to my attention through her usual mewing i think it was the shock of actually being patted that kept her from rushing off to filch i assume she never made it too him as i wasntpounced on and ordered to clean up the trail of water and muddy footprints i left through out the castle i some how managed to get through the common room unnoticed but i did spot james briefly before making my way up the stairs he was talking to the other marauders by the fire he looked his normal happy self but there was definitely something a bit off about him i suppose it a good thing he not brooding unlike me thankfully the dorm was empty when i got up there i had a roasting shower that i spaced out of for the most of and then pulled my curtains tight around my bed and prepared myself for the final confrontation between lily and anna for this too work i have realised i am going to have to listen to the cases of my different alter egos and hopefully come up with a compromise for me lillianna to be able to accept first things first was to realise that yes i am ever so slightly commitment phobic and also my damn pride has to much sway over my actions i just have to accept that love means mistakes are going to be made and yes i am going to make a fool of myself at some stage because there are no rules when it comes to romance only understandings that are different for every relationship also trust is a very big part of this you need to trust the person with you so completely to be faithful caring and not to laugh when you make a fool of yourself i think that my biggest issue being embarrassed by my actions what can i say i was always taught to control my emotions and hide my heart as if you are open about such things it leaves you open to criticism as soft and weak but when you think about it you have to be a very brave and strong person to admit you are in love or have such feelings towards someone the taboo society has placed on the declaration of such feelings makes it feel so embarrassing which is why it so damn hard so having realised all this lily has been humbled into self pitying silence anna however feels it is now her turn to talk james question is very difficult to answer what do you feel for me so many things all at the same time that it impossible to decipher it all just in a couple of words like i said he causes so many emotions to come bursting forth all at once at the beginning of the year i was convinced he was a gigantic prat who was shallow as a paddling pool i still convinced he a gigantic prat but unfortunately he does have some emotional depth and can be quite sweet when he wants to be all right so yes i do get a little loopy around james as in there just something about him i always end up having fun with him apart from when you know he gets jealous and thinks i stupid enough to ask him for romantic advice which ends up with us both frustrated and furious but usually when we are just hanging out and having fun we seem to have a brilliant time it makes me smile just to think of him and the fact that he does care for me does make me feel all tingly and special the kiss on wednesday just brought every thing into a sharp focus and i not too proud to admit it freaked me out in a big way i just dontknow how to express my feelings or what exactly those feelings are to begin with sigh i have so much to learn when it comes to this being social thing here i am drowning my sorrows in chocolate chip cookies and tea trying to probe the inner workings of my demented mind though i do think i have a tendency to over analyse things so this could all end in tears if i left to my self actually i think it going to end in tears anyway so why worry really i havent spoken to any of my friends about this yet and i dontintend to though i beginning to realise that i do actually need some help here just to keep things in perspective i sure they all still think i having a mental breakdown of some description i haventsaid any thing to them to communicate otherwise but then i haventdown much communicating at all so i dontknow how they feel about this one but it better not be met with the whole you should have told us thing or i may just tell them where to go but i think they have the measure of me by now that seclusion means i working things through in my head and i ll tell them when i ready i hope they ve got that at least lilikins oh god i think i may have just experienced my first major heart attack bloody star boy and his sneakyness hi sirius i immediately wary of sirius i still dontremember the entirety of our last in depth conversation what re you up to lilikins craving cookies again i see more like craving a distraction i just smiled and turned back to my tea and the previous drowning of sorrows not that this deterred sirius all right lily what going on james in a mood and you re being little miss anti social i am intelligent enough to connect the two you know maybe if i ignore him he ll go away oh merlin i delusional so what happened lily did james finally grow a pair and snog you or what i turned my head so fast i think cricked my neck he has no idea how accurate he is he kissed you or maybe he does sweet merlin when did this happen i cantbelieve he actually did it i so proud my little jamsie is all grown up after months of beating around the bush he finally got the guts to go in for the kill i just so proud it definitely explains his behaviour over the last couple of days wait why arentyou guys together then why haventi your well james most beloved friend not been informed of this for the whole time that star boy was prattling away i just sort of stared at him he is going to be so off me when i inform him of my gittishness now he got this determined look in his eye like he going to get to the bottom of this whether i like it or not oh bugger it i think i ll just tell him and get it over with erm because i an idiotic prat who cantdo anything right you didntkiss him back he actually sounds rather indignant on his friend behalf if only i hadntthis would be a hell of a lot less messy wait no it would be just as messy i retract my former statement plus that kiss was so worth it anyway back on topic well yes i did but sirius seems riveted but but bugger it it all too hard leave me alone to my bloody tea and go snog bridge or something that what i d like to say but i dontthink sirius would accept that as a substantial answer i dont think i should have as it has made things rather messy sirius raised his eyebrows i hate to tell you this sweetheart but it was going to be messy whether you kissed back or not thankyou captain obvious but you did kiss him back so i dontknow what the big deal is you are obviously the reason he been acting like a complete prat for the last couple of days so what happened after that hmmm here a challenge for you put my next actions into words in such a way that i dontcome off a complete prat nope cantbe done erm well at eh end of the evening we said goodnight and we went off to bed however the entirety of the situation hit me when i woke up and well sirius gave me a knowing glance and you avoided james like the plague i glared at him i didntmean to i just didntknow what i was going to say star boy rolled his eyes at me and cast his eyes around for a helpful house elf well i glad to finally know the reason behind the james newly achieved levels of gitness though we did guess it had something to do with the lovely lilikins he cast me a glance after ordering some clairs and the like from a passing elf you re lucky peter not here he was about ready to hex james this afternoon couldntget him to concentrate on chess and james is the only one who can give old worms a decent game i groaned that just what i was trying to prevent i didntwant to talk to james until i could give him a straight answer about what was going on i mean he put a lot on the line what with the whole just going for it thing i thought the least i could do was sort out what the hell i was feeling before talking to him however it seems to have just backfired on me yet again sirius was now eyeing me shrewdly well at least you had good intentions which saves me the trouble of tearing you limb from limb for messing my best mate about the scary thing in all this is he was deadly serious about the tearing me limb from limb thing it gives me the chills just thinking of it sirius is definitely not someone to cross more importantly you dontcross his friends if you value your physical and mental health honestly sirius i feel awful about this leaving james hanging and all that but i just haventbeen able to convince myself to confront the whole feelings thing and how they relate to james sirius gave me a knowing look lily i dontthink the feelings are the bit you re having trouble with it more the commitment bit and most importantly about putting your pride on the line oh dear i think he hit the proverbial nail on the proverbial head i know what i feel about james i ve just been deluding myself into thinking that i dontso i donthave to deal with the whole decision of what to do next so lily now we know what the problem is he rather perceptive this star boy i must learn to be less readable whilst around him you can weigh up your feelings for james against the value of your pride just what i wanted to hear saturday 11th february dorm room after leaving me with that lovely little piece of advice star boy grabbed his sweets and various cakes and waltzed out into the night i stared in to space for a far while after he left and was only brought back to reality when i went to drink my tea and got a brain freeze i then decided it was probably best to make my way up to bed thankfully i was able to fall asleep pretty quickly i dont think i could have handled tossing and turning all night thinking about james and the fact that i have screwed things up so completely right now i am just waiting for the others to wake up so that i can spill my guts and hopefully obtain their help in getting myself out of the trouble i have created for myself i actually sitting on the end of nessa bed she usually the first one to get up on the weekends oh yay she waking up finally hey lily what are you doing up i swear something possessed you the last couple of days you haventbeen near any creepy artefacts lately have you i smile sadly and shake my head slowly merlin i such a prat not that i know of but i need to talk to you and the others about bloody time we thought we were going to have to ambush you or something i glared over at bridget who was looking ridiculously glamorous for someone who has just woken up always straight to the point is our bridget yeah well it wouldnthave done us any good adds her twin dana looks just as gorgeous first thing in the morning as bridget damn them both rhi props herself up definitely not seeing as lily here is about the most tight lipped person i know true very true we could have tried some truth serum though nessa rolls her eyes at bridget yes but that no longer necessary as lily is here to tell us now i smile at nessa now where do i start okay come on spit it out we do have a quidditch game to go to you know that got my attention we do panic is now taking over my mind oh merlin if gryffindor is playing today then my guilt factor is about to triple seeing as i have upset the captain and am about to off load my problems on to one of the chasers hmmm i may have to rethink this rhi noticed my stricken expression it okay lily it ravenclaw versus slytherin i just nod and swallow erm well i suppose i should tell you how this all started well you see on wednesday afternoon i was up on top of the astronomy tower dana interrupts eyebrows raised wednesday afternoon wasntit raining well more bucketing down on wednesday er yes what on earth were you doing up on the astronomy tower then avoiding mcgonagall dana still looks confused nessa tries to help her out dana it lily our very own little water baby she was most likely hiding out from mcgonagall so she could sit out in the rain and not get into trouble for it now lily continue i gulped okay well i met james up there and well i thanked him for making me feel better on saturday and he er he kissed me my friends had been bursting to ask questions since i mentioned james and at the mention of kissing they couldnthelp themselves they all started babbling at once he kissed you oh merlin that fantastic you kissed him back right please tell me you kissed him back i mean how could you not was he any good i bet he was he had a thing for you for so long i bet he was fantastic you lucky thing about bloody time i thought he was never going to do it i was about smack him one the next time he started drilling me about you rhi was the first one to twig that there was more too it the twins were far to busy verbalising there predictions of how good a kisser james is they didnteven come close er lily why arentyou two together then i mean i assume you kissed him back because to be honest it rather obvious you have a thing for him to us i mean not to every one else it just because we know you so well that it ovious to us rhi added hurriedly after seeing my look of absolute horror i let slip a resigned sigh well yes of course i kissed him back he gorgeous and an excellent kisser may i add but um i managed to completely stuff it up nessa gave me a knowing look you went into denial didntyou a bit the twins looked at me disbelieving all right so i went into denial a whole lot but that beside the point well no it not that probably the main cause of all my problems but still let me finish i took a deep breath i really stuffed everything up i thought it would be best if i figured out just what i felt for james before i talked to him so i would know what the hell i was going to say dana shook her head that definitely sounds very lily ish keeping everything controlled and within the realm of logic i have to agree it so very true tell me about it that why i temporarily became a hermit i was trying to get my head together cant say i envy you your mind in a dangerous place nessa knows just what to sya to make the whole lot of us smile be that as it may james eventually caught up with me i have no idea how he did though yesterday while i while i was down at the lake and yes well he wanted answers that at the time i didnthave he got really quite upset with the fact that i still didntunderstand what the hell was go on with myself by this time i was on a roll and i was fighting back tears remembering the look on james face he started shouting about how i worry too much about other people he has a point there shut up dana you shut up bridget both of you shut the hell up and accused me of playing some kind of game with him and getting myself in too deep and then he asked me the million galleon question of how i felt about him and of course i couldntanswer and told him i didntknow and well that went down really well of course the whole time i had been talking to my knees yet again my god my knees know an awful lot about me anyway i looked up at my friends to gage their reactions but the worst bit was when he said he couldnt do this anymore what ever this is anyway the worst bit was the way he said it as though he was giving up entirely and he said to let him know when i did know and then he just walked away at this bit i broke down nessa wrapped her arms around me in a bear hug and pretty soon dana bridget and rhi had all come over and piled on top of us awww lily you really like him dontyou nessa was stroking my hair yes unfortunately i do but now james thinks i dontlike him at all and to add insult to injury it was sirius black who pointed out to me that i knew perfectly well what i feel for james i was just to scared of what comes next to accept it bridget looked at me surprised where d you meet sirius at least she hasntaccused me of seeking star boy out in the kitchens this morning at like 2am while i was trying to distract myself with chocolate chip cookies and hot tea they all just nodded meeting one of the marauders in the kitchen in the early hours of the morning is simply routine as far as we are concerned so what are you going to do now that my dear dana would be the two million galleon question i have no idea i think my hopelessness showed through all to well come on banana let go to the quidditch and cheer on the ravenclaws against the nasty slytherins and we can brain storm later i looked hopefully at nessa so you re not mad at me for not telling you about all this straight away it was rhi that answered of course not we re just happy that you eventually felt you could tell us what was going on and overjoyed that you want our advice and god forbid our help i smiled i love my friends they can be so very wonderful when they want to be how they are going to help me with james i dontknow but it good to have someone to bounce ideas off makes me remember why i love them all so much okay i sorry it taken me so long to write and post this chapter i did leave home and go travelling for just over five months but the rest of the time i was just being lazy i am immensely sorry and i have no excuse for such lax behaviour i am dedicating this chapter to all my wonderful readers who have stuck it out with me and waited so patiently for this chapter thanks to everyone who sent me messages and pleas for me to update your encouragement and reminders were appreciated i hope this chapter satisfies for now the next one will be up soon many thanks jen and remember to r e v i e w absolute shocker by jamesroxmysox disclaimer i own nothing recognisable from the harry potter books or movies that belongs to j and warner brothers studios the quidditch pitch watching the wise ravenclaws have a good shot at those slimy slytherins right i beginning to rethink this whole let go watch some quidditch to make you feel better idea here i am sitting i dontknow what 9 feet maybe at best from the bloke who is at the present moment causing me head spins he however is looking rather pleased with himself mind you he does have a very pretty brunette batting her eyelashes up at him on his left the presence of said pretty brunette is not helping my present state of mind to say the least now i know i have absolutely no right to get all upset and heaven forbid jealous about that fact that this charming young woman is giving her full attentions to one james potter i mean hello he james potter females are falling at his feet left right and centre and all hours of the night and day oh no what i object to is the fact that he encouraging her how dare he the gigantic prat i should wait i donthave the right to do anything seeing as i was the one who ripped out his heart and supposedly shredded it unwittingly of course but still ripped out his heart and shredded it none the less mind you i not taking full blame seeing as he not the best person at communicating feelings and what not i mean really he could have eased into it you know hey this makes him an even bigger tart than me hard to believe i know but it does indeed look rather slutty from my standpoint i mean he snogs a girl on wednesday night tries to get a verbal confession of undying love from said girl on friday never once voicing his own feelings see i ve thought about this he has never once said he liked me he just kissed me i want a commitment here then on saturday turns up with some other little hussy however pretty said hussy is she is still a hussy lily eeeeeeek oh it alright it just cam he trying to call my attention to the fact that the game is going to start i thought it might have been someone else someone who i would prefer didnt read any of this entry and is sitting about oh 9 feet away actually he giving me one of those exasperated looks i so used too the game isntabout to start either i wonder what on earth he wants i was quite happy ranting he should know by know i dontlike my ranting interrupted er yes he just rolled his eyes you didnthear a word of what i was telling you did you uh oh i was to preoccupied with ranting about james and the little hussy that i completely missed whatever important piece of quidditch trivia cam was waffling about at least i pretty sure he was waffling about quidditch trivia of course i did you were saying something about the great quidditch match of 29 between the cyclones and the um meat cleavers or something please let him have been waffling about that bloody game again please never thought i would be making that particular request any time soon ah well desperate times call for desperate measures and all that bollocks you mean the great quidditch final of 1939 between the tornados and the oh just forget it lily i wasnteven talking about that anyway cam let out a frustrated sigh well what were you talking about then honestly they expect me to keep track of every little thing i know i sound like a sulky little brat but that beside the point i was trying to point out the fact that james is trying rather too hard with violet hunter i raised my eyebrows so the hussy has a name oh merlin i boarding on obsessive this is not good your point being cam rolled his eyes well obviously he trying to make you jealous and by the looks of it he managing splendidly he looked pointedly at my dairy oh shut up see if i care that he being a git he the one who wontlet me explain and he doesntsay what he means he just does stuff and expects that to be enough cam face distorted with disgust that was far too much information i think the mental images may have just scarred me i punched him lightly oh shut up you big jesse of course i explained things to cam and tri when we meet them down at breakfast it was much easier the second time round seeing as i had my ever helpful friends to offer support and of course their own comments on the situation i believe bridget summed it up nicely basically james snogged lily she freaked when she woke up the next morning and avoided james like the dragon pox james got pissed and found lily and then asked her what she felt for him before being all melodramatic and flouncing off in a strop to leave our poor lily all bewildered luckily sirius came along and gave her a few pointers so now she finally realised she has a thing for james only now he pissed and she at a lose as to what to do as you can imagine she was quite red in the face after that rather detailed tirade what he going to achieve by making me jealous hmmm i mean apart from convincing me further of his gittishness proving more to himself than anyone else that he still one of hogwarts most sought after bachelors oh and you know getting his own back for when he was wallowing in misery and you were all happy and completely unaffected my mouth formed an o shape well he really is stupid git then isnthe i say after a minute as the players walk onto the pitch cam gives me a side was glance correction a stupid git you happen to be head over heels for bollocks he got me there i have to say blast james and his being so well so bloody him oh look their off hey you cantdo that not even a minute in and the slytherins are playing dirty i just know this isntgoing to be pretty mind you quidditch never is sunday 12th february detention in yougarty dungeon pickling what i suspect to be some poor unfortunate late animals spleens and other squealchy bits well i was right when i said it wasntgoing to end pretty the slytherins true to form played with very underhanded tactics and seriously injured one of the ravenclaw beaters i doubt the poor girls hair will ever be the same the end result was not pleasing well not for the gryffindors anyway it was a close game and ravenclaw won by the catching of the snitch much to the annoyance of the slytherins ravenclaw managed to pull away a bit towards the end despite all their efforts legal and otherwise ravenclaw turned out to be quite a good team much to the despair of the gryffindor team apparently this has upped the ante and means gryffindor have to win their next match which is against ravenclaw by a certain amount of points dont ask me how it works all i know is that the gryffindor team needs to work their arses off to get the cup and that because cam told me so i was only there for the therapy which was quite helpful to be honest screaming your lungs out and shouting various insults at people who cant even hear you is surprisingly therapeutic especially when the git who you are actually quite ticked off with is within your line of sight i think nessa may be on to something here hmmm maybe i should take her advice more often oh god no i retract my last statement i just recalled some of her so called advice and it always leads to trouble her advice would also be the reason why i am now glumly pickling the various parts of some poor creatures anatomy i swear i ve never known animal parts to disappear so quickly from the potions store cupboard though yougarty did say something about waiting for a student in detention who actually knew how to preserve potion ingredients properly sometimes i really wish i was devoid of intellect then i would be scrubbing floors or something rather than fiddling about with slippery body parts why exactly am i in detention in the first place never mind playing about with dead things well that would be because i followed nessa advice and really let myself go in regards to the quidditch i was not impressed with slytherin okay yes they are a good team talent wise but they are a good team talent wise that cheats at every opportunity some of the slytherins i friendly with are actually quite ashamed of their team lack of sportsmanship but apparently the captain a bit loopy arentthey all and is determined to win the cup this year through means fair or foul hmmm sounds a bit nutty to me but then james has the gryffindors up at 5 30 in the morning to practice so i would say he only one rung down the crazy ladder or maybe it just because he hasntbecome desperate yet anyway the slytherins won much to the despair of many hufflepuffs and gryffindors alike tried to comfort the ravenclaws most people were convinced that the slytherins had got away with murder and should be disqualified from the competition for the quidditch cup nessa tri and the twins were being particularly vocal i ll admit i was encouraging them hell i was probably louder then the rest of them put together i was having far to good a time bagging the slytherins to care much for what was going on around me hence i didntreally register when i smacked into regulus black and it completely escaped me that now would be a good time to shut up but no of course i didntshut up i just kept going knowing reggie as well as i do i know for a fact that he itching for a fight most of the time but straight after a quidditch match he just about ready to jump anything that moves and isntwearing slytherin robes mind out of the gutter please i think it has to do with all the adrenaline courses through his small mind it throws out the already wavering chemical balance so me one of his favourite punching bags verbally bashing the good slytherin name at the top of my voice right in front of dear reggie offers up a chance to good to miss first came the verbal abuse he had the nerve to call me a sore loser i almost smacked him one well i did but that came later to begin with i gave him a dressing down on his obscene quidditch tactics you call that playing quidditch more like a demonstration by thugs r us surely your keeper cantbe that bad that you have to physically take out the opposing chasers watch it mudblood our keeper has more talent in his little toe than the whole gryffindor team put together oh really is that why the last gryffindor slytherin was such an embarrassment so you re keeper has what it takes but the rest of you are hopeless then we carried on like this for a while until reggie finally cracked his cool and tried to hex me stressing the tried he wasnt very successful i think he tried to through some silly dark spell at me that his cousin bellatrix taught him lucky for me i had the help of his other cousin narcissa and that wonderful little blocking spell that does the bouncing thing quite nifty really not only does it block the spell but it causes it to rebound upon it creator but it first bounces of the closest object so they think they re safe for a moment but really they re not as i said rather nifty however black managed to dodge it and then i cursed him with that little jig hex that provides entertainment for all he cursed me with some tickling charm or what not i swear to merlin i have never laughed so hard in my life we both attempted to throw a few more hexes and curses but between me laughing my head off and reggie dancing about the place they never seemed to find their mark well as you can imagine that wasntgoing to stop the two of us i think we both lunged at each other at approximately the same time as our little disagreement turned far from pretty we were a tangle of arms and legs going everywhere trying to cause as much damage to the other as possible all the while i cackling the wicked witch of the east and blacks legs are trying to out do any passing leprechauns i positive this caused much needed amusements for the masses as none of my beloved friends or peers came to my assistance i believe they were all to busy pissing themselves laughing to lend a hand eventually it was fogarty who came to investigate the source of the students delight and he was most displeased with what he saw well that what he lead us to believe but secretly i sure he found it just as amusing as everyone else ms evans mr black stop this at once there is no need for such violence he tried to get close enough o pull us apart but he copped a foot in the stomach i not entirely sure who foot it was to be honest could ve been blacks but i willing to take credit for it seeing as he d just been winded fogarty decided to back off and call for reinforcements mr potter ms bones please assist me to put a stop to this nonsense you wont get any help from that quarter yougarty we ve already tried sir but to part them physically you re more likely to get a kick in the teeth well have you tried using your wand ms bones now now not need to be patronising black and i were still giving no heed to those around us but apparently we were quite the sight of course sir it had no effect though amy was becoming slightly distressed by this point well so nessa says and potter was apparently just looking on with a bemused look on his face well really that quite enough evans black that 15 points from each of your houses and if you dontstop this instant you ll both have detention after his orders went unheeded fogarty was quite at a loss as what to do two of his favourite students were trying to kill each other on the quidditch pitch and there was nothing he could do about it nessa said that amy appealed to james for help james do something he didnt even glance her way what do you want me to do lily seems to be handling herself quite well they ll both get tired before long and that ll be it amy rolled her eyes this is lily we re talking about she wontstop until she at least rendered him incapacitated for the rest of his life and you cantvery well date her if she in azkaban james mumbled something under his breath before taking out his wand rhi reckons she never seen anything like it a simple flick of his wrist and we were sailing in opposite directions the gryffindors caught me and the slytherins caught reggie both groups moved in opposite directions i suppose to drag us off to the hospital wing hoping to use different corridors not that either of us were going to go easily i d like to make it very clear right now that regulus came off looking a whole lot worse than i did okay so we were both covered in blood scratches and bruises but he still came off far worse than i did i cant remember exactly when the tickling charm was removed but i do know that i didntstop glaring at regulus until he was out of sight i think this has just upgraded our personal vendetta to all out war though some how i dontthink regulus is going to take me on in single handed combat any time soon my friends were fussing about with my bruises and such but i think all that adrenaline just numbed that pain as i had to have my multiple bruises and bleeding lip pointed out to me by a rather hysterical rhi and a none to calm nessa sirius chose this moment to put in his two knuts worth you know lily if it wasntunder pain of death i could kiss you about now i raised my eyebrows at him dont give me that look you re a lovely girl and all but i do value my life however i am greatly indebted to you for that lovely privilege of seeing my younger prat of a brother have the stuffing knocked out of him by a girl i narrowed my eyes what he thinks he d fair any better okay so maybe is a good deal bigger than regulus and has some fighting abilities does not mean i couldnthave a fair go at him i could really i could it most likely i wouldntsurvive but i could have a damn good shot er i mean your brilliant lilykins he added hastily before dashing off i heard him speaking to james as cam and tri took me up to the hospital wing promise me you wontget on her bad side any time soon i rather like having a best mate huh he already on my bad side the great git but one consolation was that the hussy had disappeared from his side madame wilkes cast me a foreboding look when tri and cam deposited me on a bed in the hospital wing thankfully regulus was making such a racket moaning about his pains and aliments that wilkes had hardly any time to scold me for my disgraceful behaviour as she put it and if she had it her way i would be in the hospital wing for a good week to make sure all the bruises had healed probably but as it was black was taking all her time so after dinner i was free to go oooh that has to be the shortest hospital visit i ve ever had brilliant but of course yougarty was waiting for me when i came out and he assigned me this lovely job of preparing his potion ingredients apparently black still too unwell to be released from the hospital wing so he doing his detention tomorrow stupid git i suppose it not that bad i mean i could have been assigned to help williams with her special trees that would have been the end for me i afraid thankfully it just this musty old dungeon these rather unnaturally slimy body parts and me fogarty had some rather pressing potion papers to attend to and scuttled off to his office pft i bet you anything he got a rather pressing date with some fire whiskey rather than grading papers though i have to say i dontmind in the least as i was able to get through what he left for me and there doesntappear to be any more slimy things lying about so i guess i can just wander about a bit until a fogarty comes back or b i get overly bored and leave a note and leg it well well well what do we have here it looks like the 7th years have been making some rather interesting potions the temptation to play about with james is very great but i shall resist temptation i am not that weak i refuse to be that weak oh but i could just no one would know well james might guess but there d be no proof no bad lily we are attempting to win him over not cause him to annoyance true he might rethink his git like attitude but no stop that we are not going to do anything i will later regret i know this sounds all rather schizophrenic but some times i think i am when dealing with the ever tricky lily part of my multifaceted personality or maybe i just refuse to accept that i do actually have those traits in my personality hmmm what am i going to do about this james thing seeing as he annoyed at me because i didnttell him straight out that i head over heels for him and i off him because he was demanding that i profess my undying love while he just got to analyse the situation first so neither of us is in fact talking to the other and we are both doing our best to make the other one even more pissed off such a loving relationship maybe i should talk to remus he usually quite good at out lining what the hell is going on in his demented best mate head not going near sirius again though i think i shall have to find out what the hell he knows first before going near him again bloody james why does he have to make everything so difficult sunday 12th february lunch ewww here i am trying to eat my lunch and cam and tri are sitting opposite me having a competition as to who can out gross the other i dont even want to know what cam planning to do with those peas but it enough to put me off my cottage pie and i may never drink tea again after that little demonstration from tri of how the mouth and the nasal cavity are connected i may be at lunch but i sure as hell dontwant to eat anything with those two in front of me i sure projectile vomit would win the competition but in all honesty i d rather keep what little of my lunch i ve managed to get down nessa just finds it funny and oh merlin now she giving it a shot my friends are mad rhi is over at the ravenclaw table talking to lorelei very nice girl but has a strange effect on the opposite sex according to rhi her grandmother or someone was an ondine a bit like mermaids only they donthave the fish tails they just look like beautiful young women they are found in germany and scandanavia and young men usual fall into obsessive love with them at the sight of their long golden hair coral lips and sparkling green eyes and that would be a perfect description of lorelei every now and then you see some poor bloke catch sight of her and his eyes ll glaze over for a second and you just know that for the rest of the day he ll be mooning over her but fortunately lorelei is a lovely girl who finds they whole thing rather embarrassing to be honest i just so glad some one like rosemary doesnthave these particular traits or i think we d all be in trouble her ego would take over britain god knows where the twins have got to they get like this sometimes bugger off on their own to do well i ve no idea most likely get into mischief and pass themselves off as each other while doing things they are not suppose to do bridget not with star boy which is a start seeing it hard to separate those two some days but i ll tell you who is fawning over black phinny he he he he he i know i shouldntlaugh but come on she a crack up that one though not exactly known for her bravery i wonder if oh my chocolate now that just low right he really done it this time there no going back now would you believe rosie is flirting with james well actually that very believable but him flirting back not so believable but yep i just checked again he acting interested in what she has to say and from the glare that sirius is sending james he not too impressed either okay so i can deal with him flirting with that brunette and basically any other girl this school possesses but not rosy the evil cow who thinks i jealous of her and out to ruin her entire life because in reality she out to ruin mine so that how it going to be is it right hmpf right two can play at this game matey you just wait you are so going to pay for this james potter where nick ah of course there he is peacefully eating his lunch at the hufflepuff table completely unaware that he about to become a pawn in a very dangerous game of what i guessing is relationship chess i may be awful at chess but i not above playing dirty if james is going to go full steam ahead into that dangerous terrain and would you look at that curly sue is safely out of sight hmmm i wonder if nick would like a chocolate chip cookie the library hiding from james in case he decides to hunt me down and follow through with those glares of death oooh dear i think i just racked up some major bad karma points definitely did nothing for my previous allocations to one of the deeper circles of hell well james deserved that he was flirting about with rosie right in front of me the cheeky sod that he is i was rather cruel i admit but that was the intention so i really dont have any defences on this one i picked up the plate of cookies and started off down the gryffindor table towards james i pretty sure tri cam and nessa thought i had flipped my lid as they stopped their game to watch me saunter off down the table they knew that i was definitely not going to make a peace offering to james that would just be un lilyish oh no i sauntered right on past james completely ignoring him and star boy effectively ensuring i had their full attention i made my way over to the hufflepuff table thankful for the first time today that my hair had refused to stay in it braid and hoping to god i looked alright in my jeans and sweater i had to stop my self physically slapping myself nick friends already think i a bit mad i dontreally need to work on the nut case area of my personality with them nadia and darren were with nick so that made me feel a little bit better about i was about to do because i felt i could most likely tell them what i was up to and they would laugh anyway i slid into the seat next to nick and offered my plate of cookies about they all gave me a warm welcome and said it was lovely to see me and how was i feeling after having beat reggie to a pulp all very sweet nick just raised his eyebrows at the cookies er lily it very nice of you to think of us like this but we have a plate of cookies already boys they re so bloody thick nadia not though ah but this plate of cookies makes steam come out the ears of a certain gryffindor quidditch captain see girls are far more up with the emotional warfare nick mouth formed a little o darren found the whole thing rather amusing yeah that ll certainly do it after you sat with us at the quidditch match i dontthink herbology has ever has ever been the same potter not exactly the forgiving type i rolled my eyes no he more the gigantic prat type nadia smiled and looked over my shoulder well i can tell you he certainly not happy about this little t te t te especially you leaning on nick like you are lily i felt like the cat that got the canary nick wasntso pleased though lily please dontdrag me into this i just got paired with potter in potions and i d prefer to make it to my eighteenth birthday thanks i slide him a look but kept my hand and chin on his shoulder dont worry he ll be sorry if he so much as touches your quill it not my quill i worried about he has a point but honestly i would hex james to within an inch of his life he did anything to nick quit whining what i actually wanted to talk to you about was dana you know the loopy blonde who has you at the top of her wish list can you get off my shoulder first i think my arms going to sleep i glared at him no now about dana she very nice really a tad aggressive maybe but rather sweet most of the time i know who she is she not shy is she dana shy why do those to words just refuse to go together er no she not but then what do you expect of someone with veela blood a shrinking violet more like a man eating venus fly trap i see your point i thought she must have something like that in her like lorelei winters but what do think of her would you say go out on a date with her that was when nick slide me a sly look and then he turned his head to whisper in my ear cant we talk about this later somewhere a little more private rather than the middle of the great hall at lunch time i just looked at him trying very hard to hold back my laughter he so very cute when he flustered nope that would defeat the purpose of this little chat plus darren and nadia want to know just as much as me by this point nadia and darren where close to bursting from laughter oh nick whisper in lily ear again please potter sprayed his pumpkin juice all over macdonald the last time maybe next time he ll throw something nick glared at nadia yeah at my head this is brilliant lily you have to come sit with us more often potter gone all red and black yelling at him something about being a gigantic prat i just grinned and used every ounce of self control not to turn around and take a peek nick on the other hand covered his face with his hand i dead your lucky your so cute lily or i d have to hex you i laughed and slapped him playfully dont be silly nick you wouldnthex me your right i wouldntbecause if i did potter would have me in the hospital wing for the next month i decided now was time to take my leave as i had achieve what i set out to do now i am free to go enjoy my cookies in peace i left nadia and darren still sniggering at nick who was moaning about how he really had wanted to make it to eighteen before having every bone in his body broken i sneaked a look at james and he looked positively livid he was having a heated conversation with star boy when he looked up i couldnt help but look straight back at him and raise my eyebrows in a silent question he he he he didnt look happy i think the only person who looked more put out was dear rosie i smirked all the way up here to the library where i have miraculously managed to sneak in some cookies so here i am smirking to myself eating my chocolate chip cookies nicely hidden in the divination section of the library i just discovered this place i mean i dontknow why i never thought of it before i mean really who going to come to the divination section no one seriously i ve thought about this and it true no one who takes that class would visit a whole section devoted to it in the library most of the people who take divination are slackers who did it to get out of ruins and therefore just fudge their assignments to their professors liking so there nutty head fruit loop will think they re all brilliant and there fore dontneed books to do their course while those a couple of sandwiches short of a picnic who think the subject has actual substance will have their own personal library on the subject and wouldntbe seen dead reading these pre medieval texts see brilliant means i the only one in here and that a on a busy day perfect hiding spot from nosy marauders wait hold that thought i can see remus charming smile coming towards me damn it how do they do that no matter where i go these damn marauders seem to be able to find me still in the library considering finding a nice bomb shelter yes a bomb shelter would do nicely though preferably with a back door just in case james did manage to find me would also come in handy if rosie got to me first i think a fidielus charm is taking things a bit too far but i could probably recommend one to nick poor nick i really didntmean for him to be pulled into this i was hoping james would more concentrate on the fact that i was being a tart but no some how he got it into his tiny brain that nick was the one to initiate things oh please he saw me sashay my way over to the hufflepuff table start conversation share my beloved cookies and lean on nick and yet nick is the one causing trouble i think it was the whispering in my ear that set james off according to remus he had been handling it quite well suppressing his outrage and what not but as soon as he saw what he thought was interest he went a little bit mad again poor nick he really is too polite he was just trying to get me to shut up and look what happens he been put down for water torture followed by beheading i should probably document my meeting with remus it was rather enlightening remus seemed to just materialise out of the book shelves grinning like a fool reminded me very strongly of the cheshire cat from alice in wonderland anyway he was chirpy and his eyes were all twinkly with amusements at the afternoon events at least i think it was at the afternoon events it could also be at my predictability to always find sanctuary in the library i swear even the mad old battel axe that runs this place is even starting to look upon me in an endearing light not quite sure if that good or not best not to think about it i ll stick to what i know best when in doubt be in denial anyway remus slid into the chair opposite me and just sat their grinning i finally gave in the silence contest my curiosity won as it always does what remus just kept on grinning no seriously why are you sitting there grinning like a maniac remus chuckled to himself for a bit before answering me just thinking how brilliant the infamous lily evans is my eyebrows disappeared into my hair me brilliant remus nodded at buggering things up i d have to agree and famous for said brilliance at buggering things up you also have my consensus the grin appeared again only this time accompanying a shake of the head you really are a strange girl last year i got the fact that you were slightly odd but this year has just shown me how very eccentric you really are it quite bewildering really someone a bit slow on the up take now arentthey well what do think it like to actually be me then are you about to come to the epiphany explaining hwy i always so very confused i thought it was common knowledge i a bit lose upstairs i tapped my head and rolled my eyes for effect honestly after six years i thought people would be a bit clued in by now i think your eccentricity is what makes you so very likeable and i pretty sure those strange thought patterns of yours is the reason why you re able to push james buttons so well uh oh i knew this was going to come up remus couldntgo along happily analysing me oh no he had to bring the gigantic prat into things that little display in the great hall earlier was quite the stroke of genius all you have to do is smile at another bloke and james is ready to blow his top i winced i dontknow if you noticed he can get rather jealous remus added in a bored tone rather unnecessarily i must say i uh got that yeah stupid git james i mean though remus can be quite the git at times like oh i dont know now he puts me on edge remus obviously james just ticks me off i never know what he getting at and it can be rather unsettling at times i swear only remus knows where he going with these conversations but makes him go really mad is when what ever bloke you have bestow a throw away smile looks as though he may reciprocate hit the bloody roof when he thinks some other bloke has a chance i not that oblivious you know i did catch on that james is a tad possessive remus had been doodling on spare bit of parchment while saying all this but then he pulled up his head and gave me a rather owlish look the big blue eyes staring intently into my own rather more anxious eyes the strange thing about all this though is you happen to be the only one who has this particular effect on him the number of girls i ve seen play mind games whether it be the simpering girlfriend or the hard to get ice queen not one of them has got him nearly as riled up as you do and what i find to be the best bit is you donteven try to wind james up well today an exception but usually all you have to do is be you i sudden thought hit me struck me like a bloody anvil would also be appropriate but i a bloody nut case you even said so yourself why on earth would you want your friend dating a known psycho and can i just say i am not taking all the responsibility for today james is just as much at fault as i am i mean rosie honestly remus chuckled a bit more if it any comfort i did try to warn him about that one however james was trying to coax a reaction out of you insisted he was prepared to go to extreme lengths also sirius almost boxed his ears for being such a prat but james hit him with the leg locker before he could get within range i just stared at him with my mouth hanging open and nose scrunched up in a incredulous expression has this boy never heard of flowers i mean there are some pretty fool proof ways of getting a girl attention but flittering about with the unhuman social tiger moth that makes said girl life a misery is not one of then remus sighed he lightly miss guided slightly okay he wandering the forest without a guide but i do try to give him a few pointers he just doesntlike to be told what to do it aversion to authority kicking in rather like someone else i know he gave me a piercing look oh who that remus rolled his eyes anyway so what it going to take for the two of you put yourselves out of your misery and relieve the rest of us of a never ending headache dont look at me like that it not just down to me you know there is another party at fault as well why dontyou go demand answers from him i already tried that but unfortunately all i got was a few curses and some unidentifiable murmurings hmmm i thought your eyebrows looked a bit mismatched remus hand flew to his head and he tentatively felt his eyebrows be that as it may james really isntin a talkative mood when it comes to you but then he never is to be honest he gave me one of those calculating looks you really are a baffling for our poor james but he determined to figure you out you re like his personal riddle he has to work out all on his own he wonttell sirius peter or i anything which is ever so slightly annoying as sirius is getting positively whinny at being left out i gave him an innocent look it not my problem what james does i sure sirius will manage some how for my sanity sake i hope so but anyway back on topic since you are the more talkative of the two i thought i might extract a little information you re an arrogant prat at times do you know that remus what makes you think you ll get any more out of me than you will out of james then he smirked yes that right smirked i was so very tempted to sock him one my merlin i an aggressive little sod now arenti because lily dear you re not very good at concealing your emotions and when caught at the right time you ll blab to anyone anything that comes to mind he knows me far too well this one well what do you want me to say then remus slide me a sly glance i was hoping it was something along the lines of you re desperately in love with james and you ll do anything to make this right i just gave him a are you quite mad look okay so maybe that a bit much but do you at least like the idiot i screwed up my face hmmm not really sure about the whole spilling my guts to remus thing but here goes well yes i have to say i have unfortunately become fond of him it rather sad really considering how much he annoys the hell out of me well that a start so i take it your not exactly impressed by his recent antics then what do you bloody think decidedly not well all i can say is at least we ve established a mutual liking how we get the two of you in the same room with hexes being thrown is still a mystery but we ll take it one step at a time this was getting confusing it was liking talking to one of my inner voices only it was in the fleshy form of remus strange wait one cotton pickin minute that just the point though remus he hasntsaid he likes me he tried to get a me to make the first verbal commitment yes he snogged me but that all he hasntactually voiced any requests such as lily will you go out with me just what am i supposed do throw myself at him and hope that he ll lower himself to maybe reciprocate the feeling s if they are to his liking remus was looking thoughtful you have a point there have a point you bet i have a bloody point though it would be lovely if remus could shed some light on the inner workings of his best mates minefield of a brain that all you can say you have a point there i know i have a point remus hence why i am so utterly perplexed by whatever little games james has decided we re playing bloody relationship chess i swear i ll never be any good at it after that remus rambled on about this that and the other how james is just growing up and that it a confusing time for him well it a confusing time for me too primarily due to our dear mr potter stupid git stupid git prattish friends remus finally got the fact that i wasntlistening to him and buggered off hopefully to annoy some other poor soul speaking of prattish friends my dear nessa has just slid into the seat next to me whatever can she want to congratulate on that little stunt you pulled earlier complete genius james was floored i am humbled by the cunning that sits before me vh well thank you i glad you enjoyed the show but er why are we writing notes ev because someone just spilt an entire beaker of some disgusting looking potion in the transfiguration section and pince is on the warpath plus i dontwant any over zealous gossip mongers to hear our conversation what are you on about over zealous gossip mongers who going to be hanging around here solely to hear us talking take a look around lils you re quite the centre of interest oh my chocolate what do they think this is a zoo you know you ve gone the most stunning shade of scarlet i ever did see set of your eyes so very nicely a blush is quite becoming on you ms evans oh shush why are they all staring i mean there nothing to look at nothing to look at are you completely barmy here we have the ever so lovely lily evans who has not only given one of hogwarts biggest heart throbs who also happens to be head boy the absolute run around just today she been seen slagging off with a deliriously dishy hufflepuff 7th year causing our beloved head boy to blow a gasket that what they re saying is it well there a couple of versions floating about nobody knows what going on between you two hell the both of you donteven know people are just filling in the blanks great that makes me feel so much better not only do i have to figure out how to win over the bloke i fancy but i have the whole of hogwarts watching with bated breath oh yes i feel so much better now that you ve informed what a spectacle i was making of myself well if you really want to know i think it more james antics that have been attracting attention you ve just been happily going along being you and it doesnthelp that half an hour a go remus blasted james about his behaviour in the common room for all to hear oh and did i mention remus also told him he was a head case who needs to get a few things in perspective and james yelled back that he was a traitor and he shouldntbe taking your side i ll kill him who remus james remus james both of them oooh goody a good old fashioned blood bath can i watch what about sirius can you do him in too he always gets on my nerves ugh let go i feel the walls closing in on me dontworry it not the walls it just more people have heard about today various events you re not helping though a nice cup of tea would all right to the kitchens it is some how i feel i going to need many cups of tea to get through whatever this is hi everyone yes i know i said i would update soon but well by my standards this is soon okay yes it has been sitting on my computer three quarters of the way done for a couple of weeks but that beside the point i ve had quite a bit on what with christmas and new
