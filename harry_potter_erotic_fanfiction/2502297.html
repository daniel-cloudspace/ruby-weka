mentioned are hers chapter 1 lily kate evans privet drive was quite a dull street indeed the houses were all architecturally identical having the same shingled roofs and potted plants on the perfectly paved driveways the lawns smelled of freshly cut grass and were never parched looking the gardens were always perfectly pruned showing beautiful arrays of colored flowers while kitchens always held the aroma of freshly baked cookies and mince pies expensive cars were showcased prominently in the driveways and always looked spotless the people inhabiting this street were perfectly nice but once inside their air conditioned homes took up their favorite hobby spying on and gossiping about their fellow neighbors one could say that it was all a pointless act trying to impress the person living beside you but those living on privet drive took pride in the art of gossip in such a neighborhood nothing extraordinary ever occurred that is to say until the beginnings of each summer holiday what caused the street to liven up well none other then lily evans at that precise moment loud screams could be heard coming from the evans house hold this had been a regular occurrence during the summer for the youngest evans daughter had returned home from her boarding school or so the neighbors thought lily and her older sister petunia were not the closest sisters in the world the occupants of privet drive kept a close eye on the pair of girls hoping something exciting would take place and give them something to gossip about mrs boggleskin was the nosiest woman living on privet drive how she loved when controversy came to light she was peeking through her kitchen drapes with a pair of binoculars wondering what could be going on she noted the peculiar gold sparks that seemed to be bouncing off the walls inside the house the loud shrieks and caught a glimpse of petunia evans yanking on lily long red hair whatever could be going on mrs boggleskin hobbled over to her husband quickly and started to search through some drawers what are you doing by the window dear mr boggleskin an older ailing man asked his wife politely something is about in the evan household i must know what it is she said offhandedly has that pretty evans girl come back from her boarding school mr boggleskin asked hacking horribly of course she is home you old crone she comes home every summer and causes complete havoc mrs boggleskin said rustling through some drawers for a better pair of binoculars i quite like the girl mr boggleskin said affectionately she reminds me of myself when i was young then you must have been a fair bit of trouble now keep your nonsense to yourself i must hear mrs boggleskin barked shushing her poor husband such a nice young lady mr boggleskin said ignoring his wife and rambling on be quiet i must hear the girls round the neighborhood are probably listening in right now mrs boggleskin said roughly peering through her visual aids what are you up to now lily evans mrs boggleskin murmured shutting his eyes to take a nap v author notes v please continue to read and review 3 chapter 18 saving friends when lily entered through the jelly barrier the water felt like ice it caused her to shiver up her spine but perhaps it wasntthe cold just her nerves it was eerie to be able to breathe underwater lily didntquite understand how it was possible considering she didntsprout gills but the merpeople were quite smart kanool waved lily roxanne and sirius over to the hippocampus because he was eager to go lily walked up to one calm looking one who was eating seaweed quite enthusiastically it wasvery large and it took her a few tries to swing her leg over the fish horse roxanne had trouble as well but sirius helped her up sirius got up on his creature on the first try when everyone gave thethumbs up kanool lightly kicked the side of his creature and it sped off lily roxanne and sirius did the same making sure to catch up with kanool the creatures were extremely fast and agile in the water so the three students had to hold on tight the water was getting darker signaling the sun would be setting soon lily slightly urged her creature to go faster the terrain changed dramatically as the magnificent palace was out of sight and was replaced by jagged rock cliffs and dark fissures surprisingly it had not taken long for them to reach the kappa lair they lived closer to the palace then lily expected kanool stopped and pointed at a massive hole under a cave he was signaling that they would have to swim up it to find the underwater cave sirius waved his hand in thanks and kanool sped off toward the castle once more the students all gave each other meaningful looks tied the hippocampus to a large jutting rock and started to swim up to the cave when they first entered they could tell there was light up there the merpeople used white crystals as their light for they gave off a cool glow so sirius guessed it must be a mining cave their heads popped up to the surface quietly and the kappas did not notice the cave was fairly large and was lighted by the thousands of crystals that were in the walls sirius was right about the cave being a mining cave there were three monkey like kappas in the cave all in a corner sharpening sticks with their webbed hands james remus and erica were still alive and were tied up on the wall opposite lily roxanne and sirius neither the kappas nor the captured students noticed the presence of lily roxanne and sirius which gave them time to strategize alright here what we will do roxanne you need to try and free remus erica and james ok lily and i will distract the kappas and try to trick them use the spear to cut their bonds sirius said roxanne nodded on the count of three lily and i pop out at the kappas roxanne hang back so they dontknow you are here so they focus on lily and i ok sirius said ready lily sirius said grabbing her hand as i will ever be she said gulping one two three they both yelled popping out of the water and walking on solid ground the kappas jumped in surprise and immediately grabbed the crude spears they had been sharpening james remus and erica looked at them in surprise and james frantically started getting loss one kappa approached sirius and lily with a maniac grin on its face what it grinning about lily had holding out her spear threateningly i thinks you re hot lily sirius said trying to focus on what they should do next when sirius spoke two of the kappas ran at lily and sirius sirius started dueling with spears with one and another tackled lily to the ground lily was rolling around the cave floor with one frantically trying to get the water to spill out of its head some water had spilled but not enough meanwhile roxanne had sneaked out of the water with the three kappa attention on sirius and lily she ran over and started untying remus crude seaweed bonds the kappa had lily pinned to the floor lily spear forgotten it smiled again and looked like it was about to biteher neck it put its hands around her throat lowering its head sirius help me lily screamed trying to get the kappa to release her throat james frantically struggled and called out to roxanne through the seaweed covering his mouth roxanne couldntdistinguish what he was saying but when he kept inclining his head toward lily she saw her o my god lily roxanne called out roxanne removed the spear from her back and with precision threw it at thehead of the kappa strangling lily it hit the kappa in the head and the kappa let go of lily it fell to the ground in pain and all the water spilled out of its head lily coughed and rolled onto her stomach gasping for air another kappa noticed roxanne for the first time and started running towards her lily still on the ground grabbed the sack of lobalugs from her back pocket and released them they scurried toward the running kappa and started to bite him on the feet the kappa reached down to his feet in pain for the venomhad penetrated his veins when he reached down to remove the bugs all the water in the hollow spot of his head spilled out onto the cave floor two down one to go lily murmured sirius was still battling fiercely with the last kappa and having no luck in weakening it just then lily had a great idea hey water brains look what we did to your friends lily screamed at the remaining kappa diverting the attention away from the sirius and onto her lily what are you doing yelled sirius get down on all fours sirius lily screamed as the kappa charged at her sirius did what he was told and watched as lily continued to dodge the kappa finally lily had the kappa in place it was in front of her and sirius was behind it hunched down instead of the kappa launching itself at lily lily launched herself at the kappa she pushed the creature toward sirius and when it impacted sirius it fell over his back spilling the contents of its head with it that was brilliant yelled sirius getting up and kicking the kappa in the head for good measure thank you mr black lily said finally smiling he encompassed her in a big hug and whispered we did it in her ear lily let tears escape and turned toward roxanne who was still trying to free the others when she saw lily and sirius hugging she ran over to them and joined in this made sirius very happy they all congratulated each other and cried save sirius who chose to laugh at them crying i sorry if i interrupting but can you guys untie us now remus said laughing from the other side of the cave the three laughed and walked over to the three imprisoned people lily started working on erica bonds roxanne remus and sirius james sirius got james out and they gave each other brotherly hugs lily finally undid erica bonds and they hugged like reunited sisters are you ok lily said still crying out of happiness i fine lily you were brilliant out there erica said smiling erica had a few minor cuts on her forehead but other then that was in perfect condition when roxanne had set remus free erica crushed them both in big hugs god remus you shouldnthave come after me erica said in his shoulder you know i couldntleave you remus whispered lily was whipped the dirt off of her forehead when she felt a light tap on her shoulder she turned around and was face to face with james hi lily he said smiling james also had bruises and cuts on his head lily let out a sob and leapt into his arms james wrapped her in a comforting hug rubbing her back to make her feel better they stayed in the hug for a couple minutes as everyone else did i thought you all were dead lily sobbed and it would be all my fault that not true lily james said softly i let go of you james i couldnthold on she said dontyou see lily you saved me you put the charm on me and saved me from drowning now you and the others saved us from the kappas james said pulling away from the hug and looking her straight in the eyes she smiled at him with her tear stained face and james thought she looked beautiful the group of friends finally calmed all of their nerves and decided to head back to the surface roxanne took out the gillyweed clearwater mixture kanool had given her and administered it the remus erica and james they all cringed at the taste how will we get back to the surface swim erica asked curiously you will see sirius said grinning the six friends exited the mining cave and headed for the hippocampus that were still tied up to therocks james and lily erica and remus and sirius and roxanne all paired up on the creatures and sirius lily and erica all choose to drive james wrapped his hands around lily waste and she kicked off the ascent to the surface was dark and when the group got closer to the surface they could see the moon shining brightly looking back lily admired the mermaid palace that she was sure she would visit again they broke the surface 3 minutes later and took in the fresh cool air the creatures took the six students to the shore and with a high pitched nay dived back into the water and headed to the palace the sixth years walked through the shallow water all sopping wet and collapsed on the dry shore it was quite chilly out and the moon illuminated the landscape beautifully i dontknow about you guys but i am dead tired sirius announced eyes drooping slightly well the moon is high in the sky i would predict it is about 12 o clock remus said we missed the whole day saving you lot roxanne said mumbling in the grass erica was so still on the ground she looked dead when remus went to check on her he noticed she was sleeping peacefully as the students got up erica piggy backing on remus they headed toward the castle they entered hogwarts silently afraid to attract unwanted attention they arrived at the fat lady portrait without disturbance which was lucky tea leaves roxanne whispered to the portrait no darling the password had been changed the fat lady whispered back o damn murmured remus lily you are a prefect what the password sirius said to lily well i missed the meeting rescuing them lily said pointing to the three great roxanne mumbled so i call this bit of stone floor sirius whispered sarcastically pointing to a spot well maybe i want that spot countered roxanne alright enough i know where we can go james said stopping the argument before it could start where lily asked the room of requirement james said good idea james remus said patting him on the back wha roxanne startled dontask just follow lily said tiredly james and sirius led the group down a hallway illuminating it with their wands james signaled everyone to stop and he walked past a doorway three times we need somewhere comfortable to sleep we need somewhere comfortable to sleep james muttered over and over again a small door appeared where the wall was blank before and james and the others entered inside were six single beds dressed in fine linen with a dividing curtain separating three on each side above each bed was a set of pajamas three male pairs and three female pairs alright sirius i was wrong you dontcount as a girl roxanne said cheerfully walking over to a bed hey i am the manliest most sirius started save it sirius said remus pushing sirius into the room i am so victimized sirius said dropping onto a bed dramatically and pretending to cry into his pillow james chuckled and pulled the curtain closed so everyone could change lily was dressed in a pair of emerald green pajamas there was a t shirt with a fat green frog on it clapping its hands and a pair of pants with frogs playing the fiddle on them alright these are kind of weird lily said cocking an eyebrow at her appearance roxanne pair was just as strange her pajamas were bright pink and had fluffy pink bunnies stuffing their faces with carrots on them little carrots were dancing on her pajama bottoms and shaking their thang what the hell she muttered they were definitely the strangest pajamas she had ever seen well mine arentany better erica said noticing the other girl grimaces one erica shirt were two beavers jumping on a trampoline and cackling like hags when they fell on the bottoms the beavers were smacking their tales together and doing the patty cake your right erica they aren t laughed lily just then some male voices floated over the curtain hahaha sirius james said killing himself laughing um girls are your pajama as retarded as ours called out remus they sure are erica replied grimacing the boys pulled back the curtains and everybody laughed the boys found lily fiddle playing frogs and roxanne dancing carrots the funniest the girls however found sirius outfit hilarious sirius pajamas were one whole piece they looked like something an infant would wear it was buttoned up at the front and was baby blue even his feet were enclosed in fabric where your bonnet sirius roxanne said laughing tears pouring out of her eyes not funny people sirius said throwing the bed sheets around his pajamas i will have you all know they are very comfortable sirius said looking indignant remus outfit was one large nightshirt that came down to his ankles it was yellow and had kissing hearts on it he was also wearing large heart slippers remus looked quite uncomfortable indeed you look cute remus lily said covering her mouth trying not to laugh erica however was laughing quite hard remus turned red sorry she gasped james may have gotten the most normal looking pajamas but he also got the most annoying ones he was wearing only a pair of pajama pants but it had a little singing snitch on it you cantcatch me haha you can t haha the little snitch kept singing how do i turn it off james said to the group exasperated i ve seen those before you have to hit it to shut it up erica said james kept hitting his legs trying to get the little bugger but it was too fast it was eventually shut up however sirius james yelled out with a scandalized face sirius had smacked james in thebottom where the snitch was what i got it didnti sirius said you fags i ll be back in the morning the snitch said before disappearing in the pajamas it swore at me james said to the group everybody laughed and decided to get to bed it had been an extremely long day everyone jumped into his or her warm comfortable beds and remus turned out the lights night everybody night see you in the morning dontlet the bed bugs bite sweet dreams sleep tight night night all right enough already roxanne called out it was most certainly an eventful day lily thought and with that thought she drifted to sleep author notes so how

reviewing disclaimer all recognizable characters and places are property of the awesome j k rowling and i definitely do not own them j k rowling is brilliant and all harry potter characters and settings mentioned are hers chapter 2 crocodiles caimans and owls lillllyyyyy cried a hysterical horse faced girl scrambling to keep her bedroom door shut her thin knobby frame and lack of muscle was not helping her situation is there a problem petty cooed a smug looking redhead from her bedroom door you know very well what the problem is just wait till i tell mum and dad you set that that creature on me petunia evans bellowed in a high pitched screechy voice the redhead stifled a laugh petunia face was changing to a very abnormal purple color it your own fault you deliberately poured a pitcher of orange juice over my head at grandfather birthday party i swear i will never get that stain out of my white blouse growled lily evans her startling green eyes narrowing at the memory this ought to teach you not to mess with me she was quite touchy when it came to ruining perfectly beautiful items of her extensive wardrobe why you little freak petunia screamed holding the door to her bedroom closed with one hand whilst attempting to claw lily with the other lily mockingly laughed at her feeble attempts dodging her every move just as the screaming match between the ever so close sisters came to its peak the parentals showed up what the ruddy hell is going on here yelled a flustered mr evans father to the two girls screaming bloody murder mrs evans appeared behind him her eyes wide with anger mr evans was a tall man of about 6 4 with dark red hair and blue eyes he had a gentle fatherly nature about him but could take care of business when needed mrs evans was quite the opposite she was a petit woman with long blonde hair and emerald eyes the same colour as lily s she always demanded complete respect from her girls and they gave nothing less do you girls even know what time it is mrs evans demanded dressed in her night robe for such a small woman she was incredibly intimidating mummy this is all lily fault i swear petunia insisted innocently plastering on a sickly sweet act for her mum and dad no petunia started it lily returned in outrage enough mr evans ordered the girls immediately going silent his face suddenly crinkled in a mixture of confusion and curiosity what is that noise coming from your room petunia i would show you what is making the noise daddy but as the massive crocodile in my room seems to be irate at the moment i think it wise you donttake a peek said petunia through gritted teeth mr evans turned on lily in horror lily kate evans what did i say about conjuring large reptiles in the house lily knew that trying to convince her parents that transfiguring her sister crocodile skin boots into the real thing was reasonable was going to prove difficult i a spontaneous person i canthelp it but my blouse is ruined and lily started desperately you set a crocodile on your sister for ruining a favourite blouse cried lily mother katherine so frazzled that the curlers in her hair were beginning to unravel ok so maybe it was a little drastic just as lily was about to retort a tawny owl swooped in through the stairway window causing petunia to shriek and lily mother to take shelter behind her tall husband the owl dropped a letter neatly in front of lily before disappearing into the breezy night once more oh shit this is not going to be good lily muttered a frightened look etched on her face lily had conveniently forgotten the restriction for underage magic being only sixteen she was not permitted to do magic outside of her school hogwarts lily took out the letter from the brown official looking envelope bearing the ministry of magic seal dear ms evans it has come to our attention on this evening friday august 17 that you have transfigured a pair of boots into a living and breathing caiman an endangered reptilian animal only found in remote parts of the amazon though the spell itself was quite remarkable your behaviour is not permitted according to the restrictions of underage wizardry law you have performed magic illegally for you have not yet reached the age of seventeen therefore you are required to attend a hearing in which you will be tried and sentenced the hearing will be on sunday august 19 at 9 a m sharp and professor dumbledore has kindly offered to bring you seeing as your parents are unable to access the ministry of magic have a lovely evening yours sincerely ophelia bones law enforcement what is that letter about lily it seems late to be corresponding with friends lily father said sternly er well see i kind of have a little hearing to attend this weekend lily mumbled still quite shocked that she lily evans had unthinkingly performed illegal magic i practically a marauder lily thought shuddering a hearing lily evans never have i ever met such an irresponsible shouted her mother now turning the same shade of purple petunia had the shouting match continued throughout the night lily parents and petunia taking turns when one person voice became hoarse after awhile lily tuned them out her thoughts drifting to one thing that had bugged her since receiving the letter how did i manage to turn the boots into a caiman never knew they were endangered v author notes v please continue to read and review disclaimer all recognizable characters and places are property of the awesome j k rowling and i definitely do not own them j k rowling is brilliant and all harry potter characters and settings mentioned are hers chapter 3 busy bodies and kitchen utensils assuming the entire neighbourhood had awakened to the screaming match that had taken place at the evan household the previous night which the whole street had indeed awakened to there was the exciting prospect of gossip looming in the air mrs evans has received numerous phone calls the following morning from the busy bodies inhabiting privet drive asking for details and giving their two cents about the situation this had only enraged mrs evans further for she hated being gossiped about she did not take the same liking to rumours as the other women did and decided to keep the drapes shut so no nosy neighbours would peek into the house lily had taken to pacing in her room or twiddling her thumbs for the upcoming hearing was enough to drive her insane she had conveniently forgotten to remove the caiman from her sister bedroom insisting she was too tired to perform magic and it could get her into more trouble petunia had grudgingly slept in the guest bedroom for fear of having her limbs nibbled on during the night though the hearing could result in being expelled from hogwarts which she would be entering as a sixth year she could not help but feel excitement at the same time she had been trapped in her bedroom all summer trying not to encounter her bean pole of a sister and it had become quite a bore she did enjoy spending time with her parents whom she loved deeply but petunia always managed to spoil it lily would have loved to spend time with her best friend roxanne dewey but she was vacationing in the mediterranean with her posh pure blood parents she also wondered about her other friend erica jones but she was too busy visiting her muggle friends both had been rather preoccupied to owl lily but roxanne managed a few postcards and promised to buy her a stuffy lily had practically lost all connection with the wizarding world which was why she was excited about dumbledore coming hopefully the last 5 years haventbeen a hallucination lily snapped back from her daydream when she heard a light tapping coming from outside her freshly painted window she opened the window quickly and a magnificent midnight blue owl with a letter clutched in its talons flew in at first lily was frightened thinking it was another letter from the ministry once she checked the front for a seal she relaxed lily removed the letter and was shocked when she found who sent it what the bloody hell lily shrieked in disgust dear lillykins i dontthink i have ever been so proud of you breaking a ministry law shocking to think you had everyone including myself fooled about being a goodie two shoes you will be a marauder yet lily or perhaps a marauder girlfriend i can arrange both if you like arentyou thrilled to know i will be seeing you tomorrow i do miss teasing you and making you turn that funny purple colour when you get mad insert laughter here if you are thinking of possible ways to kill me dontwaste your time wands and weapons are checked at the front desk of the ministry i looked into that for my own safety see you tomorrow lillykins wear something presentable wontyou i know how you love prancing around in lingerie i wouldntput it past you anymore you naughty girl you but please this is a ministry hearing only joking love leave the knives at home please james potter xoxoxoxoxoxox prat lily murmured to herself before chucking the letter in the trashcan lily thought shouting might be out of the question as half of the neighbourhood had already focused their attention on her household so she punched her pillow to let out her frustration pretending it was james potter face lily had known james potter since her first year of hogwarts and had never taken a liking to him he loved to cause trouble and mayhem and took to cursing anyone who walked by james and his friends sirius remus and peter had become the school pranksters virtually overnight and adopted the name the marauders lily was not keen on any of the members of this group though remus was tolerable james and sirius irked her the most because they strutted about the school like kings acting arrogant and just plain retarded they were the most popular and sought after boys in the entire school save peter maybe and that was undoubtedly why their heads were inflated girls went crazy every time they spotted them in the halls and that fact annoyed lily to no end just then something occurred to lily she picked the letter out of the rubbish bin and re read it once more becoming more puzzled james said he was going to see me tomorrow how is that possible unless he will be at the ministry as well but how did he know i had a hearing lily whispered confusedly her eyebrows crinkling in befuddlement james owl sat on lily desk obediently obviously hoping lily would slip him a treat and a letter to return lily fetched her box of owl treats and fed the beautiful owl admiring its odd coloured feathers probably some rare bird only the potter fortune could afford bunch of nitwits all i can say is your master is well informed lily frowned as she shooed the owl out the window once more the rest of the day was spent picking out a suitable outfit to wear to the ministry hearing listening to petunia complain to lily mother about the caiman that still occupied her room and eavesdropping on her mother phone conversations with the street resident busybodies eventually the phone was just taken off the hook the constant ringing was giving everyone in the house a blistering headache lily really didnthave time to worry about seeing james potter though bringing some kitchen utensils to the ministry was starting to sound very tempting v author notes v please continue to read and review chapter 36 the first murder to be utterly blunt the next morning had been a blur of chaos to lily evans for fierce questions were fired her way every two seconds questions she with the help of james avoided carefully though lily loved her friends dearly she could not confide one of her now deepest secrets to any of them not even roxanne lily fricken evans sirius black shouted audaciously flinging himself out of his seat at the gryffindor lunch table and lunging toward the red headed beauty lily evans entered the hall calmly with her two apprehensive friends trailing in her wake a cringe appearing on her porcelain features as the handsome marauder bounded toward her excitably black leave her alone james shouted after his best friend though like many of his commands it did not seem to penetrate sirius thick skull which happened to be topped with masses of brunette hair james huffed in indignation and continued to eat his thin pancakes whilst watching the events concerning his friends unfold today was going to be interesting especially with all the outrageous questions he and lily would have to elude sirius enveloped lily in a constricting hug lily felt like a particularly obese and savage snake was strangling her the hall attention turned to the maniacal boy seemingly consuming his female friend causing many whispers to circulate and girls to whimper i was so worried sirius yelled dramatically over lily shoulder gaining many smirks from onlookers i would have thrown myself off the astronomy tower if you hadntshown up dontworry black roxanne said cheerily a coy grin dominating her face there is still plenty of time to attempt that shut up you stupid clone sirius fired back pretending to cry into lily shoulder did you hear what she said lillykins i ll never be the same clone remus asked questionably james shrugged his shoulders and flippantly pushing peter out of his seat as lily neared the table causing peter to glare at james viciously and take a seat beside remus instead stupid prat peter mumbled rubbing his backside before taking a seat you alright this morning lily james asked softly filling lily empty plate with breakfast foods like eggs bacon and fritters lily scooted onto the bench beside james and chuckled at the way he was babying her when was the last time she had to have another person cut her bacon for her six i lovely thanks lily said rolling her eyes and shooing james hands away from her breakfast plate i haventsuffered brain damage i think i can feed myself james smirked and turned back to his food a pleasant twinkle lingering in his eyes sirius roxanne and erica situated themselves at the gryffindor table as well everyone longing to tuck into their appealing meals so lily remus started dabbing the corner of his mouth with a napkin james came in last night telling us all you were back and safe however he didntexplain where you disappeared to o did he not lily inquired faking stupidity as she cleared her throat to stall time well it a funny story really i sort of was looking for some socks james added quickly clearing his throat uncomfortably as everyone intrigued and confused faces turned to him she was looking for some socks and and i went into my closet lily started her nose scrunched up pretending to recollect a horrible event but it locked behind her james blurted a huge grin spreading over his face as he thought of the stupidest dorkest lie he had ever concocted why wouldntshe be searching for socks in her trunk erica whispered in roxanne ear her face looking disconcerted lily is hiding something and i am going to find out what it is roxanne whispered back turned her attention back to the group conversation you were locked in the closet sirius asked loudly and skeptically his facial expression contorting abnormally that had got to be the dumbest thing i have ever heard which is quite significant because sirius says stupid things every time he opens his mouth roxanne said pointedly eyeing james and lily distrustfully exactly sirius exclaimed triumphantly as if that statement had settled all matters at least lily doesntget stuck up chimneys sirius james said casually his chocolate eyes sparkling mischievously as he tried to deflect the conversation away from lily you promised not to mention that james sirius hissed avoiding eye contact with all the grinning friends surrounding him besides i had good reason he needed bat wings to concoct a potion that would make his assets a little big james started to say to his eager friends all of whom awaited his explanation no need to continue james sirius sputtered his eyes narrowing as a small blush crept onto his cheeks ok ok james said grinning cheerily basically he was looking in my chimney for bats and got lodged in there somehow my dad had to blast him out of the smokestack the group of friends started to roar with laughter but no one louder then roxanne the imagery that sprung up in her mind was enough to send her into a fit of giggles what haha i would have paid haha to see haha his face roxanne said between gasps of laughter tears of mirth streaming down her cheeks as she pointed at a flustered sirius i ate a lot of mash potatoes that day ok sirius said in a pout crossing his arms and holding his nose high in the air honestly it all went to my hips the group of babbling and blustery friends eventually calmed down and as breakfast continued a picture of sirius flying out of a chimney was fresh in all their minds james and lily had successfully dodged all questions concerning the night before therefore pleasant smiles adorned their faces well lily was also smiling because james had decided to let his left hand roam up and down her right leg james had received a prompt slap when his hand ventured to close to her inner thigh we should head to potions the bell will ring soon remus said sharply checking his magical watch as the friends cleaned their plates and headed down to the dank and dreary dungeons what do you reckon we will stew in class today erica inquired innocently inwardly grinning as she felt remus toying with her hands as they walked down the stone hallways leading toward the potions classroom maybe we will stew a potion that will make our assets bigger roxanne exclaimed offhandedly a smirk curving on her lips at the uncomfortable look on sirius face why unhappy with your body darling sirius asked aloud his eyes sweeping over her and choosing to ignore her jib he wasntabout to let her win that was for sure no my body is fine thanks roxanne fired back unhappy sirius wasntgetting irritated and flustered by her sly comment yes i think it is fine too sirius said winking seductively at the flaring brunette as the two brown haired spitfires continued to verbally spare the others entered the poignant classroom and took their seats punctually professor slughorn was scribbling what resembled instructions on the black board reserving a merry wave for every important student that entered his classroom lily james sirius slughorn piped in an ebullient tone gaining half hearted smiles from james lily and sirius however the professor only received annoyed frowns from erica and roxanne peter and remus seemed to care less about professor slughorn and walked by the teacher without comment well i never roxanne exclaimed in a huff as she took a seat beside lily i a pureblood and my parents are famous explorers why donti merit professor slughorn attention who cares you merit sirius attention isntthat enough lily commented with a crafty smile on her face as she pulled out her notebook and green colored quill from her backpack belt up you roxanne said laughably hitting lily lightly over the head with her potions notebook i dontneed you joining the dark side with him hey girls sirius said in a hissed whisper interrupting them and poking lily in the back annoyingly as the rest of the students entered the classroom ready to begin what roxanne and lily inquired simultaneously turning around in their seats to face james and sirius you have my permission to start a cat fight amongst yourselves sirius said grinning idiotically as he observed them bickering and feel free to take off your tops too why you little roxanne jeered searching for a large object to hit sirius with however she was beaten too it by none other then the dashing james potter sirius rubbed his skull ruefully after james had smacked him up side the head with his potions textbook i knew they should have made those things in paperback sirius murmured glaring at the hard cover textbook whaddya do that for foo your head was in the way sirius james said grinning happily i wanted a good view of the girls taking their tops off sirius started to roar with laughter as lily and roxanne glared daggers at the lop sided grin curving on james face james reserved a small wink for lily causing her lips to betray her and give a small smile remus roxanne exclaimed loudly leaning in toward his desk have i told you lately that you are by far the best marauder out of this lot roxanne said cheerily pointing to sirius like he was some foreign insect she wanted to squash thank you roxanne i ll have to agree with you there remus said sticking out his tongue at a grumpy looking sirius and continuing to fiddle with erica delicate fingers woman are you blind sirius barked at roxanne gruffly a deep frown etched onto his face i am by far the hottest marauder out of them even ask the magic mirror that tells me so every night who are you bloody snow white james asked in amusement ruffling his hair nonchalantly and absent mindedly staring at lily mirror mirror on the wall who is the dumbest looking wanker of them all roxanne sang in a sing song voice sirius black not true sirius said pounding his fists childishly on his desk if we had some type of marauder competition i bet you i would win that sounds intriguing james said watching his friend antics with bewilderment we should have a friendly competition it would settle matters i think would you be up to it remus peter no thanks i ve got to spend some quality time with marcus tonight i think he is coming down with an illness peter said pulling at his collar self consciously as the others looked at him in amusement peter i really hate to break this to you sirius said pretending to seem sorry as he looked at his friend in concern but marcus is a turtle i know that peter said indignantly avoiding eye contact with all those curious persons present ever considering receiving therapy sirius exclaimed with a huge grin on his face sirius and james had quite a difficult time restraining themselves from laughing hysterically james has his smile buried in his hands o leave him alone sirius roxanne said huffily crossing her arms like a pretzel i think having a pet turtle is a very sensitive and cute idea then somebody get me a wrinkily amphibian quick sirius shouted loudly playfully looking under his desk for a green creature that could make him seem sensitive and cute very funny roxanne said crossly glaring at the laughable sirius i should turn you into a frog and then step on your toady ass no no darling sirius said brightly flashing his pearly whites you have the nursery tale all wrong if you kiss the frog it will turn into a prince but if you kiss the prince he wontturn into a frog what is your point black my point is pucker up and kiss your prince baby sirius yelped loudly his seductive eyes tracing roxanne figure why you disgusting roxanne started angrily beginning to pull her wand out of her robe pocket remus did you want to be in our little competition james cut in quickly hoping to distract the two feuding brunettes you better tell me quick these two are bound to start sparring again soon of course i in remus piped in quickly receiving an eager smile from erica i wouldntgive up a chance to make you two look like foolish flobberworms o it on now remus sirius said loudly gaining the classes attention including the flustered and frustrated professor s excuse me mr black but i am trying to conduct a lesson professor slughorn said simply though she didntsound stern i would highly suggest you copy down the note on the board it all up here sir sirius said arrogantly tapping his head lightly and smirking knowingly as he leaned back nonchalantly in his chair dontbelieve him sir roxanne cut in still sore about sirius earlier comment his head is as hollow as the empty cauldron in front of him many chuckles could be heard from the slytherin portion of the class though they were reluctant to laugh at anything roxanne had to say professor slughorn shook his head doubtfully and returned to writing notes on the black board roxanne lily remus and erica immediately started to copy down the board notes on spare parchment i cantbelieve she said that sirius mumbled to james the expression on his face looking somewhat put out i wouldntinsult her in front of the whole class dontworry about it padfoot james said reassuringly patting his friend on the back besides we have to create our little marauder competition i wonder what we should do sirius said trailing off into another world that included a scantily clad roxanne meanwhile professor slughorn had assigned the class to stew the wit sharpening potion and had written the ingredients necessary on the board i ll fetch the scarab beetles ginger roots and armadillo bile from the store cupboard shall i lily inquired moodily as roxanne made no sign of motion lily approached the open cupboard eager to collect her ingredients when she felt a taller broad shouldered student shove her out of the way lily looked up in muted surprise and glared into the face of lucius malfoy out of my way mudblood lucius spat coolly wiping his hands roughly on his robes i shall have to wash my hands and burn my robes now that i touched you well if you need anyone to set you slimy hair on fire you can find me in the gryffindor common room ok lily retorted savagely sick and tired of bullying slytherins taking advantage of her heritage you little bit malfoy started before someone forcibly ran into malfoy sending his potion ingredients stumbling out of his hands and onto the clean stone floor malfoy you clumsy fool sirius said shaking his head sternly at the mess on the floor you might want to take a shower there is armadillo bile all over your unattractive face with that straightforward comment sirius linked arms with lily and escorted her back to his desk james was no longer situated beside sirius but instead beside erica remus and roxanne were also sitting together chatting merrily amongst themselves what going on lily asked in confusion as she took a seat beside the startlingly handsome sirius black we decided the way in which we were to prove who was the best marauder sirius started chopping up his scarab beetles into thin cylindrical discs you roxanne and erica will be the judges we each have a day to be as nice as we can to the girl we were assigned and in the end you three will discuss whom deserves the title of best marauder ever so i your victim then lily inquired chuckling at sirius mock insulted look you betcha lillykins sirius said gleefully leaning in toward lily ear but i must admit james was quite disappointed you werenthis victim a small blush crept onto lily cheeks and she meekly started chopping up her potion ingredients without comment sirius smiled at lily shy reaction and decided it was best to finish their potion meanwhile james was fiercely scribbling a small note on a piece of parchment he had ripped out of his notebook erica watched him in puzzlement james scrunched the note into a messy ball when he was done and whipped it across the room hitting his intended target on the head what does potter want crabbe asked a disgruntled malfoy gruffly as the ball of paper bounced of lucius head and onto the desk before them how should i know what that muggle loving jester wants malfoy spat arrogantly his silvery eyes sparkling with intrigue malfoy narrowed his eyes at the glaring potter sitting across the room from him and quickly unfolded the note that had so brashly hit him to the blonde prat touch lily again and i swear to god i will shove a flaming filibuster firework up your arse savvy j p d malfoy immediately banished the scrunched up note and went back to work a calculating smirk wallpapered onto his smug exterior it was coming more and more apparent that the messy haired boy had deep feelings for the saucy redheaded muggleborn james would have boxed malfoy in the nose had he been near lily at the time but sirius had already been on his way to the cupboard so james begrudgingly stayed in his seat er james could we possibly get back to work now erica asked sweetly poking james side to get his attention yes of course sorry about that james muttered rapidly flipping to the correct page in his textbook and reading the potion instructions aloud the class had turned out to be quite a subdued affair and when the group of friends exited the musty dungeons their focus turned to the marauder competition hey erica want a piggy back to lunch james inquired happily flashing her a toothy grin she returned contently ok that should raise a few eyebrows once we enter the great hall erica replied getting increasingly giggly at the thought we ll catch up with you guys later ok james exclaimed directing him comment towards a begrudgingly jealous lily james headed toward the great hall erica laughing merrily on his back as he broke into a run remus had suavely asked roxanne if she wanted to have a picnic by the lake an invitation she was more then pleased to accept leaving sirius and lily alone frick those two are already winning sirius started frowning as remus and roxanne departed for the grounds now i have to do something that will absolutely dazzle you ma dear did you have anything in mind mr black lily inquired somewhat flirtatiously though she was only joking with the dark haired male hmmm follow me darling sirius said excitably grasping lily hand firmly as a completely astonishing idea sprang up in his mind sirius seemed to get more and more animated as they walked down an unfamiliar hallway located near the statue of the one eyed hag statue the same statue that lead into deep into hogsmeade sirius where are we going lily requested her breathing labored as she kept up with sirius rapid pace and can we get there soon because i starving i want to show you something you re appetite will have to wait sirius said before stopping abruptly before an elaborately patterned tapestry sirius examined the tapestry for mere moments before gathering it up in his hands and revealing a quaint wooden door behind it what in there lily inquired curiously her interest peeking pleasantly tickle the doorknob and find out why dontyou sirius urged softly his eyes glassed over at the thought of what lay behind the insignificant door lily did as she was told and tickled the doorknob the door handle immediately started to giggle childishly and turn in a counterclockwise motion revealing a room in which lily was surely never going to forget lily stepped into the mysterious room and was met by multiple images of herself sirius entered as well letting the tapestry fall behind him to conceal their whereabouts the whole room including the floor and ceiling was made out of spotless mirrors the room was in a hexagonal shape therefore eight tall mirrors provided the facets of the walls wow lily muttered incoherently observing the pristine mirrors and unnatural light illuminating the room where are we well i dontknow if the room has an established name sirius said grinning contently but i like to call it the room of memories lily turned to sirius and saw his eyes were shut tightly and his face was wrinkled in deep concentration lily thought it best not to disturb him and turned her attention back towards the mirrors however her reflection no longer looked back at her but a beautiful forest scene how what happened lily asked aloud as she gaped at the spectacle that lay before her eyes i shall show you as opposed to explaining are you ready miss evans sirius asked curtly holding out his arm like a true gentleman would long tresses of brown framing his face handsomely lily decided to cease asking questions but when lily took sirius arm she was quite distressed to see them walking speedily toward the imaged mirrors they were going to crash into the thick reflective walls and make a huge mess lily was sure of it sirius no lily screamed as she closed her eyes and felt a cool sensation pass over her face and body the impression was not uncomfortable but numbing lily eyes were shut tightly she still felt sirius beside her and in her ears was a soft buzzing noise lily felt weightless like she was floating it lasted only a few seconds however for the buzzing in her ears vanished and was replaced by the song and chirping of robins and sparrows the duo stopped sirius unlatching himself from lily and the redhead opened her eyes when she felt solid earth beneath her feet lily was stunned to see the two of them standing in a large enchanting forest o my giddy aunt lily said delicately observing the green trees and blooming flowers in awe what the hell just happened a floral natural scent wafted throughout the air pleasantly tickling the end of lily nose the trees swayed slowly in the wind creating a perfect lethargic atmosphere it looked to be early morning for the birds twittered noisily and the sun was still kissing the horizon sirius laughed imperceptibly at the stunned expression that dominated lily features and couldnthelp but glimpse the reason james was so fond of her she was so pretty when she smiled and she looked down right goofy with that flabbergasted look upon her face the room acts like a pensieve sirius said basking in the rays of sun that shone through the tiny spaces among the foliage of the trees all you have to do is walk into the room and immerse yourself in a memory wow lily thought angelic smiles lighting up her face where are we exactly i ll tell you once we ve reached my intended destination sirius said whimsically enjoying the feel of crunching leaves under his shoes lily could tell whatever memory she was emerged in it was one sirius truly cherished lily wondered why sirius would want to share such a personal thought with her it just in the distance sirius said hiking up a hillock with lily dawdling in his trail i remember it residing in the north as sirius passed one particularly ancient tree lily noticed someone had carved his or her names onto the scratched trunk in spindly messy letters were the names jamie poo sirwus petey and remmy horrid spellers werentwe sirius softly whispered stopping to observe the tree with a nostalgic twinkle in his eyes yes just awful lily said tittering as she carefully traced james name with her finger lily really did feel as if she was submersed in a dream sirius continued up the hill lily catching up with him and smiled joyfully as the object of his interest came into view there sitting comfortably in an old oak tree was a rickety wooden tree house it was obvious that it had been constructed in a hurry for it looked ready to fall apart at any moment and there lily is the marauder headquarters sirius exclaimed proudly looking upon the tree house like a father would look at his new baby boy that the cutest thing lily said giggling at the sloppy appearance is it safe to climb of course james dad put some sort of charm on it so it would never topple with the gang all sitting or playing on it sirius said recollecting the memory sweetly i remember james mom being so insistent that it be completely safe lily smiled prettily at the thought of james parents and started to scale up the mangy ladder that led into the tree house sirius ascended up the ladder after her cherishing every moment he spent in his memory is this forest part of james backyard or something lily asked gently feeling it unnecessary to raise her voice in such a serene environment yes this is but one of hundreds of acres james property is situated on sirius said watching wonder pass over lily features again i dontthink you really know how much money james has to his name lily sat in an abandoned corner of the tree house leaning awkwardly on a protruding branch sirius sat beside her and kept sending curious glances towards the entrance of the tree house why did you not build a roof for your tree house lily asked chuckling at the lack of walls and roofing the only thing the tree house really possessed was a floor and ladder leading up to it it was more like a floating platform than a tree house we tried once but we werentthe best builders at the age of six sirius said grinning and looking above him into the glaring sun lily admired the lush landscape wildly her thoughts centering around james once more it was true the thought of james being filthy rich hadntquite registered with her because to lily it made no substantial difference now that lily had glimpsed only a portion of james property she felt somewhat ashamed what must he think of her humble modest house lily thoughts were interrupted by the sound of crunching leaves and petit voices approaching in the background sirius perked up immediately and leaned over the side of the platform hoping to catch a glimpse of the forthcoming figures i already told you three babies it wasntmy fault the box of toads got loose a tiny brown haired boy shouted loudly trouncing over sticks and leaves that lay in his path with a giant grin my mom threatened to offer up my head as a bludger to the english quidditch team because of you a messy haired boy of six retorted poking the other boy belly with a sharp stick as he frowned ooww quit that stabbin potter the rebellious toad boy whined rubbing his hands over his tummy and sprinting awkwardly toward the tree house with his fussy hair flying wildly lily eyes opened widely and her mouth parted in a gasp as she observed four little boys trailing throughout the expansive forest is that you and james lily inquired as she looked upon the two adorable boys bickering yes sirius said laughably smiling and that is remus and peter lagging in the background i believe they took a bit longer because peter insisted on stuffing another turkish delight in his mouth before departure lily laughed lightly and continued watching the two little boys carefully she couldntget over how sweet they both were james your mommy should be sayin thanks sirius started as he began to climb the ladder leading to the tree house the dinner party was boring and we made it fun she dontlike frogs in her soup sirius james scolded sternly his brows furrowed as he wiped his dirty hands on his white shirt she is gonna curse me then you should run away from home dopey sirius said as if it were the answer to all of james problems i ll live in the tree house with yah by this time both the young sirius and james were on the platform with lily and the present day sirius lily glimpsed remus and peter throwing large rocks and acorns at flustered birds in their nests below got em in dah face peter exclaimed happily as he chucked a rock that ricocheted off the tree lodging the disconcerted birds i broke d his beak the six year old remus shook his head as he watched the hyper peter bob up and down in excitement even at six remus was incredibly intelligent for he had already deciphered that peter was incapable of doing anything right if peter were to attempt cursing him remus would be more concerned for the fellow standing beside him i can still barely understand a word peter says these days sirius whispered to lily as he moved beside her and watched the hilarious events unfold lily chuckled offhandedly for she was emerged in the comical conversation occurring between james and sirius my dad said the other day if i dontbe good nobody will marry me sirius said flippantly nudging a small green inchworm scooting across the platform but i says to him i says girls are gross and yucky and he says just wait just wait what does that mean dunno james mumbled looking at sirius in a clueless fashion i never gonna marry cuz i dontlike girls much lily put her hand over her mouth in order to suppress her laughter james and sirius were the biggest bachelors in hogwarts it was hard to imagine them ever disliking women sokay me and youz will live in our tree house forever never have to worry bout nothing the young sirius said smoothly tucking his hands behind his head and leaning against the tree trunk supporting the platform boys a booming female voice echoed across the forest loudly your snacks are ready if you bring any wildlife in the house i will become very angry and do something very rash come home now is that james mom lily inquired curiously realizing she had enhanced her voice with the sonorus spell in order to gain the boys attention yes she often stood on the back door stoop and yelled across the forest for us to come home sirius said his eyes glazing over her snacks were always so tasty too the younger sirius quickly started to descend from the tree house a bewildered james clambering clumsily after him the pant knees of both boys were severely grass stained you said we were going to live in the tree house the little james shouted we cantgo back home but i am hungry sirius protested joining a sensible remus and frenzied peter you can stay but i wanna eat sirius remus and peter dashed into the forest eager to return to the potter mansion and eat their snacks james sprinting after them stumbling upon some stones along the way james slow childish run was exceedingly sweet the last thing sirius and lily heard before the boys disappeared in the woods was will the snake in my pocket will make your mom mad james with the blink of an eye lily was no longer lounging on the scruffy tree house located deep within the potter woods but she was standing beside sirius her arms still linked with his in the middle of the mirrored room the verdant forest no longer reflected in the glass surrounding them wha what lily stuttered unintelligibly staring in a dumbfounded fashion at the walls encompassing her and sirius we never left this room lily sirius said grinning at the girl flabbergasted expression you conscious mind as well as mine were thrust into my memory not our physical bodies but we ran into the mirror lily protested trying to understand the concept of the room it was a trick of the intellect your conscious mind walked through the mirror but not you sirius explained which demonstrates the dangerous part of what we just did someone could tamper with our bodies while we are unknowingly within the memory lily inquired skeptically crossing her arms it is a possibility sirius commented numbly twisting a lock of his hair around his finger and because it was my memory i can terminate it at any time bringing us back to reality it took a split second to do it too one minute i up in a tree the next i am once again inhabiting a mirrored room lily said audaciously utterly intrigued yes it took some time until the marauders and i figured it all out sirius said pulling back the tapestry and ushering lily out of the room lily and sirius exited the room in silence both thinking about the memory they had just left it really was special to sirius lily could tell by the far off look present in his alluring eyes why did you want to show me that memory sirius lily asked softly as she followed sirius down the abandoned hallway i not sure really sirius said his eyes glazing over to me it demonstrates the bond the four of us had even when we were young i thought i would show you what the marauders were like back in the day you were trouble makers even then lily sighed chuckling at the proud grin that appeared on sirius face sirius led lily over to the hunchbacked one eyed witch adjacent to the elaborate tapestry and tapped his wand on her hump with a silent incantation the hump popped open leaving a petit hole the two friends could squeeze through we are off to hogsmeade then lily assumed climbing down the hole and landing awkwardly on the stone floor belonging to the darkened tunnel i figured if i loosened you up with a few firewhiskeys i could rent out a room at the local motel and prove i am by far the best marauder sirius said mockingly igniting the end of his wand and winking seductively at lily i sorry but i do not succumb to perverts lily retorted cheekily dashing down the gloomy tunnel blindly sirius laughing and chasing after her with their only means of light in his hand it was rather a stupid thing for lily to do running down a dark tunnel without knowing what she may trip on or run into along the way unfortunately for her she was about to learn this lesson in a rather shocking and disturbing way lily wait up sirius whined squinting as he tried to make out the form of the retreating girl in the darkness not on your life black lily yelled out playfully her laughter echoing in the tunnel lily childish game was soon cut short for her foot caught on an unidentified object beneath her causing her to trip and land on it lily sharp scream and annoyed oomph alerted sirius of her situation causing him to rush to her side he hoped she didntscrap anything you alright lily sirius asked pointing his wand toward her in order to illuminate her surroundings i fine just a little clumsy lily grumbled in irritation getting up off the ground and facing sirius it funny how often i seem to embarrass myself sirius attention was not focused on lily embarrassment but the red liquid trailing down her face and creeping down along her exposed neck she seemed unaware that her face had blood smeared all over it did you bang your head sirius asked in urgency outlining his wand around her face and neck checking for a wound no i dontthink so lily said wiping some blood off her forehead and examining the glistening consistency on her fingers in panic lily quickly snapped her wand out of her robe pocket and illuminated the tip of it lily and sirius pointed their wands at the object lily had tripped on both jerked back in horror at the sight that met their eyes it a a dead body sirius choked out hoarsely his eyes growing wide in disgust as lily let out an ear piercing scream that echoed menacingly throughout the darkened tunnel get this fricken blood off of me lily cried shrilly ripping off her school robes as sirius quickly made the congealing blood on her face vanish with his wand calm down lily stay still sirius said trying to vigorously wash away the filth on her face i cantget it off when you are squirming like that what would you do if a dead corpse blood was on your face lily screamed in hysteria her face looking very pale and clammy sirius managed to clean the blood off of lily face neck and hands with difficulty guilt was bubbling in sirius stomach as he watched lily silently sob in fright sirius wrapped his muscled arms around lily letting her rest her head on his shoulder they both sat against the bricked wall of the tunnel it was a fair distance away from the body what do we do sirius lily whispered her blood shot eyes focused on the dead being before them we just found a dead person we could pretend we never saw the body sirius started to say in unease sirius we couldntpossibly lily exclaimed angrily there is a dead person in hogwarts for god sake ok ok i will have to report this to dumbledore then sirius said solemnly his brow furrowed but in doing so i will land in big trouble not only are we skipping class but we are in a secret passage leading to hogsmeade what i not letting you report this alone lily exclaimed in a challenging tone and dontyou dare ask me to pretend like i wasnthere lily dontbe insane sirius barked running his hands through his bushel of hair there is no point in getting you in trouble too you are a prefect think of what this could mean for you i dontcare about the bloody badge lily hissed getting up off of the ground with sirius at her side i couldntin good conscience let you take do this alone i mean god damn it we found a murdered person screw your bleeding conscience then sirius snapped it my fault we landed in this mess i refuse to let you get in trouble there is nothing you can do or say to stop me black lily said flatly narrowing her eyes at the handsome marauder and turning up her nose i willing obliged to go to hogsmeade with you therefore it is not your fault fine there is no use fighting with you sirius said sighing in frustration and igniting the end of his wand again let go see dumbledore then lily was taken aback with sirius agreeable attitude and warily followed the marauder down the dank tunnel and out of the humped witch back the duo remained silent lily heels clinking on the stone floors providing the only source of noise lily peered out of one of the windows and noticed it was still shining brightly outside her stomach lurched as her gaze wandered over to the willow tree by the lake for james remus roxanne and erica were all running around like mad people most likely playing a game of tickle tag i such an idiot sirius murmured as he too spotted the group of friends laughing and playing on the green grassy fields of hogwarts you are being too hard on yourself lily said staring into the eyes of sirius we are doing the right thing here sirius offered a feeble smile before continuing to walk toward dumbledore office his head seemed to hang low his stare remaining on the floor it was odd to ever glimpse sirius in such a forlorn state i ruined today for you lily sirius said his gaze not meeting hers roxanne was right i am just a dumb wanker lily saw the expression on sirius face and inwardly gasped he seemed really put out when he mentioned roxanne for the hurt on his face was enough to make her cry sirius roxanne doesntmean half of what comes out of her mouth lily offered softly if you ask me she is just putting on an elaborate show to hide the fact she has a major crush on you do you honestly believe that sirius asked gutturally his expression perking up because if roxanne does like me she has a funny way of showing it lily chuckled softly yet her stomach tottered awkwardly as dumbledore office statue came into view lily prayed that her punishment would be light for not only was her perfect badge at stake but she could possibly be suspended sirius girls rarely ever display what they re feeling lily said quietly rolling her eyes you ve got a chance with her you just need to keep trying lord lily you are making me feel awful sirius said shifting his aloof stare to the ajar broom cupboard mere meters from the falcon statue do you mind if i apologize well in advance apologize lily asked curiously scrunching up her nose in intrigue apologize for what this sirius said somewhat regrettably shoving the petit redhead into the broom closet and shutting the door firmly behind her with a swift flick of his wand sirius had the cupboard locked and sound proofed lily forcibly smacked into a dozen brooms and mops that scattered to the floor and clattered against the gritty sandstone walls it was pitch black within the closet one of lily feet was wedged uncomfortably into a water pail the smell of soiled soggy mop heads wafted in lily nostrils making her cringe and plug her nose in disgust sirius black lily shrieked in a high pitched tone battling with a rogue duster tickling her neck open this door immediately sorry lils but i wontlet you get in trouble on my mischievous account sirius exclaimed loudly not hearing lily protests i ll have james fetch you soon i promise the last thing lily heard was sirius breakneck diminishing footsteps nearing the jagged falcon statue down the granite lackluster corridor lily back was propped up against the wall of the cluttered broom closet about two hours later her neck rubbing up against a particularly rough sponge hanging on a hook on the wall about an hour ago she had been fuming and spouting out smoke like a rusty steam engine but now lily had given up trying to maneuver around the tin buckets littering the floor and had resorted to waiting patiently for a rescuer lily heard prominent footsteps nearing the closet and when the door opened and she was exposed to light her eyes squinted uncomfortably fancy finding you in a broom closet a sexy masculine voice said silkily as lily heard the door creak open mind if i join you in here for awhile and why mr potter would i ever want to inhabit a broom closet with you lily retorted back in a teasing voice grasping james outstretched hand and getting up off of the closet floor how offending james announced in a mocking tone pulling lily up and closing the closet door how long were you in there two bloody hours lily shrieked in outrage causing james to clamp his hands over his ears did you have to take your bleeding time getting here i only found out five minutes ago of your whereabouts ms evans james snapped though he did not seem angry apparently sirius is in some sort of trouble he got back to the common room a few minutes ago and i found him packing some of his things it was before he left that he told me you were locked in a closet somewhere o my giddy aunt where was he going with all his things lily asked in fright hoping sirius had not been suspended or worse expelled i was hoping you could tell me that james said his expression turning to one of thorny worry and why the blooming hell were you locked in a closet lily looked meekly puzzled for a moment she didntknow whether to scream and find sirius before he took all the blame or fall to the ground and cry james lily started her eyes filling with tears something awful has happened what are you alright james asked panicking at the sight of lily watery orbs james lightly reached out for lily right hand and stroked her palm hoping to sooth and calm her james hated seeing lily in such an upset state but it seemed he was glimpsing this side of her quite often now i m fine sirius and i were on our way to hogsmeade but we never ending up getting there lily said in almost a whisper clutching james hand tightly i was running down the passage leading into honeydukes but i tripped on something along the way tripped on what james asked barely able to ingest the suspense a corpse lily said throatily her porcelain skin turning paler at the thought of the bloody body abandoned on the soiled tunnel floor a what james inquired in stunned disbelief his eyes narrowing in curiosity as in a dead or murdered person yes james lily cried distress painting a picture on her face i tripped on the body and got blood all over my face and hands lily couldnthelp but let an anguished sob emit from her lips as her eyes met james worried ones james pulled lily tightly to his chest and tried to sooth her trembling by stroking her hair and rubbing her back he himself could barely believe the story lily had just told him why did lily always have to be the one exposed to terrible events it ached james to see lily so distressed lately all he wanted to do was protect her but so far he was doing a lousy job james and lily remained in their tight embrace for awhile thankful no unwanted guests had come dashing round the corner to disturb them james cradled lily head with one of his hands he loved the way her head found solace on his muscled shoulder come i taking you back to gryffindor tower james whispered softly in lily ear pulling away from her and holding her hand tightly in his own we will get you some food a hot shower and some sleep lily let james lead her up the grand staircase and into the empty gryffindor common room it was about suppertime no one was occupying the tower lily face was tear streaked and her hair was in disarray though she didntmind james glimpsing her in such a vulnerable state the secret couple ascended up to the girl dormitory and lily quickly popped into the bathroom and had a much anticipated shower lily was extremely disturbed and alarmed to see the water seeping through the shower drains tinged with hues of red james waited patiently on lily bed and when she exited the washroom in her pink pajamas and soaked hair he embraced her again are you alright lily james inquired again brushing strands of wet red hair out of her face with his gentle hands can i get you anything you have done enough already james lily in a genuine yet fatigued voice i worried about what trouble sirius is in he locked you in that closet didnthe james asked soberly making a mental note to thank his friend profusely for doing so and sparing her extra trouble of course he did lily said sadly placing her hand on james knee i should receive the same punishment as him i cantlet him endure this trouble alone lily james said in almost a begging tone dontdo anything rash sirius can handle this he made this sacrifice for you because you are his friend you may land him in more trouble if you come forward now how do you figure that lily asked in challenging puzzlement he undoubtedly told dumbledore he was alone when he found the body you dontwant to make him out to be a liar james said trying to sound intellectual and save lily from unnecessary problems i suppose you re right but i feel so awful lily said softly looking downcast it is noble of sirius to tell dumbledore about the corpse even though he could suffer consequences it ll probably be splashed all over the daily prophet tomorrow morning james said logically tracing lily spine with his hand as he spoke i wonder what details will be released to the public imagine a murder in hogwarts if it even is a murder lily said a far off look occupying her expression as she enjoyed the feel of james touch well i very much doubt whomever that is died of natural causes james said scrunching up his nose in thought i d like to know who the poor bloke is i think i already a tad too familiar with him lily said shuddering at the thought of her blood stained hands and face deciding it best to explain to their friends the events that had taken place james wrapped lily up in a thick quilted blanket which she begrudgingly adorned and the two made themselves comfortable in front of the common room fire lily and james leaned up against an arm of one of the plushy davenports and awaited the return of their friends there you two are erica exclaimed calmly popping her head from behind the portrait and entering the room with remus roxanne and peter were you not hungry i ve lost my appetite lily said doing her best to block out the horrific images in her mind come sit for a moment we have something to tell you james said beckoning over the group it concerns sirius i was quite surprised not to see him at dinner remus said taking a seat around the fire it is not like him to forgo a meal what wrong where is he roxanne inquired curiously trying her best to not seem to engulfed within the conversation as she too took a seat really roxanne your concern for him is so touching james said cracking a small grin i must tell him how you fretted about his whereabouts you do that potter roxanne started a menacingly twinkle in her eye and a sly smile crossing her lips and you will not be in a fit state to play in your next quidditch game you are a scary woman roxanne james said simply making the group including roxanne laugh so remus started after the conversation had turned serious once more what happened to sirius exactly james began explaining the events that had taken place a few hours back lily filling in the parts he was sketchy about lily remained quite pale through the explanation but roxanne and erica pigmentation could easily rival hers i cantbelieve he went to dumbledore alone roxanne said a far off look in her eyes he locked you in that closet to save you from trouble such a gracious thing to do erica said gently entangling her hands with remus i hope he wontbe punished i mean he is reporting a murder lily do you know who it was that was killed remus inquired wondrous possibilities swimming in his mind no i didntrecognize the body lily replied uncomfortably squirming underneath the warm duvet i wanted to get out of there as quickly as possible but i remember he look sort of young dark hair for some reason he reminded me of someone but where is sirius now roxanne asked again starting to lose her patience and disregarding the identity of the deceased person we dontknow james said solemnly leaning back and resting his head on the arm of the chair all we can do now is wait one by one each friends drifted to sleep around the crackling fire erica with her hands still entwined with remus and lily with her head resting on james shoulder peter had left for the dormitories leaving roxanne alone with her conflicting thoughts hours ticked by and sirius did not cross the threshold of the portrait hole his jolly air did not fill the emptying common room his ridiculous sexual jibs didntreach the ears women and his cocked eyebrows did not bounce upon his forehead when appealing silhouetted girls strutted by stupid bugger roxanne mumbled in a subdued whisper laying on one of the upholstered couches in the common room still wide awake sirius where are you v author notes v hello everyone p so i haventupdated in almost two months that has caused some awkward reviews i really am

with smooth noir feathers had persistently trounced on the frosted glass belonging to her bedroom window the room was fairly quiet only the soft hum of one of erica singing quills could be heard lily and erica were the only inhabitants of their dorm room apart from peter turtle who had mysteriously escaped from the boys dorm and was now snoozing in roxanne sock drawer lily there is an owl outside our window erica yawned sleepily her linen sheets wrapped around her head awkwardly as she sat up in bed she looked like a combination of mother teresa and medusa curse it in the face then lily grumbled tiredly digging her face into her mattress and making fatigued gurgling noises you are such a pleasure in the morning lily erica said sarcastically rolling her eyes and with her duvet in tow motioning to open the window dontlet that maddened buzzard in i sleeping lily mumbled turning over and examining the bothersome owl with aggravated disdain erica ignored lily negative morning attitude and slid the wooden frame of the window upwards a black owl with silver eyes entered nicking erica ear with one of its wings and landed gracefully on the foot board of lily bed obediently the owl stuck out its left talon revealing a small piece of parchment tied in white yarn what insomniac sent me a goddam letter this early in the morning lily huffed tiredly reaching for the scroll and shooing the owl out the window the posh owl looked quite insulted with lily bitter manner lily uncoiled the parchment and was intrigued to find a small note from sirius black the elusive boy that had not returned to his room the previous night lily i at the ministry of magic i told dumbledore about our best friend and i was located to london for further questioning a full fledged investigation is underway but i still dontknow who the dead guy is i flooing back to school after breakfast i not in any trouble dumbledore thought it admirable that i told him that right i admirable tell roxanne she isntto cry in my absence and tell james his father will be owling him about some family get together soon see you soon love sirius hotstuff black p s sorry about stuffing you in that closet p it from sirius erica lily exclaimed in a sigh of relief he at the ministry answering questions but he isntin any trouble thank goodness erica chirped happily snatching the letter from lily and chuckling at the part about roxanne crying and lily getting locked into closets i going to tell james how about you tell roxanne i bet she is still snoozing in the common room worried silly lily chuckled in amusement running down the girl staircase in drowsy glee lily scooted down the stairs into the common room and then up the boy staircase eager to tell james remus and peter the good news it was like a weight had been lifted off of her shoulders she no longer felt guilty lily threw open the door to the marauder dormitory flippantly only to be met with a half dressed and wide awake james potter a surprised smile crossed over james face as his eyes scanned lily curiously he stopped trying to pull on his black t shirt and instead left it in a heap on the floor eager to see me this morning james inquired teasingly suavely waltzing up beside a bemused lily and positioning his granular hands on lily waist what are you doing awake so early lily asked softly and pleasantly quickly checking to see if both remus and peter were sleeping before letting james embrace her i have a morning quidditch practice the gryffindor vs slytherin match is upcoming james whispered alluring in lily ear his eyes practically closed as he ran his playful fingers through her red hair i ll be cutting breakfast short this morning lily loved the way james touched her how gentle and pleasurable his fingers were as they lightly stroked her neck and tickled her senses a slight blush crept onto lily cheeks as james hands trailed underneath her pajama top and caressed her back partially lifting up her top james lily whispered as james hands trailed down her spine what if they wake up let them james said in a husky voice ignoring lily protests and snatching up her lips with his own lily let james moist lips linger for only a moment she was paranoid the other marauders would awaken please lily broke away from a disappointed and hormonal james i came to tell you sirius owled me what really what did he say james inquired hurriedly his frown disappearing and being replaced with a look of intrigue is he ok sirius is at the ministry being questioned but he isntin trouble he flooing back to hogwarts after breakfast lily said with a content smile i so relieved he hasntbeen expelled you and me both god that idiot always weasels he way out of trouble james said in an affectionate tone his toothy grin illuminating the room did he mention who was killed no no word yet lily said anxiously pulling on the hem of her pajama top down over her exposed belly button do you think the ministry will release a name i not sure this murder is going to cause a lot of bad publicity for hogwarts that i sure of james replied picking up his black t shirt and pulling it over his head you ll be ok going down to breakfast james finished pulling on his quidditch uniform while lily watched a frown formed on her lips lily was not pleased with all the recent babying james was doing did he think she was weak last time i checked i was able to walk down a flight of stairs lily said somewhat bitterly getting annoyed with all the unnecessary worry do you think otherwise you know what i meant lily james said tiredly rolling his eyes as the redhead started to get flustered i thought i would just walk you down to the well dontbother i sick of you treating me like a four year old lily spat crossly making her way over the threshold have a lovely quidditch practice i will james sputtered back poking his head out of his dorm and watching lily scuttle down the dormitory stairs and just to let you know i dontmake out with four year olds no lily screamed back up the stairs turning to face james well i dontmake out with buggered up quidditch players well you just did james shouted extremely loudly causing lily jaw to drop as he loudly blurted out what he promised to keep a secret james seemed to realize this as many boys opened their dorm doors and gaped at the pair keep dreaming potter lily quickly spat whipping out her wand and setting james hair on fire with the marauders nifty creation of a spell evans i ll massacre you for that james sputtered in astonished fury racing down the stairs after lily lily quickly dashed through the silent common room and out of the portrait hole a boy with his hair aflame hot on her tail roxanne sat bolt upright on the crimson couch she inhabited and curiously watched a fiery james potter dart out of the common room in a fit of irritation their extremely vocal conversation had wakened her from her fitful slumber what going on erica exclaimed curiously approaching a fatigued roxanne in her fluffy pink niffler slippers and sheets still wrapped around her head was that james with his hair on fire yah i think so roxanne supposed between yawns him and lily were screaming about something what were they quarreling about erica inquired in confusion her sheet billowing behind her as she paced about the room with all the other curious gryffindors who the bloody hell cares roxanne muttered sleepily collapsing back onto the couch and emitting a startling snore seems she had a late night remus snorted comically as he came up beside a perplexed erica care for some breakfast love erica giggled at remus nonchalant nature and linked arms with him she abandoned the sheet coddling her head before exiting out the portrait hole and towards breakfast get back here evans james shouted audaciously running after the rampant redhead and onto the lush dewy grass of the quidditch pitch he had long since extinguished the neutral fire atop his bushy head of hair lily had burst forth from hogwarts and onto the grounds with a sudden gust of energy tears were streaming down the sides of her cheeks as she ran and a cheshire smile upturned her lips the utter shock on james face when his hair had ignited had sent lily into spasms of laughter lily collapsed in the middle of the pitch and closed her tear stained eyes her anger with james had evaporated quickly you do realize james started tiredly collapsing beside lily with a marauder grin upon his face that you are an insufferable lunatic i know but you re the one that blurted out in the middle of the boys dormitory that you and i make out lily sighed placidly looking up at a cross legged james as she picked fistfuls of grass i figured it was time we let everyone know that we re a couple james replied thoughtfully though at the time that was not his intention i dontunderstand why we have to hide our feelings for eachother who said i had feelings for you lily retorted teasingly rolling onto her back and squinting as the sun blared and blinded her eyes james poked lily side playfully and rested his head on her stomach screwing up his eyes because of the sun brightness if you dontlike me i ll just have to slip you some love potion and make you love me james mischievously pouted grinning at lily look of protest lily plucked the spectacles from the bridge of james nose and fiddled with them idly pondering over what james had said were they truly a couple now she wondered what it would be like when people found out they were dating would she constantly be shooing away james fan club or would they stop swooning over him every time he walked by lily supposed many girls would still pine for james even if she were possessively clutching his forearm technically we arentactually a couple lily began getting up into a sitting position as james jerked his head away and looked at her skeptically what do you mean james asked in a puzzled and almost nervous voice dontyou want us to be i only meant you haventasked me to be your girlfriend lily blurted a small blush creeping onto her cheeks as she felt her neck grow hot a look of dawning spread over james features and a frenzied grin broke out onto his lips you re right then technically no we arenta couple james replied suavely smirking teasingly at a perplexed lily i sorry such a question slipped my mind there followed a silence in which lily expected james to finalize their courtship by asking her that elusive question lily hopes were squelched when all james did was smile back at her humorously well lily posed in anticipation a cross look transitioning onto her face well what james retorted pleasantly amused at the anger bubbling within lily arentyou going to ask me to be your girlfriend you bloody bastard lily inquired in a huff her emerald eyes swimming with frustration nope james replied simply lightly stretching as his grin grew more pronounced why you egotistical jerk lily shrieked angrily jumping to her feet and storming off of the quidditch pitch in outrage james flippantly summoned his broom which was conveniently leaning up against his bedroom window and when it arrived in the palm of his hand mounted it and sped toward a stammering lily james gently caught lily around the waist and pulled her onto the front of the broom with him before lily could struggle out of his grasp and dismount james flew straight up and hovered just below the clouds above the quidditch pitch put me down james lily cried shrilly glaring into james chocolate brown eyes as she held onto the back of his brawny shoulders who do you think you are i lily evans future boyfriend i ll have you know james chirped mockingly watching wisps of lily hair blow lightly in the breeze and i cantvery well let you walk away without me first explaining my intentions toward you apparently your intentions are to leave me in the lurch lily bawled angrily glaring menacingly into james twinkling eyes ahh but you are very wrong my vivacious redhead james started in a matter o fact tone my intentions are to ask you to be my girlfriend when you are least expecting it i cantvery well ask you to go out with me when you are anticipating such a question why didntyou tell me that before lily sighed in an incensed tone her smile starting to reappear it could have saved you a lot of unnecessary name calling because you re so sexy when you re all hot and bothered james said with a mischievous twinkle in his eye i am going to throttle you lily screamed laughably mocking an infuriated tone as she clung onto james tighter but i think i ll wait until we get back on solid ground throttle me i like the sound of that james whispered seductively cocking an eyebrow and nodding like a retarded bobble head lily slapped james across the chest good naturedly and grasped onto him tightly as he inclined his broom back to the ground once they had landed lily began to feebly try to throttle james though her plans did not succeed as he instead tickled her and started giving her piggybacks around the pitch i think you should make this part of your quidditch training lily chirped contently as james did laps with her on his back it will strengthen your back and arm muscles if i had any more muscles i would be on the cover of witch weekly james bragged proudly laughing as lily messed up his hair in protest then i d be so hot that you d start calling me a sex god imagine i d ever call you that i would rather drown lily announced gleefully laughing as james screwed up his face in insult well my dear lily that can be arranged james said grinning like a fool as he raced toward the lake with lily still on his back james put me down lily shouted stridently trying to struggle off of james back as the lake came into view james potter call me a sex god and i ll put you down james grinned idiotically as he stood on the lake shore with lily tittering over the water scream to the world how sexy you think i am i would rather lick the bottom of severus snape feet lily screamed out triumphantly shrilly yelping as her pajama clad body made contact with the icy water of the lake james sat on the shore of the lake hugging his knees to his chest and grinning as lily tuff of red hair surfaced with her wet hair sticking to her face like seaweed lily marched out of the lake and gave james a constricting hug causing him to burst into laughter as his quidditch uniform started to absorb excess water i ve never seen you so eager to give me a hug before i should have known you had ulterior motives james said absurdly tickling lily neck as she wrung out her hair over his face o james you know i love you lily piped between giggles even more than the bottom of snape feet please stop mentioning that the image of you sucking on that sod toes is enough to make me overdose on essence of murtlap james said in a shocking tone scrunching up his nose in repugnance you fancy purple ear hair do you lily inquired teasingly learning of the odd after effect of ingesting such a liquid in herbology personally i believe purple is your color i would fancy purple ear hair over the thought of you and snape james retorted stubbornly the possessive and protective side of his personality showing the thought of him touching you repulses me you re just jealous because i sucking on his toes and not yours lily brashly announced grinning wildly at james scandalized expression that is disgusting you most certainly deserve another dunk in the lake for such a comment james started approaching a smirking lily or you could make mad love to me in repentance it your choice the loud spatter emitted from lily jumping in the lake caused james to sigh tiredly and mutter maybe next time jumping into the cool lake to join a bobbing lily james made his way over to her wading figure and laughed as she splashed water in his face in a good natured way you ll be sopping wet during your quidditch practice you know lily stated happily swimming toward james and latching onto his back to rest her limbs i dontsuppose captain smith will be too happy with his star chaser skiving off practice i wouldntworry your pretty little head over it james cooed mockingly getting his head dunked underwater and sputtering and besides practice hasnteven started then why do i see gryffindor quidditch players flying over the pitch lily inquired in amusement watching the expression on james face grow stony shit james muttered swimming towards the shore with lily in tow with a sharp wrist movement and the muttering of a makeshift incantation james dried his drenched robes though the water wrinkles remained lily tittered as james poured water out of his leather quidditch boots and groaned no amount of magic would prepare him for the upcoming blisters i would offer to walk you to the castle doors but as i received a stern yelling match the last time i ll leave you to it james said in a quick and concise fashion pecking lily on the cheek before summoning his lacquered broom and bawling toward the quidditch pitch i ll catch up with you later lily sprawled out along the banks of the lake in silence watching the giant squid spasms on the opposite side out of the tip of her wand spouted warm air that she used to dry her pathetic looking pajamas and with the hair elastic around her wrist lily braided her hair and tied it back neatly it wasntthe best of times to take a dip for the weather was starting to turn cool and brightly colored leaves were abandoning their trees but lily was content and truly felt safe in the embracing arms of hogwarts the redhead tranquil thoughts were interrupted abruptly by the loud and scrambled singing of a large wild looking man from across the lake by the abandoned cottage was a gruff looking chap with a bushy beard and merry eyes carrying a bucket as big as a swimming pool with him as he approached the motionless lake lily recognized the massive man as hagrid the fellow she and james had run into a few weeks back hello hagrid lily greeted politely having walked around the lake to curiously inquire as to what he was up to lily hagrid managed as he squinted through watery eyes good ter see yah been awhile eh i ve got the gate keepin job since the last time we chatt d hagrid face gleamed with gladness as he started to list all of the duties his job entitled little things like trimming the hedges positively delighted him hagrid would be taking up residence in the derelict cottage by the forbidden forest along with his wrinkled pup fang which he explained was a perk of holding such a position at hogwarts i about ter head up ter breakfast just got ter take care of these plimpies first hagrid said cheerfully motioning his saucer sized hands toward a bucket of spherical fish each with two rubbery legs and webbed feet plimpies lily asked in utter confusion kneeling down to peer in the murky bucket full of fish and green lake water never seen a plimpy before eh hagrid asked eagerly ready to explain the creatures to lily the plimpies lurks in shallow pools o water eatin mostly sea snails the mer people ainttoo fond o them call um pests and tie der legs together causin um to drift away what are you doing with them lily inquired looking at the rather ugly fish with distaste etched onto her face she leaned forward to get a closer look but was roughly pulled back by hagrid don get ter close now hagrid said in urgency get ter close an they ll spit poisonous venom in yer eye lovely lily muttered softly taking ten colossal steps backwards dumbledore ordered some plimpies ter replenish the school o fish eaten by the merrows hagrid said puffing out his chest as he talked about dumbledore an he made it my job to habitat um in the lake lily could see by the mere mention of dumbledore name that hagrid admired him greatly not only was it apparent he admired dumbledore but also that he adored all kinds of magical creatures lily silently wished he could replace their malicious care of magical creatures teacher professor malastar you better head up ter breakfast now before all the toast gets cold hagrid said affectionately shooing lily from the bucket of silver fish stop round the cottage for some tea an me famous rock cakes sometim yer hear roxanne you need to face the truth sirius shouted vociferously pounding his fists comically on the gryffindor lunch table as lily entered the great hall in a dry and pressed uniform you love me and you want my children having your children would require touching you something i wouldntdo if it was mandatory to re populate the earth roxanne screamed back angrily her face growing red as she harshly stabbed at her scrambled eggs and shoved them into her mouth erica told me you waited up in the common room for me all night sirius commented teasingly quieting down and enjoying the uncomfortable and furious expression crossing roxanne face why would you do that if you werentutterly infatuated with me i didntwait up for you roxanne spat in her defense glaring daggers as erica eluded eye contact and awkwardly started to whistle i went down to the common room because i was tired and lily was er snoring hey i dontsnore lily retorted confusedly as she entered the great hall and took a seat at the gryffindor table hello sirius when did you arrive back at school just ten minutes ago sirius said filling his silver plate with mountains of breakfast food and giving lily a cheery greeting roxanne here was just confessing her love for me when you interjected if you dontquit saying that black i will remove the reason you wear a jock strap roxanne hissed in a menacing tone causing sirius smile to broaden and him to chuckle uneasily have you ever considered enrolling in anger management roxanne sirius inquired calmly pouring himself a glass of pumpkin juice if you dontgain control of your anger you may end up in the mental ward at azkaban well azkaban is miles upon miles away from here so on the bright side i would be far away from you roxanne emphasized boisterously smiling as erica and remus chortled in their morning juice in my personal opinion remus started butting in before sirius could come up with another witty comment you both belong in an insane asylum maybe you could get married on the steps of azkaban lily and erica burst into hysterical laughter what with roxanne turning an enraged purple color and sirius grinning from ear to ear roxanne bent back her fork and flung a small morsel of egg at remus though it missed by a mile you are suppose to be on my side remus roxanne sighed though a slight smile was threatening to escape and ruin her stubborn facade hey remus is a marauder like me he would obviously be on my side sirius shot back grinning as remus gave sirius a quick wink speaking of marauders where exactly is james o there is a quidditch practice this morning lily piped in forgetting sirius was part of the team as her attention wavered from her waffles if i were you i would hurry onto the pitch captain smith didntseem too pleasant this morning good lord lily you could have told me sooner sirius cried out in panic chomping down on a piece of toast as he sprang from the bench and toward the door smith is going to murder me good roxanne yelled out as sirius exited the hall with a burst of energy then we would be rid of the you you will never be rid of me darling sirius shouted flirtatiously making many girls swoon as he closed the door with a snap his charming smile causing many to crane their necks uncomfortably to get a last look at him roxanne crossly observed all the girls in the hall giggle and start chatting as sirius left the hall it felt like an irate feline was clawing inside of her stomach it was strange how at the measly sight of sirius smiling or nodding his head curtly at another girl made her boil over with jealousy roxanne would most certainly have to acquire something to distract her thoughts from sirius black why is it seventy five percent of the female population completely adores sirius roxanne inquired bluntly obstinately glaring at a jug of pumpkin juice i mean what exactly makes him so appealing to everyone probably his dashing good looks charming attitude money and quidditch talent erica answered subtly winking at a slightly downtrodden remus immediately picking up his spirits and may i add more like ninety seven percent of the female population is in love with him the only two girls i know not totally obsessed with him are erica and i lily smiled teasingly excuse me i do not like sirius black clear roxanne sputtered in an aggravated tone viciously cutting her fritters why you all believe i do is beyond me and i hi there roxanne a strikingly handsome boy behind roxanne cut in his deep voice causing her to drop her fork and turn around in surprise er hello vince roxanne greeted her voice meekly faltering as she laid eyes upon the hufflepuff quidditch captain she once had a crush on how are you remus erica and lily all looked at eachother in surprised manners then turned their attention toward the good looking blonde boy with intrigue and suspicion lily couldnthelp but grin as the image of vince with a bloodied nose surfaced in her memory excellent my morning seems to be getting better and better confessed confidently flashing roxanne a toothy smile and arrogantly cocking an eyebrow may i speak to you alone of course roxanne replied cheerfully taking vince hand and walking toward one of the great hall expansive corners erica and lily rapidly exchanged curious glances before roxanne disappeared from view a flabbergasted smile on her pretty face what d you figure he is up to lily inquired hastily to erica and remus many different scenarios playing out in her mind as she and erica exchanged excitable looks i ll take a guess and say vince is asking her to the halloween ball remus estimated almost reluctantly he knew sirius would not be pleased that was probably the reason vince decided to ask roxanne after sirius had left the building bloody hell erica gasped her eyes igniting with exhilaration this is so stirring i wonder if she will say yes i thought for sure sirius would ask her so did i remus muttered apprehensively looking around the hall to see if he could spot the pair i have a feeling sirius assumed they were going together you mean sirius didntthink anyone would ask roxanne to go lily inquired skeptically scrunching up her nose in mystification i expect sirius didntthink any guy would be daring enough to ask her under his nose remus whispered intending lily and erica to be the only ones to hear but you know sirius it just his stubbornness well if he technically didntask roxanne she has every right to find someone else lily stated thoughtfully grudgingly saying the word technically for the second time during this morning you re right but sirius wontbe pleased remus mumbled tiredly though he sharply looked up as derek mitchell approached the gryffindor table a soft groan escaped remus throat lily has james asked you to the ball remus hissed softly giving lily an intent stare and breaking up the conversation about roxanne and vince well er no but lily started to say swirls of confusion forming in her emerald eyes as remus grilled her about the ball then i suggest you start running remus said seriously getting up from his seat and grabbing lily arm trying to usher her from the hall erica eyes widened as she realized why remus wanted lily out of the hall derek mitchell remus what are you doin hello lily remus derek mitchell greeted in a deep and shiver inspiring voice coming up from behind the two and stepping in their path toward the door long time no chat the tall ravenclaw smirked pompously as lily eyes opened and a sense of dawning spread over her porcelain features remus was trying to prevent derek from asking lily to the ball she was sure of that yes yes we must be going urgent prefects meeting to attend remus said cuttingly sidestepping a grimacing derek and pulling lily towards the great hall exit one moment derek retorted grabbing onto lily arm so remus could drag her no further i need to talk to lily for a moment about the ball i afraid you ll have to chat later got it remus replied in a tone that did not at all insinuate politeness now let go of her arm before i transfigure you into a beetle and turn you into my newest potion ingredient are you threatening me lupin derek growled tightening his grip on lily arm and frightening lily with his overbearing presence derek you re hurting me let go lily managed painfully wanting to get far away from derek before remus did anything stupid lily i need to talk to you aguamenti remus shouted in an angry voice water spouting from the end of his wand and jetting into derek face and yes i threatening you mitchell try not to forget that derek recoiled in surprise the water meekly stinging his eyes and soaking his uniform he let go of lily arm to wipe the liquid off of his face giving remus ample time to beckon a bemused erica over to him and exit the hall with the two stunned women derek fuming for being embarrassed in front of the few students watching the verbal exchange rampaged toward the three friends colloportus remus shouted casually over his shoulder smirking as the great hall doors slammed in derek face and magically locked erica giggled at the muffled yelling that could be heard from behind the wooden doors and latched onto remus arm was that really necessary remus lily inquired in an irritated voice tucking her hair behind her ears it would have been simpler if you had let him ask me to the ball you want to go with him remus asked skeptically stopping abruptly to turn and face lily because that guy is a prick and a half of course i dontwant to go with him lily retorted in annoyance if he asked me to go with him i would reject him on the spot yes but do you honestly think he would accept your rejection unless you said you were going with someone else remus countered logically looking at lily as if she were a clueless child derek is not the type to accept defeat he couldntvery well force me to go with him lily spat her brows furrowed and a defiant look upon her usually sweet face contrary to what you and james believe i do possess a backbone i sorry i was only trying to help remus said a teasing grin appearing i canthelp but get a little hot headed about guys asking you out why lily asked inquisitively lightening up a little bit because of remus bashful air because i see you as well almost like a little sister remus offered gladly i dontwant to see you hurt or your happiness comprised by a jerk like mitchell lily smiled melodiously and immediately forgot about any anger she felt towards remus lupin was such a sweet guy and was absolutely perfect for erica lily shook her head at remus and gave him a large bear hug making remus relax and roll his eyes jokingly thank you remus but next time i believe you should let me handle my own problems agreed lily scampered off to collect her transfiguration books roxanne catching up with her along her way to the girls dormitory erica and remus made their way toward the transfiguration classroom hand in hand the scowls from on looking girls didntfrighten erica they made her smile broaden and her grip tighten do you think of roxanne as a sister too remus erica softly inquired content to simply hold onto his hand and walk yes i ve grown rather fond of all three of you james and sirius have as well remus commented serenely basking in the sunlight pouring in through the castle windows and closing his eyes for only a moment what do you think of me erica asked shyly blushing as remus turned toward her and grinned cheekily lets just say i dontthink of you as a sister remus whispered slyly snaking his arm around erica waist and walking into a classroom full of jealous women with the girl he had fallen head over heels for james and sirius were sitting tiredly on a wooden bench in the gryffindor locker room both with fluffy white towels wrapped around their waists captain smith had not been pleased with them both showing up for practice late and in a disheveled states if you two dontstart showing up for practice on time i will have you both thrown off the team clear gerald smith spat scornfully towel drying his hair and glaring at the two marauders i suppose james and i will just have to join the hufflepuff team then they are doing quite poorly this season sirius jibbed teasingly pulling on his school uniform and smiling at the distraught looking smith gerald smith gave james and sirius menacing glowers before picking up his broom and quidditch bag and storming out of the changing room leaving the two marauders alone in the hot and steamy locker room that swell sirius get the captain even more worked up why dontyou james yawned despairingly i dontknow about you but i not up to becoming all chummy with the hufflepuffs nor i potter sirius announced enthusiastically but we both know he would never kick us off the team because we are two of the best players not to mention gerald hates losing quidditch matches all i saying is dontpush your luck james said cracking a smile as his comment registered and contradicted most of his actions during school without quidditch how could i possibly enjoy school well sirius started a lop sided grin appearing i sure there is one special flower that could keep you entertained james couldnthelp but beam for he knew if he had a choice between lily and quidditch at hogwarts he would surely pick the feisty redhead over the sport he adored speaking of lily sirius whispered mischievously coming around from behind james with a twinkle in his eyes have you asked her to go to the halloween ball yet the halloween ball james had completely forgotten about it bloody hell the ball completely slipped my mind james sputtered having had other pressing problems to worry about lately what if someone already asked her and she said yes then you re screwed my friend sirius replied laughably watching james scramble around the locker room picking up his stuff hurriedly so he could bound up to the castle but i bet no other guy has dared to ask lily not if they knew how displeased you would be merlin i really messed up this time james moaned angrily hurdling out of the changing room and toward the castle with sirius casually running beside him what if she thinks i forgot about her girls minds always come up with the worst possible explanations stop fretting james just because you technically haventasked her yet doesntmean she will say yes to the first bloke that does sirius said flatly though he was surprised to see james expression grow even more hysterical and frantic did you just say technically sirius james groaned loudly and recalled what lily had said to him only an hour ago technically we arentactually a couple lily began getting up into a sitting position as james jerked his head away and looked at her skeptically what do you mean james asked in a puzzled and almost nervous voice dontyou want us to be i only meant you haventasked me lily and roxanne entered the grand circular transfiguration classroom chatting away like eager nifflers searching for shiny objects along the way roxanne had explained that vince had indeed asked her to the ball and she had accepted causing anticipation to grow with the thought of dress shopping lily was getting quite worried that james wasntgoing to ask her bugger where are we going to sit lily roxanne inquired as they entered the classroom to find there were no two empty desks beside eachother i guess i ll grab a seat next to marissa labell lily was distressed to find the only two spots left to sit were beside rochelle and derek mitchell the redhead begrudgingly took a seat beside derek who had called her over from across the large sandstone room roxanne and lily made eye contact and roxanne looked about ready to trade spots with her but lily waved her off and took out her notebook i was hoping you would come to find me and apologize for remus derek triumphantly whispered leaning in towards lily with a conceited smirk but no need i forgive you not to sound rude but i only sat here because i would rather sit beside you than rochelle not because i wanted to apologize lily replied shortly though she was agitated to observe derek smile broadening i dontmind you playing hard to get lily i do love a challenge derek said in a deep and seductive voice his hand finding lily knee get your hand off of me lily hissed taking out her wand and giving derek a slight burn on the top of his hand this caused him to jerk backwards in pain and curse loudly feisty derek whispered huskily his calculating eyes never leaving lily i ll show you feisty if you dontkeep your hands to yourself lily threatened menacingly glaring at derek before opening up her textbook and ignoring him completely remus watched the exchange from across the room and did not look content why do you look ready to murder someone remus erica inquired curiously rolling her eyes at his flinty expression did you happen to glimpse whom lily is sitting beside remus asked between gritted teeth if that bastard doesntstop harassing her i going over there you promised remus erica added sternly grasping his hand firmly let lily handle him if she needed our help we would know remus turned back to his parchment as james and sirius waltzed into the transfiguration classroom both looking out of breath professor mcgonagall pursed her lips together in a disciplined manner and observing that there were no more empty desks transfigured two ink bottles into desks for them james and sirius took seats behind remus and erica on the right side of the classroom now that everyone has arrived we will begin to practice turning hedgehogs into fine toothed combs mcgonagall started briskly directions appearing on the blank chalkboard at the front of the classroom you have an hour to achieve this task mcgonagall distributed the hedgehogs and the class began trying to turn them into brushes james sirius and remus achieved the task within the first five minutes oi remus james called out tapping him on the left shoulder where are lily and roxanne haventthey arrived to class yet roxanne is over there remus pointed sitting beside that ravenclaw girl what was her name again and lily she over there sitting with derek mitchell what james inquired skeptically craning his head and seeing lily feebly trying to transfigure her hedgehog with derek observing and questioning her every move how did she end up over there i saw derek deliberately move from beside his friend and to that empty desk when lily arrived erica added rolling her eyes he been trying to ask her to the ball all day what james shouted loudly pounding a gritty fist onto his desk in horror she didntsay yes did she many of the students around james turned to look at him inquisitively including an intrigued roxanne sirius and roxanne made eye contact for a fleeting moment before she turned back to her rampaging hedgehog i i not sure erica sputtered as she glimpsed james in a frenzied state i expect she said no after all she despises the guy derek has been all over lily since the beginning of class get my drift remus whispered to james heatedly watching his eyes grow wide what that suppose to mean sirius inquired skeptically as he heard james trying to suppress his growls of rage he hasnttouched her has he i would consider constricting her arm and feeling up her leg touching wouldntyou remus said in a ghost of a whisper his concerned gray eyes meeting up with james enraged ones i going to fucking slaughter that arrogant git james started getting up from his seat and heading toward lily wait remus yelled pulling james back into his seat roughly lily will get mad if you make a scene and get up in derek face believe me i learned that this morning fine i wontget angry or curse off his face but i still bringing lily over here with us or staying with her there james said firmly fire still burning in his eyes but if he lays another hand on her i dontcare how angry she gets with me james got up once more and sauntered over to where lily sat many girls fluttering their eyelashes wildly as he passed this he ignored as he pulled up a chair next to a flustered and annoyed lily evans common lily i know you ve always had a crush on me why keep denying your feelings derek questioned looking at lily sympathetically as she ignored him and jibbed her wand in her hedgehogs back hoping it would transfigure come to the ball with me no you know i like you quite a bit dontyou derek sputtered almost angrily as lily continued to ignore him and poke at her hedgehog really mitchell i never knew you felt that way for me james commented lightly as he valiantly pulled up a chair beside a relieved looking lily who knew you were a homosexual potter derek muttered scathingly the word rolling off his tongue like it was poison nothing to do with you sorry you ll have to find another hogwarts male to fall in love with james replied casually smirked as lily eyed him humorously i came over here because i wanted to spend some quality time with my date for the halloween ball derek was outwardly seething as he watched james gently grab lily hand and kiss the top of it in a gentlemanly fashion the slight blush that crept onto lily cheek and the smile at the mention of them attending the ball together sent derek mitchell over the deep end you mean to say you and james are going the ball together lily derek asked his temper flaring and his eyes burning deeply into the pair yes lily said softly as she latched onto james tender hand and got up from her seat i was trying to tell you but you wouldntlet me get a word in edge wise lily and james walked away from derek who was red in the face from humiliation and anger and took seats with the rest of their friends when derek attention focused back on his desk he found a little piece of scrunched up parchment residing where his hedgehog once was mess with the marauders and you re bound to get hurt find snakes in your bed or hedgehogs up your shirt so heed this warning my good sir or that pesky rodent wontbe the only one with fur j p s b r l derek mitchell shocking shriek could be heard from across the classroom as he found his assigned hedgehog squirming inside of his uniform pants derek unbuckled his belt and pulled down his pants revealing an unattractive pair of boxers and a furrowed hedgehog that had fallen at his feet the class burst into splendid laughter especially because of the pattern on derek boxers little gnomes dancing the marauders had tears streaming down the sides of their faces along with the rest of the class honestly mitchell i knew you liked men but hedgehogs that raunchy james shouted out happily gaining an infuriated glare from derek and more laughter from the class we ll have to warn the hufflepuff mascot about derek fetish after all badgers are closely related to hedgehogs sirius added causing derek to flush and the class to further keel over in laughter how dare you embarrass me derek mitchell started approaching the marauders and lily in a startling rage what was that you said about your bare ass mitchell sirius asked incredibly loudly because i think we would all prefer you stop gallivanting around the classroom with your pants around your ankles professor mcgonagall didnthear the marauders taunts for she was flitting around the classroom trying to quiet everyone down lily roxanne and erica were huddled together in a corner each hyperventilating because of the intense laughter that had overcome them mr mitchell pull up your pants at once professor mcgonagall said in a flustered manner shaking her head at the ravenclaw boy ten points from ravenclaw for inappropriate exposure but but professor it not my fault it was the maraud derek started to sputter before mcgonagall turned on her heel and marched to the front of the classroom no excuses mr mitchell class dismissed for a fleeting moment amongst the crowd of retreating students derek mitchell glimpsed james sirius and remus giving eachother high fives and laughing until their faces turned blue after having endured an afternoon of hilarity and two more classes the gryffindor group of friends headed to the great hall hoping to scarf down some delicious foods dinner that night had been pleasant that is until roxanne revealed to sirius black whom she was going to the halloween ball with whadda you mean you re going with vince sirius demanded skeptically accidentally throwing his fork across the gryffindor table and dinging peter in the forehead he that arrogant berk i hit in the face with a bludger isnthe he isntarrogant sirius roxanne spat once again mutilating her food as frustration bubbled up inside of her he is kind studious and completely gorgeous so i have all that and more sirius retorted jabbing at a piece of pork and stuffing it into his mouth bitterly he couldntbelieve roxanne had accepted vince invitation to the ball and not his well you arentexactly studious sirius james snorted before being silenced by sirius deadly glower and you refer to him as arrogant you are such a hypocrite sirius roxanne sighed sipping her pumpkin juice and glaring i call it confidence ok and i no hippopotamus sirius said sourly his gang of friends rolling their eyes as he mistook the word hypocrite for an african animal roxanne and sirius banter was interrupted when james owl lenny swooped in through one of the great hall windows and dropped a tied piece of parchment onto james plate full of gravy screwing his face up in disgust james unrolled the paper and started to read his father handwriting to james and sirius i thought that the two of you especially sirius were entitled to learn of some information recently uncovered about the corpse obtained at hogwarts partly because of your involvement in the case using various methods of magical forensics the ministry found out this morning that the body found in the tunnel belongs to a cletus cyprian the brother of your astronomy teacher cristoforo cyprian this information will all be included on the front page article of the daily prophet tomorrow however the ministry has decided to declare the body was found in hogsmeade as opposed to hogwarts we didntwant any parents or students in hogwarts to become worried if we said the body were found there and that is why this decision has been made i implore you and sirius to keep your mouths shut about finding the body so as not to taint hogwarts reputation there will of course be a further investigation as to why and how cletus died but that information still eludes us at the moment on a lighter note james your mother and i will be in hogsmeade this saturday night to take care of some ministry affairs would you like to have dinner with us at 9 o clock at the three broomsticks i believe this weekend is a special hogsmeade weekend for the students to shop for the halloween ball am i right you can ask sirius and any of your other friends to come along too if you like wink lily wink owl me back about dinner on saturday landon potter minister of magic aka dad who is sending you letters at this time of the night erica inquired curiously as she and the others watched james eyes scan the letter over once more girls from your fan club donttell me it another love letter remus said jokingly causing lily to perk up in interest and roxanne and sirius to turn toward james ooo love letters james potter you popular player you roxanne said flirtatiously mockingly fluttering her eyelashes stop quivering and cooing like a retarded school girl would you it sickening sirius started looking at roxanne in what seemed to be disappointment it was obvious he was inwardly hurting because she and vince were going to the dance together o shettup sirius you re just jealous i cooing at james and not you since when does he receive love letters lily interjected in outrage forgetting to seem indifferent and ignoring sirius and roxanne how many letters does he get remus remus is teasing lily james said simply smirking and shaking his head as remus started to laugh it a letter from my father turns out the man that was murdered was cletus cyprian our dear astronomy teacher brother the entire groups heads all whipped around toward the staff table they found cyprian seat empty and his dinner plate sparkling clean i knew i recognized that man lily whispered in awe her eyes glazing over as she recalled the image of the dead corpse he looks just like cyprian why would anyone want cyprians brother dead erica asked in a hushed voice so no one else could hear her except her friends and i wonder who killed him good question remus commented scratching the top of his head as he started to think up possible solutions it all depends what side he is on if he a deatheater he could have enclosed explosive information that he threatened to reveal if he on our side he could have endangered voldermort in some way and was killed or he could have been a nobody that was randomly murdered i cantimagine his death being random james muttered logically capturing the attention of everyone what i interested to know is was cletus fleeing from hogwarts or into hogwarts you want to know if the killer is external or internal am i right sirius inquired wondering the same thing i hope the killer doesntbelong to hogwarts but it would make more sense if the killer was from hogwarts i mean how else would cletus have ended up in a secret passage not known to many people lily wondered aloud watching as many people left the great hall to get ready for bed unless the killer once went to hogwarts and remembered about the passage we ll just have to wait for more information from the ministry i suppose remus said quietly rising from his seat and stretching like a tired lion anyone want to head up to the dormitories with me erica and peter joined remus and left the gryffindor dining table roxanne and sirius following soon after james and lily heard roxanne and sirius spiteful arguments echoing even after they had left the great hall and started to ascend the grand staircase there was a silence in the great hall that followed james and lily stared at eachother quizzically both having ample things to think about i sorry i didntask you to the ball sooner james finally mustered warming lily hands with his own everything going on lately momentarily distracted me that alright james but dare i use the word technically again lily started mischievously smirking as james groaned smiled and rolled his eyes i have a question for you lily james said romantically kneeling before lily and bashfully grinning would you do me the honor of letting me accompany you to the halloween ball this sunday lily paused for a moment and smiled sweetly at james she couldnthelp but notice how bloody good looking and cute james was kneeling before her with one of her hands tucked neatly into hers well mr potter i ll have to think about it lily retorted brashly snubbing her nose up at james and snootily swaying out of the great hall james looked flabbergasted he burst out into splendid choked laughter and ran full speed after a giggling lily evans james caught up to lily when he reached the top of the grand staircase and promptly scooped her up into his arms i forgot to tell you lily you arentallowed to think about it you are only allowed to say yes james said matter o factly nodding his head vigorously as lily watched him in amusement well i suppose i could go with you but only if you dontdress up in some dopey costume that ll embarrass me lily replied chuckling at james outraged expression but i was planning on dressing up as a flobberworm james pouted jokingly flashing lily a pair of puppy dog eyes that welled over with sadness lily and james happily clambered up the stairs to the seventh floor both laughing and discussing the upcoming ball and hogsmeade weekend lily felt truly relaxed when she was with james though she felt an odd pang in her heart as she walked by the third floor corridor lily and james did not notice the shrouded figure disguised in the shadows behind a pillar watching them with keen interest rest for now lily evans for in late november whilst

hair raising blood curdling screech the brash brunette had awoken early to ready herself for her shopping trip to hogsmeade but the sunny landscape outside of her window did not appear sitting contently on her chest staring back at her with two bulging diluted eyes was a creature so hideous and fear provoking that roxanne couldntsuppress her mangled scream marcus the turtle get this bloody reptile off of me roxanne bellowed in a frenzy pushing the slimy baffled creature onto the floor and jumping onto erica bed in fright accidentally stepped on erica head and knocking the contents of her nightstand to the floor including erica screaming yo yo from that point forward a chain reaction of shrieking and breaking occurred oddly enough not only was there a screaming yo yo on erica dresser but also a box of filibuster fireworks one particularly wicked firework sent off on a rampage ricocheting off the walls of the dormitory and setting lily bed drapes on fire ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh lily bawled as the screaming yo yo awoke her from her slumber and alerted her of the fire spreading above her sleeping figure what the hell is going on lily nose dived off of her bed as the flames started to consume her curtains joining a bemused roxanne and erica that were frantically trying to hush up the screaming yo yo and stop the epidemic fireworks erica was so bleary eyed that it seemed she was still half asleep why wontthis bleeding thing shut up roxanne squealed in panic trying to quiet the yo yo that was now wailing in displeasure throw it out the window lily screeched ducking as the firework recoiled above her head and sent roxanne sheets ablaze as well what do i do about this firework erica whipped her wand out of her trunk and pointed it toward the firework trying to vanish it so it would stop causing problems however the firework reacted to the spell in an anomalous way water started gushing from out of the back of it spraying all the sputtering girls and flooding the dorm room great erica drown us all why dontyou lily yelled out in surprise as the room quickly flooded and the water started rising above their waists somebody do something well at least the fire has been extinguished erica retorted in panic clutching onto one of the posts belonging to her bed as she slipped and bashed her hand into her trunk all three girls were rooted to their spots in horror as the dorm room continued to fill with magical water from the firework neither windows nor doors were open their room would be full to the brim in mere moments if the cumulating water did not start to escape lily waded over toward the door and thrust it open water flooded down the girl dorm staircase carrying with it lily roxanne erica and marcus the turtle this caught james sirius remus and peter by surprise for they were bounding up the staircase with peter trusty baseball bats swung over their shoulders men retreat sirius black shouted in comical surprise as the sight of all three girls barreling down the staircase a tidal wave of water carrying their pajama clad bodies met his eyes merciful merlin james bawled in shock trying to dive behind the common room couch along with remus but not succeeding sirius and peter dropped their bats and were swept away in the dwindling wave once the water had dispersed and dampened the crimson common room carpet seven wet and twisted figures lay on the floor james was surprisingly pleased to see lily had washed right into his arms and had her head cuddled closely in the arch of his neck would you look at this james seductively whispered as the others started to regain consciousness i ve gone and caught myself a mermaid you are one lucky sailor lily drawled sarcastically though she couldnthelp but smile as james affectionately grinning down at her and tucked a wet strand of hair out of her face yes yes i am james started teasingly his face getting close to lily s but i was hoping you d be wearing one of those seashell bras roxanne pushed up on her forearms into a cat like position and surveyed the damage her gray eyes narrowed murderously as they spotted an angelic turtle casually walking about the common room gleefully peter bleeding pettigrew roxanne snarled in a deathly whisper peter soaked head looked up at roxanne in pure trepidation have you any idea how much trouble your bloody turtle has caused m m marcus peter stuttered worriedly blinking his eyes unnecessarily what does he have to do with all this that that tortoise roxanne spat getting up off the drenched carpet and standing menacingly over marcus caused our room to be set on fire and then flood that not possible peter sputtered stupidly inching his way toward roxanne h he just a t t turtle no magical powers at all i swear magical powers or not i chucking his shelled ass out the window roxanne bellowed angrily picking up marcus from beneath his belly and stomping toward the common room window no leave him a a lone peter cried out feebly stumbling toward roxanne and tripping over a book that had drifted from the girl dormitory it was sirius black that picked himself off of the floor and snatched the hand roxanne held marcus in stop being a spaz and give peter his turtle will you sirius demanded more than asked matching the glare roxanne was providing him with if you dontlet go of me sirius black i will throw you out of this window instead roxanne replied dryly staring pointedly at the hand grasping her forearm i would love to see you attempt that sirius countered a challenging grin spreading over his face but i cantpromise i wontpush you out the window in my defense roxanne crossly seized her arm away from sirius and dropped marcus on a chair nearest to the window sirius didntseem pleased with roxanne even when she relented to doing as he asked roxanne was beyond bewildered you need to get a life sirius roxanne spat in perplexity walking back over toward where james and remus were helping erica and lily dry off o yah well you need a bloody attitude adjustment sirius stormed out of the gryffindor common room shutting the portrait roughly behind him the fat lady huffed indignantly and shouted well i never a few times to catch his attention peter with marcus tucked protectively in his pocket jostled quickly after sirius in retaliation roxanne stormed up the stairs toward the girls dormitories kicking odd objects out of her way lily cringed when she heard one of her hair clips crunch under roxanne foot and slammed the wooden door shut remus james erica and lily all looked at eachother in bamboozled silence so james started his brow furrowed and his eyes scanning a sodden lily skeptically i see your morning has been eventful you could say that lily said in a slightly dazed tone ringing out her pajamas over the burgundy rug and tucking her sopping hair behind her ears you dontmind if i use your shower do you i slightly fearful to be in the same room as roxanne at the moment james remus and the two girls trudged up the stairs into the marauder dormitory running into many stunned males along the way the younger boys looked embarrassed when they encountered lily and erica while the older ones especially those only adorning towels looked quite pleased indeed what are you looking at pollard james called over his shoulder as the gryffindor seeker eyed the two girls keenly get your ass back in your dorm or you ll do what potter jesse retorted teasingly shaking his head and laughing curse my broom before the next match even better james replied suavely turning around and grinning at the rebellious fifth year i ll stuff the snitch up your arse then lets see you find it lily and erica grimaced as they entered the marauders exceedingly messy room socks and boxers were hanging limply off the furniture and assorted pranks and treats were spread along the floor ever so often poking out from below a bed remus and james did not seem the least bit perturbed because of the clutter and muddle you live like a pen full of muddy pigs erica commented in disgust banishing clothing and candy out of her way with her wand how you are able to maneuver around this room is beyond me quidditch skills come in handy james smirked thrusting open his trunk to collect some owl treats for lenny and a chocolate frog for himself though he intended to share it with lily erica and lily used the marauder bathroom for about an hour showering and primping their hair to perfection the moaning and groaning coming from the boys finally caused them to head down to breakfast lily and james shared a chocolate frog along the way sirius was sitting at the gryffindor table with peter reading with intensity what appeared to be the daily prophet lily was surprised to see roxanne sitting contently at the hufflepuff table with vince check this out james sirius said speedily as james lily erica and remus found seats at their table and tucked into breakfast james straightened out the newspaper and turned to the front page in intrigue mysterious murder in hogsmeade melinda bobbin reporter for the daily prophet hogsmeade with the threat of he who must not be named looming news of an unidentified murdered body found in hogsmeade can mean only bad news the ministry of magic was anonymously tipped on friday morning about a dead body in the heart of hogsmeade thus sparking frenzied rumors and a lengthy investigation the body belonging to what seemed to be a male wizard was obtained from the basement of honeydukes on october 29 an exceeding odd place to find a dead man i have no idea how someone could have gotten into the cellars when the store was closed one honeydukes worker commented wishing to remain anonymous the shop is protected with multiple robbery prevention spells not to mention the ghouls are always on the watch the daily prophet has tried numerous times to get in touch with the owner of honeydukes but all owls have been returned unopened it is rumored the honeydukes manager is currently being investigated by the ministry at approximately two o clock on friday afternoon the ministry held a press conference in one of the abandoned courthouses releasing key information forensic wizards had uncovered about the identity of the body after intensive physical analysis the ministry has uncovered the identity of the body found murdered in hogsmeade mediwizard gregory gorges stated the body belongs to a cletus cyprian a young wizard knowledgeable in magical history that was visiting from greece for a historical study cletus brother cristoforo cyprian was the first to be alerted of his death and is currently conducting funeral arrangements for the twenty four year old cristoforo is an astronomy professor at hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry it is deeply unfortunate that an event such as this has taken place minister of magic landon potter commented when asked about how and why cletus was murdered the ministry is still seeking answers but as of yet we still dontknow who killed cletus or why the ministry extends its greatest sympathies to the cyprian family the ministry has asked anyone with prevalent knowledge about cletus cyprian or the murder to come forward in order to aid their investigation reward money will be offered if information is substantial it has not yet been confirmed that he who must not be named is in any way involved in the murder of cletus cyprian nothing there we dontalready know james muttered seriously handing the paper to lily and spreading strawberry jelly on a piece of toast i expect my father is running around in a frenzy the hall was alight with chatter and gossip about cyprian even the teachers seemed to be conversing conspicuously over their golden platters of fritters and eggs professor flitwick looked to be sitting on the staff table straining to hear what professor mcgonagall and pomfrey were discussing i wonder when professor cyprian will return to school erica wondered aloud taking her turn reading the crimped paper you guys haventhad a class in awhile right we had one class fairly recently lily added remembering the stern conversation she received about mars but i suppose we ll have another one soon i love how i referred to as the anonymous tipper sirius interjected chuckling as he re read the paper he paused when he heard roxanne sharp laughter emit from the hufflepuff table james and remus eyed sirius worriedly for his somber manner since roxanne had announced she was going to the ball with vince was very alarming lily noticed sirius was barely touching his breakfast another abnormal occurrence coming from a boy who could live in a grocery store and be satisfied who up for heading into hogsmeade early this morning remus quipped cheerily having to purchase a new dress shirt and costume for the halloween ball i figure we can beat the crowds into hogsmeade and hit all the shops early the marauders lily and erica swiftly excused themselves from the gryffindor table and headed out toward the grounds lily thought she saw roxanne perky smile falter as vince put his arm around her the walk into hogsmeade village was fairly tiring the crisp cool air pinched at students cheeks as they strode along the winding cobblestone streets storeowners had stands set up in front of their magical shops ready for the hoards of students that would soon flood the village and bring in hefty profits how about we head into madam puddifoot and grab a latte some caffeine would do me wonders erica suggested still a tad fatigued from the morning catastrophe that musty old tea shop i cantset foot in there that place threatens to quash my masculinity sirius barked laughably terror seemingly shining in his dark eyes i agree with sirius i would prefer a place without pink and lace james added scrunching up his nose as he remembered a particularly horrid date that had taken place beneath fluffy cherubs pelting him with pink confetti fine remus and i will go then erica retorted in a bit of a huff grabbing onto remus arm and dragging him toward the teashop we can meet at the costume shop later james and sirius sniggered as remus mouthed the words help me behind her back i need to pick up some quidditch gloves from quality quidditch supplies while i here anyone up to coming james flatly inquired digging his hands deep into his jean pockets after remus and erica had disappeared from sight i ll come peter piped in eagerly looking at james i want to buy a new pair of omnioculars before the gryffindor vs ravenclaw match why dontlily and i meet you in gladrags wizardwear we ll look for costumes while you guys get your quidditch stuff sirius suavely proposed seemingly eager to get lily on her own ok james said slowly he seemed almost reluctant to agree james and peter bid their farewells and headed south while a slightly bemused lily and sirius heading north toward the popular clothing store i thought you would be inclined to go to the quidditch store rather than a clothing store lily stated curiously opening the shop door and hearing the little bell rattle in all honestly i would much rather be in a quidditch store sirius offered grinning at lily baffled expression but you ms evans need to make an expensive purchase for tonight what are you talking about lily started before a plump middle aged witch wearing long ruby robes approached the two friends what can i do for you dearies gladys gladrags politely inquired in a cheerful tone looking for anything in particular yes i ll need you to take us to your exclusive changing area please sirius replied curtly smirking as the witch expression grew even more gleeful of course right away follow me the shop owner exclaimed escorting sirius and lily over to the back of the store behind a long velvet curtain and into a lounge area that looked fit for a queen i ll just be a moment getting the racks of clothing make yourselves comfortable lily collapsed onto a velvet crushed ottoman and admired the finely decorated area in awe sirius casually took a seat on one of the high backed leather chairs and grinned at lily clueless face i think it best you explain what going on lily sharply said once she had regained her composure i haventa clue what we re doing here well my dear lillykins we need to buy you a dress for tonight festivities sirius said leaning forward in his chair james parents are in hogsmeade and asked us all to dinner tonight we canthave you showing up to a posh restaurant wearing casual clothing but i have nice clothing lily protested grinding her hands into fists how do you know i donthave a lovely outfit back at hogwarts have you ever spent more than five hundred galleons on fancy robes or a dress sirius inquired casually withdrawing a galleon from his pocket and throwing it up in the air of course not that a ridiculous amount of money to spend on clothing lily replied in an outraged tone she could never scrap up enough money for a set of robes like that exactly the robes james and his parents wear can be more than a thousand galleons never mind five hundred sirius said seriously watching lily jaw drop even i wear robes like that i dontwant you to feel awkward when we go out tonight i cantafford clothing like that maybe i shouldntgo i buying you a dress lily dontworry about the money sirius interjecting rolling his eyes as lily flushed and grew more defensive not in a million years i wontallow you to spend that much money on me sirius lily practically shrieked jumping up and crossing her arms there no way lily my family has enough money to fill the bloody black lake at hogwarts a dress will hardly put a stint in such a fortune sirius snapped back trying to convince lily it the principle of the thing lily retorted stubbornly her emerald eyes swimming with fire gladys gladrags returned to the overly furbished changing room minutes later bringing with her racks and racks of disgracefully priced dresses and formal robes lily immediately took a seat back on her ottoman and snubbed her nose at the clothing now you take your time dears if you need anything you come and find me the shop owner added blissfully scooting out of the room lily evans i wont screw you bloody pride and get in that goddamn change room no if you dontput on a bleeding dress i will dress you myself you wouldntdare sirius snatched a canary yellow dress off of the rack full of clothing with a menacing look upon his face and approached lily ready to fulfil his threat lily huffed grabbed a royal blue cocktail dress off of a rack and stormed into the change room cursing as she pulled the drapes shut over the opening that better shut up lily tried on many different colors and styles showing sirius each one begrudgingly sirius seemed very particular stating they werent classy enough regal enough or modest enough what wrong with this one lily inquired angrily wearing a short salmon dress as she observed herself in the long mirror in front of sirius i like this one nothing about it makes you stand out amongst a crowd sirius replied skeptically wrinkling his nose at the dress and it way too short you dontwant to look like a floozy since when does sirius black not want a girl to dress like a floozy as i recall half of your girlfriends wore skimpy outfits lily retorted turning to face sirius yes but i didntgo out with them for their intellect charm or grace sirius replied rolling his eyes what did i have on mind sex do we want james parents to have sex on the mind no you need a classy dress that will enhance your beauty and doesntreveal your distracting womanly curves you ve put a lot of thought into this lily said slowly and suspiciously eyeing sirius as if he were up to something i want james parents to like you they arenteasily impressed i doing this for you and james lily sirius said looking at lily genuinely i know how much james adores you i sure his parents know too he may not be presenting you as his girlfriend yet but he will be soon but how do you know i ve seen the two of you together lily sirius said grinning at lily astonished expression i not stupid i know something is going on remus told me he caught the two of you kissing yesterday morning lily seemed at a loss for words as sirius confessed his suspicions his smirk grew more pronounced as lily remained silent her jaw moving up and down attempting to conjure words who else knows lily inquired meekly a blush creeping onto her cheeks just remus and i stop worrying we wontgo around telling anyone until you two make your little love affair public sirius said snorting and grinning wildly i cantwait until james makes me the best man at your wedding shut up i cantbelieve the two of you found out i told james that remus would wake up lily shrieked foolishly sighing as sirius continued to poke fun i made him keep quiet so you wouldntbe able to tease us all fantasies come to an end mrs potter sirius exclaimed happily ducking as lily threw a pillow off of one of the couches at him stop trying to injure me and get back into that change room stop ordering me around lily yelled out from behind the curtain i dontfeel half as bad spending your money now sirius chuckled and collapsed on a cushy couch here comes the bride shut up black sirius and lily who was clutching a gladrags shopping bag waited patiently for james peter remus and erica by the hogsmeade clock tower on the eastside of the village erica and remus arrived first erica contently sporting a cup of tea closely followed by james and peter what that you got there james asked in interest trying to pry into lily shopping as the group headed toward corky crow costume shop down the bustling streets nothing just a new shirt lily said in a dismissive fashion whipping the bag away from james grip buy your quidditch gloves yes james replied cheerily i saw a poster of the ballycastle bats i quite liked too remember the butterbeer commercials with barny the fruitbat that got to be the best mascot i ve ever seen peter added excitably jumping up and down calm down pettigrew you like the irish team erica yelped in a scandalized tone almost spilling the contents of her cup how could you the tutshill tornados are the best team in the league captain roderick plumpton holds a world record i mean in 3 5 seconds he caught the snitch when playing against caerphilly catapults in 1921 we all know that was a mistake james fired back lily rolled her eyes as the marauders and erica began fighting about quidditch the bloody snitch flew up the sleeve of his robe that a lie personally i support the moose jaw meteorites the three canadian quidditch teams are among the best in the league remus said logically even though they caused a stir at the victory parties last summer no way sirius interjected loudly shaking his head in disappointment the banchory bangers are the best team that team was disbanded from the league they suck erica snapped sharply crossing her arms stubbornly why were they disbanded lily inquired exceedingly confused with the quidditch conversation the banchory bangers let bludgers loose in a muggle area during an after party james whispered to lily as erica continued to chatter not to mention they tried to capture a dragon for their mascot as erica and the boys argued about quidditch down the streets of hogsmeade lily noticed out of the corner of her eye roxanne shopping alone in scrivenshaft quill shop she looked downtrodden i ll catch up with you guys later lily called out heading toward the quill shop she neednthave alerted her friends of her departure for they didntnotice her slip away lily opened the door to the shop located on high street and took a moment to observe the rows of assorted copper ink pots and quills from pheasant feathers to ones of decadent black and gold roxanne was at the back of the empty store aimlessly twiddling a red quill between her fingers to help the time pass you look much more attractive with a smile on your face lily said from behind roxanne spooking her and causing her to turn around in surprise i always told you frowning made you look like a wrinkled toad lily that the first time you ve ever said that roxanne said rolling her eyes as her frown upturned into a smile where are the others everyone heading to the costume shop why arentyou with vince roxanne paused for a moment and her gaze dropped down to the floor she pretended to admire the pigmentation of the hardwood i well i not going to the halloween ball with vince anymore roxanne whispered watching lily expression change to that of surprise at breakfast today i realized what a pompous womanizing prat he is what did he do to make you change your mind so quickly lily inquired in astonishment i thought you were smitten with the guy he an ass roxanne murmured peeking over shelves to see if anyone was listening in on their conversation at breakfast he was making fun of sirius and james it evident he insanely jealous of their popularity and quidditch talent bastard lily cursed her eyes narrowing into a glare whenever i started talking he wouldntpay attention he was too interested in all the pretty hufflepuff girls striding by and blowing kisses at him roxanne spat her expression angry and slightly hurt so after breakfast i told him to shove a broomstick up his arse lily broke into high pitched laughter and hugged roxanne fiercely she always admired her strength and her i don t take crap attitude roxanne started to giggle too though she was worried about going to the ball i cantgo to the ball lily now i donthave a partner what rubbish you are going to this ball whether you like it or not and we are going to go and pick out our costumes lily stated firmly grasping roxanne wrist and pulling her out of the quill shop you ll look all fancy in your costume and tons of boys will beg you to dance roxanne barely relenting to lily was led out onto high street and down towards corky crow costume shop which was the newest addition to hogsmeade village roxanne and lily entered the shop and were awe struck with the tall shelves filled with crazy colored costumes and props such as jester hats fairy wands and troll clubs there you are hey roxanne james said eagerly from the corner of the expansive shop making his way towards the girls lily i have to show you a costume roxanne waltzed over to where erica and peter were playfully hitting eachother over the head with plastic balloon hammers while lily followed an eager james potter to a secluded part of the humorous shop james summoned a shimmering blue and green costume down from a high shelf and presented it to lily her eyes grew wide and her smile expansive as james then showed her the costume he intended on wearing to match hers james that perfect the cluttered shop was comprised of two floors the second having a balcony overlooking the dusty shelves and bustling customers sirius black leaned against the iron railing on the balcony watching as roxanne joined in on erica and peter fun with a small conflicting smile adorning his face out of the corner of his eye sirius saw lily and james paying for their costumes at the cash counter it unusual to see you tongue tied over a girl mate remus lupin said from behind the handsome marauder coming up beside sirius and leaning against the railing with him what makes roxanne different from all the others i dunno sirius mumbled incoherently avoiding eye contact with remus and i not tongue tied i just tired dontbe daft remus barked rolling his eyes and offering a small smile if you were anymore depressed i might mistake you for your delightful mother nothing a few firewhiskeys cantfix sirius grunted offhandedly shut up you arentgetting drunk why dontyou tell roxanne how you feel and do us all a favor remus said lightly watching roxanne pick up a plastic fairy wand and scream when the end exploded i personally enjoy the buoyant completely mental sirius black myself sirius sighed and turned toward remus trying to reassure the sandy haired boy that he was all right with a convincing stare remus scoffed alerting sirius of his laughable failure pick out a costume before i curse you black remus ordered comically raising his wand and mimicking merlin and find a date to the ball while you re at it piss off lupin sirius black shouted audaciously grinning as he shoved remus into a box of snarling seashells that clamped firmly onto the collar of his polo shirt dontmake me go all werewolf on your ass lupin warned quietly smirking he heard sirius chuckling as he made his way down the stairs to the first floor a half and hour later the group of gryffindors filtered out of the cluttered shop each individual clutching a brown bag concealing their costume for the ball everyone chatted excitably as they headed toward the outskirts of town sirius kept sending curious glances toward roxanne wondering why she wasntwith vince sirius could no longer quash his inquisitiveness why arentyou with vince sirius asked ignoring a conversation remus and lily were having are you still going to the ball with him i dontbelieve that is any of your business roxanne quipped curtly avoiding eye contact and focusing on the gravel road a slight blush brushed her cheeks if you re not going with him come with me sirius said seriously staring at roxanne intently lily james remus erica and peter slowed down leaving the two walking side by side a fair distance ahead it was odd for a jolt of fear a tint of nervousness and a spell of shyness intermingled and coursed throughout roxanne signaling her defensive mechanisms she wanted to say yes to sirius but she couldn t she had assured herself over and over again that she wouldntsuccumb to his charm his looks or his smile she wouldntallow herself to fall in love with sirius black what wrong black roxanne started fiercely looking up at sirius cantscore a date am i the only one that you think you can bribe into going with you sirius stopped walking beside roxanne his stare turning cold and hard roxanne looked back at him and felt her heart clench uneasily she had really stung sirius this time forget it you re not worth my time sirius stalked away from roxanne and headed toward a large group of giggling hufflepuff girls by the clock tower he bee lined for the prettiest smartest girl of the bunch ella evangelist hello sirius ella said curtly furrowing her brow curiously as the handsome marauder headed toward her with a determined look ella you are going to the ball with me sirius said his face emotionless and tone demanding i ll be in front of the hufflepuff common room at seven tears stung roxanne eyes as she saw sirius approach the blonde bombshell from hufflepuff she turned away and started running toward the castle blindly pushing bewildered students out of her way sirius subtly looked over his shoulder ignoring the giggling ella and winced as he saw a distraught roxanne heading out of the village alone abruptly leaving the group of hufflepuffs without a word sirius roughly pushed open the door to the hogs head and ordered a shot of flaming firewhiskey i going after roxanne erica said breaking the silence that encompassed the group and speedily jogging after the brunette damn it peter you go after sirius i have to pick up more sweets at honeydukes i ll meet you there remus promptly ordered i ll catch you two later remus and peter split up one marauder heading toward the bar and the other heading back into the heart of the village lily and james were left in the middle of the street both baffled shit james cursed what do we do lily inquired anxiously watching hogwarts students pass by with parcels of every size and color well i cantreally do anything james replied regretfully i have to go to dinner with my parents tonight i was planning on inviting everyone too i guess sirius roxanne erica remus and peter are indisposed lily whispered logically watching james expression grow stonier which leaves me despite being worried for sirius james brightened up looking at lily hopefully you ll come i didntplan on abandoning you lily teased quietly a small smile on her face we ll just have to deal with our friends turmoil after dinner james gleefully picked up lily and began to spin her around making her laugh and shriek passers by looked upon the couple with laughter or jealousy something neither gryffindor cared to notice whoa calm down potter lily arms might fall off the way she holding onto you gerald smith shouted in amusement a roguish grin apparent on his face from afar you re just jealous you donthave a gorgeous redhead going to the ball with you smith james called back laughing as lily hit him indignantly in the arm and blushed deeply as many surrounding males nodded their heads in affirmation touch bustles of flighty hogwarts students exited the tiny hogsmeade village as the night began to cast shadows and adults filled the streets as opposed to teenagers storeowners packed up their stands with mere flicks of their wands and greeting signs were flipped to reveal the words sorry we re closed lights flickered into existence though the glow of the crescent moon aided in the illumination of the tranquil landscape lily was currently in the bathroom of the three broomsticks struggling to squirm into the new dress sirius had bought her lily begrudgingly had to admit that the dress was very pretty and elegant with its soft jade pleats and white lace it came up just past her knees had a boat neckline and a cream streak of silk that ran under her bust line the dress was simple and semi formal perfect for the occasion lily james badgered knocking rapidly on bathroom door why is it taking you twenty minutes to put on lipstick stop complaining lily said feebly very nervous to reveal herself in the stunning purchase where is your patience ever wonder why i became a chaser instead of a seeker james called back shaking his head and checking the time because i donthave the tolerance to catch the bloody snitch o shut up i coming lily peeked open the door and shimmied out closing the bathroom door firmly behind her james who previously had been trying to put on his wristwatch dropped the shiny object on the ground and gaped when lily approached him james astounded look made lily feel self conscious she wriggled a little and folded her arms well say something lily said flatly worry eclipsing her emerald eyes you you merlin james practically whimpered his eyes the size of teacup saucers you did a bit more than apply lipstick i bought the dress today in hogsmeade lily said suavely her pearly whites gleaming as james shook his head in amused shock and his grin grew larger how do i look you look really really really good james practically sputtered his breath catching in his throat as he bent over to pick up his watch god you gave me a heart attack o great i dress up and you fall ill it called being love sick lillykins james whispered seductively in lily ear sending chills up her spine now shall we go james and lily crossed the main dining area in the three broomsticks collecting many intrigued stares from adults some who james recognized from the ministry and up the creaking stairs to the private dining area lily was sure they would find his parents there james a woman with elegant black hair chirped when james opened the dining area door she wore a regal sapphire dress and was absolutely dazzling hey mom james greeted moderately embracing his excitable mother james father landon rose from the round clothed table he occupied and approached lily with a warm smile lily still found it difficult to not be in awe of the minster of magic lily how are you landon asked affectionately smiling in the same manner james usually did how is school i fine thank you school is going well this year is turning out to be the best lily mrs potter interrupted turning her attention away from james and toward the redhead look at you just as beautiful as james described mrs potter encased lily in a fierce hug completely cutting off her husband and catching lily off guard she subtly smiled at james who was blushing at his mother previous comment thank you lily replied brightly relieved so was no longer in danger of having a lung punctured i so grateful you invited me tonight o not a problem i was eager to meet you come sit down mrs potter cooed happily ushering lily to her seat followed by mr potter and james james was delighted to observe both his father and mother warming up to lily for neither parent was easily impressed rosmerta came around about ten minutes later taking orders and serving drinks and once loosened up with a few butterbeers mrs potter delved into a conversation about the marauders you think they re bad now lily mrs potter snapped though a smile creeped onto her face the whole bunch of them almost drove me to insanity when they were younger hey now that not true james added watching his dad snort indignantly in his soup what did we ever do we were practically model children that a laugh mrs potter scoffed every time i turned around you or sirius had your pockets stuffed with toad spawn flobberworms and eels mr potter roared with laughter slapping his hand down on the table occasionally it seemed he enjoyed watching someone be lectured for a change what are you laughing at mrs potter practically shrieked turning to her husband james learned all that mischief from you well i had to participate in his upbringing somehow mr potter announced triumphantly gaining a few giggles from lily and a playful smack from mrs potter but i remember your face when that eel poked out of james pocket sheer terror mrs potter barked looking at lily in search of support and rolling her eyes and her husband and son i had a bunch of misfits running about my house wait i still do we were adventurous ok james said comically his expression growing merry at the thought of the marauders he made eye contact with lily and his smile grew james was glad to see she was having a good time and was getting along with his family i deathly afraid of any type of insect or reptile mrs potter added turning to lily again i was tempted to throw sirius down a well once he brought a disgusting snake into my house i think we re all inclined to throw sirius down a well now and then lily said cheerfully causing the occupants of the table to laughably agree i ll drink to that landon potter jibed gaily raising his mug and sloshing the contents when it clinked with the other glasses after delving into a delicious meal the conversation became much more school related for mrs potter brought up the topic of seventh year exams i ve never been so stressed in my entire life mrs potter declared dramatically i wanted to a medi witch so i had to pass my potions exam with an exceeds expectations i was bullocks at potions the studying nearly killed me what did you want to do after hogwarts lily landon potter asked keenly his expression growing intense at all interested in working at the ministry o i would love to lily twittered ardently i suppose i wouldntmind a job that entitles curse breaking or perhaps magical cooperation the ministry can always use skilled curse breakers what with all the dark and complex spells being conjured these days the minister said almost reluctantly if your marks remain high i sure something can be arranged after your graduation lily beamed at the prospect of working at the ministry she was a muggleborn and previously assumed it would be difficult attaining a well paying job james looked pleased and gave his father a teasing thankful grin imagine you both working at the ministry mrs potter said slowly a calculating smile on her face wouldntthat be something a curse breaker and an auror lily dropped her silver etched fork in shock james you never told me you wanted to become an auror lily proclaimed trying to suppress her worried outrage it such a dangerous job that what i said mrs potter added i would much rather him work in the muggle artifacts department where the most dangerous objects are biting teacups and gurgling toilets mrs potter broke off her sentence when a gruff unshaven man broke through the door at the top of the stairs alarming rosmerta and causing her to drop her tray the occupants of the dining area fell silent as the man staggered to a halt his beady eyes searching through the tables of people a stench entered the room and people recoiled when he approached them you you get out of here rosmerta finally mustered she backed off when he gave her a nasty almost fervent look where the minister of magic the wolf like man spat worry evident in his voice and causing his tone to quake where the minister of magic the revolting man pulled a crooked wand out of his pocket and grabbed hold of rosmerta hand pulling her screaming body up to his chest and pointing his wand at her throat immediately cowardly wizards began apparating out of the restaurant while others including many that worked in the ministry jumped from their seats and trained their wands on the mangled man landon please mrs potter whispered in a begging tone as landon began to rise from his seat ready to negotiate rosmerta release james grabbed lily hand and held onto it tightly as if to reassure her everything was going to be all right mrs potter came behind the table with james and lily and on mr potter orders crouched down behind it there eyes still fearfully peering at the scene unfolding i am the minister of magic the snippy and crusty man turned his attention to landon eyed him skeptically and lowered his wand apparently satisfied after releasing a fearful rosmerta he started to walk towards mr potter the sudden movement of rosmerta distracted the man landon whipped out his wand and immobilized him causing many people to breathe a sigh of relief minister minister the man shouted wildly his eyes entreating as he lay upon the hardwood floor i ve come under great personal risk to tell you who murdered cletus cyprian the surrounded public gasped at the revelation but mr potter however did not look convinced with his wand still trained toward the mysterious man landon began to question him who are you why am i to believe anything you tell me about this murder investigation the minister of magic inquired calmly though in his eyes shone a fierceness that demanded answers you must believe me minister the man begged groping his hands together as though he was about to pray cletus and i we were friends both of us dedicated deatheaters surrounding ministry officials immediately started whispering among themselves some even extracted their wands and pointed it toward the man james recognized one auror from the ministry kingsley shacklebolt you willingly admit to being a deatheater do you know the charges you will face for this crime landon demanded crouching down to get closer to the man twisted face yes but this information will more than make up for it the man announced he kept looking over his shoulder as if he expected someone to be there the dark lord he hatched a plan a plan cletus and i overheard cletus isntthe type to be a deatheater but he got caught in the wrong group of people he had no choice shacklebolt mr potter interrupted perform the counter curse for the imperio would you let see if he being controlled by the voldermort or perhaps a deatheater kingsley made his way from amongst the crowd and shouted riopime which caused the stranger to convulse for a second then relax the crotchety man did not seem resistant or defensive about being checked he clean good now continue on landon ordered beckoning kingsley to come beside him and listen along what is voldermort plan it so terrible so many people will die the man said his voice softening and his eyes glazing over as if he were in another place cletus he was so disgusted he headed for hogwarts straight for dumbledore voldermort found out he always finds out the man shuddered checking over his shoulder again with eyes stricken with worry and fear i ll be next i fled before cletus headed to hogwarts but i saw the daily prophet and knew i just knew he didntmake it did voldermort kill him landon asked rigorously grabbing hold of the man shoulder and shaking him out of his hysterical moaning no no no no it was the insider the one carrying out his plans he groaned cradling his arms together before his eyes grew wide and he hissed it was he here kingsley shacklebolt lunged toward mr potter grabbing him around the waist and toppling with him behind the table where james lily and mrs potter were crouching the immobilized man shrieked as if he were a newborn baby as four deatheaters apparated into the room avada kedavra they all shouted simultaneously red streaks of light emitting from their wands and hitting the wailing man in the chest james coddled lily head in his chest shielding her from view though she was still able to look into the lifeless eyes of the murdered man the deatheaters upturned tables and ignited them people began to scream and shoot curses towards the triumphant deatheaters like kingsley and another auror plymouth the man never got the chance to reveal the killer voldermort made sure of that sierra apparate home mr potter shouted to his wife dodging a banishing charm as he stood up i ll get them to hogwarts go but i cantleave you go mrs potter vanished terror and fire reflecting in her eyes with lily still pressed up against his chest james raised his wand and fired a spell at a deatheater that was about to curse rosmerta lily took out her wand shock etched onto her face and began shooting assorted charms at the attacking deatheaters as well mr potter came up beside kingsley and began dueling with two deatheaters at once james looked ready to join them but lily pleadingly held him back he wasntabout to abandon her he d stay and protect her kingsley mr potter yelled loudly deflecting a killing curse with a silvery platter and kicking a chair in front of a deatheater who stumbled on it get the kids to hogwarts alert dumbledore and get back up kingsley immediately dove toward the two teenagers and taking a handful of purple powder and throwing it into a flaming fire atop a table stepped into it with lily and james lily felt queasy for the incessant spinning was giving her a headache she could feel the auror and james beside her as they twisted and turned through the floo network ommmmmpppfff lily felt her face pressed against a bitter sandstone floor and looked up to see a very bewildered dumbledore and professor mcgonagall observing her james and kingsley dumbledore office was expansive with many trinkets and books adorning shelves whizzing and sputtering was heard in every crevice and lily noticed a beautiful phoenix perched in the northern corner of the office there been an attack in hogsmeade one man is already dead i need back up right now kingsley said quickly jumping to his feet and throwing more purple powder into dumbledore fire let go dumbledore said firmly his brow furrowed and expression concentrated wasting no time and without question kingsley and dumbledore stepped into the raging purple fire and flooed back to the three broomsticks mcgonagall was left to badger james and lily with calculating questions are you ok james asked lily scanning her trembling body in search of cuts or bruises do you need to go to the hospital wing no lily replied visibly shaken thank merlin dumbledore is going to help your father those deatheaters they were terrible my word what going on professor mcgonagall inquired in puzzlement helping james and lily to their feet deatheaters you say the flames in the fireplace began to spit and crack again quickly bursting into arrays of color and depositing dumbledore who had left about thirty second ago no need to fret minerva professor dumbledore quipped assuredly stepping out of the fireplace once more and brushing ash from his robes the deatheaters are gone only one death two injuries my father james hurriedly asked grasping lily hand for support fine not a scratch to report he apparated home to see your mother dumbledore said soothingly putting a hand on james shoulder you and miss evans are unharmed we re fine just a little shaken up lily whispered trying to make her teeth stop chattering i d fancy going up to bed actually excellent you and mr potter need to be rested for the halloween preparations tomorrow dumbledore said attempting a smile and if you could please do not speak of this matter until i address the school at breakfast lily and james left the massive office and trailed down the hogwarts corridors which were deathly silent neither lily nor james knew what to say as they began their climb up the grand staircase i sorry lily james finally mustered looking disappointed tonight turned out to be complete havoc not to mention dangerous dontbe sorry lily replied softly stopping to face james by the statue of trevor the troll this night was going fantastically until that man showed up i just i hate what this fucking world is coming to james announced furiously his eyes retaining anger these days you canteven go out to dinner without the threat of being killed a few portraits gasped at his appalling language and dig their fists deeply into their ears james was tempted to give them the finger when voldermort is gone when he stopped lily started fatigue overcoming her maybe then things will go back to normal back to being safe dontyou see lily this is why i want to become an auror james whispered sighing and running his fingers through his hair so i can stop this bloody madness james and lily entered the gryffindor common room and stopped before the stairs to their dorms all they did was stare at eachother for five minutes as if to try and comprehend the situation and what the other person was feeling was thinking james didntknow it but his words had effected lily greatly james kissed lily chastely on the lips and relented to returning to his dormitory but not before tugging her into a fierce hug and muttering the words i think my parents like you as lily watched james muscular retreating figure she promised herself one thing a promise she was not even willing to tell james his protests would overpower her perhaps even change her mind lily evans was going to become an auror lily opened the door to her dormitory which was pitch black and had shopping bags scattered over the floor and costumes hanging from doorknobs and could hear the soft sad singing of her best friend i dontwant to do this anymore i dontwant to be the reason why i dontwant to hurt him anymore i dontwant to take away his light i dontwant to be a murderer roxanne turned over in her bed and silently began to cry into her already tear stained pillow lily didntwant roxanne to know she had heard her sobbing and confessing her feelings about sirius so she closed the door softly and leaned up against the piece of wall outside her dorm her eyes began to droop and soon sleep embraced her it was in that moment that lily realized roxanne was truly in love with sirius black

everybody enjoyed the chapter halloween ball coming up next o chapter 39 smooth criminals part one this chapter concerns some harsh language reader discreation advised gentle waves etched the shadowed waters in cool strides as the wind lightly touched upon the glistening shores trees eclipsed the shimmering sun and caste arrays of patterned darkness on the murky sand garnishing the bottom of the lake it was as if whispers of a tragic song interwove among the current beguiling the scaled fish and causing the water reeds to sway melodiously an irresistible curiosity surged thrusting forward blurred images of the deep swept by in colors of turquoise and azure a somber light emerged from the gloom and illuminated the sculpted edges of an underwater palace its glass arches poignant and well manufactured through a window in the western corner was seen a sleek and unadorned room with high vaulted ceilings and symbolic text scrawled along the floors it was empty and aloof lacking the usual music and clatter of trident and glass something caught her eye the throne encrusted in back of the throne located prominently above where the siren king head usually situated was a jewel of many facets and one calculated color sapphire the jewel winked as light trickled along the smooth carved edges concealing a secret and tempting onlookers taking a closer look a faint image began to mirror on the jewel many faces the outlines of a visage materialized then soft tresses that flowed down petit shoulders two green orbs peered into the stone a frightened expression swirling in their depths lily recoiled cold sweat dripped from her pale brow and upper lip giving her the appearance of a drowned ghost lily writhed from beneath her sheets for they stuck to her muggy arms and legs and planted two feet firmly on her dormitory floor she felt nauseous and dizzy as she staggered toward the loo and wretched in the porcelain pot it was as if all the energy she possessed had been drained reducing her to a pathetic rag doll wiping her mouth with the sleeve of her nightdress lily blearily observed her room erica and roxanne were sleeping peacefully with the exception of roxanne mumbling incoherently ever so often and various clothing items embellished the room making it look like ravenous gypsies had looted it changing into a loose hooded sweater and a pair of calvin klein jeans lily magically pulled her hair up into a bun and abandoned her dorm room for the great hall it was still quite early for breakfast but sleep had eluded lily lately and left her melancholy she hoped food would spark her spirits and supply her with more energy descending down the great staircase proved difficult for lily often missed steps as her attention snapped from thought to concept just when she presumed the rest of her walk to be safe the flare of lily jeans caught on the edge of a jagged spear a rusty suit of armour grasped sending her sputtering to the ground bugger lily mumbled bitterly feeling a dull stab of pain in her left knee as the suit of metal giggled behind her it awfully early to be stumbling around the castle ms evans lily felt a strong hand grapple her forearm and pull her to her feet dusting off the grime and dusk from her jeans lily was surprised to find herself face to face with the astronomy teacher professor cyprian thank you professor lily managed hoping she could keep the bile threatening to course up her throat at bay i just decided to get an early start at breakfast is that so professor cyprian chided questioningly a flicker of worry passing over his handsome face before becoming passive again by the pasty white color of your skin and the red rimming your eyes you hardly look able to keep down a plate of food lily was taken aback by his perceptiveness and almost reluctantly let a blush brush against her cheeks she was sure her flushed expression only worsened her sickly appearance i had a fitful sleep lily divulged tucking her hands in her pockets to maintain a submissive stance i thought food may improve my wretched state i no healer professor cyprian started combing his hands through his hair and letting a glimmer of upset cross his expression but i recommend a good draught of pepperup potion before ingesting anything solid taking only a moment to shift through the contents of his robe pocket cyprian pulled out a corked vile of green liquid and handed it to lily a commanding look upon his face lily delicately swished the contents of the vile around watching the potion retain its color and density are you sure i ve enough to spare dontworry it a refined version steam wontemit from your ears cyprian replied reassuring a haunted look in his eyes as he turned away and started traversing down the corridor shuffling his feet in a miserable fashion lily realized it was the first time she had seen cyprian since the announcement of his brother death in the daily prophet she supposed he had good reason to be downtrodden perhaps he d just returned from his brother funeral lily felt a pang of guilt for not being kinder to the teacher professor yes ms evans cyprian inquired dully stopping and looking over his shoulder at the green eyed redhead trip on another artifact um no i meant to er offer my condolences lily blurted feeling slightly childish as her voice squeaked and partially echoed a glimmer of amusement danced in cyprian eyes and a small benign smile flickered on his unshaven lips that sweet of you lily i see you in class without another word cyprian disappeared behind a statue of a plump witch settled at the edge of two hallways so as to obstruct lily view of the adjoining corridor she remained rooted to her spot for a few moments mulling over her encounter with the elusive and attractive teacher he called me lily plopping down at an empty spot at the gryffindor table lily noticed only a few more students dabbling in their pumpkin juice while convened in the great hall a ravenclaw boy ate and studied while three hufflepuffs argued over the results of a gobblestones game lily even glimpsed the hooked nose of severus snape who was concocting a turgid potion in his breakfast goblet that spewed out noxious purple smoke lily spooned some scrambled eggs and a piece of toast onto her clean plate and willed herself to dive in the sickly churning in her stomach only worsened as she eyed the steaming food tasting bile surging past her pharynx lily quickly uncorked the potion professor cyprian gave her and slugged it back feeling the soothing liquid trickle down her esophagus surprisingly enough the potion instantly quashed her nausea and heightened her senses but it left her throat and tongue dry five glasses of pumpkin juice and a piece of toast later roxanne trudged into the great hall fatigued bags collected under her eyes and puffed out like the throat of a bull toad not even she could cry gracefully morning merlin i need a coffee lily saw her owl petree float in through one of the arched windows of the great hall clutching in its talons a freshly pressed daily prophet lily glared bitterly at the headline bloody quarrel in the three broomsticks and made no inclination to read the article arentyou going to read it roxanne mumbled over the ceramic edge of her coffee cup her breath creating ripples on the surface of the black liquid i think i d rather burn it why shettup and drink your coffee gradually the hall began filling up with exhilarated students all of whom seemed wide eyed and frantic about the upcoming ball dread filled lily as she realized she would have to assist with the decorations for the celebration when would she find the time to assemble her own outfit with all the tasks that had to be completed vince capree strode into the hall surrounded by a chorus of chattering hufflepuff females and glared coldly at roxanne as he took a seat at his table roxanne met his stare matching his fierce glower and flashing a feisty goading smirk when vince turned away her leer disappeared and was replaced with a frown i not going to the ball tonight roxanne stated as she watched lily set fire to the daily prophet i d rather just be alone dontbe daft lily countered sounding stern i ll not have you crying your eyes out all night over vince capree and sirius black i dontgive a damn about either of them roxanne spat crossing her arms stubbornly and abandoning her breakfast i just dontwant to look like a fool going to the ball unaccompanied if that what bothering you i ll blow james off and go alone too lily persisted hoping roxanne didntagree so she didnthave to ditch james you know you re being ridiculous dontyou it would be much better for you to go to the ball on your own and stick it to both sirius and vince roxanne seemed to ponder what lily said for a moment realizing she was right vince and sirius would think her pathetic for wallowing in self pity up in her dorm room during the dance she would dress up in her costume putting extra effort into looking downright gorgeous and march right into that dance a massive smile on her face she didntneed some boy to make her happy you re absolutely right i going to have a wonderful time tonight whether i look foolish or not roxanne proclaimed a genuine smile fluttering on her lips i knew you were my best friend for a reason roxanne crossed the gryffindor table and gave lily an excited hug making her laugh in a good natured way look at this lesbian action simply revolting sirius black quipped as he and the marauders entered the great hall and took seats at the table where my popcorn i want a front row seat lily looked toward sirius with a mocking glare giggling as james came behind sirius and smacked him upside the head have i ever told you that you re a prat roxanne broke away from hugging lily and turned to sirius her face blank and expressionless sirius was about to ignore her and turn away when roxanne smiled sweetly and tittered good morning sirius as a friendly gesture sirius looked positively bemused as roxanne sauntered pass him and exited the great hall as did james and remus you go girl lily thought to herself smiling brightly what gotten into roxanne james muttered to lily as he took a seat beside her holding her left hand in his right beneath the breakfast table i suppose she just excited for the ball tonight lily offered greeting erica as she approached the table and took a seat beside remus lily could tell sirius was itching to ask her who roxanne was going to the ball with well i see ella over at the ravenclaw table i better join her sirius said with a truckload of fake enthusiasm his fraudulent smile so strained it threatened to collapse into a frown sirius sauntered off toward the ravenclaw table where a beaming ella made room for him to sit down lily observed his polite greeting but couldnthelp believing he would rather be sitting with roxanne sure ella was pretty and exceptionally smart but she wasnt roxanne he was piss drunk when we found him last night remus told james and lily in a small voice if peter and i hadntinsisted he stop drinking and go to bed he would still be at the hog head in a drunken stupor under the table roxanne refused to let me into our dormitory room until ten last night erica continued shaking her head in uncertainty i know she was crying i heard her muffled sobs behind the door why those two dontsmarten up and talk normally is beyond me james muttered side glancing lily and holding her hand tighter now they re both on the rampage trying to find other people to put their minds off eachother that what happens when two stubborn people cross paths i suppose lily added catching remus knowing gaze as he looked between her and james time will mend things between them erica said trying to reassure the group although worry glittering in her blue eyes or break them further apart remus and lily sat beside eachother on the floor of the tiled kitchen of hogwarts toting in their hands tubes full of brightly colored icing beside lily were little candies in the shape of pumpkins and black cats which she and remus had been assigned to decorate lily became quite annoyed when the pumpkins started to cackle and sing badly composed songs carve me once and carve me twice put me in your hair and i ll give you lice would you shut up lily snapped at the crowing pumpkins grinning with their jagged mouths they ignored her you must admit that charm i put on them is quite witty remus chided laughing as lily rolled her eyes and put a pumpkin candy face first into an iced cupcake she heard muffled curses o very witty remus lily quipped sarcastically why dontyou give them musical instruments to accompany that lovely singing i think they would require hands to play instruments remus replied groaning in amusement as lily smudged icing sugar on his face giving him a moustache you look very attractive with that moustache mr lupin lily said sweetly grinning as remus eyes narrowed dangerously and you will match my sex appeal with this icing smeared in your hair remus insisted inching toward lily with an orange tube of sugary embellishment remus lupin dontyou dare my hair has to look good for the ball tonight lily said mocking a severe stance and that singing pumpkin said i would get lice if you put that in my hair why do i care what your hair looks like you arentmy date therefore you wontbe embarrassing me by you accompaniment just james remus chirped squeezing the tube over lily head and when do you take singing pastries seriously lily yelped in fright as someone approached them from behind snatching the tube of icing out of remus hand and belting her in the back of the head with it what are you two doing angela baker the head girl hissed coming up behind lily and remus before icing oozed onto lily head i give you the menial task of decorating cupcakes and you re playing around like a bunch of four year olds chill baker remus replied smoothly his brow furrowed in dislike we re almost done and the ball isntfor another four hours i dontcare if the ball was in five minutes you are wasting precious time time that could be spent preparing other essential tasks now get to work angela baker stalked off leaving remus and lily frowning and many lively house elves hiding behind appliances the head girl was a bit neurotic i would hardly classify putting up streamers essential remus muttered glaring after the head girl as he plucked another chattering candy out of the pail and smutted it atop a cupcake i think i saw a vein pulsating on her forehead lily agreed sniggering at the thought of the head girl bursting a carotid artery in her head perhaps we should slip some calming potion into her pumpkin juice hmmmm remus thought to himself smiling at the mischievous plan concocting in his mind all thanks to lily rather dull solution to quashing angela temper it was quite boring decorating cupcakes for the ball why not shake things up a bit perhaps add some new ingredients remus thought integrating some interesting pranks into the ball would make it even better perhaps we ll add some more appealing ingredients than a simple calming potion remus said grinning like a child with a chocolate chip cookie uh oh lily whispered watching remus skeptically what sort of ingredients scurvy grass lovage sneezewort ashwinder eggs if we can get our hands on some a befuddlement draught lily inquired unbelievingly what damage will that due paired with the ashwinder eggs wontthat ingredient neutralize the acidity in the sneezewort quite the opposite remus replied the ashwinder egg molecules will combine with that of the lovage creating not only a befuddlement draught but a love befuddlement draught o remus lily barked her mouth open wide creating a perfect oval that could be drastic people switching partners after ingesting the potion couples divided in the middle of the ball wouldntthat be a sight to behold remus asked his smile widening at the prospect of course the effects wear off after a good night sleep but wouldntit be something if we slipped a bit to roxanne and sirius lily looked at remus as if he were the most brilliant boy to ever grace the earth that perfect two hours later lily and remus had parted ways angela was pleased to see the cupcakes looking pristine and finished releasing both remus and lily from their duties so they could prepare themselves for the upcoming event lily hurriedly made her way to her dorm room hoping to catch a shower while remus headed to the great hall to grab some sandwiches just as lily was about to ascend the stairs leading up to the girl dormitory a hand grabbed her around the waist and pulled her behind some red curtains which pooled at the edges of the window in the common room before she could let a surprised gasp emit lily felt someone lips traveling up and down her neck hot breath making the tiny hairs on her neck stand up james lily incoherently whispered barely able to contain the groan that threatened to explode from her lips james hands traveled up and down her back pulling her close so that their bodies were pressed against eachother shhhhh james cooed leaving lily neck and taking hold of lily bottom lip with his own mouth lily couldnthelp but let herself submit to james it felt so good to be in his arms safe and content lily began maneuvering her hands up and down james back occasionally letting her fingers get entwined in his hair and brush his neck she and james had kissed before but never like this carefully james let his hands roam further down lily back parking themselves in the back pockets of her jeans he broke away momentarily to see if lily protested this but she closed her eyes and pulled him close again taking james by pleasurable surprise jammmmmmmmmesssssssssssss peter called out loudly thundering down the boy staircase and entering the common room jammesss lily pulled away from the messy haired boy and listening to peter hollering in intrigue james seemed annoyed with the interruption and pulled lily back into a fierce kiss choosing to ignore the chubby boy lily moaned in wonder jammmmmmmesssss where are you i need help the rat like boy protested looking under desks and chairs to see if james happened to be hiding he needs you lily whispered breaking away from james again and seeing the frustration and lust intermingling on his face maybe we should screw peter and kiss me now you would have me screw peter and not you lily lashed back a feisty look in her eye as james like a sigh of amusement and aggravation escape i thought you wanted me for yourself you are so difficult james announced smiling wryly and his hands snaked up lily back and partially up her shirt o really i like that peter wailed helplessly his tone getting louder and whinier as he paced about the common room james seethed i hate my friends james peeked from behind the curtain and saw peter back turned lily slipped out from beneath the fabric and skipped up the stairs to the girl dormitory james looking after her longingly what is it peter james demanded gritting his teeth together and struggling to keep himself from grabbing peter around the neck and strangling him i need help getting into my costume good lord lily opened the door to her dormitory and immediately started coughing like she had contracted a rare disease the room was submerged in a pink cloud of hairspray which seemed to loom just below the top of the bedposts has anyone been asphyxiated by this poisonous hairspray yet lily choked wafting the crude smelling product out of her way lily where have you been the dance is in one hour erica exclaimed her hair pinned up in massive curlers and her foundation already applied you donthave much time out of the corner of her eye lily saw roxanne plastered to a mirror applying her first coat of mascara she wasntquite sure what her hair looked like for it was hidden under a bandana i better jump into the shower then lily replied entering the bathroom and turning on the facet so hot water could pour out over her chilled body and sooth her aching muscles professor cyprian was right that pepper up potion had done her wonders only this morning she had been throwing up uncontrollably and now she was fit as a fiddle as hot water filtered over her head and soaked her hair a vision flashed before her eyes a sleek and unadorned room with high vaulted ceilings and symbolic text scrawled along the floors figuring she had gotten conditioner in her eyes lily ignored the sinking feeling in the pit of her stomach and continued rinsing her hair hoping she would be able to manage and style it nicely for the ball stepping out of the shower lily briskly combed and dried her hair by magical means put on a bathrobe and exited the tiny porcelain room full of faucets and mirrors lily observed roxanne intensely focused on straightening her hair while erica was pulling the curlers out of hers erica pass me that sleekeazy hair potion will you roxanne called across the room as lily entered it right beside the beautifying potion beautifying potion lily echoed skeptically cocking an eyebrow you mean that dreadful paste sacharissa tugwood concocted in about a half an hour you re exaggerating roxanne scoffed running the hair solution erica handed her through her long locks she brilliant i admire her talent she advertised in witch weekly erica continued eagerly her epitaph is something like thanks to sacharissa tugwood the world is a more beautiful place rubbish shettup and get ready you have barely under an hour roxanne cried ruefully shaking her head and lily wet hair and unpolished nails james will not appreciate being held up ignoring roxanne lily opened her wardrobe door and began shuffling through the muddled contents hoping to glimpse her costume smiling she extracted the glittering blue and green fabric and placed it on her bed what is your costume lily erica inquired eagerly eyeing the glossy attire i being a fairy see i have the wings and tutu very cute you ll see my costume when i get to the ball erica disappeared behind the bathroom door and returned wearing a light blue fairy costume with mobile wings attached to her back with her bouncy curls tiny tiara and high heeled white stilettos erica looked like a combination of cute and hot her tutu skirt was fairly short showing a good amount of leg and there was a chaste dip in her tight long sleeved top remus is going to flip roxanne squealed making erica smile widen in excitement that costume is adorable and flirty thanks i loved it the moment i plucked it from the hanger i bet remus is waiting for you erica maybe you should go down and meet him by myself erica looked stricken what about you two arentyou coming i am way behind schedule lily moaned looking at the magical clock on her dresser could you tell james that i ll meet him in the great hall i ll need some more time ok erica agreed but if you guys donthurry up i coming back and dragging you both to the ball costume or not erica quickly applied some bubble gum pink lip gloss and straightened the crooked straps that held her flapping wings on her back winking she trudged down the dormitory stairs to an awaiting remus lupin hey roxanne lily called over from her vanity where she was applying soft waves to her hair remus is going to ask out erica tonight after the ball what roxanne sputtered dropping her finishing powder that wonderful erica hasnthad a boyfriend since that dumb bloke what was his name kyle what a prick he was yah that reminds me when is that prat james potter going to ask you out roxanne asked nonchalantly a smile betraying her stony face as lily turned to her in astonishment i dontknow what you re talking about i not blind lily what i see the way you two look at eachother roxanne exclaimed giggling as lily looked utterly stunned the secret hand holding under the table the way his eyes alight with worry every time you re missing it so obvious it seemed lily and james had not been as discreet as they had thought remus and sirius knew of their romance roxanne and now not doubt erica the only person still in the dark was peter pettigrew and that didntaccount for much i dontknow lily stammered her face growing hot i dontreally know what going on between us that why we didntsay anything he hasntasked you out no well what the fuck is wrong with him roxanne demanded angrily crossing her arms what he playing at you re not some puppet he can dangle on strings i know that and so does he the timing just isntright we re just waiting a bit longer to make the relationship public ok lily defended glaring back at roxanne so dontbother getting yourself involved i can handle this thanks i just think he should take more initiative belt up and put on your goddamn costume calm down woman james potter leaned up against the clothed food table surveying the hogwarts students that were dressed up in outrageous costumes flitting from on person to the next everyone looked cheerful and enthusiastic complimenting outfits and laughing at students dressed oddly did you see that bloke dressed up like a broom asking all the girls if they wanted a free ride a boy wearing a jet black suit cape and white mask asked coming up to stand beside james why didnt i think of that because you arentwitty sirius james replied grinning sirius black was dressed to the nines tonight his hair was slicked back leaving a few strands to fall over his white mask while his crisp dress shirt was buttoned down slightly apparently during muggle studies he had read about a famous play where a man lurked in the basement of an opera wearing a mask to hide his face intrigued sirius decided to dress up as the phantom of the opera he looked sexy where lily sirius inquired scanning the hoards of students and ducking as his date ella passed by the food table in search of him she not ready yet james replied giving sirius a questioning look as he began to crawl under the food table sirius hey james ella chirped sweetly adorning a pretty but unoriginal princess costume could you tell me where sirius is please uhhh james started feeling sirius discreetly hit the back of his leg i he s he sick in bed ella what she cried harshly her lips starting to tremble and her expression miserable he really unhappy james emphasized feeling sorry for the girl as her eyes began to well over with small tears but how about you and i dance to the first song lily hasntarrived yet and i d like to warm up a bit haventdanced in a long time you see ella seemed to perk up flashing james a grateful smile as she agreed and was led to the middle of the dance floor many curious students watched them dance beside other couples wondering why james wasntwith lily james was hoping he and ella would garner attention for if ella was seen with a marauder she was sure to be asked to dance by many other guys and forget about sirius after all if ella was good enough for a marauder she was good enough for anyone the slow song ended a few minutes later the conclusion being a long cord from the resident piano james had to awkwardly pull away from ella as she still had her head buried in his shoulder cheers ella have a good time tonight ok james stated genuinely offering a small smile before heading toward the table remus and erica occupied he hoped lily would ve joined them by now thank you james ella whispered softly watching him leaving and smelling his cologne which still lingered in the air thank you james ended up seating himself at a vacant table not wanting to disturb erica and remus who looked to be emerged in a deep private conversation he scowled as sirius finally popped out from beneath the food table giving professor flitwick quite the scare and made his way towards him sorry about that mate sirius apologized seating himself beside james who was still glaring at him i just i would rather not be around anyone right now mooning over roxanne are we james remarked his glower transforming into a smirk no sirius stubbornly fired back liar i just o to hell with it yes yes i fucking mooning over that idiotic woman ok sirius leaned back in his chair looking troubled obviously expecting james to burst out into laughter and make childish petty jokes james did not laugh but took on a stern yet comforting expression women are complicating arentthey james commented watching sirius grimace as if that were an understatement they re incomprehensible sirius retorted folding his arms did you see the way roxanne waltzed by me this morning a huge smile on her face she mocking me i just know it maybe roxanne is as pissed about the situation as you are witches often hide behind false pretences so they can make us all the more uncomfortable james explained wondering if what he was saying even made sense i think you should just be yourself and approach her show her sirius black is not just a circus clown but what if i am just a circus clown stop wallowing in decadence and go and trick roxanne into dancing with you already james ordered in an exasperated tone how you re wearing a goddamn mask arentyou james demanded sighing as realization dawned on sirius face sirius smirked mischievously o yah lily and roxanne inconspicuously slid into the brilliantly decorated great hall they were both astonished at the amount of brightly colored costumes and floating pumpkins the long house tables had been replaced with moderately sized round tables that could sit about ten people around their rims while the teacher table had become the food table which was embellished with towering stacks of sweets and pastries angela baker may be a high strung bitch lily thought but she provides lovely results on each table were ten place settings surrounded by burning wax candles and large goblets of pumpkin juice in one corner of the great hall was a slightly elevated stage where assorted instruments played at their own accord strumming vivacious beats or mellow tunes wow roxanne whispered turning her face toward lily and grinning wildly the prefects did a wonderful job lily spotted james across the room sitting comfortably with a masked student and indulged in a heated discussion erica and remus were seated at a separate table remus wearing a typical azkaban uniform with his hair styled in a scruffy roguish way and erica in her pretty fairy costume look at peter costume roxanne choked out her eyes wide and brimming over in amused tears as she spotted him amongst the crowd isntit masculine peter was filling his yellow platter with treats at the food table seemingly elated at the prospect of eating two noir antennae stuck out of his head a little ball on each end peter red and black costume was rotund in shape having two little wings at the back peter was dressed up as a ladybug merlin only peter would fathom wearing a costume like that lily muttered squinting at the boy as if he were a mirage i surprised he didntdress up like a trout i thought he liked fishing lily turned her attention back to where james was previously sitting and frowned he wasntthere anymore feeling uneasy and disconcerted as if someone was watching her lily turned around and saw derek mitchell leering from amongst the crowd his costume was all black with a silver buckle tucked around his waist and two white fangs protruding from his grinning mouth derek mitchell was dressed as a vampire lily roxanne inquired urgently trying to suppress the curiosity in her voice do you have any idea what sirius costume is why do you fancy finding him lily demanded teasingly ripping her gaze away from derek mitchell and firmly ignoring him no she replied firmly her mulish attitude flaring i was merely asking not a clue lily was very suspicious that roxanne was hiding her feelings for sirius black i think i ll look for james catch up with you later lily pushed her way through the crowds of dancing students her eyes darting around for the elusive messy haired boy many students predominantly boys watched lily as she passed for her costume was quite eye catching before lily could heave a sigh of defeat she felt someone tap her on the shoulder has anyone ever told you a husky voice whispered into lily ear strong arms slinking around her waist that you are by far the most gorgeous female in the entire school lily face literally lit up a smile gracing her lips perhaps but never from such a handsome sailor lily looked over her shoulder in an alluring fashion a blush crept onto her cheeks because of the way james potter was looking at her in his chocolate eyes swam such adoration such desire lily barely kept her knees from shaking uncontrollably i d thought you d never get here james finally mustered completely thunderstruck because of how stunning lily looked another minute and i would ve drowned myself in the punch bowl james potter was indeed clad as a sailor the entire outfit was white with thin blue lines running along the cuffs and collar and atop his head was the traditional sailor hat tuffs of hair stuck out from beneath his hat making him look a tad wind blown and his sleeves were rolled up past his elbows displaying his muscular arms to compliment james costume lily was dressed as a dazzling mermaid she didntwear the typical sea shell bra like james would ve liked along with the rest of the male population but instead wore a turquoise sequenced tube top that ended just above her belly button in the same glittering material lily wore a long skirt which had a slit in the front revealing a good portion of her left leg and had a train that pooled on the floor in the shape of a tail around her neck was a chain composed of shells and tucked in her hair which was wavy and made magically longer was a water lily lily and james were undoubtedly the best dressed couple now wouldnt that be ironic lily cooed smiling humorously a sailor drowning what can i say i d do just about anything for a half dressed mermaid james replied grinning merrily as he entwining his hand with lily and began leading her toward the dance floor i not half dressed lily insisted heatedly her lips thinning into a puckered brow you better not be the only guy in this hall allowed to see you unclothed is me o so now i some piece of meat only you can take a bite of biting sounds kinky james smirked cocking an eyebrow in intrigue as he watched lily go bright red why i never i lily yes shut up and dance with me derek mitchell sat slumped in a chair against the wall clearly quarantined away from the happily dancing pairs dressed in arrays of costumes he felt his blood boil as his eyes glared at lily and james looking like a fucking married couple derek loathed james potter and he had from the day they d played their first quidditch game it had been second year when derek made the quidditch team an accomplishment he had wished for since his first day at hogwarts it was the way the students looked up to quidditch players the way they adored them derek had never been adored before he remembered how nervous and antsy he had been on the day of his first match ravenclaw versus gryffindor derek had practiced on the quidditch pitch for nearly two weeks straight in preparation of the game the thought of crowds cheering his name and being admired thrilled him but that day had not gone according to plan the game was tied 160 to 160 and had gone well past dinner and into the night it was exhilarating for derek to being playing for so long but he was beginning to tire madam hooch had announced that the game couldntgo on for much longer for there was school the next morning and declared the next goal on net would win the game if it occurred before the snitch was caught derek realized this was his chance a chance to arise from the game as a hero the one who scored the winning goal nobody would forget him after such a long game he d be talked about for years becoming popular and famous amongst the students the gryffindor keeper was injured and out of the game derek was zooming toward the empty net quaffle tucked firmly beneath his arm he didntshoot right away he thought he d make a spectacle of the goal and fly right through a hoop wouldntthat be a stylish famous move nobody would stop him from becoming a somebody not after this goal james potter came out of nowhere catching him completely off guard and snatching away the quaffle derek cried out in astonishment watching james fly swiftly by him and rammed into one of the scoring hoops in a heap on the ground his head spinning wildly derek heard a splendid cry emit from the crowds and ring in his ears go james go go james go go james go james potter an already infamous marauder and the ideal crush of every girl in hogwarts scored the winning goal and derek would never forget what he could have had a life like james potters derek are you alright ella evangelist inquired in worried politeness taking a seat behind the boy who seemed to be lost in thought fine derek mumbled paying absolutely no mind to ella as he continued to watch lily dance the night away with him would you like me to sit with you for a bit ella offered kindly wondering why her friend seemed so miserable i dontcare do what you want ella looked annoyed for a moment but decided it would be rude to shuffle away leaving derek in such a distressed state derek face looked cold and distant but his gaze was firm and definite ella followed his stare and was surprised and dismayed to see lily and james dancing blissfully discreetly whispering in eachother ears ella felt an odd lurch in her stomach as she observed james face get close to lily s his proximity making lily blush and giggle they make a nice couple dontthey ella said conversationally regretting her comment as she watched derek face contort in rage they look repulsing together derek snapped turning for the first time to look at ella how lily can stand potter touching her is what baffles me derek tone was bitter and cutting ella was almost scared to respond well i rather fancy james potter myself ella replied defending him and refusing to look derek in the eye in case he realized how much she fancied him he a gentlemen i thought you fancied black derek spat clenching his fists into balls and grinding his teeth to keep from yelling which isntmuch better sirius stood me up tonight ella replied resolutely deciding the ill in bed story was complete bullocks james asked me to dance because he didntwant me to be sad which means well perhaps he cares for me derek knew ella was being delusional thinking james potter cared for any girl apart from lily and her little cluster of female friends he was close to declaring ella a nutter for even fathoming james cared for her but an idea sprang up in his mind ella was a pleasant person and smart as hell but she was way to trusting and naive derek knew he could manipulate ella and use her to his advantage i saw the two of you dance derek began lying through his polished teeth i didntwant to get your hopes up but james looked very happy while he was dancing with you really ella exclaimed her eyes brightening and her posture becoming ridged see the way he looking at lily yes that the way he was looking at you ella was stunned could james potter actually have a crush on me now i may be wrong ella derek pressed a malicious smirk beginning to sculpt along his mouth but i heard a rumor james potter was going to break up with lily tonight but they arenteven going out that what they want you to think derek insisted his act convincing ella and causing her to think his intentions genuine so ella eyes gleamed with a rare innocence you think i think he found his newest love interest me ella choked out you roxanne fluttered from person to person in the great hall pushing the fact that she was dateless to the back of her mind a few guys had approached her and asked her to dance but she declined not keen on them roxanne was determined to have a good time and began to wonder if perhaps it would be better to accept dance proposals instead of mopping around in self pity it was difficult to overcome the annoying look of desire that accompanied ever male that asked her the vivacious brunette wore a beautifully crafted dress made of white silk that flowed to the ground and dipped at the neckline displaying flawless cleavage and a jutting collarbone around her waist roxanne wore a gold belt that gave the dress some structure and atop her head was a crown in the shape of an egyptian asp its head rearing above her eyebrows black eyeliner extended beyond her eyelids and golden clasps adorned her arms roxanne made a beautiful cleopatra the last pharaoh to rule over egypt she dipped a crystal goblet into the crimson punch bowl on the food table and took a long draught before realizing a veiled man across the table was watching her although only his dark orbs and mouth were visible beneath his mask roxanne could tell he was good looking she froze as he opened his mouth to speak i think dressing as an egyptian queen is very befitting the man said throatily as if striving to make his voice sound seductive and disguised as he engaged roxanne a glass of punch in his hands why do you think that roxanne inquired meekly her eyes wavering as she wondered who lurked behind the mask and how he was knowledgeable about muggle history i sure there are many men who would be willing to fight battles to win you my queen the man said beguilingly his thoughtful and desiring stare boring into roxanne making her fidget uncomfortably perhaps marc anthony or julius caesar roxanne smoothly added slightly quaking and unsure of how to respond to the roguish stranger you re quite the charmer dear opera ghost but i doubt your words are true let me show you how charming i can be the stranger answered moving toward roxanne with regal grace and then judge the honesty in my words roxanne was so mesmerized by the shrouded man magnetism and brazenness she did not protest as he took her hand and led her toward the outdoor exit leading out of the great hall she felt her heart flutter as he opened the double doors leading to the gardens which were cloaked in darkness petite pink fairy lights bobbed amongst the rose shrubs and trees giving the foliage an unearthly glow roxanne felt as if she were being led into a dream dance with me the stranger said softly gently lacing his hands around roxanne lower back and letting her place hers around his neck she was torn internally her mind and heart were battling and she didntknow which one to listen to should she relent to this stranger and let her emotions take control or should she back away and keep her heart shielded from the possibility of hurt who are you roxanne whispered as they began to delicately sway to the music drifting into the gardens from the hall she felt her heart beat irregularly in her chest have we met before shhhh the man hushed melodiously looking deeply into her stormy gray eyes with a frightening affection dontlet your mind wander live in this moment and this moment alone it was as if he knew what she was thinking what she was feeling how could he possibly if they had just met he wouldntbe paranoid about being hurt or letting his true feelings shine she would have to know him and he would have to know her to be afraid of what may transpire what judgements could be made was he afraid of being hurt as much as she was roxanne panicked as she realized she was dancing with sirius black v important author notes v i hope

chapter 4 pillsbury doughboy fascinations lily trudged down to breakfast the next morning in a surreal state she had wracked her brain all night trying to think of sufficient excuses for her behaviour and couldnthelp but worry about possibly seeing james potter at the ministry lily plunked herself down on one the kitchen rickety old chairs and helped herself to eggs and bacon the spell of breakfast wafted in the kitchen pleasantly lily mother looked quite stressed and kept sending lily worried glances petunia however was now the one wearing the smug look seeming quite pleased with herself lily tried to ignore her after all it was her fault she transfigured those boots if petunia had just left lily alone for once she wouldnthave hit boiling point and done something so stupid if you dontwipe that ridiculous look off your face petunia i will do it for you keep in mind that caiman hasntbeen feed for a few days now lily whispered darkly petunia scowled and looked away lily father badgered her with questions she couldntanswer throughout breakfast eventually causing lily to lose her appetite she returned to her room to prepare for the hearing and after getting dressed looked in her door length mirror to inspect her looks lily was quite a tall girl maybe around 5 7 she enjoyed being tall because it made her look slim and her legs look long she had brilliant red coloured hair that flowed past her shoulders and down her back lily liked having red hair because it made her stand out in a crowd made her unique after all she lived on a street where no one wanted to stand out and every dressed like stepford wife robots she felt the need to be different out of all her attributes she loved her eyes they were a very peculiar emerald green colour and she had yet to find someone with the same eye colour as herself other than her mother lily was a very pretty girl though certainly not the prettiest in hogwarts and had a few guys pining for her attention at school she happened to despise one of those guys but she didntcare to think about that lily was wearing a stylish black suit with a bottle green shirt underneath to accent her eyes she was quite pleased with this suit and was actually glad to have an event to wear it to lily was obsessed with clothing and designers but always chose a more laid back look at hogwarts knowing most witches at hogwarts didntknow about muggle designers anyway lily was adding an jewelled hairpiece to her hair which had been brought fixed into a fancy bun when the doorbell rang lily was startled she had assumed dumbledore would be traveling by floo powder she had even asked her father to tidy up the fireplace for when the headmaster arrived as lily made her way to down the staircase her stomach became knotted instead of a man with a long silver beard and half moon spectacles standing in her doorframe a tall handsome boy with messy black hair and round wire glasses was there to be frank james potter looked quite uncomfortable he was leaning on the doorframe elegantly listening to petunia evans blabber on about something he seemed to deem unusual lily guessed an episode of martha stuart however as soon as lily came to stand beside petunia arms crossed and a determined look upon her face james literally lit up bug off petunia go read a home decor magazine or something lily said quite irritated that petunia was so keen to talk to james then again annoying people probably attract one another petunia fluttered her eyelashes and waved goodbye to james it was a pleasure meeting you james er bye james replied awkwardly secretly glad to be rid of the strange muggle he turned to lily and smirked your sister is quite charming lily although you are still my favourite evans shut up lily practically growled her eyes tightening dangerously and tell me what you re doing here oh didntyou remember our date lillykins i mean you have been begging me all these years to go out with you well i ve decided i ll give you a chance james announced comically pulling lily into a fierce hug geroff me lily ordered her voice muffled because her head was buried in his chest lily shoved james off of her and glared up into his amused face let get a few things straight potter i would never make a date with you i would never beg you to go out with me and i would never go out with you in the first place never say never love said james quite happy he had gotten the reaction he wanted you know lily you really need to relax i ll put a cheering charm on you shall i you and i both know charms is not your best subject and if you ever try and attempt that charm i shall transfigure you into an octopus lily warned him sternly ok more arms to hold you with lils i wontmind that at all james said adding a suggestive wink lily sputtered angrily seemingly struggling with what insult to hurl his way first enough of your antics potter why are you here at my house and how did you know about my hearing and where the bloody hell is dumbledore lily demanded completely confused and already tired of fighting with james well dumbledore said he had to run some errands before we go to the hearing he thought it would be a good idea to drop me off at your house for an hour isntthat exciting james smiled obviously enjoying lily exasperation and i know about your hearing because dumbledore told me you see lily i have a hearing to attend myself you arentthe only one performing illegal magic outside of school did i mention how proud save it potter what spell did you perform lily asked trying to hide her intrigue it was an accident really i ended up turning my parents and younger sister into walruses i was screaming on top of my kitchen counter for merlin knows how long you see they were quite mad so they decided to try and gouge my eyes out with their tusks nasty buggers walruses i was quite glad when the house elves came to sort out the matter james said cracking up just thinking about the whole ordeal lily looked quite unconvinced that it was an accident on james part but decided not to pursue the matter i could have gone to the ministry with my parents but dumbledore said he was taking you anyway so i decided to hitch a ride with you guys james explained excitably well isntit my lucky day trying to make my summer that much better are you said lily holding sarcasm in her voice knew you would be pleased lillykins said james still smiling with his ever charming lop sided grin lily quickly ushered james inside the house without another word and shut the door behind him james looked around the house with interest for he had never been in a muggle household before they both entered the drawing room and sat on opposite couches facing each other james still scanned the room wildly bursting to ask lily questions lily watched him inwardly amused at his curiosity but outwardly she held a neutral look oh would you just ask me already lily insisted irritably what exactly is that shiny box james asked curiously pointing to the television that would be a television you can watch pictures moving and talking on it let me show you lily turned on the television with the remote james recoiled slightly when she turned it on and lily chuckled at his reaction wow how cool is that who are those people do you know them james asked practically bouncing on the balls of his feet lily answered all his questions about the television and after awhile began reading a magazine seeing as james had become fascinated with the commercials he would shout out often saying things like look at that lily and did you see that fat thing wearing the bakers hat i so want to poke him lily then started explaining the pillsbury doughboy to james and other random characters like toucan sam and tony the tiger they got into a little argument over whether the doughboy was actually an elf in disguise which was james theory but lily stopped the conversation with a piercing glare lily parents finally surfaced and were quite curious as to why a boy lily age was in their living room staring at the tv with excitable curiosity um lily would you care to explain him mr evans said evidently quite confused james quickly jumped up from his position and shook his hand his facial expression growing serious pleasure to meet you sir i your daughter boy ouch lily james whined glowering lily had stomped on his foot so he could not finish his sentence this is james potter dad he is going to a hearing as well and dumbledore needed to get rid of him for an hour so he dropped him off here lily explained a hint of annoyance resounding in her tone ok said mr evans with an uneasy chuckle nice to meet you james is there a reason you have a fascination with our television set i ve never seen one before i a wizard you know my whole family is and we donthave any muggle gadgets but this this television i am definitely getting my parents to get me one james said enthusiastically gasping every time the channel changed as he played with the remote lily why dontyou take your friend james up to your bedroom james gave a suggestive wink lily looked appalled at the suggestion because petunia is having her boyfriend vernon and his parents over for tea and your mum needs to prepare the drawing room said mr evans oblivious to lily horror lily and james started ascending the stairs well now that we have your father permission we can ouch lily james whinged as he and lily made their way up the stairs lily had tripped him on the way donteven think of finishing that sentence potter said lily again glaring at james which room is yours he asked crossly stopping to massage his foot the door to the right lily said sweetly an evil grin spreading over her face james opened the door and with a boyish wail slammed it closed again oops sorry did i say door on the right i meant left lily said now dissolving in giggles not funny cantbelieve she still hasntgotten rid of that reptile james muttered under his breath as he entered lily bedroom v author notes v please continue to read and review chapter 40 canttake it in reader discretion swearing and sexual situations in this chapter lily and james stopped dancing after the fifth song commenced eager for some refreshments and food the great hall was buzzing with action chatter and dancing creating an enigmatic environment that inspired enthusiasm i think they ll be announcing the winners of the costume contest soon james whispered in lily ear his hand tickling the bare skin above her waist i ll grab us some drinks and meet you at remus table lily flashed james a sweet teasing smile before departing towards erica and remus the evening was proving to be very exhilarating and lily was becoming comfortable with the fact that soon she and james would make their relationship public lily had an inkling however that many hogwarts students already knew having a good time erica chirped happily as lily situated herself across the table from her who knew james was such a good dancer i know he making me look like an idiot and i took ballet lily mumbled smiling wryly quidditch players are usually good dancers remus commented entangling his hand with erica under the table maybe swaying on their broom benefits their dance sway then maybe you should play more quidditch because you certainly cantdance erica exclaimed amusement etched across her freckled face burn i hate girls really sorry erica looks like remus is gay as well no that cantbe gay guys are almost always good dancers hey wow a gay guy that cantdance that just wrong let me rephrase i hate redheaded girls haventyou heard redheads are the best in bed what are you guys talking about james inquired quizzically seating himself beside lily with two filled punch glasses i seem to be missing a good conversation thank god potter is here remus exclaimed in animated relief watching the two girls giggle mischievously i cantdeal with the two of them alone who can james retorted jokingly well james we were just discussing the prospect of a threesome lily teased winking at remus as erica wrapped an arm around his shoulders and smirked with me james grinned euphorically no with remus that not fair why does remus get to have all the fun james pouted tipping the brim of his sailor hat sorry james but i a sucker for bad boys lily mockingly replied seductively fingering the cuff of remus azkaban costume damn i knew i shouldnthave been a stupid sailor james mumbled grinning as lily laughed and put her manicured hand on his knee anybody spotted sirius or roxanne yet erica inquired glancing around the hall curiously i worried nope james replied simply furrowing his brow they re probably together yes that what worries me should we split up and look for them remus offered blithely fairly unconcerned as he humored erica disquiet guys i think this is unneccesar james started irritated remus you check the grounds erica and james you check around the great hall i ll quickly check the dormitories ok lily cut in rising from her seat ok we ll meet back here in five minutes erica affirmed remus and james looked blas about the affair but obediently got up from their table blite coborous james commanded whipping out his wand and directing the spell at the four chairs gathered around the table what was that lily stuttered in puzzlement little spell i created in third year if anyone sits in our chairs they will get a nasty surprise james winked a marauding grin on his face biting chairs genius isntit james smartly replied quickly pecking lily on the cheek before disappearing into the costumed crowd once a marauder always a marauder lily beamed chuckling under her breath as she headed out of the great hall james stopped and looked over his shoulder at lily a pang of dread kicked him in the stomach derek mitchell ducked into one of the alcoves meant for suits of armor outside of the great hall as he saw lily evans coming down the corridor she looked amazing dressed as an alluring and seductive mermaid costume red hair snaking down her back it was his only chance to make her love him the way he loved her the adjoining hallway leading to where the portrait of the fat lady was located was virtually silent every student and even ghost being in the great hall for the halloween ball with the candles dimmed lily thought the castle looked quite eerie password sphinx lily replied confidentially ducking into the gryffindor common room before the portrait could snap shut lily scanned the common room for any sign of roxanne or sirius before bounding up the stairs into the girls dormitories password sphinx derek repeated noticing the fat lady eye him suspiciously as she swung open to allow him entrance derek was glad the fat lady was too drowsy to notice he wasnta gryffindor the common room was empty and shadowed in the fireplace embers squinted beneath shoddy logs provided derek with little light and the room was very warm derek maneuvered toward the girl staircase making sure to immobilize the sliding stairs before climbing them at the top of the landing was a hallway housing multiple doors imprinted with occupants initials one of which being ajar derek crept down the corridor one of his hands fumbling with a tiny bottle in his pocket and peeked into the open room where lily was roxanne are you in here lily softly inquired lighting a candle on her night stand everybody is looking for you she not here but i am startled lily dropped her wand to the floor and turned around her eyes wide as she realized she wasntalone standing in the doorway was the silhouette of a tall built man with dark brown hair and piercing eyes derek mitchell d derek lily sputtered the skin on her forehead crinkling what how did you get up here i followed you but that not important there something we need to talk about derek replied his presence demanding and intimidating colloportus the door locked what are you doing lily meekly demanded backing away from derek in search of her wand making you listen to me something you can never seem to do with potter and his gang of fuckers shadowing your every move derek spat his facial features distorted in anger lily pulse started to race as derek neared her a frustrated infuriated expression on his face i want you to leave lily commanded mustering the courage to remain calm derek ignored her rage and desire clouding his conscience what does james potter have that i don t lily why is it i not good enough for you what i i i i ve got everything he does good looks intelligence money a promising quidditch career yet you still choose him over me derek growled ignoring the terror flitting through lily eyes as he drew closer the room was terribly dark with derek face barely visible and lily couldntfind her wand she d never seen derek in such a frenzy his eyes were wild and angry his body language overpowering lily started to panic please derek i i think you re a very nice person and just because we arenttogether doesntmean you arentgood enough for me i just you just love james fucking potter is that it dontyou understand lily he a womanizing arrogant bastard that regards you as a possession i bloody love you in a way that potter will never love you derek gruffly yelled backing lily into a corner and roughly grabbing her by the shoulders let me go lily screamed in fright blinking back tears as she struggled to wriggle out of derek firm grasp you love me lily derek roared angrily pressing lily against a wall and fiercely kissing her bare shoulder stop it somebody help me lily shrieked tearfully rolling her hands into fists and beating on derek back let me go listen to me mudblood you ll do as i say derek viciously hissed violently throwing lily onto the floor and pinning himself on top of her no one can hear you i going to prove to you i better than potter lily started to uncontrollably scream and kick as derek ran his hands up and down her torso and chest derek used his wand to conjure rope and tied lily hands then feet together to prevent further struggle help james help me lily feebly moaned her face streaked with tears as strength began to drain from her body he doesntlove you lily derek whispered kissing the skin around her jaw line i love you and soon you ll love me too i ll never love you derek lily whimpered her eyes growing weary i love james and i hate you derek recoiled fire reflecting in his eyes as he looked down at lily taking a tiny bottle out of his pocket derek quickly uncorked the vile of pink liquid and held it daringly close to lily mouth ready to force her to consume it lily smelled crushed pine the shampoo james used and coffee beans drink it derek said soothingly roughly tilting lily head as he began to pour the liquid lily thrashed her head around her mouth clamped shut but eventually derek managed to get her to ingest some of the potion he d concocted the potion slipped down lily throat coating the membrane with a thick cherry fluid at first lily felt nothing but then her throat grew hot and started to retract making her choke what the fuck derek worriedly cursed watching lily face turn blue as she struggled to breathe shit lily come on darling breathe the door behind derek clicked open immobulus professor cyprian shouted causing derek to go rigid and lay motionless on the floor beside a choking lily lily eyes began to roll into the back of her head as her windpipe collapsed cyprian quickly got down on his knees beside lily pointing his wand at her throat anapneo cyprian urged situating lily in a sitting position as her air passage began to relax and inhale oxygen its fine lily you ll be ok you re strong cyprian gathered the unconscious redhead in his arms her head lulling over his muscular arm as he exited the gryffindor common room and headed for the hospital wing dumbledore would be dealing with derek mitchell later you wontbelieve what i just saw remus sputtered deliriously walking toward james and erica who were waiting patiently at their table i dontknow but if you see dear ella approaching be sure to warn me james mumbled slumping in his chair ella evangelist what she done erica asked she been following me around for the past ten minutes asking me to dance or chat or go to hogsmeade with her james frowned rolling his eyes what did you tell her erica further inquired i told her i was madly in love with lily wanted to marry her and planned to have ten children by her james replied in amusement smirking if that isnta hint to piss off i dontknow what is i hope you werentmean about it would you two shut up remus bellowed looking exasperated what james and erica asked simultaneously both looking offended i saw sirius and roxanne making out in the garden what yes they must ve resolved their issues with one another remus smiled madly it a bloody miracle james announced in awe his expression looking distant and reflective this cantbe real pinch me erica ordered not being able to fathom roxanne and sirius getting along never mind kissing oi not my ass remus sorry did you get a picture james persisted gleefully did you see me walking around with a bloody camera remus retorted sarcastically o great now what am i going to put on the front of my christmas cards james argued stubbornly you know that somewhat perverted hey i comfortable with my sexuality james grinned putting his arm around erica speaking of sex where lily remus commented now why would you pair sex and my future girlfriend together in a sentence belonging to you james asked mocking suspicion well when she grows tired of you and your na ve ways in bed she seeks someone with more experience remus winked that and you have your arm around my girlfriend you two have made it official then james grinned looking between remus and erica i call best man for your wedding hear actually sirius already called that how about being the godfather for our first child remus suggested sounds good mate boys boys slow down and i thought women were bad planning out their entire weddings before finding a boyfriend but you two are worse erica exclaimed overwhelmed by their conversation we are a special breed remus and i james replied remus pushing him away from erica and slinking his hand around her waist speaking of breeding where is lily remus smirked there you go again associating lily with sex you re using the wrong head today remus james snapped chuckling at his own immature joke this conversation is making me uncomfortable erica exclaimed squirming under remus grasp good now you know what hell it can be conversing with two people of the opposite sex remus quipped referring to the previous conversation concerning him erica and lily point taken oi james someone coming over here remus started worriedly watching the handsome astronomy teacher approaching them looking very determined o no hide me from ella no idiot its professor cyprian erica slowly managed to say consciously smoothing out the wrinkles in her dress and flipping her red hair over her shoulder mm he looks good tonight you re going out with a horn dog remus james teased making remus go red and nonchalantly roll his eyes as the professor approached evening cyprian having a good time you sound like a smarmy prick erica hissed in james ear stepped in front of him and flashing cyprian a bubbly smile hello professor evening ms jones i was having a good time mr potter but unfortunately an incident has occurred concerning miss evans and i need the three of you to report to the hospital wing cyprian said solemnly looking very serious what happened james immediately prompted his face turning from buoyant to intense with the words lily and incident compiled together in the same sentence i not quite sure she ll have to fill us in once she conscious and james roughly pushed passed students on his way out of the great hall leaving disgruntled partiers in his wake once the crowd dispersed james broke into a fervent run hurdling up the staircase three steps at a time he didntknow what had happened or how all he knew was that he had to be with lily mr potter i ll ask you to stop running in the hospital wing please this is not the quidditch pitch as i sure you re aware a horrorstruck madam pelly exclaimed her arms full of towels and medical supplies where lily james demanded his eyes pleading as he ignored pelly is she alright can i see her how is she one question at a time dear madam pelly whispered in exasperation leading james over to a seat by her office are you and miss evans a couple now yes james affirmed nattily twiddling his thumbs as he controlled his impulse yell at madam pelly for answers good i ll need you to answer a few questions for me before i run some tests on lily madam pelly said conjuring a clipboard paper and a quill what kind of tests james asked skeptically tension building well i regret informing you that lily may have been raped tonight madam pelly whispered worriedly eyeing james who looked deeply troubled what by who james hissed in a voice lower than a whisper that information is classified until dumbledore has dealt with the person responsible madam pelly replied putting a hand on james shoulder soothingly we dontknow what happened to lily and we wontuntil she conscious but i need to run this test now canti see her james murmured hunched over in his seat his hands erratically running through his hair let me ask you some questions and run the test then i ll let you see her madam pelly replied in a hushed voice just then erica and remus scrambled into the hospital wing both short of breath they froze when they saw the expression on james face james erica choked out her face ashen and upset at the sight of his troubled face remus pulled her close as if to shield her from some of the pain wait outside i ll talk to you in a moment james feebly ordered in no mood to give either friend a reassuring smile o no erica weakly moaned letting remus lead her out of the hospital wing alright mr potter these questions are quite personal but they re very important do not lie to me madam pelly stressed if it benefits lily i won t james replied have you and miss evans ever had intercourse madam pelly asked many questions all very personal and some james didntknow how to answer he didntknow everything about lily sex life or past boyfriends but with each question james felt sicker and sicker you ll tell me the results when you re finished the first person i am entitled to tell is the patient mr potter i cannot impugn on her privacy madam pelly returned after fifteen minutes having finished her examination and sat down beside james once more now there are severe bruises on her arms shoulders and neck but they will heal quickly the reason she was rushed to the hospital wing is because she was poisoned the boy involved must have concocted or gotten someone else to concoct a love potion which he used on ms evans but the potion hadntbeen left to brew for the mandatory month period therefore the primary ingredient lovage was still highly potent and caused ms evans throat to detract is she ok james stressed his hands formulating into fists at the thought of another guy touching or hurting lily ms evans will be physically sound but she ll need the support of you and her friends to get through such a trauma madam pelly replied her eyes empathetic you can see her now i ve a feeling she ll be waking up soon james didnthesitate he jumped out of his chair and pulled back the curtain sheltering lily pallid form she looked so innocent lying motionless in a hospital robe with brilliant hair encompassing her face like a halo lily evans was an angel his angel and how anyone could fathom hurting such a person was beyond him lils it me james whispered softly pulling a chair up beside her bed and holding onto one of her limp hands it james she did not stir nor give any inclination that she knew he was there she just peacefully inhaled and exhaled beneath her lids lily eyes fitfully moved around a sign she was dreaming i sorry this happened to you lily i ll never understand why bad things happen to such amazing beautiful people like you and i wish i could take all your pain away james gently kissed every finger on lily right hand holding it protectively between his own she didntdeserve this maybe he did but not lily i shouldnthave let you out of my sight this isntyour fault james lily whispered her eyes closed but her head softly rolling in the pillow lils thank merlin can you open your eyes darling james asked softly stroking her cheek with the pad of his thumb please wake up and tell me your ok i ok you re lying just a little lily murmured tiredly her eyes still closed can i get you anything lils james quietly asked sadness building up in the back of his throat as he looked down at lily who appeared helpless and afraid no where are the others waiting outside you can only have one visitor at a time james replied but lily can you tell me what happen not right now lily abruptness took james by surprise james reluctantly admitted it hurt him he wasntmad with lily he could never be this wasnther fault but she seemed so distant and detached a mere shadow of her former self silence enveloped the hospital wing only a diminutive drip drop sounded in the corner by the largest window alright i ll just let erica see you now james whispered softly feeling defeated as he carefully edging out of his chair and heading toward the door james james turned around to see lily sitting up in bed one tear trailing down her cheek and hitting the dry pillow below lily you shouldntbe up please i sorry lily cried feeling sick to her stomach as her bottled up emotions burst forth and she began to uncontrollably sob i i couldntget him off of me i who lily reluctantly whispered his name derek mitchell lily got to her feet hysterically sobbing as she tried to make her way over to james before her wobbly knees could give out james sweep her into his arms holding her head in the crane of his neck and supporting her lower back as she cried the couple collapsed onto their knees both tightly holding onto each other james repeatedly kissed lily forehead and hair and rubbed her back having trouble trying to contain his own emotion james had never felt this way about anyone before his insides burned and cringed with every tear she cried and he so badly wanted to make her pain go away to protect her from the world lily stopped crying after awhile and let james lead her back to the hospital bed james lay beside lily until she drifted back asleep half an hour later holding her close against his chest once he was sure she was peaceful james untangled himself from her body and crept out of the hospital wing o my god james tell me what happened erica practically shrieked getting up from her sitting position on the stone floor outside the hospital wing and grabbing a fistful of james sweater what going on go in and ask madam pelly i in a hurry james curtly replied his face deathly serious where do you think you re going remus roughly called after james who was already half way down the hallway he was angry because james had been callous with erica james didntanswer instead he disappeared behind the corner and out of sight he looks angry remus maybe you should go after him in case he does something stupid erica gravely suggested afraid of what james was about to do if there one thing i ve learned not to do in my life it to get in the way of a potter remus softly replied shaking his head and entering the hospital wing with an apprehensive erica james potter finished climbing the multiple steps leading into the ravenclaw tower and impatiently waited for the fat friar to float down the hallway and out of view before heading toward the tapestry shielding the door into the ravenclaw common room taking the marauder map out of his pocket james discovered the password and quietly whispered cobweb into the ear of a house elf statue sitting on the table near the tapestry the tapestry magically rolled upward revealing the opening into the ravenclaw common room briskly stomping into the common room james was met by a group of fifth year ravenclaw girls all dressed in pajamas and playing cards at an empty table is that james potter one brunette gapped wondering how the handsome boy had gained access into the room what are you doing here can we help you with something hey james can any one of you tell me where i can find derek mitchell james cut in trying to contain his boiling anger i need to see him now i ll go grab him for you one girl offered getting out of her seat i think he been suspended or something because he packing his stuff really do me a favor donttell him it me waiting down here for him ok james requested in case derek refused to come down or tried to make a hasty escape sure two minutes later the bubbly blonde james had instructed to fetch derek climbed down the stairs with a bedridden derek behind her who seemed unaware james was viciously glaring at him derek reached the bottom of the stairs and lifted his head bam hello fucker a few ravenclaw girls screamed and backed away from james who was towering over derek hunched over with a bleeding nose before derek could say anything james grabbed the scruff of his shirt and sent him flying into the same table the girls were previously occupying scattering cards everywhere derek howled in pain hitting his knee on the oak table before doubling over in pain go to hell potter derek spat opening one eye and peering at james who looked about to kill him i ll meet you there mitchell derek threw a punch at james narrowly missing his face james retaliated with a swift kick to the back of derek leg making him buckle to the ground derek lunged toward james legs wrestling him to the ground and punching him in the stomach james twinged in pain pinning derek to the ground with his weight and repeatedly punching him in the face derek face was a bloody wreck when james finally decided to thrash out his wand and thrust it hard into the tender spot between his chin what are you going to to do potter derek jeered gasping under the weight of james his wand and the blood pouring out of his nose kill me i d like to petrificus totalus professor flitwick shrieked making james go rigid and fall to the floor beside derek my word three male students and one female came to derek aid staunching the blood flow from his nose and cleaning up his wounds with the flick of a wand professor flitwick marveled at the situation for a moment not expecting james potter to be so brutally violent pierre frank bring mr mitchell up to his dormitory for the time being i ll send for madam pelly to fix up his nose very soon flitwick ordered waiting until the three students one bloody were out of his sight mr potter you will follow me to professor dumbledore office flitwick reversed his freezing spell and waited for james to pick himself up off the floor before exiting the ravenclaw common room with the messy haired boy in his wake james did not speak to flitwick who was fiercely interrogating him on his way to dumbledore office without knocking flitwick and james entered dumbledore animate office the white bearded man sat quietly behind his desk sucking on a lemon drop a troubled look appeared on his face when he saw james enter lily awoke when remus and erica entered the hospital wing merlin lily madam pelly told us everything erica whimpered giving lily a fierce hug as she stumbled upon her bed i want you to know we are with you and how are you doing remus cut in his eyes sympathetic as he too hugged lily and pulled up a chair beside her bed i better than i was now that you guys are here lily said attempting to sound happier but failing miserably it easier when friends are around well we arentgoing anywhere erica persisted determinedly her eyes flaring passionately really you bet kiddo remus affirmed seriously if you need anything just let us know ok i ll have a butterbeer float with strawberries thanks lily replied mockingly slightly giggling do i look like a bloody house elf jeez remus remarked flamboyantly rolling his eyes and smiling well remus i ve always said i think your ears are abnormally large so i can see how lily would make that mistake erica retorted sticking out her tongue at an outraged remus hey at least i donthave a big nose erica that better than having a big ass remus been looking at my ass have we erica and remus comical banter was interrupted by a navy blue owl that persistently began to peck on the outside of the window near lily bed the three friends looked up and recognizing the owl remus opened the window to let the bird in what james doing sending letters at this time of the night remus muttered in annoyance opening the window and watching the owl drop a short note on lily lap lily read the note quickly her pale face turning if possible a more pallid color she looked up at remus and erica in upset but quickly composed herself as she formulated a plan erica i need you to quickly swap your clothes with my hospital gown lily ordered getting out of bed and pulling the curtains around the two of them leaving remus baffled on the other side what are you doing lily remus questioned waiting for the two girls to emerge lily erica you ve got to pretend to be me for awhile quickly get into bed before madam pelly comes to check on me remus stay with her and make sure to pretend she is me lily whispered pulling the curtains back and helping erica into bed i ll be back in less than an hour tell us what going on erica pleaded just trust me lily whispered looking at the couple anxiously before silently slipping out of the hospital wing remus and erica looked at each other quizzically both concerning about lily remus she left the note remus grabbed james scribbled note off the ground and scanned it left to right it james he been suspended from hogwarts lily softly pushed open the oak doors leading out onto the grounds of hogwarts and crept outside the air was very cold her breath was visible in the darkness hugging her sides lily tiptoed down the stair steps and situated herself between james and his trunk james i dontwant you to leave you ll be ok lily you ve got roxanne and erica not to mention the remaining marauders james said genuinely turning towards lily with his messy brown hair and chocolate brown eyes they ll protect you when i can t james pulled lily into a hug warming her sides with his hands and letting her rest her head on his shoulder james would be gone until christmas for fighting with derek he d broken derek nose dislocated one of his knees and almost attacked him with magic what about derek lily whispered her eyes growing tired as she looked off into the distance her body shivering the bugger been expelled he wontbe graduating from hogwarts james affirmed he ll never hurt you again lily remained silent for a moment thinking back to what derek had said to her derek hates you so much james if you could just hear the way he spoke your name or the way his eyes clouded over at the very mention of you it was scary i not afraid for myself i afraid for you derek canthurt me lily dontworry about me or about yourself he wontbe interfering with us anymore james appeased kissing the top of lily head the night was quiet and still with an occasional howl ringing out from the forbidden forest in the distance rattled wooden wheels no doubt belonging to a carriage that would soon reach hogwarts and whisk james away to his lonely manor will i see you at christmas lily meekly asked pulling away from james grasp and turning to look at him yes but i dontknow if i can wait that long james truthfully responded still holding lily hand i might have to break into the castle when dumbledore isntlooking good luck lily smiled you think i cantdo it james asked seriously because i can and if it means seeing you i will you better mr potter lily ordered half heartedly reluctantly blinking back tears due to james earnest look i going to miss you you think i wontmiss you god this is as hard for you as it is for me james whispered taking both of lily hands if it wasntfor you i d be regarding this little trip home as a vacation however my ideal vacation would include you lily giggled as the red horseless carriage pulled up to the steps in front of them now really quick i have some rules for you james said pretending to be serious no boys or men or male creatures or even hermaphrodites got it if i come back to this school and find you with a boyfriend i ll drown myself in the lake ok i ll think about it lily replied sounding thoughtful watching you drown could be quite the spectacle well how about i make the decision a little easier james pulled lily into a soft kiss running his hands down her back and supporting her neck i know its awkward timing but lily evans will you be my girlfriend lily looked momentarily aghast but a smile soon spread across her face ear to ear you re joking this is your well planned opportune moment potter lily mockingly queried beginning to laugh shut up and say yes woman james comically demanded rolling his eyes as lily doubled over in giggles i dontknow i dontusually date clowns lily retorted casually rolling a piece of hair around her finger what a clown muggle thing o well anyway if you dontsay yes i ll tickle you and enjoy every minute of it pervert you wish lily flashed james a happy smile and kissed him taking him aback with a bemused expression upon his face i ll be your girlfriend james happily lily whispered in james ear wrapping her arms around his neck brilliant now that we have that established i ve got to go james sadly grinned stepping back to memorize every one of lily features i ll miss you lils promise to write me only if you follow my boys rule deal james kissed lily on the forehead and began to descend the steps towards his carriage dragging his trunk behind him loading his luggage into the back james opened the door and began to climb in goodbye mrs potter just because i your girlfriend doesntmean we re married james ok then i ll ask you that question next time i get suspended you re an idiot did you know lily called after him hugging her sides again james paused an idiot who happens to love you lily the door to the carriage closed and the wheels began turning down the road towards hogsmeade village lily waited for the wooden carriage to disappear from view before collapsing onto the steps leading into hogwarts and contemplating the many events that had just taken place the sky gradually clotted with clouds opening up and unleashing its wrath upon the earth lily lay unmoving in the rain her red hair sticking to her face she wondered what hurtle she would soon have to jump what was next for her if it hadntbeen for the clouds pices would ve winked beautifully in the night sky author notes my thanks goes out to everyone who has continued to read and review i really appreciate it if you re feeling impatient

password welcome thank you for reading please review 0 chapter 41 aer lily meet me at the edge of the great lake at twelve i ll be waiting james the common room was dark and quiet the only noise emulating from the crackling fire lily evans sat alone curled up in a ball near the hearth thinking of what had transpired over the last month james had been gone almost two weeks and december was nearing frost biting each blade of grass on the quidditch pitch lily received letters from james almost every day a constant reminder that he wasntwith her he wrote to check up on her afraid she was left fragile after what had happened with derek mitchell lily had come to gripes about what derek had done to her and though the incident still frightened her she wasntgoing to let it hinder her spirit she couldn t she waited until the big hand on her magical watch struck quarter to twelve before slipping james invisibility cloak over her head and exiting the common room via the portrait hole the hallways were eerily empty the only sound came from the persistent dripping of water from the bathrooms down the corridor peeves wordlessly floated by her looking somewhat bored without students to tease and lily narrowly missed stepping on mrs norris filch cat the grounds were shrouded in shadow and very still the moon barely visible behind the only cloud in the sky it was a strange night the air seemed to sparkle and lily felt the hair on the back of her neck stand on end there was something different about the way the waves on the lake restlessly moved swaying back and forth like notes composed for a symphony she neared the willow tree on the lake shore long strands of green foliage tickling her face as pushed them aside to find no one the grass was wet with dew where james should have been standing lily felt unnerved from the beginning james note uncharacteristic and vague it hadntbeen delivered by his owl and the handwriting didntmatch his previous letters i shouldntbe here lily was about to turn around and scuttle back into the castle when out of the corner of her eye she saw a ripped slip of paper tacked onto the trunk of the willow tree cautiously she ripped the note off and read the scribbled writing lily glanced down at the mysterious note and scrunched up her nose in confusion her attention quickly wavered the water began to oddly bubble near the shore of the lake and as lily began to pull off her invisibility cloak a head broke the surface lily gasped falling backwards and balanced on the palms of her hands kanool lily inquired softly her eyes clouded in uncertainty as the slick scaled head emerged from the water like an infant baptized the head belonged to the siren king chief of defense kanool who had previously helped her sirius and roxanne prepare against the kappas his yellow eyes focused keenly on her looking resolutely determined come with me hurry he spoke calmly the indented golden translator lily had seen before sandwiched between his sharp teeth what lily hissed pocketing james invisibility cloak did you leave this note quickly before the dark haired man comes back kanool spoke evenly gesturing for her to get into the lake james was here lily asked pleadingly looking over her shoulder i must wait for your time is now daughter he said seriously holding out his webbed hand which held a fistful of gillyweed we mustnttake too long it will be over soon daughter she was certainly not related to him why would he call her that but james it was not the man you speak of then who was it feeling oddly compelled lily hesitantly obliged and crammed the slimy plant into her mouth the sides of her neck burned as gills began to formulate where porcelain skin once was kanool grabbed a hold of her forearm and pulled her into the water once submerged lily cringed as she felt herself grow another set of eyelids which allowed her to see underwater it was dim and murky the deeper she swam the harder it was for her to see but lily was able to distinguish the hippocampus floating nearby kanool helped her mount the creature which had the head and front legs of a wild horse and the body and tail of fish once kanool had mounted he kicked the creature soft underbelly to jolt it to a start lily sped on the back of the hippocampus deeper into the lake feeling her ears pop unpleasantly the cold water sent chills up her spine and though disoriented all lily could think of was james and the strange note he had left her the palace was just as she had remembered it the underwater castle was made of pure thick glass that radiated an entrancing pearly pink glow and consisted of twelve tall turrets kanool and lily entered the castle from the bay entrance at the back left of the palace and after abandoning the hippocampus lily was led through crystal hallways she had never set eyes upon before lily stomach did nervous little flip flops as she observed her foreign surroundings she couldntquite register the fact that she was at the mermaid palace alone in the middle of the night lily didntknow why she so blindly trusted kanool but she supposed it was because of his assistance back in september however it didntabate her uneasiness kanool remained wordless as he led lily through a maze of corridors his silence replaced by glorious singing ringing out from the throne room it was the most exquisite singing lily had ever heard even better than last time though it retained a haunting air it was bold yet soft the kind of music reserved for only the most prestigious of occasions the combination of plucked strings and the poignant choir was overwhelming are you ready kanool breathed stopping before the double doors leading into the throne room for what lily whispered her eyes a blazing emerald colour though the question slipped from her tongue lily knew her next move wouldntbe an easy one kanool looked down at lily with a hint of sympathy lingering in his cat like eyes but did not respond instead pushing open the throne room doors and calmly ushering her inside the siren choir immediately softened their song with the arrival of the redhead seemingly expecting her lily breath caught in the back of her throat as she observed the precise formation of the siren king and his court emblazoned in the marble floor was the symbol of water a shape resembling a backward three with a triangle formulating from the third prong cuckolded in its bosom between the second point of the triangle and the second prong of the backwards three was a flawless sapphire without facets watery light recoiled from the surface of the jewel making it glitter despite the unnatural darkness lily cringed as gutted fish lay motionless around the perimeter of the room an offering to pisces we are glad you have come the siren king stepped forward adorned in a turquoise cape fashioned from rainbow fish scales translator betwixt his teeth just as the moon rules the tides it has brought you here to us but why am i here lily whispered incredulously her memory becoming hazy and her head beginning to spin the jewel you are here to rid us of this accursed key just as the prophecy foretold the king murmured his lucid speech songlike as he motioned toward the jewel go daughter save us lily stepped toward the jewel unaware of the merpeople surrounding her and gradually chanting louder and louder their voices passionate her eyes burned as the jewel came into focus the king was speaking to her but she couldntcomprehend anything but the beat of her palpitating heart lily stood over the water symbol and gracefully reached down toward the jewel ready to brush her knuckle on its glossy surface do i dare go through this again a cylindrical beam of white light encompassed the redhead bouncing off the transparent glass walls and blinding the merpeople they fell to their knees serpent like wails emitting from their blue lips lily moaned regaining consciousness and lifting her head from the moist ground awestruck by her serene surroundings lily wiped dirt away from her rosy cheeks and crouched to her knees ethereal light glistened on the quiet river carved through the limestone to her immediate right and wind that seemed to sing slithered between the gigantic trees in the forest to her left lily felt a sense of peace wash over her as the sun warmed her porcelain skin what is this place lily ascended to her feet and curiously peered into the river seeing her disheveled reflection staring back at her lily noticed her hair was knotty in the back and smudged with mud but she didntcare unlike her first jewel encounter lily felt she was in no immediate danger why do you look so displeased daughter a woman with hair the color of coal coaxed amusedly elegantly leaning against the trunk of the tree nearest lily lily jumped turning in surprise before lily stood a beautiful woman dressed in a thin white robe hair past her bottom her ocean blue eyes glistened intelligibly singing like the wind lily imagined princesses to look like her not displeased just confused where am i lily calmly inquired turning to the woman confidently once she had regained her composure atlantis the woman replied methodically approaching lily with her head held high i am naida sister of rowena ravenclaw you are the daughter the prophecy speaks of atlantis i lily evans lily replied politely incredulously viewing her surroundings i was under the impression if atlantis existed it was under water in this time atlantis has not yet been consumed by the wave naida replied her astonishing features sadly smiling this is where rowena found the aqua stone though the city was submerged when she found it but how did she find it lily inquired curiously amazed with the pure landscape and why was the stone here i know not how she found this place but i do know the stone was placed here by poseidon himself naida smirked understanding lily abashed skepticism do you know of poseidon he the greek god of water he ruled the oceans and rivers as i recall lily frowned folding her arms but greek gods arent real they re just stories perhaps but as i understand it you assumed atlantis a legend too naida stated smartly how are any of us to judge what is and what isnt real point taken lily frowned hugging her sides with her folded arms i have been charged with enlightening you on the legend of the jewels naida smirked observing lily carefully you require more knowledge for your journey for it will get more difficult i was difficult enough getting my hands on the aqua jewel lily frowned nervousness bobbing in the back of her throat but please tell me the legend nadia eyes flashed purple she gestured lily to sit on the patch of moss growing around the trunk of the tree she leaned against and expelled a deep sigh as she began long ago when human civilization was still taking form a great war broke out between the olympians and hades brother to zeus and god of the underworld hades jealous of his brother power and authority yearned to claim the throne for himself as well as zeus wife hera enlisting the help of gorgons sirens poseidon mutated child cyclops and cerberus his three headed dog hades marched his monster army to the base of mount olympus ready to strike zeus god of the sky held a secret court atop mount olympus to discuss ways to obliterate hades resistance it was ares god of war who made the suggestion to unite the four elements to create a super weapon ares called upon the element of fire ionis poseidon called upon the element of water aqua demeter called upon the element of earth terra zeus called upon the element of wind and air aer the four elements collided and formed a crystalline stone that could manipulate the elements of earth it was the color of black rain known all as the quintessence stone after seven years of war hades and his army of monsters were defeated without further reason to use the stone the four olympians fought over what to do with it ares demanded the stone remain in his position being the one who founded the idea zeus insisted the stone be kept safe in his possession being the ruler of all the gods every olympian living atop the great mountain wanted the stone to remain with them it was demeter who resolved the conflict taking the stone to hephaestus the blacksmith god to be broken into four pieces the four creators zeus ares poseidon and demeter were each given a piece that very day the god and fabled oracle apollo predicted the stones would be united once more and fall into the hands of an evil sorcerer thinking the evil sorcerer to be hades the four gods temporarily disappeared with their elemental pieces hiding them in mysterious places around the world places nearly impossible to reach hoping the stones would never be reunited again lily listened carefully her emerald eyes sparkling with curiosity when naida finished she licked her lips and exhaled softly her eyes brimming with tears what wrong lily asked wondering why naida was crying and not she the one charged with such an impossible mission now that i have fulfilled my task i must depart from atlantis naida replied her mouth twitching into a sad frown i have grown so fond of it though i was lonely in my solitude naida who was the evil sorcerer the oracle prophesized about lily inquired feeling slightly light headed why is this all happening now the prophecy has yet to be fulfilled lily the dark sorcerer will appear in your time and try to undermine you do not trust anyone daughter do not let this wizard unite the stones naida professed passionately i know not why this is happening now i just know the legend you will learn more as you collect more jewels but how will i know where to find the next jewel lily persisted feeling as though she still new very little it will call to you just as the aqua stone did nadia replied half heartedly preparing for her exit next is the aer jewel i know not where it lies or when you shall find it this will be revealed to you in time consult the stars in your world neptune is particularly visible tonight the stars the box that disclosed the ionis jewel was activated when mars shown it brightest mars a red planet was associated with war the roman god mars was the equivalent to ares in greek how does greek mythology tie in with astronomy lily asked a puzzled look on her face greek mythology is practically the basis when it comes to space ms evans cyprian happily replied tonight neptune was particularly visible as well as the pisces constellation pisces the fish constellation the merpeople were offering sacrifices to pisces in the castle neptune the roman god of water the equivalent of poseidon aqua stone aqua being the latin word for water it was the stars and planets that were influencing the stones lily now had in her possession ares and poseidon jewels representing fire and water ares had hid his jewel underneath stonehenge and poseidon had hid his in atlantis a place long disappeared from any modern map map it the planets and stars that will provide me with the time line aodh alluded to so long ago lily suddenly shrieked color returning to her cheeks as she connected the dots i missing the air and earth stones all i need to figure out is which constellation or planet connects to the jewels and gods see the information i have provided you with is already benefiting you naida smiled sadly running her pale fingers through her black tresses now it is time for you to return daughter are you ready yes i prepared lily replied still slightly gleeful i ve got to tell james walk into the river and dive underwater hold your breath as long as possible then let the water spill into your lungs and blackness pour over you naida explained pointing towards the still river this is what you must do if you wish to return drown myself lily murmured fear and uncertainty persuading her to refuse do not worry it will be painlessly go now naida encouraged not flinching lily winced aodh being a lot warmer and understanding than naida but didntprotest as she began to wade to the middle of the luke warm river the trees above lily head swayed against their bright blue background as she took a final look at naida and plunged into the water have you ever known her to sleepwalk i told you before no erica and i have been in the same dormitory with her since first year we would ve noticed if she just disappeared from time to time you donthave to chew my head off would you two shut up i think she stirring lily jerked to a start as if awakening from a nightmare and found herself staring up at five curious relieved faces roxanne erica sirius remus and even peter were crowded around her their faces betraying puzzlement and worry it took lily a moment to register where she was the hospital wing w w what going on lily blinked ascending into a sitting position what am i doing in the hospital wing we were hoping you could tell us remus replied his grey eyes searching hers sirius and i found you on the banks of the great lake this morning sopping wet and blue in the face am going to have to put you on a leash lily roxanne burst cutting off remus as she folded her arms in stern worry the number of times you ve gone missing in the past couple months is ridiculous how did i get to the banks of the great lake lily didntremember anything after plunging into the river at atlantis she didnteven remember drowning as she was told to do was it all a dream lily felt something bulging out of her pajama pants pocket it wasnta dream i dontknow how i got there lily lied realizing her pajamas were still soaking wet i must ve walked in my sleep i sirius and remus shot each other worried glances looking as if they suspected foul play while roxanne merely squeezed lily hand her eyes panicky erica and peter remained silent seemingly concocting their own conclusions lily felt uneasy about their expressions what wrong with you lot this isnta big deal lily commented forcefully trying to jog her friends out of their worried stupors i ll just get a sleeping potion from madam pelly and be on my way madam pelly ran some tests on you early this morning she found fluid in your lungs and had to immediately drain them if sirius and remus hadntfound you merlin knows what condition you d be in roxanne stated her eyes filling up with fret you re really scaring us lily i know this is a difficult time for you james being gone and your incident with derek but this isnta difficult time i fine lily protested narrowing her eyes dontyou make me out to be some fragile thing that canthandle a little conflict what roxanne means to say remus countered trying to diffuse the escalating tension it just are you telling us everything you ve been acting mysteriously lately i sorry i ve caused you guys so much worry lately but it nothing really lily continued annoyance evident in her voice maybe if you guys just i dontknow stopped paying so much attention to me you d see that why are you getting mad at us lily roxanne grumbled seriously frowning we re your friends if you haventnoticed you were almost raped for merlin sakes we re all trying to look out for you i dontneed your help lily snapped aggressively stunning her friends as she got to her feet fury turning her cheeks pink what wrong with you lily erica nearly spat angry that lily was treating all of them so unfairly all they wanted to do was help her understand her weird behavior and disappearances but instead she was pushing them away as i ve explained to you before nothing lily found her wand on the side table by her hospital bed and pocketed it wanting to be as far away from her friends as possible you should rest lily lay back down sirius said austerely being the first to stand up and stop the redhead departure i going back to the dormitory to change lily insisted glowering as sirius blocked her path get out of my way sirius i dontthink so spitfire sirius crossed his arms daring lily to dodge him without thinking lily extracted her wand and pointed it in sirius face get out of my way or i will hex you black lily spat desperation stress and fatigue fueling her foul mood sirius looked shocked and hurt by lily actions what the fuck lily roxanne rose out of her seat purple in the face put down your wand now what gotten into you lily didntanswer instead side stepping an abashed sirius and quickly exiting the hospital wing leaving behind her stunned deeply troubled friends lily wait traversing the halls of hogwarts at an alarming speed lily felt hot tears streak down her cheeks she didntwant anyone to see her crying so she quickly ducked into an empty classroom filled with inches of dust and tattered textbooks plopping down in the corner furthest from the door lily buried her face in her hands and silently wept she wasntmad at her friends how could she be they were only trying to help her it was the fact that she couldnttell them what was wrong what she had to endure the burden that fell on her shoulders was a heavy one and she didntknow if she could handle it the one person lily could confide in was gone till christmas lily fingering the bulge in her pocket and extracted the blue stone she had attained only hours ago it was beautiful the brightest thing in the dank room what was her next move it seemed like she had accidentally found both stones as if by chance or a twisted fate what was guiding her to them lily felt stressed realizing she had never even attempted to locate the stones or the key chamber where would she even begin to look lily sighed wiping tears away from her porcelain cheeks images of atlantis still swam in her mind atlantis a place long disappeared from any modern map wait a minute lily whispered to herself her green eyes watery as she remembered i have seen atlantis on a map before lily swiftly got up from her dirty spot on the stone floor and exited the classroom dust whirling and dancing in her wake chapter 42 november evenings lily awoke the next morning to find her dormitory empty practically licked clean both erica and roxanne beds were neatly made and the bathroom door was ajar lily bit down on her bottom lip realizing they had left for breakfast without her climbing out of bed and almost slipping on a pair of dirty trainers lily thrust open the windows and plunged her head outside taking a deep breath she had to try and compose herself regulate her rollercoaster of emotions if she were to figure out the mystery of the jewels it wouldnthurt to make up with her friends either slipping on her school uniform and brushing out her mop of hair lily headed out of gryffindor tower toward the great hall many of the younger gryffindors watched her attentively as she slipped through the portrait hole an observation she did not miss she was attracting a little too much attention lately what with her derek mitchell incident relationship with hogwarts most sought after marauder and now potential drowning accident lily wished she had james invisibility cloak as she sauntered down the halls on the seventh floor lily pondered about what to do about her friends it was difficult having to carry such a heavy burden on her own a burden which would ve been lightened had james been around she refused to endanger her friends and divulge her secret but would her friends continue to buy her lame excuses for the odd things that were happening to her would it be a wise decision to keep her friends at bay while she was trying to solve the mystery of the jewels somehow she doubted it whatever the answer lily decided to push the thought of her friends out of her mind until after classes care of magical creatures was scheduled to begin in an hour so lily who had no appetite headed out onto the hogwarts grounds and situated herself under the big tree by the lake the air outside was cool and crisp an early indication that winter was quickly approaching and frost lingered on the slightly graying grass lily pulled her jacket tight around her figure and leaned against the thick willow tree watching out of the corner of her eye the new game keeper hagrid pluck the last pumpkins from his picked clean patch fancy seeing you here a voice rung out from the distance jolting lily out of her serene stupor and alerting her that she was not alone i didntsee you at breakfast lily looked up into the face of remus lupin who looked slightly ragged this morning and offered a weak smile i thought i d spare you all my grumpy presence especially after how i acted last night yes you were quite the bitch yesterday werentyou remus smirked plunking down beside lily and burying his hands in his jeans pockets that doesntmean you can skive off breakfast and get away with it though you prat lily grinned playfully pushing remus and rolling her eyes i wasntaware i was contracted to have breakfast with you lot every morning now you ve been informed remus stated matter o factly watching his warm breath condense before his eyes and turning to lily skive off again and i ll resort to drastic procedures to force you to adhere to our contract really and what are these purported procedures lily inquired a smile twitching on her lips i hope they are at least ministry approved since when do i do anything that is approved of perhaps i ll steal all your knickers and pass them among the gryffindor quidditch team when they re changing after practice remus mused looking thoughtful yet peaky or i could post your o w l grades all over the school and what makes you think that either one of those things would embarrass me lily raised an eyebrow and smugly returned remus smirk i happen to have excellent grades for one and perhaps i dontwear knickers remus chuckled a very guttural noise emitting from his lips and smiled with his twinkling eyes i ll remember that statement the next time you wear a skirt i bet you will lily scoffed pursing her lips in amusement now tell me why you re out here maybe like you i fancied some quiet time outside remus offered idly extending onto his back and stretching like a lazy lion why do you think i here you came looking for me didntyou lily inquired pulling her knees up to her chest and looking out toward the lake i cantsee you coming down here to find solace there always some type of action occurring on the grounds i wanted to tell you something remus said deciding to be truthful it about last night look i know i was unfair to everyone and that you guys were worried i just stressed as of late and i well i dontknow how to better explain myself lily began begging excuses to pop into her head i dontknow what to tell you what i can say to satisfy all of you i didntcome to lecture you lily remus whispered offering a mysterious knowing smile i wanted to tell you that i was unfair to you last night i your friend and i care about you but i understand that you like i need privacy i too have secrets lily secrets which i am not ready to share yet just know that you have friends and we re here for you when you re ready i well that was unexpected thank you remus lily quietly replied her features softening i know you all must be frustrated with me but that frustration pales in comparison with mine i know what it like like you re standing in a crowded room and all the attention is on you but you dontknow what to say but then when you unburden yourself it like you ve just saved yourself from drowning half an hour later lily was already beginning to feel as if she d saved herself from drowning remus had successfully lifted her spirits if only a little professor malastar seemed passive when lily and remus arrived outside of hagrid hut another reason lily mood was improving quiet down malastar mumbled rubbing his temples in annoyance when the rest of the class arrived five minutes later today we will be observing and sketching the tendencies of porlocks can anyone tell me what a porlock is like usual lily and remus hands punctured the air flapping about eagerly anyone other than lupin and evans malastar reacted in exasperation having to relent to the two brainy gryffindors no fine lupin they re horse guardians about 2 feet tall walk on two legs shaggy fur and a long nose i believe they originated in england porlocks only protect horses they choose to protect which makes them unique remus explained effortlessly causing lucius malfoy to loudly scoff in the background yes malastar sighed particularly unhappy with his job that morning partner up and carefully pluck a porlock from its pen near the forest let it roam around a bit and record its behavior porlocks are not fast runners and pose no threat to wizards therefore it will be easy for you to collect them at the end of class lily and remus did as they were told plucking an extremely furry creature with large eyes and a long nose from a pen near the forest remus set the creature which looked like a cross between a bear cub and an anteater down on the chilly grass and it began to waddle around like a toddler lily and remus followed the cuddly porlock around until it sat down and began picking at the grass have you received any letters from james lately lily asked her and remus sitting beside the porlock and watching it play with the grass i haventspoken to him in awhile he used to write every day not lately sirius just received a letter the other day i believe james grandfather is ill james and ariel love their grandfather i expect they re visiting him in belgium and james has been too busy to write remus said quietly students with their porlocks lingering near them i think he d tell you that but best keep it quiet that you know ok yes i will lily affirmed though she felt dismayed that james hadnttold her i think i ll owl him tonight though we haventtalked in almost a week i read part of the letter he sent sirius he must have asked three times how you were doing quite a pathetic display actually remus teased laughter threatening to erupt from his chest you ll watch lily for me wontyou how is she is lily ok o shut up lily demanded comically gently hitting remus cheek as hers became inflamed what about you and erica remy holding hands stealing kisses whispering sweet nothings to each other you re jealous remus winked a smug look upon his handsome face insanely how can you tell lily rolled her eyes and accepted some torn grass the porlock handed to her how are you two doing anyway it been good so far it not like we re rushing into anything remus shrugged mimicking the porlock and absentmindedly pulling out grass has she said anything lily grinned she seems really happy more so than ever if that even possible great remus beamed breaking away from lily gaze and smiling down at the grass anyway have you and james shagged yet remus lily shrieked shrilly comically outraged and embarrassed due to his comment remus burst into fresh peals of laughter lily reaction being exactly what he expected o common you know you want to lily he such a dreamboat dontmake me curse you lupin lily threatened though a smile lingered at the corner of her lips donteven get me started on you and erica what do you call her when you re snogging shall i just tell everyone dontyou dar oi crabbe goyle get a load of these two the mudblood and the half breed are having a lovers spat lucius malfoy smirked maliciously flanked by the two largest boys in hogwarts imagine what their children will look like their blood will be so dirty they ll probably have to be put in cages crabbe and goyle grunted in agreement as lily and remus broke away from their amusing verbal exchange the two narrowing their eyes at the slick haired pureblood and his two goons if you dontrelocate in the next minute malfoy i ll feel inclined to curse your face off and cause hair to grow all over unlikely places on your body remus replied coolly calmly folding his arms and regarding the nasty slytherins as if you frighten me lupin malfoy replied regally an arrogant smile plastered on his face although your little whore face is quite frightening her body isnthalf bad though lily reacted almost instantaneously her wand lodged between malfoy eyes and her tone sharp i dare you to say that again lucius you ll find i wontbe as kind as remus here though malfoy remained unmoving lily recoiled remus had brandished his wand just in time to repel a jelly legs curse shot at him by crabbe but was pinned to the ground with the use of the petrificus totalus curse by goyle capitalizing on her momentarily distraction lucius batted lily wand away from his face and grabbed hold of her hand not so tough now are you mudblood lucius smiled arrogantly controlling lily in his tight grip as she struggled not with potter and his stupid friends not protecting you let go of me lily hissed not wanting to alert malastar and give malfoy the satisfaction of scaring her not before i bestow upon you some pureblood hospitality lucius malfoy grinned hearing crabbe and goyle laughing behind him as he raised his wand petrificus tot arghh malfoy let go of lily giving her ample time to escape and race over to remus stiff body and dropped his wand with a howl of pain crabbe and goyle looked dumbfounded malfoy leg was being attacked by a furry two foot tall creature the porlock lily and remus had been following around get this thing off me lucius screamed at a motionless crabbe and goyle whipping about his leg trying to shake the porlock off do something lily helped remus who was recovering from the temporary and poorly cast body binding spell up to his feet and the two watched malfoy run about like his hair was on fire crabbe and goyle stupidly following in his wake look lily the porlock chose to protect you i sure we ll get extra marks for that remus grinned his anger instantly evaporating because of the comical sight of malfoy now what do you say i show malfoy and his lap dogs a little marauder hospitality i cantlet you have all the fun lily smirked raising her wand toward the three slytherins on the count of three one two three oppugno lily yelled pointing her wand toward a tree full of birds which when struck with the spell dove at the group of struggling boys and began to incessantly peck them rictusempra remus pronounced at the same time sending a jet of silver light toward malfoy and hitting him square in the chest now not only was malfoy being attacked by a mob of angry birds and a courageous porlock he was laughing despite his pain because of remus tickling charm do haha some haha thing malfoy screeched like a little boy not knowing where to begin i believe our work here is done remus smirked watching malfoy with swelling satisfaction then turning to lily let hand in our drawings and head to lunch sounds like a marvelous idea lily smiled up at remus taking great pleasure in malfoy pain and embarrassment pity i donthave a camera shall we remus and lily happily linked arms both stifling laughter and walked off toward the castle mocking malfoy and his goons the whole way he probably just lost peter turtles dontjust wander off erica said soothingly to peter pettigrew who had his face buried in his hands at the lunch table no he gone for good this time peter mumbled clearly distraught due to the fact his pet turtle marcus was yet again missing i wish james was here he would ve been able to find marcus hey i searched our whole room the common room i even posted up missing turtle fliers sirius nearly spat out his pumpkin juice in indignation i telling you that turtle either took a tumble out the window or peter broke into a fresh batch of tears his hysterical coughing and sputtering causing many gryffindors to lose their appetites the chubby boy acting more like a young elementary boy was making his friends exceedingly uncomfortable now look what you ve done roxanne snapped glaring at sirius as she awkwardly patted peter on the back you can be the most insensitive me you re the one who almost chucked the little wanker out the window last would you two shut up erica demanded one hand on her left temple due to peter crying and sirius and roxanne shouting you re making things worse like my headache well arentyou cranky this morning roxanne commented taken aback by erica unnatural disposition you and sirius are cranky ever day of your lives that a bit of a generalization sirius mumbled in disagreement childishly folding his arms and it really not necessary to yell at each other all the time you two quarrel like a married couple erica finished heaving a sigh and downing her cup of juice want some juice peter as if i would ever marry him roxanne grumbled earning a glare from sirius what makes you think i would put up with a cow like you for a wife sirius returned though not as harshly as he nonchalantly leaned on the gryffindor table i just upset about lily i guess we ve barely seen her lately roxanne continued choosing to ignore sirius stupid comment i was thinking maybe we were too hard on her last night she had a rough go of it lately maybe we could cut her a break i was thinking the same thing erica affirmed looking troubled she been stressed lately and since james left she sort of distanced herself from us whatever she going through it cantbe fun then let add a little more fun to her life sirius said seriously how about we all take her to hogsmeade for a couple we re not drinking sirius forget the firewhiskey roxanne cut in sternly i was going to say butterbeer sirius announced defensively crossing his fingers behind his back maybe it will be good for her to get off the grounds and loosen up a bit like i said no intoxication roxanne frowned rolling her eyes at the good looking brunette any ideas erica i sure you and i can muster up something fun to get her mind off james and well derek just then a midnight blue owl a rare species found in the forests of slovenia swooped down into the great hall toward sirius a large grin spread over his features when the majestic owl dropped a small letter onto his platter filled with macaroni and ground meat i ve seen that owl before roxanne wondered aloud it james owl lenny peter cut in having looked up from his puddle of tears sirius eagerly ripped open the letter and unfolded the delicate paper peter roxanne and erica watched sirius scan the letter carefully all three perking up when his grin grew larger if possible and he let out a whoop of excitement what is it roxanne asked nosily straining to get a good look at the letter is james coming back soon has dumbledore let him come back early let just say we wontneed a reason to cheer up lily anymore sirius exclaimed greedily reading the letter again i ve got a plan come close hey guys remus lupin said walking over to the gryffindors with lily in tow what that merlin sirius wrenched back the letter to the chagrin of peter roxanne and erica and stuffed it in his pocket noticing lily was with him h hey remus lily surprised to see you here why would you be surprised to see us here remus raised an eyebrow and took a seat beside erica while lily tentatively took a seat beside a skittish sirius it lunch o right so it is sirius laughed awkwardly clearing his throat and turning to lily so how you been lillykins feeling better this morning yes thanks for asking lily replied softly unsure of how to talk to roxanne and erica did you guys have a good morning normal although poor peter has lost his turtle roxanne replied trying extra hard to muster a smile for her best friend sirius and peter have been looking for marcus all morning it terrible lily peter sniffed his eyes dry and red rimmed he was in my room last night under the bed like usual then i went to feed him this morning and he was gone are you sure he not hiding in a slipper or something lily asked trying to seem concerned about peter silly pet i mean it isntthe first time marcus has gone missing is it he is partial to wandering i suppose peter mumbled relenting to his hands again so anyways sirius started hoping to stray from the turtle conversation how was care of magical creatures malastar in a foul mood like usual not so much malastar more like malfoy remus replied calmly passively biting into a tuna sandwich he and his lovers cornered me and lily after class had me in a full body bind what erica demanded nearly spitting out her soup he cantjust go around cursing people that against school rules malfoy was never exactly one to follow rules roxanne retorted folding her arms reminds me of some other boys in this school did either of you get hurt peter asked removing his hands from his face and looking up at remus and lily i ve heard lucius is an excellent dueler neither of us were hurt lily smiled nicely appreciative of her friends concern malfoy was just being his typical self and making fun of anyone who wasnta pureblood james probably would ve blasted his head off his shoulders if he were there sirius said in jest though he didntappear impressed shall we pull a prank fest on them remus dontworry lily and i took care of them remus smirked sending lily a knowing look malfoy is probably in the hospital wing right now pulling the feathers out of his arse lily laughed her cheeks turning a rosy pink maybe he ll think twice before bothering us again i doubt it roxanne announced a small smile playing on her face as she and the others imagined what lily and remus did to lucius malfoy is like rochelle he just keeps coming back for more speaking of rochelle where has she been lately erica inquired looking down the gryffindor table for rochelle and her girl gang it been so quiet lately without her annoying voice announcing how gorgeous she is probably because james isntaround sirius snorted remembering the letter he sent and grinning she has no one to impress i would imagine she cries herself to sleep every night i wouldntput it past her lily grumbled frowning down at her pasta and salad when do you think james will be back anyway he has to be back before christmas we have mid terms dunno soon hopefully sirius replied willing the smile off his face it can get right boring here without him all remus does is read i mean who does that we have midterms in december sirius maybe it would do you some good to actually study after all our marks for this year will determine if we can continue on with our courses for next year remus raised an eyebrow trying to sound stern if you dontstart cracking down you wontbe able to become an auror like you wanted you want to be one too lily perked up still keeping the fact that she too wanted to be one a secret james told me only a little while ago that what he wants to do after hogwarts yeah if i dontend up playing on a professional quidditch team sirius began causing remus and peter to scoff just because i haventhad any offers yet doesntmean i wontget any remus whatever you say remus muttered lightly beginning to collect his books as the lunch bell was about to ring signaling the commencement of classes anyway i ve got to run to ancient runes i ll see you all at dinner wait i ll walk you sirius stood up abruptly dropping loose parchment into his macaroni i have something i need to discuss with you see you ladies later oh roxanne yes she quipped tiredly also gathering together her books dontyou be looking on my ass on the way out ok sirius winked at roxanne offering lily a silly smile as he and remus left the great hall peter scurrying behind them both chuckling and whispering that wontbe a problem roxanne yelled after them heaving a great sigh as sirius disappeared around the corner black has got some nerve just wait until i learn how to cast silent spells he wontknow what hit him erica giggled settling up her backpack i off to arithmancy you coming roxanne oh i was hoping to have a word with you two lily cut in shyly before roxanne agreed holding her books close to her bust it about last night we ve really got to run lils we re already late roxanne apologized fixing her hair in a compact mirror she extracted from her bag but we ll definitely talk tonight ok ok see you later lily frowned as erica and roxanne power walked out of the great hall toward the north tower were they avoiding her they didntseem mad or upset because of her behavior last night just distant remus had more than proved he wasntupset with her and it didntappear sirius or peter were mad but compared to roxanne and erica it hardly mattered deciding that she wasntin the mood to study at the library lily headed toward gryffindor tower having no other classes to attend she particularly liked today because she had one class and two spares time which she usually spent with james arriving in her room lily deposited her bag on a chair near the window accidentally hitting her bookshelf and causing textbooks to spill all over her dresser and plopped onto her bed what the lily jumped up from her bed something having pricked her ear when she lied down there on her bed looking simple and elegant was a white rose lily realized she had pricked her ear on one of the thorns that had not been shorn cautiously picking up the flower thinking it could be some silly pay back prank from malfoy lily sniffed its floral scent it was beautiful and reminded her of her mother garden no note could be found that odd lily mused examining the delicate flower in her hand and smiling despite her disconcertion getting up off her bed lily deposited the rose into an empty glass on her dresser and filled it with water with the aguamenti spell cleaning the top of her dresser to make room for the glass lily noticed something odd reflected in the mirror above the surface of her drawers op en t hed oor wit hth easel em en t sfour the small inscription on the back page of the library book she had taken out about the four elements reflected in her mirror but when reflected backwards seemed to spell a solid sentence perhaps it wasntlatin after all hmm lily wondered aloud picking up the word four at the end of the sentence opent he door withth easel easel no here it is open the door with these elements four the inscription made perfect sense what with the book it was scribbled in being about the four element of nature the question was what door was the elements suppose to open and was an element a concrete thing not just air and water then it occurred to lily the stones if the elements are the stones which each represent an element then the door must be it must be the hidden place in the castle where i supposed to unite the elements lily whispered running her figure along the inscription but where is it urggh where is bloody james when you need him lily snapped the book shut in surprise roxanne entered the room with erica both adorning big bright smiles hey you what are you up to erica chirped happily depositing her bag on the ground and collapsing onto her bed we were wondering where you went we almost went to the library hi just cleaning up a bit lily lied her heart beating rapidly due to her startling revelation umm how was ancient runes that was a quick class boring i have no idea what my parents find so interesting about them roxanne exclaimed bending over to catch her breath after having ran up the stairs to the dormitory all i know is i wontbe following in their footsteps anyway we were let out early because we have an essay due in a couple days oh what did you want to say to us earlier lily erica piped up yawning like a tired lioness and squeezing her teddy bear sorry we had to rush off it ok i just wanted to apologize about the way i acted last night lily said meekly sitting down on her bed her eyes focusing on the ground i know i ve been off lately i cantreally explain it dontworry we know you re stressed roxanne smiled genuinely quickly being replaced with a sly grin which is why we brought you this roxanne spilled out the contents of her backpack on lily bed and laughed at lily shocked reaction different assortments of candy including bertie bott every flavor beans and chocolate frogs covered her red bedspread lily grinned from ear to ear inwardly thanking merlin for her wonderful friends how did you get these lily inquired in enthusiasm gapping at her two grinning dorm mates i thought you went to class we lied we took a quick trip to honeydukes erica beamed appearing proud of herself for breaking the rules imagine roxanne and me sneaking out to hogsmeade without the marauders they ve been such a bad influence on us roxanne agreed though she said it with affection we figured we haventhad any girl time in awhile and we could all use some sweets merlin you dontknow how much i needed this lily announced jovially ripping open a chocolate frog and stuffing it into her mouth well dig in i was wondering when you d insist erica rolled her eyes and took a seat along with roxanne on lily bed it been too long since we ve done this those damn boys are just running our lives lately i dontsee you complaining about remus running your life missy roxanne teased prodding erica in the side and making her shriek the two of you seem smitten i wouldntgo that far erica blushed popping a jellybean into her mouth he a sweet guy smart athletic so romantic too remus is exactly what i looking for in a boyfriend we talked about you a bit today lily grinned earning a surprised look from erica he said some pretty interesting things what did he say erica demanded dropping her candy and narrowing her eyes at lily i swear to merlin if you donttell me i ll i ll you ll stutter at me lily laughed ducking when erica took a swing at her with her pink pillow oi quit trying to behead me so i can tell you go on then ok ok lily held up her hands in defeat he just explained that you two werentrushing into anything and that he was happy with your relationship so far that it i thought you were going to give us some juicy details roxanne pouted quickly turning her attention to a slightly calmer erica so how far have you two gone i not telling that private and between remus and myself erica turned a brilliant shade of red and hugged lily pillow tightly i just i d rather not o common it just me and lily roxanne persisted frowning at the meek girl if you donttell me i ll go and ask remus myself you wouldntdare erica squeaked going rigid i ll tell you how far remus and i have gone as soon as you explain to me and lily what you and sirius black did at the halloween ball we didntdo anything roxanne shrieked sending lily and erica into giggles where did you get a crazy idea like that from remus saw you guys making out in the garden erica returned causing lily to howl in hilarity and collapse onto the floor tears streaming down her cheeks well then he must have been intoxicated because i did not and i repeat did not make out with black roxanne screamed running over to her bed and burying her face in her pillow you two are so full of it why would remus lie about something like that lily comically questioned roxanne having recovered from her bought of laughter remus barely drinks too ugh maybe he should get glasses like potter roxanne mumbled her face flushed the day i make out with black is the day i ll have myself committed to st mungo s you admitted to liking him once dontyou remember lily continued a smug look upon her face as she scrutinized her best friend remember that day i joked i had made out with him you turned a lovely shade of jealous green i must have been sick then roxanne spat in defense can we change the subject please dontthink for one moment we wontbring this up again erica chirped happily relishing the fact she had blackmail material on roxanne the three friends chatted for a long time about school boys and the latest gossip in witch weekly before relenting to their grumbling stomachs and deciding to head down to dinner the girls changed into their normal clothes and just as roxanne was about to open the door erica screamed merlin erica jumped nearly a meter off the ground and let go of the sock she was attempting to put on her foot why is there a turtle in my sock marcus lily shouted turning the sock upside down and revealing the small turtle peter owned what are you doing in here peter been crying about you all day thank god we found him now peter will stop sputtering and coughing in my food roxanne exclaimed raising an eyebrow at the turtle nestled in lily hand all that crying and spoilt food because of this silly thing eck what i want to know is how he got into my trunk erica frowned pulling out a new pair of less slimy socks and pulling them on if i find him in here again i swear i ll make a stew out of him that terrible lily laughed we d never hear the end of it from peter it would be his fault for not putting that reptile on a leash erica frowned quickly fixing her hair in her mirror and opening the door shall we return the pest to peter at dinner common i telling you remus it perfect sirius grinned excitement evident in his smooth sultry voice she wontknow what hit her the marauders minus james sat in a cluster around the gryffindor table their heads together in conversation the enchanted ceiling was cloudless revealing the darkening night and twinkling stars and the students below it were chatting merrily among themselves anticipating dinner what time do you reckon remus asked a pleasant smile lingering on his lips as he brushed a strand of hair out of his face erica and i have a study session later on tonight you re not going to shag her in the library are you sirius scoffed teasingly remus rolling his eyes at him couldntyou pick a sexier atmosphere maybe somewhere with a little candle light candle light i never pinned you as a romantic sirius remus teased smirking at sirius triumphant look now stop being a wanker and tell me when he said a bit after dinner maybe we can prolong dinner so we can go straight sirius offered turning his attention to a down trodden pettigrew whatcha think petey are they serving treacle tonight peter mumbled absent mindedly ignoring sirius question and staring off into the distance still upset arentyou peter remus inquired kindly noticing the boy clueless yet somber expression dontworry i sure hello boys lily cut in abruptly winking teasingly at remus as she sidled up to sirius and playfully squeezed his knee i ve got a little present for the three of you if it includes red lingerie and whip cream i in lillykins sirius smirked seductively enjoying lily tantalizing mood give it to me baby in your dreams sirius roxanne pronounced rolling her eyes as she and erica took a seat at the table as well erica holding hands with remus under the table i dontbelieve i invited you to my little escapade with lily so in your dreams dewey sirius snapped immediately breaking out into a grin again when he possessively slinked an arm around lily waist what this present then ta da lily smiled holding out her hand with marcus on it before peter we ve rescued the reptile from erica sock drawer marcus peter shrieked like a little girl almost sending erica flying off her chair when he reached over the table to grab the turtle you ve found him fine i guess i can settle for peter turtle sirius leaned in and whispered to lily who smirked at sirius as if he were a naughty child there you go petey boy now you ll be all smiles at meals from now on right o marcus are you alright peter cooed at his turtle ignoring sirius and carefully stroking its shell thanks so much lily i owe you one well it was actually erica who found him lily continued her stomach rumbling because she was so hungry he was hiding in her sock after all and i swear to merlin peter i better not find him in there again erica warned though kindly i dontwant warts or anything from that turtle i thought it was toads that gave you warts roxanne laughed well i know someone who i d like to give warts to sirius narrowed his eyes looking toward the slytherin table suspiciously malfoy been looking over here with that smug sneer on his face since we got here he probably just going on about my muggle heritage to his goons lily scoffed rolling her eyes in annoyance dontpay him any mind sirius he is so not worth your time and energy if he bothers you or any of my other friends he is sirius retorted back seriously folding his arms in displeasure if he doesntstop looking over here i going to box him in the face then i d like to see him look smug o good idea sirius get yourself suspended why dontyou roxanne snapped passively playing with her fork then again at least i wouldnthave to see you for awhile and have you bawl your eyes out every night i gone sirius replied shaking his head roughly i couldntdo that to my friends expect poor lily and erica to try and consol you every day your grief would probably drive them to insanity ha ha roxanne bit back sarcastically frowning when her friends began to snicker with sirius where dinner anyway i starving as if on cue dinner magically appeared on the empty golden platters before the group the table stacked with chicken and pear salad leek pudding sage and onion stuffing scones and for desert syrup ginger cake and coconut treacle tart to peter chagrin students immediately started spooning food onto their plates lapping up the divine english taste so lily sirius began between large mouthfuls of food feeling a little lonely lately i hope you re not implying you d like to fill my lonely void lily cocked an eyebrow smirking slightly after biting into a pear you know that could mean a few things lily remus chuckled getting swatted by erica who rolled her eyes along with lily and roxanne at the madly grinning boys at the table remus is right there sirius affirmed willing himself not to laugh with the girls glaring at him so venomously i only meant that i ve good news for you lily dumbledore told james he could return before christmas are you kidding lily sharply turned to sirius her eyes afire with excitement that s that great merlin knows how much homework he missed and now the quidditch team will o to hell with that that just great sirius it just not the same without that bugger around roxanne agreed happily glad for lily sake he d be returning soon when did he tell you sirius and why didnthe tell me lily suddenly shrieked angrily realizing they d barely spoken in a week that prat has got some nerve let it go lillykins i sure he ll make it up to you if you know what i mean sirius nudged lily and winked suggestively making her flush and stubbornly fold her arms he still an arrogant self centered i propose a toast erica cut off lily grinning at the flustered girl and raising her glass of pumpkin juice with the rest of her friends even lily to the return of the fourth marauder may his return bring us inspiration for new pranks against the slytherins sirius interjected jovially clinked his goblet against the others and downing his drink in one fowl sip as the six friends drowned there glasses a strange thing happened remus and lily dropped their glasses and began fiercely coughing both shutting their eyes as the attempted to breathe sirius cocked an eyebrow and gently patted lily who had clearly ingested her drink too quickly on the back while erica did the same for remus must have gone down the wrong pipe roxanne started looking at her two coughing friends skeptically are you guys ok lily and remus ceased coughing and looked up at eachother locking eyes lily felt oddly light headed and her skin prickled with goose bumps when she made eye contact with remus remus felt the same and gave lily an unsure little smile almost as if he felt awkward in the presence of his friends you two should slow it down next time it wasnta race erica smiled rubbing a silent remus back why arentyou eating hun remus broke out of his stupor and stared up at lily again intensity in his eyes i not hungry for food but i am hungry lily looked up her eyes slightly glasses over and blushed under remus stare what do you mean remus i think you know what i mean lily remus said slowly his eyes sweeping over her as if she were his pry he dropped erica hand err ha ha very funny remus roxanne laughed uneasily watching the exchange between the two and swapping a confused look with sirius erica looked somewhat scandalized i never noticed before but your eyes are a bluish grey that shirt you re wearing really makes them stand out lily smiled shyly oblivious to erica furious glare and roxanne and sirius abashed looked even peter looked up from his treacle curiously i can take it off if you like but of course only if you take off yours first remus grinned sexily reaching across the table and gently grabbing a giggling lily hand i wouldntprotest to seeing those exquisite breasts of yours and mooney take it easy sirius growled yanking lily hand out of remus and side glancing a scandalized erica if james heard you screw james i ve got to have lily now remus announced throatily reaching across the table grabbing lily arms with great force pulling her across the table knocking food and drink all over roxanne and erica and kissing her fiercely remus lily erica shrieked shrilly tears gathering in her eyes as her scream attracted the attention of the hall who whooped and cat called at the spectacle stop it lupin and evans are doing it gerald smith called out laughably standing up from his seat to get a better look and alerting all those students who hadntnoticed about the situation remus get off of her sirius black shouted angrily watching to his horror remus begin to unbutton the front of lily shirt thank merlin james wasntthere sirius crawled across the table and gripped remus around the waist attempting to pull him off lily but the two didntstop kissing and groping one another mcgonagall and surprisingly cyprian raced over from the staff table mcgonagall appearing livid stop this inappropriate behavior at once mcgonagall ordered though her orders fell on deaf ears mr lupin mrs evans would somebody help me pull them off of eachother sirius demanded in exasperation as he caught remus in a body lock taken aback when professor cyprian stepped in and pulled a struggling lily from remus let go of me lily demanded squirming in professor cyprian arms as the student population watched on with awe remus geroff me sirius remus hissed looking ready to punch sirius who had him tackled to the ground lily i need her get slughorn to check their goblets minerva professor cyprian suggested between struggling to hold the protesting redhead in his arms they ve probably been drugged with a love potion of some sort stop squirming lily professor slughorn waddled over when mcgonagall beckoned to him bits of food stuck in his moustache and carefully sniffed the contents of remus and lily goblets o my professor cyprian is right they have been drugged it a very complicated love potion brilliant really i smell a large quantity of lovage usually results in uncontrollable lust and irrational behavior professor slughorn chortled rubbing his belly i surprised ms evans didntrecognize its pungent aroma she the star of my potions class what do you suggest we do professor slughorn mcgonagall asked peering at the chubby man over her little glasses we cannot let these two along together i shudder to think she blushed when slughorn and cyprian gave her a questioning look well what is the anti serum let me see slughorn murmured opening the jacket part of his robe and revealing different colored potions in tiny vials tucked into his pockets perhaps a mixture of hmm ah ha essence of bezoar reverses poisons and since this particular potion is a mixture i sure it will do the trick hold onto those two tightly they make start to convulse as slughorn said once he forcibly poured the potion down lily and remus throats they began to convulse though remus convulsions were more violent after they became limp professor cyprian having to catch lily before she slipped reverting back to their old selves after approximately a minute what a show a boy from ravenclaw yelled loudly students laughing and shaking their heads in amusement encore encore that enough mr diggory mcgonagall turned toward the boy looking stern ten points from hufflepuff what are you doing sirius remus snapped opening his eyes due to the noise and finding himself tackled to the ground could you get off now that the thanks i get for stopping you making out with evans get off me sirius challenged mockingly getting up and giving remus a hand what are you talking about remus asked skeptically brushing dust off his jeans and noticing the three professors clustered around him err what going on here just then lily stirred waking up and finding her head buried in a warm chest wha o merlin lily tried jumping back from cyprian but he the good looking teacher held her back angling her toward him what going on lily whimpered in embarrassment her close proximity with cyprian making her blush profusely the whole school watching them with great interest i ll explain as soon as you button up the front of your shirt cyprian said out of the corner of his mouth looking down at lily then regretting doing for her ample cleavage was quite distracting turn around and the school might see more of you than necessary holy shit lily moaned in humiliation the professor seeing more than he should of any female student i so embarrassed how did this happen you and mr lupin were slipped some lust potion cyprian whispered kindly you were kissing and getting a little frisky before professor slughorn slipped you some antidote i made out with my best friend boyfriend lily sputtered fixing her shirt and appearing shocked i ve got to go apologize thank you for er any time professor cyprian said quickly then blushing retracted his comment i mean well you re a student so not anytime but uh no problem alright everyone back to your supper enough gawking professor mcgonagall called out to the crowds of students standing on tables to get a better look at remus and lily lily walked away from cyprian who she heard cursing to himself toward her recovering friends feeling dazed i made a professor blush merlin remus i i so sorry lily remus breathed seriously seeming flustered i swear to you i didntknow what i was doing in normal circumstances i would ve never it not your fault someone drugged us lily explained though she felt slightly embarrassed around him o erica i swear to you we didn t i know lily erica said though somewhat harshly lily didntblame her who could possibly enjoy the sight of their best friend and boyfriend kissing passionately i going up to the common room i ve lost my appetite erica wait remus called out following the redhead out of the great hall i want to leave too everybody is staring lily announced quietly picking up her purse and avoiding eye contact with all the rude students looking at her we ll come sirius said firmly the group getting up to leave sirius stared everyone down daring them to say anything who would drug you lily roxanne whispered fervently on the way out intensely relieved that a love potion was involved in the awkward situation that such a malicious prank especially after what happened to you at the ball someone who they happened to humiliate today sirius whispered to the group inwardly scolding himself when he turned to the slytherin table before their departure met with a familiar sneer malfoy author notes thanks for all the support readers and reviewers please continue to do so love yah pratty prongs princesse check out the website www flymetothemoonstory piczo com password welcome chapter 43 a prank and a broom closet ughhh just leave me alone erica common open the door remus lupin loudly trounced upon the girls dormitory door after dinner fidgeting with the door handle in exasperation you know i didntmean to kiss lily erica step aside remus i ll take care of this roxanne brushed remus away offering a half hearted smile and slipping into the room tell her i sorry ok remus pleaded contorting his neck in an uncomfortable position to get a glance of erica when roxanne opened the door tell her i ve got it remus go roxanne insisted her brunette locks flipping over her shoulder when she turned closing the door on a distraught remus hunched over in defeat remus slid down the girls dormitory stairs and dove face first into the plushy red couch in the common room lily hanging limply over the arm of a chair nearby and sirius lying on his back before the fire it was quiet only the sound of the crackling fire reverberating in the room for everyone was still down at dinner probably having a good laugh she wonttalk to me remus murmured into the fabric unmoving on the couch she ll come around by the morning sirius replied nonchalantly seemingly deep in thought as he scribbled on a small piece of parchment his nose scrunched in concentration fucking malfoy remus cursed clenching his fists and grunting into the couch i could kill him right now kill that no fun remy m boy sirius smirked stashing the letter in his pocket and manoeuvring into a sitting position we can do much better than that we re marauders arentwe what are you proposing we do remus removed his face from the couch and looked at sirius curiously his eyes scrutinizing sirius mischievous glow i proposing we get back at malfoy marauder style sirius grinned crawling toward the coffee table by the couch and inclining remus and lily who was staring up at the ceiling emotionlessly over but we need to move quickly we dontusually operate without james remus began uneasily we ll have lillykins replace him for tonight after all she has as much incentive to get back at malfoy as you do sirius announced proudly turning to a detached lily evans get your tiny behind over here so we can plan our prank against malfoy prank lily turned to the two boys crouched on the floor having snapped out of her stupor i a prefect sirius i couldntpossibly do you want to get back at malfoy or not remus demanded tiredly wrinkles creasing his forward when he frowned at the redhead i yes lily breathed angrily flopping off her chair and over to sirius and remus with a new determination what shall we do do you ms evans solemnly swear that tonight you will be up to no good sirius asked acutely the fire reflecting in his dark russet eyes as he spread a blank tattered piece of parchment over the coffee table yes i do lily did not flinch recognizing the enchanted map james had once showed her welcome to the group lily evans 6 30 30 minutes and counting careful you dontdrop that bucket of slugs lily hissed at remus a backpack slung over her shoulder as she remus and sirius headed down to the dungeons under james invisibility cloak their feet showed ever so often remus and sirius being quite tall i d like to see you try and carry this remus whispered back in annoyance grunting when sirius stepped on his foot oi watch out shut up i think someone coming sirius ordered the three pressing themselves against the stone wall when the bloody barron a severely frightening ghost dressed in blood stained medieval attire floating by suspiciously how much further until the slytherin common room lily whispered curiously anxiety bubbling in her stomach as the three continued through the labyrinth of corridors in the dungeons we re here lily looked around a blank damp wall lay before them in the shadowed corridor the nearby torches barely lighting the grimly stones there were no portraits or tapestries just the suit of armour sirius had previously mentioned remus wrenched the cloak off of the three mischievous sixth years and pocketed it requiring it for later without a word sirius pulled a dungbomb from his bag of tricks and placed it in the right hand of the suit of armour clamping the fingers over it carefully and whispering into the metal guard helmet he agreed let hurry sirius murmured smiling at the excitable look on lily face shall we pureblood remus announced to the stone wall a concealed door immediately sliding open and admitting in the three students wow lily breathed stepping through the archway and taking in the slytherin common room the room was very large and long having course stone walls and a low lying ceiling green lamps attached to the ceiling with chains lit the dreary room and a finely carved mantle flanked the simmering fire the furniture was emerald green and black the couch upholstered in silky velvet and the armchairs in smooth leather carved chairs and tables cluttered the space and around the border of the room was a stone snake with a protruding tongue in lily opinion it was cold and uncomfortable nothing like the gryffindor common room as lily and remus made their way toward the boys dormitories sirius quickly extracted a piece of parchment from his pants pocket and tacked it onto the slytherin events bulletin board it reading 7 o clock meeting in the common room all students not in attendance will be reprimanded professor slughorn see you two in ten dontforget the cloak sirius quietly called to lily and remus who nodded and slinked into an alcove covered by a tapestry near the entrance of the common room the coast is clear let hurry remus whispered to lily the two climbing the stairs to the dormitories and making their way down the corridors in search of malfoy room it here lily stopped in front of a dark mahogany door the initials lm imprinted on the wood along with those of his roommates remus silently opened the door and peaked in it was empty ushering lily inside remus closed the door and locked it with the colloportus spell lily observed the room with interest it was impeccably clean the walls devoid of quidditch posters or pictures of famous witches and barren this room doesnteven look lived in lily commented shrewdly grimacing at the lack of warmth and the sheer cleanliness of the place what d you say we mess it up a bit remus suggested lightly opening malfoy unlocked trunk and dumping a small container of flobberworms he stashed away in his bag in with his clothing textbooks and materials they ll eat holes in all of his clothing that disgusting lily snickered excitement giving her an adrenaline rush let head to the bathroom like the bedroom the bathroom was incredibly hygienic and cold the mirrors cleaned to perfection and the tiled floor spotless lily took her bag off her back and pulled out a few interesting items a bottle of powdered shrinking solution a bottle of exploding solution and a bar of frogspawn soap quick unscrew that shampoo bottle so i can get these slippery buggers in remus said referring to the bucket of flesh eating slugs he d appropriated from the garden near hagrid hut are you sure they wonthurt him lily inquired uneasily extracting a shampoo bottle from the shower clearing it out and putting the rest of the bottles away in the cabinet above the mirror i mean they are flesh eaters i made sure to only pick infant ones they ll gnaw more than bite remus assured lily smirking not that i d care via a funnel remus managed to get the slugs into the shampoo bottle lily poured three droplets of exploding solution in with the nasty creatures and immediately closed the lid of the bottle putting it back in the shower along with the bar of frogspawn soap shrinking solution and we re down lily said remus leaving all but one towel in the bathroom and lily carefully sprinkling the powder in the middle of it remus vigilantly handled the towel and hung it on the rack near the bathroom door now we wait remus said throwing the invisibility cloak over himself and lily and waiting by the door this should be good down in the slytherin common room students dressed in green robes filed through the entrance sirius hiding nearby 6 45 ten minutes and counting serves those two mudbloods right narcissa black a 6th year slytherin with beautiful blonde hair and silver eyes spat holding hands with her boyfriend lucius malfoy i ve never seen a more disgusting display at hogwarts this place is filled to the brim with muggle lovers it that fool dumbledore fault rodolphus lestrange agreed walking behind narcissa and lucius along with walden macnair and evan rosier he d accept a flobberworm if it showed magical potential quite bitter arentyou lestrange lucius commented lightly a triumphant smirk curved on his face if it werentfor the blood traitors and muggle trash how would we have fun lucius speaks true that one muggle evans she is pleasing to look at evan rosier added rodolphus barking in acknowledgement pity lupin didntmanage to get her shirt off you would touch that muggle filth narcissa demanded indignantly turning toward the animalistic men in utter disgust are you aware she dating james potter she a pretty thing but worthless use her for my own purposes and throw her away that what i d do rodolphus lestrange continued macnair and rosier smirking in agreement and it doesntsurprise me that a muggle lover like potter would date her despite his pureblood heritage look at his minister father i wonder how he ll react when he finds out his precious girlfriend and his half breed friend fondled one another in front of the school rosier tittered evilly grinning if only he was there to witness it if i lucky and i usually am he ll lash out irrationally and get himself suspended again lucius said smoothly coming upon the entrance to the slytherin common rooms perhaps black will get in on it too would that please you narcissa sirius is a blood traitor i care not what happens to him he was burned off the family tree by his mother when he ran away from home to the potters narcissa explained icily flipping her hair over her shoulder and grimacing he a disgrace to the black name i expected as much regulus will continue the black name he already displaying great potential lucius replied fidgeting with the sleeve over his left wrist but enough of this pure narcissa screamed and lucius baulked brown smelly liquid dripped from their hair and robes pooling in puddles around their feet rosier lestrange and macnair moved away from the two blonde haired slytherins the stench overwhelming lucius my hair my robes narcissa shrieked in despair helplessly looking to her boyfriend for direction i know narcissa rodolphus who threw the dungbomb lucius demanded in outrage his hair falling in clumps over his face and his emerald uniform damp this better not be some sad revenge attempt from lupin and black i didntsee anyone throw it macnair stated firmly covering his mouth and nose with his robes you two better head to the showers we ll meet you in the common room and figure out who behind this pathetic lucius roared whipping past narcissa without a word and marching toward his room slytherins inside the common room recoiling due to the smell out of my way lucius burst into his room and slammed the door shut ripping off his robes on the way to the bathroom and turning on the shower once the bathroom door was closed remus and lily who were cowering in a corner took off the invisibility cloak quick grab his wand lily hissed still partially covered by the cloak remus broke away from lily and ruffled through lucius soiled robes extracting a long regal wand with a snake handle remus pocketed the wand grinned and concealed himself under the cloak again he and lily making their way down the boys staircase to sirius hiding spot it was difficult to manoeuvre the common room was filled to the brim with students awaiting professor slughorn sirius who remained motionless in an alcove concealed by a tapestry flinched when he felt remus and lily invisible bodies beside him pocketing the cloak again remus and lily nodded to sirius affirming that they had carried out their part of the plan the notice on the board worked almost all the slytherins are here sirius whispered a large grin consuming most of his face i could smell malfoy coming in my brat of a cousin got hit as well narcissa remus scoffed suppressing laughter i bet she flipped would you two shut up lily giggled peeking behind the curtain i think the show is about to start remus take out the camera sirius wand at the ready look how prepared lillykins is sirius mocked comically flashing his pearly whites enjoying the mischievous life of a marauder more than you thought arentyou be sure to tell james i filling his role well lily whispered smiling despite herself who knows lily maybe you ll be able to tell him yourself sirius deviously winked causing lily to cock an eyebrow what look it malfoy alerted remus excitably just on time 7 o clock chimed on the majestic grandfather clock nestled in the corner of the common room a high pitched scream resounded in the slytherin common room alarming the students awaiting professor slughorn and causing them to turn toward the boys staircase on cue a towel clad figure bawled down the stairs into the crowd his blonde hair askew and miniscule though plump flesh eating slugs dotting his chest shoulders and head the crowd of petrified slytherins gawked and moved away from the crazed boy who was shouting orders out to his friends get these things off of me macnair lestrange get them off where my wand lucius narcissa black who was freshly showered yelped staring helplessly at her boyfriend who had a towel wrapped around his lower waist and leech like creatures all over his sopping wet body lucius my darling get them off they re ah biting me lucius screamed the slytherins surrounding him regarding him as if he were a madman not the most respected student in the house now remus and lily hissed simultaneously pulling back the curtain while the students were distracted accio towel sirius black commanded the towel covering lucius immediately ripped from his body and into sirius hands remus popped out from behind the curtain and snapped a photo he and sirius then diving back behind it lucius stood motionless forgetting the flesh eating slugs that were attacking his skin he turned bright red a color he only retained when angry in embarrassment and instantaneously covered his shrunken assets with his hands o my god a second year squealed in horror covering her eyes as if she d been burned look at the size of it a seventh year boy howled doubling over with the rest of his friends smaller than an infant s that disgusting another seventh year girl yelled rudely her and her older friends backing up and snickering at the disturbing sight do us all a favor and put some clothes on buddy lucius loudly cursing over the incessant laughter ran back up the stairs to his room bare buttocks exposed macnair lestrange and rosier awkwardly followed somewhat embarrassed to be associated with malfoy narcissa had fainted her friends were attempting to awaken her by lightly shaking her lily sirius and remus saw their chance they slipped by the hysterical crowd and out of the common room stumbling into the dungeon corridor short of breath remus chucked lucuis wand behind him callously they ran out of the dungeons not wanting to be caught by mr filch or the bloody baron and into the now dark and empty great hall the house elves had finished cleaning up ten minutes ago the tables having been cleared and the benches being devoid of people the enchanted ceiling was free of clouds the stars astonishingly visible against the navy blue sky firmly shutting the large oak doors behind them sirius pulled off the invisibility cloak and collapsed onto the ground along with remus and lily laughing manically o merlin i almost wet myself sirius barked loudly tears of mirth streaming down the sides of his face malfoy face and his o merlin shrinking solution on the towel genius remus continued boisterously his body shaking uncontrollably against the cold floor flawless just a flawless plan and we ve got pictures to prove it did you see the way the slugs reacted to the frogspawn soap lily demanded barely able to speak because of her bout of giggles they became ravenous and he cantchange because there are flobberworms eating away at all his clothes what i would have paid to see that bottle of slugs explode all over him sirius howled banging on the ground like a madman my cousin my cousin fainted haha just brilliant remus proclaimed catching his breath as he leaned upright against the hufflepuff table merlin i wish james could ve seen it who said i didntsee it remus the three friends froze realizing they werentalone in the great hall lily breath caught in the back of her throat when sirius ignited the end of his wand and pointed it toward the speaker who was nonchalantly lounging atop the hufflepuff table james potter there he was dressed in simple masculine muggle clothing his eyes glittering magically behind his wire spectacles he idly twirled his wand in his hand as if he d never been gone lily could hardly believe it was he real you re early mate sirius grinned from ear to ear his explosive laughter echoing in the great hall i wasntexpecting you for another couple of hours w what you were expecting james and you didntbother to tell me lily shrieked indignantly the shock melting off her face when she turned away from james and glared at sirius who sheepishly smiled back it was supposed to be a surprise sirius retorted happily so surprise why did you come early prongs remus beamed up at his friend from his spot on the floor when i got sirius little note i decided i couldntmiss such a juicy prank james said to remus though his warm eyes were trained on lily and only lily did you miss me lils lily felt her heart brutally pounding against her chest a feeling that had been absent since james initial departure she felt like jumping on him and screaming perhaps squeezing the life out of him to be sure he was real kissing his face off but she held back remembering sirius and remus were in the room and that they werentopen about their official relationship yet not really it was a welcome break lily drawled her face proving contrary displaying utter joy besides sirius and remus here have kept me busy james who if possible had become more handsome in a month got up off the hufflepuff table and closed the distance between he and lily roguishly grabbing her around the waist closing his eyes and crushing his lips against hers he wasntafraid to display his affection for the girl in front of his friends well apparently he missed you sirius whooped exchanging an animated look with remus as he watched his best friend take charge when do remus and i get our hello kisses do i have time to go and grab a breath mint you re a prat james murmured between kisses to sirius smiling when he pulled away from a breathless and flustered lily j j james lily mustered blushing profusely due to sirius and remus teasing ecstatic expressions and her and james close proximity would you two stop smiling already finally you two idiots have come out about your relationship took you long enough remus grinned stupidly james mirroring his ridiculous expression though it was hard to see in the dark so no i won t i ve already called godfather to your children sirius said matter o factly crossing his arms proudly you should name you re first son sirius i think or at least the middle name or if you two dontshut up she might break up with me james scorned sensibly squeezing lily hand and turning to her you wouldntdo that to me would you if dating you means putting up with these two every day i just might lily calmly joked smirking at sirius and remus appalled faces girls in this school would die to be around us i ll have you know you should be honoured and flattered that we even let you be in our presence every day sirius stressed remus nodding his head in fierce agreement they both broke into silly grins you two are full of it lily giggled feeling james eyes on her and looking up i still cantbelieve you re here what d you say we head up to the common room it getting cold in here not to mention creepy let go james agreed snapping up lily hand and following his two best friends out into the main foyer and up the enchanted stairs merlin it good to be back lily was asleep on the common room couch the fire in the grate slowly dying as the hours ticked by the marauders had headed off to their dormitory to catch up which lily had insisted upon james reluctant to leave her and lily had fallen asleep waiting for james to return it was quiet almost eerie all the gryffindor students having retired for bed there was a mirror dusty and dark mounted on the wall across from her she reached out to touch it whispering something under her breath but she felt nothing just a handful of air where was her reflection she stumbled forward falling through the hole in the wall i can t i can t i dontknow how i need help i cantbreathe i where are you i going to get to you dontworry i coming but i i cantsee open the door with these lily cried out startling herself awake and finding she had projected herself forward into the arms of a warm body her eyes momentarily remained closed cold sweat beading on her forehead she took a deep breath and opened her eyes finding james beside her on the couch silently staring down at her his chocolate orbs clouded with worry and his arms wrapped firmly around her what was it a nightmare james whispered softly the fire casting dancing shadows on his face as his eyes locked with lily confused almost fearful ones i dontknow a vision maybe lily sighed wearily taking comfort in james embrace and burying her head in his shoulder i have to show you something lily gently broke away from james and extracted a small flawless stone from her pocket placing it in the palm of his hand the aqua stone i retrieved it only a few days ago at the mermaid palace kanool seemed to be expecting me he called me daughter and brought me straight to the stone where did you go atlantis atlantis that was on the map we found up in the tower remember james whispered his eyes clouded in thought and worry it s real it all real james james eyes flashed in disbelief as he turned the stone over in his hand appearing distressed as he looked back up at lily this is why sirius and remus found you by the lake they told me you d almost drowned and you werentspeaking to them they didntknow what was happening to you i was worried out of my mind lily after that letter i begged dumbledore to let me back early but i didnttell him why now you dontknow how relieved i am what could i tell them james lily whispered gulping back tears of frustration and emotion i could tell they thought i was depressed because you were gone and because of derek i ve just spent so much time on finding the stones and the key chamber i was lonely i sorry i wasntthere for you james bore into lily his eyes looked intense even conflicted first that fucker derek mitchell now these stones i dontthink you know how much you ve already helped me lily whispered softly depositing the stone on the table and gently running a hand through james hair it scares me how much i missed you just having you here to talk to makes me feel better i sorry i didntwrite more often my sister and i were in belgium with my grandfather he quite ill with dragon pox james asserted lying down on the red couch and pulling lily comfortably on top of him her chin resting on his chest will he be alright lily scrunched up her nose her eyes shining with worry there no cure for dragon pox he ll be with us a bit longer james said bravely looking away momentarily there nothing that can be done and i accept that hopefully i ll see him on christmas break but enough of that tell me about the stone it strange actually lily began resting her head on james chest it all started when i got a note from you telling me to meet you down by the lake what james sat up looking confused i never sent you a note i gathered as much lily rolled her eyes then frowned i have my suspicions somebody else knows about the stones and is trying to guide me someone pretending to be me james muttered restlessly running his hands through his hair we dontknow who is sending you notes therefore we canttrust them it too dangerous from now on if i ever send you a letter i ll sign as prongs ok ok lily sighed rubbing her eyes despairingly i ll tell you the rest of the details tomorrow i tired then sleep i want to stay with you a little longer james agreed innocently smiling at lily who looked unconvinced just sleeping i swear you better behave yourself mr potter lily yawned finding a comfortable position beside james and letting him wrap his arms around her wake me in an hour so i can go up to my dorm ok james resting his chin on the top of lily head mumbled an incoherent yes and closed his eyes drowning in the smell of lily hair and letting the warmth of her body sooth him the second stone it affirmed lily task everything was beginning to piece together the map the stones the four founders of hogwarts for the first time in awhile james was scared not for himself but for lily james potter is back i heard a rumour dumbledore let him come back because he secretly cheering for the gryffindor quidditch team are he and evans official if they are i am going to cry myself to sleep every night until they break up she such a lucky bitch i think he gotten better looking since i saw him last well i think they re cute together lily feeling groggy sat up and opened her eyes the noise level around her seeming louder than normal however instead of waking up in her warm bed and seeing the slumbering figures of roxanne and erica a group of giggling fourth and fifth year girls met her tired stare w what lily stuttered stupidly looking around and realizing she and james had slept on the couch overnight james wake up ten more minutes he muttered tiredly refusing to open his eyes and pulling an embarrassed lily back down to his level seriously james wake up lily shook him roughly trapped between the couch and his body absolutely mortified that she and james were caught sleeping together in the common room more gryffindors walked over some of them james team mates only if you kiss me james demanded seductively slightly sitting up eyes still closed and trailing kisses down lily neck james lily hissed struggling against his strong arms what james moaned in annoyance opening his eyes and allowing lily to sit up he looked surprised and unimpressed to see they had an audience what are you lot of perverts doing staring at us scram before lily takes away house points james fan club immediately scurried away and out the portrait hole some giggling and commenting on how attractive james looked in the morning others horrified james believed them to be perverts lily visibly relaxed when the common room cleared out i cantbelieve we feel asleep down here what will people think lily panicked fixing her messy hair into a ponytail and untangling herself from james what was i thinking you were thinking merlin i d love to spend the night my good looking boyfriend that what you were thinking james stretched lazily rolling his eyes at lily flustered look you re not that good looking lily muttered in exasperation attempting to fix the front of her shirt which had mysteriously unbuttoned itself good lord look at the time i need to shower before classes mind if i shower with you james asked innocently running his hands along her back and the hem of her pants grinning because of her stubborn glare i think you ve caused enough trouble this morning lily announced getting up off james who tried to pull her back down and failed and heading toward the girls staircase i a marauder it what i do james protested jumping up off the couch after lily and grabbing her hand before she ascended you owe me a kiss ms evans go get changed and meet your friends for breakfast lily ordered not unkindly i ll see you in potions kiss james asked hopefully leaning forward and planting his hands on her smooth waist nope lily winked teasingly wiggling out of james grasp and running up the stairs see you in potions bitch james playfully yelled after her attempting to follow her but forgetting about the charm on the girls staircase relenting james bounded toward his dormitory in need of a cold shower sexual frustration nearly driving him to madness my girlfriend is such a witch james moaned tiredly plunking down next to sirius for breakfast fifteen minutes later his head resting on the gryffindor table i think that might ve been why she was asked to attend hogwarts sirius replied cleverly immensely glad to have him back potatoes james roxanne dewey nearly spit out her toast looking up from her copy of the daily prophet at the messy haired boy in disbelief when did you get here oh hi roxanne james smiled tiredly his eyes threatening to shut just last night and no potatoes thanks so what she done remus inquired casually yawning from across the table and shovelling pancakes onto his plate she being a stubborn little er well i d rather not talk about it amongst present company james stopped awkwardly realizing that venting about his sexual frustration in front of his girlfriend best mate wasntthe smartest idea girlfriend what girlfriend roxanne immediately piped up swallowing hard had james gotten a girlfriend in the little time he was gone you re daft sirius announced smirking at the clueless girl no i not roxanne lamely retorted narrowing her eyes at the handsome marauder how am i supposed to know james went and landed himself a girlfriend while he was gone you may know her james mused foolishly laughing when sirius snorted loudly she tall long red hair green eyes almost as good looking as me complete bitch though i dontbelieve you roxanne eyes went wide with the possibility of james and lily being an official couple i mean you didntask her did you before i was suspended james smirked at roxanne abashed look we figured we wouldntmention it until i returned you re kidding roxanne yelped her mouth open wide i cantbelieve she didnttell me i ve got to tell erica i ve oi potter the tall and broad gryffindor quidditch captain gerald smith interrupted clapping james hard on the back almost making him spit out his eggs i ll be scheduling an emergency quidditch meeting now that you re back oh and i heard about you and evans in the common room last night good on you you ve got it wrong smith james began in an aggravated tone what did you hear roxanne cut in harshly directing her question at the startled quidditch captain tell me just that er that potter and evans got a little er frisky last night in the common room smith began awkwardly wincing because of the death glare roxanne had bestowed upon him i going to go james potter you have been home from one night and you ve already seduced my best friend roxanne shrieked in outrage gryffindors sitting near the marauders turning their heads toward them in interest i cantbelieve silencio sirius black swiftly pointed his wand at roxanne throat and quieted her shaking his head at the girl do you need to announce it to the whole great hall you loudmouth roxanne was practically spitting fire at sirius her mouth moving but no words coming out she violently gestured for him to lift the spell but he shook his head not until you hear james out not that it any of your business sirius calmly replied stuffing a piece of toast in his mouth and looking away from roxanne james we fell asleep on the couch together last night that all james insisted though somewhat despondently we both awoke to half of gryffindor tower staring at us welcome home romeo sirius smacked james on the back grinning you ve already got hogwarts gossiping about you you ll give remus and me a nice break we were tiring of all the attention remus snorted loudly and roxanne smacked down on the table angrily gaining sirius attention she rolled her eyes when a group of giggling hufflepuff girls passed by the marauders and waved flirtatiously i dontknow roxanne i rather like you better when you re not speaking sirius began nonchalantly casually leaning forward on the table and smirking at her you re much more pleasant remus muttered the counter curse under his breath a second later providing roxanne with the ability of speech before she castrated sirius you are such a prick was the first sentence roxanne uttered gently massaging her throat with her hand and glaring at sirius see much more pleasant when she couldntspeak sirius threw up his hands in defeat frowning at remus thanks remus anytime he smiled back cheekily hey where is erica anyway james inquired curiously looking to remus i thought she was a nutcase when it came to breakfast like you remy boy uh i dontknow maybe she sick remus suggested awkwardly looking to roxanne for help roxanne er sleeping in i expect roxanne replied without blinking smiling despite james disbelieving look she was up quite late last night cry uh reading remus dropped his fork looking troubled sirius wanting to postpone telling james about dinner last night looked about the great hall for any means of conversation wha oi james remus look at malfoy this morning sirius joked loudly pointing to the blonde haired slytherin haha nobody will even sit beside him except his cronies and my dear cousin we ve got to get that film developed he looks miserable james added his deep laugh heard from the slytherin table that prank is going down in the books prank what prank roxanne inquired eagerly straining her neck to get a glimpse of malfoy i hope you got him good for what he did i mean you never told me malfoy did anything sirius james grin slightly faltered and his face became etched with curiosity what did he do to deserve your prank time for potions let go remus exclaimed over enthusiastically picking up his things in a mad dash and pulling roxanne to her feet we dontwant to be late we ve got a good five minutes remus james cocked an eyebrow at his friend strange behaviour anyway sirius what he right let go sirius bounded to his feet and joined roxanne and remus leaving james alone and intrigued at the gryffindor table he picked up his school things and followed his face contorted in confusion since when does sirius care about getting to class on time i know it not your fault and i being stupid but it was hard to watch erica explained to lily on the way to the dungeons hugging her potion textbook close to her chest i glad you got malfoy back though you better show me that picture when it developed i ll show you but it might scar you for life lily returned sticking out her tongue in disgust how narcissa finds him attractive i ll never know does james know yet about the incident erica asked carefully wondering if he was handling it as well as she was if he beats up remus i coming after you for letting him no not yet what makes you think james could take remus he brilliant at defence against the dark arts lily joked brightly walking into the bustling potions classroom and taking a seat at the front with erica no seats available near the marauders or roxanne and i dontthink james with overreact oi redheads sirius black called flamboyantly from across the room garnering lily and erica attention along with half of the class by waving about his hands way to sit with us way to save us seats black lily retorted teasingly catching james eye and smiling he returned her smile with a seductive grin good morning class professor slughorn cut in as he entered the dungeon balancing books on his rotund belly and sporting a cheery smile let get right to the lesson shall we i have a good friend of mine coming round for tea maybe you ve heard of her gwenog jones of the holyhead harpies always spoiling me with free quidditch tickets so i dontwant to be late puddlemere united all the way eh jamie sirius eagerly nudged james who was daydreaming whilst staring at the back of lily head uh oh what are you dreaming of eh something kinky with your little mugglebumpkin shut up james quietly demanded glaring at sirius who had his fist stuffed in his mouth to keep from laughing as a blush crept onto his cheeks you re a prat mr potter slughorn called out turning around from the blackboard which had chalk independently writing the instructions for the potion they would be brewing that class on it i thrilled to have you back but i do require you to listen as opposed to talk james caught lily as well as the rest of the class looking at him curiously he cleared his throat and plastered on a charming smile i do apologize professor sirius and i just couldntcontain our excitement about gwenog jones we re big fans you see no they re not remus whispered out of the side of his mouth to peter who snorted is that right well i sure i can arrange a meeting between you and ol gwenog mr potter perhaps even your father the minister can attend slughorn enthusiastically suggested the prospect of befriending the minister of magic by favouring his son a juicy opportunity but we shall discuss that more later back to the instructions for the befuddlement draught lily cocked an eyebrow james mouthed the words i am going to kill you to sirius who snickered and flippantly opened his textbook uninterested in listening like usual the class partnered up after slughorn lesson and gathered the ingredients scurvy grass lovage and sneezewort for their next potion the befuddlement draught they were allotted an hour to finish slughorn taking a sample of each potion at the end of class and bequeathing grades back there in the great hall you never told me what malfoy did james casually said to sirius after spending half an hour chopping sneezewort looking up from his task and scrutinizing his best friend who appeared uncomfortable what are you hiding from me black it nothing really just forget i even mentioned it sirius replied unflappably awkwardly coughing and avoiding eye contact with james pass me that knife would ya nice try tell me james demanded shortly narrowing his eyes behind his glasses and digging the silver knife sirius requested into the chopping board sirius ok ok sirius threw up his hands in defeat looking slightly scared of his best friend rather what his best friend might do when he found out about lily and remus it ridiculous really remus and er lily had a bit of a run in with malfoy yesterday they ended up cursing him so naturally he wanted revenge what did he do james whispered brusquely his eyes becoming terse looking well sirius looked uneasy and gulped he slipped this love potion into lily and remus goblets at dinner and they er they kind of made out in front of the school what james roared loudly his eyes practically bursting from his skull when he accidentally knocked over the potion he and sirius had been working on alarming those around him what do you mean made out would you keep it down sirius hissed remus looking up from his potion at james and sirius in mild interest no need to lose your head they didntmean to remus bloody lupin made out with my girlfriend james spat in disbelief snapping his head to where remus was sitting watching is it true what remus asked blankly his jaw slackening you and lily in front of the whole school james demanded angrily his face steadily growing red those sitting around the marauders stopped brewing their potions to witness the exchange o that remus pulled awkwardly at his collar looking to sirius for support we didntmean to i would ve never erica is giving me hell like it my fault i mean i not even that aggressive with erica and aggressive james spat hoarsely subconsciously grinding his teeth as he regarded his cowering friend what did they do sirius er just kissed uh passionately i guess and he almost had her shirt off sirius began remus opening his mouth in horror behind james back make it worst why dont you almost had her shirt off james spun around and looked close to hitting remus you ve bloody gone further with lily than eve n i have you fucking i didntknow what i was doing i i i remus stuttered in panic his friend looking close to having a nervous breakdown i swear james i james leapt up from his seat and stormed across the classroom in lily direction leaving sirius peter and remus in his wake of disbelief you are a moron remus angrily punched sirius on the arm making him recoil in childish pain telling him i almost had her shirt off way to fan the fire sirius they ve only got the first base that interesting sirius mulled indifferently balancing his chin on his hand as he ignored remus wanker remus sighed turning around and banging his head on his desk meanwhile lily and erica were making progress on their potion the consistency being correct and the colour a shimmering yellow lily cleaned off her lovage stained hands and smiled at their product i bet we ll earn at least an e on this one lily smiled optimistically letting her hair loose out of her ponytail and closing her advanced potions textbook i partnering up with you more often roxanne and i never manage to procure anything that doesntresemble sludge erica laughed bending over the potion and taking a whiff it even smells correct it does look a little off though lily commented scrunching up her nose as she observed the simmering surface it looks more gold than yellow dontyou think uh oh dontworry we ll still do great lily replied smartly looking up at erica who was distractedly looking over her shoulder what remember how you said you didntthink james would overreact erica mumbled still looking over lily shoulder in distaste yeah lily answered casually giving the befuddlement potion another stir while absentmindedly scribbling a note on a long piece of parchment i think you might be wrong erica frowned crossing her arms and sighing wha you and i are taking a walk james potter said through gritted teeth coming up behind lily and grabbing her arm causing her to drop her spoon into the cauldron of bubbling potion before her in surprise professor slughorn lily and i need to step out for a moment the class turned to look at the couple including professor slughorn remus groaned in the back uh yes of course mr potter slughorn barked merrily though he looked perplexed not too long now i assuming this is to do with prefect or quidditch business certainly we wonttake long professor james plastered a fake smile on his face and dragged lily out of the classroom without another word many gryffindors and slytherins raising eyebrows due to their departure what are you doing lily yelped when james wordlessly dragged her up to the first floor and down a familiar hallway where the lavatories were located james potter i not supposed to be in here james james promptly pulled lily into the boys lavatory scaring two first years out due to the sight of him an infamous marauder and a female james picked lily up around the waist despite her protests and sat her atop one of the sinks against the wall so that their eyes were at the same level why didntyou tell me about you and lupin james narrowed his brown eyes at his girlfriend his hands pressed against the wall around her preventing her escape you didntthink i was going to find out dontyou dare do that again james potter lily breathed angrily her emerald orbs flashing dangerously i not some plaything of yours that you can drag around whenever you feel like it did you hear a word i just said james inquired sceptically though his tone considerably softened why didntyou tell me lily i was going to tell you later we haventexactly had a lot of time to talk lily said irritably crossing her arms and stubbornly looking away from james you didnthave to drag me halfway across the school look i sorry about that james attempted apologetically his eyes sincere as he gently turned lily face towards his again i let my temper get out of hand not to mention jealousy jealousy you have nothing to be jealous about lily frowned ruefully at james her anger slightly dissipating as she slide her arms around his neck and let him hold on to the sides of her legs remus and i hadntany idea what we were doing because of that jerk malfoy so so you didn t like it james asked awkwardly colour rising in his cheeks as he tentatively looked for lily reaction i mean sirius said you re crazy last time i checked i was dating you not remus lily broke into a teasing smile rolling her eyes when james visibly relaxed shall i let you in on a little secret you better james pointed out immediately dropping the subject as his eyes flashed seductively and he carefully parted lily legs allowing him closer access to her torso well lily eyelashes fluttered as she arched her neck and moved to the side of the sink mischievously smirking at james as her hand grasped the spout of the sink behind her i just wanted to tell you that you are very well it a little embarrassing tell me james demanded huskily moving closer to lily his lips almost touching hers you re very sexy when wet lily shrieked playfully turning on the water in the sink and covering the tap with her hand so that the water gushed straight into james face causing him to recoil and fall back on his hands water droplets beading on his glasses lily james sputtered loudly over her impish cackling his messy hair sticking to his face and his uniform soaked i going to get you for that lily shrieked playfully and went barrelling out of the boys bathroom a very wet james potter hot on her tail tell me im sexier than remus tell me you witch never lily humorously yelled back screaming girlishly when james caught up to her and dragged her into a broom closet being james potter girlfriend wasnt so bad so far author notes i updated ridiculously fast this time you ve got to admit i supposed to be studying for five university exams right now but instead i updated just for you lot haha please review it would make me feel a lot better about postponing studying pratty prongs princesse disclaimer all recognizable characters and places are property of the awesome j k rowling and i definitely do not own them j k rowling is brilliant and all harry potter characters and settings mentioned are hers chapter 5 the secret box lily sat on her bed gazing out the window at the perfect weather wishing that roxanne would return so she wouldnthave to endure him james looked to be having the time of his life peering at photos on lily corkboard and asking her who some of the people were he seemed to be put out for about 5 minutes when he saw the picture of lily and her first boyfriend nathan he then resumed to playing with her owl petree who was a small ball of feathers he was a very excitable bird and it didnthelp when james fed him a chocolate frog at that very moment lily let out a shrill scream it just a chocolate frog i sorry i thought started james hysterically in fear lily might cause him bodily pain no no spider lily screeched pointing to the ceiling above her james started walking toward her to kill it when he tripped on a loss floorboard that was jutting out he landed on top of lily with an ommpphh potter would you please get off of me lily said shrilly trying to untangle her limbs from his why i am quite comfortable i james started he was silenced by her deathly glare and got up off of her immediately he quickly killed the spider and lily became calm again so i am going to make an observation here correct me if i wrong but from that loud scream i am going to take an educated guess and say you have a fear of spiders james said cocking an eyebrow you could have just asked me if i had a fear of spiders smart ass lily muttered still a bit frazzled well yes but you know me said james flashing a charming smile yes unfortunately i do didntknow you were incredibly graceful however lily said sarcastically rubbing her stomach where she had been elbowed well maybe if your house was built properly these little accidents wouldnthappen cantsay i mind however said james a smirk on his handsome face lily rolled her eyes and dropped to the ground where the loss floorboard was jutting out of place james dropped down beside her and tried to fit the floorboard back in like a puzzle piece however he did the very opposite the floorboard became loose and when he pulled back it came with him oops james said guiltily looking a little uncomfortable good one james said lily voice dripping with sarcasm why is your floor hollow james inquired he put his hand into the opening and pulled out a dusty wooden box lily looked quite surprised with james discovery lily stared at the box a long time wracking her brains to figure what it was it looked vaguely familiar she even remembered putting it there when she was ten you know lily this will sound strange but that box looks familiar said james an uneasy expression apparent on his face i i dontknow what in it i remember putting it there but nothing before that said lily looking beyond confused strange said james his face looking distant like he too was trying to remember something forgotten they tried to pry the box open but it would not budge just then lily father lightly knocked on the door telling the two teenagers that dumbledore had arrived and was patiently waiting for them lily and james abandoned the box and descended the stairs together this time professor dumbledore headmaster of hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry was standing at the door he was a wise looking man with a long silvery beard that almost touched the floor petunia appeared speechless as she took in his appearance but both mrs mr evans welcomed him warmly hello lily james ready to head to the ministry dumbledore asked politely a small smile playing on his face yes sir both said simultaneously they frowned at eachother lily quickly pecked her mother and father on the cheek and with their best wishes left the house with the other two wizards dumbledore had arranged for a car to take the three of them to the ministry thinking non magical travel would leave a good impression on the jury how has your summer been ms evans eventful i sure asked dumbledore a twinkle in his eye good and not eventful until quite recently i afraid lily replied sheepishly james and lily entered the car which had a magically enlarged inside which could accommodate about 10 people while dumbledore remained outside of the car arentyou coming professor asked james curiously one moment i think there are still some loss ends to tie up inside isntthat right ms evans dumbledore inquired in amusement dumbledore entered the house once more taking only a moment and returned announcing that he had successfully removed the caiman from petunia bedroom and that she could return to sleeping there he then joined lily and james in the car before it sped off to ministry enduring the hearing would be nerve racking but one question remained on lily and james

j k rowling is brilliant and all harry potter characters and settings mentioned are hers chapter 6 the creature room the three occupants of the car remained quite silent for most of the trip to the ministry except when james decided to take advantage of some of the free firewiskey in the car fridge lily had screamed at him for underage drinking james had protested and dumbledore had simply chosen to laugh as the car came to an abrupt stop dumbledore james and lily climbed out onto a run down street with one disused telephone booth adorning the pavement lily looked around curiously thinking the driver had mistakenly dropped them off at an incorrect location did the driver make a mistake i dontsee any building looking even remotely like a ministry lily asked in mystification slightly creeped out by the dodgy alleyway aw my little muggle bumpkin you have never been to the ministry before have you said james grinning from ear to ear lily seethed isntthat just adorable before lily could respond dumbledore had ushered them both into the cramped phone booth lily was pushed against james and he had an oddly happy look on his face dumbledore pressed a few choice numbers on the phone and a cool voice came over the receiver welcome to the ministry of magic please state you name and the reason for your visit since james was the closest to the receiver he spoke albus dumbledore here escorting james potter and lily evans both attending a hearing three badges appeared where muggles would collect change showing their names and the reason they were at the ministry the bottom of the booth started to descend into the ground making lily a tad nervous as she was claustrophobic and eventually deposited the three occupants into the atrium of the ministry the ministry was quite large very clean and full to the brim with wizards and witches running around trying to get things done dumbledore and james did not seem as impressed as lily she knew they had both been there before now listen you two we still have 45 minutes until the hearing and i need to have a little word with the minister of magic he said james smiled so james why dontyou show lily around be back in the atrium in 40 minutes dumbledore directed kindly with a swish of his cloak he had disappeared into the next hallway hey lily i know a place you would love to see exclaimed james grabbing lily hand and pulling her in the opposite direction lily grudgingly allowed james to pull her into a lift she thought he was probably going to take her to examine quidditch brooms or something stupid like that he like the rest of the males in the magical community was obsessed with quidditch james was even on the gryffindor quidditch team at hogwarts another reason witches swooned over him lily didntobsess about the sport like the rest of the world although she did enjoy watching gryffindor play they got off the lift on a random floor lily wasntpaying attention and walked down a long hallway here the door lillykins james announced opening a large wooden door at the back of the hallway lily peeked her head in and was quite surprised at what she found inside were many large cages holding assortments of different magical creatures crates and boxes were stacked all the way to the tall ceiling some of the boxes even rattling the smell was nothing to celebrate but lily didntmind she raced over to one cage finding inside a baby niffler he was curled up into a ball and had a little pink nose he reminded lily of a mole hi there little guy arentyou sweet she cooed in delight lily loved animals in general magical or not one of her favourite classes was care of magical creatures as she got to learn and interact with all sorts of creatures james how did you know i would want to come here lily asked curiously well i knew you liked animals you are always so enthusiastic in care of magical creatures so i thought you might like it here said james casually trying to come off like anybody with a brain would have known that about her lily blushed and quickly averted eye contact with james she started examining all the cages and fussing over the adorable creatures inside james leaned up against the door with a small smile on his face content on just watching lily when lily noticed this james quickly made it seem like he too had been looking at the animals james began to make his way over to lily until once again he tripped oh shi ouch james howled half in pain and half in aggravation he had gone head first into some wooden crates accidentally punching a hole in one of the crates that happened to be rattling james got up and brushed himself off looking red in the face from embarrassment how can someone with your quidditch skills possibly be so clumsy demanded lily struggling to hold back her laughter instead of james looking insulted he looked positively gleeful so you think i good at quidditch then evans asked james flashing a charming smile that would make a girl knees give out well i i james what is that on your head lily asked looking surprised and alarmed dontchange the subject evans you i sorry did you say there was something on my head a little white mouse with a bright yellow lightning shaped tail was casually singing the abc atop james potter messy black head dontpanic i will get it off lily said tentatively bend down a bit you re too tall as she removed the singing creature from atop james head she received a lovely jolt from its tail ouch that thing electrocuted me she yelped outraged let me see your hand lily let me see james requested irritably struggling to examine her hand as she kept pulling it away would you stop wriggling bugger off i fine besides we have more important things to worry about and what would that be demanded james rolling his eyes look behind you and find out whispered lily her eyes wide with fear it seemed that the box james had accidentally punched a hole in held not one mousy creature but a couple hundred every single one stared at lily and james maliciously their tails emitting tiny sparks er seems they dontappreciate being interrupted when singing said james uneasily lily and james slowly made their way to some crates hoping to climb atop them for safety the creatures watched their every move alright dontmake any loud movements it might cause them to react lily said carefully climbing the boxes james had already made his way atop them lily started climbing when she heard a loud crunch beneath her her foot had gone through one of the boxes this was enough for the creatures to charge at her james she screamed james grabbed her hand and pulled her up to where he was sitting just as the mousy creatures reached her however lily did not stop squirming once she made it to safety lily wha james there is one down my shirt she screamed pulling at her blouse and revealing a substantial amount of cleavage that made james eyes nearly pop out of his head i ll get it keep your hands to yourself lily yelled angrily lily finally extracted the angry mouse from her skirt and threw it down towards the other mice who were trying to find a way up to them both the room became overcrowded with the little pests who were conveniently blocking the exit so james said casually still trying to regulate the images of lily chest filling his mind now who is the clumsy one lily gave him an angry glare before replying you re the one who punched a hole through the bloody crate in the first place yes but i made up for that by saving you from the dreaded creatures i am a hero james announced triumphantly a grin on his face lily rolled her eyes but couldnthelp but chuckle i in the ministry of magic with james potter surrounded by evil lightening mice what a nightmare now what do we do i dontplan on running for the door anytime soon said lily dontworry we can just immobilize them here james brandished his wand but before he cast the spell it was snatched away from him james i think one hearing is enough for the week dontyou enough illegal magic lily retorted regarding him as if he were insane forgot about that oh lily you do care james said comically putting on a lovey dovey voice for laughs before he could wrap her in a hug she stopped him i not afraid to push you into the pit of doom down there so donttry anything warned lily just then a portly looking man with a long black beard and piercing eyes entered the room what the bloody hell immobulus he yelled authoritatively the mousy creatures instantly froze and the man quickly packaged them back in the crate with a spell making sure to fix the large hole hey maxwell how are things james asked casually from the crate tower they were on james is that you should have known always causing trouble come down here and bring your lady friend wontyah said maxwell grinning stupidly james explained to lily as they descended the crate tower that maxwell and his father were co workers lily wondered what department of the ministry james father worked in once they got down maxwell stared at lily making her quite uneasy there was something about him she didntlike this your girlfriend james what are you two doing in here anyway he asked nudging james mischievously lily looked away from the two glaring daggers at the floor yah she is and we are james began before he was interrupted no sir he is not my boyfriend and we both have a hearing to attend today said lily brusquely oh i see well you two better be off then got some cleaning up to do in here apparently james and lily quickly apologized for the mess and left the creature room so where do you want to go next asked james grinning lily just rolled her eyes and continued following him hoping they wouldntrun into anymore trouble fat chance lily thought trying not to smile v author notes v please continue to read and review disclaimer all recognizable characters and places are property of the awesome j k rowling and i definitely do not own them j k rowling is brilliant and all harry potter characters and settings mentioned are hers chapter 7 like father like son lily had decided it unwise to follow james into anymore mysterious rooms in the ministry therefore they were sitting comfortably in the ministry caf sipping coffee and munching on muffins actually munching wasnta great description of what james was doing more like inhaling lily watched him with a disgusted look on her face why do guys eat food like it will self destruct if they donteat it fast enough what the rush well why do girls always have to go to the bathroom in pairs james countered continuing to scarp down chunks of pastry why do guys only ever want to talk about quidditch lily retorted why do girls obsess about split ends and what the merlin are spilt ends james said his face screwed up in confusion we do not lily insisted ha i win you answered one of the questions james said a triumphant smile adorning his handsome face and for the record quidditch is not the only thing guys talk about he added a suggestive wink before lily could call him disgusting or disturbing she glanced at her watch oh my god you realize we are 2 minute late lily shrieked in a panic both lily and james jumped up from the table james insisting on paying the bill before lily could throw a sickle on the table and ran at top speeds toward the atrium james was a faster runner than lily and grabbed her hand in order to keep her caught up with him they dodged many disgruntled looking people a few of whom decided to yell a few choice words at them james also received a few greetings from people his father worked with they arrived in the atrium and upon seeing dumbledore raced towards him glad to see the two of you decided to arrive on time dumbledore said chuckling james and lily were nearly doubled over in exhaustion we must be off to the courtrooms now james your hearing is first the three wizards took a lift down to the bottom floor the department of mysteries where the courtrooms were located a chill ran down lily spine the dark emotionless hallways seemingly eerie the largest courtroom was at the end of the hall but thankfully the courtroom lily and james would appear in was smaller and gave off a warmer feel good luck james if you are expelled from hogwarts i promise i wontbe too disappointed lily said teasing i glad your nerves haventovertaken your charming personality james smiled rolling his eyes if i come back from that courtroom in tears i expect you to comfort me miss evans and with that last sentiment james and dumbledore entered the courtroom lily felt oddly along once james left the stone hallway was very cold and did not give off a pleasant air cobwebs adorned the corners and a few mouse holes could be found in the walls as long as they donthave lightning bolt tales lily thought lily heard footsteps nearing and voices speaking in rapid hushed tones for some reason she didntwant to be found alone in the foreboding place and slide into a dark corner unfortunately for lily the two people stopped in front of the courtroom doors continuing their discussion she couldnthelp but eavesdrop if anyone finds either of us down here they will be suspicious turn back and continue your search at night said one voice belonging to a woman he sent me to find it and i plan to he is already losing patience with me i must use all the time i have said the second voice belonging to a man i have heard that voice before lily thought to herself the doors to the courtroom began to open and the two people scurried away into another hallway lily came out of her hiding place visibly shaken james suddenly emerged from the courtroom looking happy he had obviously gotten off lily are you alright dontworry about the hearing i got off for transfiguring my parents one of which is fairly important to the ministry all you did was transfigure a pair of shoes lily james now looked worried for lily still seemed out of it oh you got off so much for the celebration party i was planning i better go in then lily said in a detached voice her heart suddenly beating quickly in her chest good luck lily donteven worry i will personally beat up the minister if he expels you james said seriously trying to cheer lily up he is actually sort of sweet sometimes she quickly shoved that thought out of her mind as she entered the courtroom though she couldnthelp but wonder about the conversation she overheard only moments ago the courtroom was small and seated 10 jurors some offered lily reassuring smiles while others remained neutral the courtroom was dark and dank worse than the hallway making her wonder if it had once been a dungeon how inviting lily took a seat on a wooden chair dumbledore had conjured up for her and prepared to hear questions fired at her alright then let us begin said ophelia bones a tall women with brown hair that was cropped to her shoulders are you lily evans yes i am lily replied nervously clearing her throat you have been charged under the restriction of underage wizardry law are you aware of this yes you transfigured a pair of boots into a caiman is that correct bones asked briskly cocking her eyebrow as she read the strange charge amazing one juror whispered to another bones shot them a warning look yes that is correct but i intended it to be a crocodile lily blushed gaining a few chuckles from the jury you fully admit to what you have done yes at the time i was very angry and i wasntthinking straight so i made a bad decision i am truly sorry about the whole ordeal lily said earnestly trying to sound remorseful and what made you angry enough to set a caiman on your sister ms evans she dumped a pitcher full of orange juice over my head and ruined my favourite blouse lily said starting to tear at the memory it was burberry too how awful cried a women juror she was obviously a fashion fanatic like lily alright i think that is all the information we need the minister and jurors will discuss the verdict now said ms bones curtly turning to face the rest of the jurors it was then when lily noticed the newly instated minister for magic the campaign for minister for magic had occurred over the summer but as lily had not bought a subscription to the daily prophet and had barely corresponded with roxanne and erica she d never actually heard who had won the minister had dark messy hair and wore thick conservative glasses though she was much younger lily couldnthelp but think he was an extremely handsome man now i see why james went into the hearing so confident lily whispered to dumbledore dumbledore gave lily a knowing smile just before the minister stood up and addressed her alright ms evans the jury and i have discussed your case and most of us having brothers and sisters ourselves understand that sibling rivalry can make one do things they might regret therefore we are letting you off with a warning ms evans and we hope next time you will use better judgement when dealing with your sister filibuster fireworks do the trick for me with a wink mr potter the new minister of magic dismissed lily james was pacing outside when lily and dumbledore exited the courtroom and upon seeing lily smiling face visibly relaxed imagine threatening to beat up your own father lily exclaimed in mock outrage laughing at james mischievous grin i told him last night if he expelled you i d turn him back into a walrus said james laughing i d watch out potter apparently your dad is good with fireworks lily giggled a wry smile on her face what james looked at the redhead confusedly like father like son v author notes v please continue to read and review disclaimer all recognizable characters and places

before lily would be returning to hogwarts and the house was in shambles lily mother had been doing laundry all day and was in a collapsed heap on the living room sofa petunia had resorted to locking herself in her room in fear that lily would transfigure another one of her possessions into a dangerous reptile lily had been quite relieved when she got off for performing illegal magic and her parents were as well petunia had a fit claiming lily tried to murder her and was a high risk case to re offend i wontargue that lily thought still cross with her elder sister petunia had done her best to make the remainder of lily summer hell constantly hurling insults at her and calling her names like freak and dodo brains she couldnthelp but laugh at the last one lily was currently running around the house trying to pack unfortunately for the redhead she ran into her dear sister petunia looked at her in distaste sneering down at the black t shirt she d been clutching i dontknow what you think you are doing with that shirt lily you will never fit into it now with all the weight you ve gained this coming from the girl who has to stuff her bra with sacks of potatoes in order to fit into her shirts just because i am not a boney horse doesntmean i obese lily retorted sharply rolling her eyes at her stupid sister just trying to help you lily darling you will never score a boyfriend at the weight you re at now laughed petunia an evil smile playing on her pursed lips did i mention vernon is taking me to a fancy restaurant tomorrow evening she loved to brag about her boyfriend vernon dursley and about the fact lily was single please i wouldntbe bragging about that tub of lard you call a boyfriend you call me fat have vernon dursley takes up the entire side of our effin kitchen table lily pronounced beginning to laugh apparently insulting petunia boyfriend had been crossing the line with her petunia launched her lanky body at lily with a scream and the two sisters ended up in a full blown cat fight how dare you insult ouch petunia gasped lily had punched petunia in the nose which now had blood streaming out of it take that lovely face out to dinner tomorrow night i sure everyone will admire your swollen purple nose lily screamed vengefully pushing petunia off of her and heading for her bedroom lily shut the door with a slam still hearing her sister whimpering she would most definitely get a good talking to from her parents if it were anyone else lily would feel badly for her actions but she and her sister were practically enemies when lily received her invitation to hogwarts petunia changed her attitude toward lily completely they were close when they were young playing like sisters do and sharing clothes and toys when petunia turned on her for being a witch she was hurt deeply lily sat on her bed wishing the day would end she missed her best friends roxanne and erica her true sisters though lily was quite a popular girl in school she chose not to have too many close friends just then a gray owl flew into lily open bedroom window depositing a letter on her writing desk hey dudders looks like roxi read my mind said lily excitably stroking the silly owl with care dudders was roxanne pet owl though it was quite ugly and always appeared to be grumpy lily had become quite fond of the creature lily quickly opened the delivered letter excited to be hearing from her best friend hey lily how has your summer been with your brat of a sister horrible i am sure not even worth asking you i am so sorry you couldntcome stay with my family but we were vacationing so what have you been up to ha i already know the answer to that guess whom i got a letter from sirius bloody black i dontknow where he gets off sending me letters he knows i am not fond of him i mean how many times does a girl have to hex a guy before she gets her point across anyway he told me you and james had a hearing why did you not inform me you could have been expelled and i would have had a heart attack what would erica james and i do without you sorry had to say james you know he loves you so you didntlike make out with james or anything did you stupid question really i know you despise him but he good looking let be serious and by the way if you had been expelled i would have thrown out the plushy i bought you not even joking see you on the express tomorrow you better fill me in on the juicy details missy roxanne if you dontfill me in your plushy will be forcibly thrown out the train window p s could you possibly give dudders some food he is looking a bit peaky lately lily put the letter down laughing roxanne always made her laugh when the two of them were together it was impossible to stop them from giggling erica further added to the impossibility lily re read the letter and starting talking to dudders like he was her confidant you know dudders i not sure that i despise james anymore i mean it not like we are best friends but i dunno the hate part of the equation is kind of gone now said lily thoughtfully who replied dudders in an abnormally low hoot a grumpy look on his face lily laughed why am i pouring my heart out to a bloody bird lily had to admit it had been fun at the ministry although james could be a bloody klutz sometimes she was sure that other than his marauder pals no one had seen that side of him he flirted with her and often embarrassed her but she didntmind it as much as she did the previous years does he really care for me just then petunia stuck her evil purple face into lily bedroom i ll have you know that mom and dad will punish you for this yelled petunia an icepack held up to her snout with lightening speed lily slammed the door back on petunia face and propped a chair up against the door handle so she couldntburst in again owwww my nose petunia screamed running down the stairs towards her parents again when will people learn not to mess with redheads lily sighed smirking

what the bloody hell am i waking up at 9 a m for she mumbled incoherently hitting the snooze button and rolling over in bed ten minutes later lily mother came into her bedroom ushering her to wake up get up honey lily mother said before exiting her bedroom has the whole bloody house gone mad i never get up at nine lily owl petree was twittering about in his cage practically bouncing off the walls with excitement shu up mumble stupid pigeon lily murmured sleepily throwing a book at the cage petree looked quite shocked as much as a bird could look shocked but continued to be noisy another owl appeared at lily open window and fluttered in this owl was a barn owl and one of lily worst enemies the owl looked at lily expecting her to take the letter from its talons when she didntmove clearly still fast asleep the owl took drastic measures flying onto lily head and starting to stomp on her face stomp stomp stomp oswald you malicious bird get off of my face lily shrieked shrilly as if someone were attempting to murder her oswald flew off her face and landed on her writing desk he was owned by lily other good friend erica and erica always got a laugh out of oswald bothering lily lily got up and stared oswald down for about a minute in her opinion the bird should be shot however as that would make erica cry lily had never attempted it lily finally submitted and took the letter from oswald talons with a triumphant look he flew off into the morning sunny glow what in the name of merlin is erica doing sending me letters at 9 o clock in the bloody morning lily growled tiredly ripping the envelop away and reading the short note hey lily just wanted to say good morning and i cantwait to see you and roxi on the express at 11 make sure you arentlate erica p s i hope oswald didntcause you massive bodily harm a small amount of harm is acceptable however lily threw the note on her dresser and plopped back into bed she lay motionless for about a minute before it dawned on her oh my bloody hell i am going to hogwarts today she screamed the entire house and possibly entire street waking up because of her bellows and subsequent string of curses lily over at her clock 10 25 she scrambled out of bed and started packing her trunk she was moving so fast that someone might have reckoned the house was on fire she threw folded robes spellbooks quills parchment ink scales cauldrons and all her other school supplies into her wooden trunk lily also grabbed petree cage down from the ceiling where it hung on a hook the bird twittering inside with eyes full of excitement when everything worth packing was packed including the mysterious box james and her had unearthed she started to fix her hair she quickly applied some light make up including mascara liner and gloss then grabbed her trunk and petry cage and ran down the stairs at the bottom of the stairs lily parents were waiting expectantly hurry lily we have to go now we have 15 minutes to get to the station and to get you on that train said lily father a in rushed tone grabbing her trunk and pulling it toward the car petunia came to the bottom of the stairs her face quite distorted by the purple and black bruises covering it to say farewell good bye lily have fun at that freak school of yours and dontbother to write said petunia in a cheery vindictive voice good bye petunia have fun with your pig of a boyfriend and try to avoid him at meals you could be next on the menu mocked lily laughing at her sister outraged reaction lily finally climbed into the car with her parents and headed out for platform 9 and where is she demanded roxanne dewey a very pretty girl with long chocolate brown hair that went past her shoulders good question if lily is late how will she get to hogwarts asked erica an equally pretty girl with dark auburn hair the two girls were standing on platform 9 and in front of the shiny red train the hogwarts express oh god i hope oswald didntdamage her face or something she could be at the hospital right now squeaked erica always thinking of the worst case scenario as the two girls discussed all the possible reasons lily hadntarrived yet they were approached by none other than the marauders hellooooo ladies need someone to escort you onto the train piped sirius black a ridiculously good looking boy with a cheshire cat smile that made the girls of hogwarts melt erica giggling before roxanne could reply well as we dontplan on being mortally wounded on our way to the train i dontthink it necessary to have escorts we can board a train by ourselves you know we arentdense like some of the girls that swoon over you sirius blurted out roxanne looking at sirius like he was an annoying piece of gum stuck to the bottom of her shoe oh roxi you get sassier every time i see you i like a little spunk in my women exclaimed sirius huskily inching closer to her like i would ever agree to be your woman black i would rather snog erica vicious owl than you spat roxanne hey i can be vicious too if that what your into sirius grin continued to widen naughtily why you roxanne started dontmean to interrupt anything romantic here guys but do you know where lily is asked james curiously coming up from behind sirius with remus and another plump boy peter usually you three are attached at the hips roxanne calmed down and decided to answer james question well not that it is any of your business but to tell you the truth we dontknow where lily is she has five minutes to get here before the train leaves and if we dontall find seats soon we will have to stand at the back near the slytherins said roxanne looking repulsed at the idea we better find seats now guys i sure lily will find us said remus lupin softly speaking for the first time he was very good looking like the rest of the marauders and very intelligent as well he had sandy brown hair and stormy gray eyes though he was not as striking as james or sirius his sense of quiet mystery oozed sex appeal the girls and the marauders james sirius remus and peter finally relented to finding seats on the train erica roxanne and james all looked uneasy at the idea they found a spot near the back and to roxanne horror all had to sit together erica seemed very pleased with the arrangement it was 2 minutes before the train was going to leave and everyone was worried about lily whereabouts listen guys i have to check something in the luggage compartment i ll be right back said james casually getting up from his seat truthfully he was going to make a last minute check on the platform for any signs of lily lily and her parents pulled up to king cross station they quickly scrambled out of the car and ran toward lily platform trunk and jostled owl in tow oh my gosh mum i going to miss the train lily cried desperately her stomach tied in nervous knots at the thought of being left behind on the platform as her friends waved goodbye we ll make it dear i promise with one minute to go the cluster of frazzled redheads made it to the platform goodbye lily i want a mail sack of owls from you i love you so much have fun and stay out of t t trouble cried lily mother sobbing in a wet handkerchief lily father gave her a fierce hug than kissed her cheek goodbye lils no boys i love you lily yelled sincerely before she ran throw the barrier leading to the wizarding platform damn where is she james muttered to himself he checked the platform twice but did not see lily james climbed back onto the train feeling uneasy about not knowing lily whereabouts he stayed by the door and the train began to move slowly parents and friends had already left the platform so it was empty james was about to close the door when he heard his name james james wait cried out a voice he looked out the door and saw lily standing on the platform alone the train steadily moving away from her her unusual eyes usually burning with feisty quips were panicked lily had previously gotten her luggage put on the train and was about to board when the train had started moving however she did not have time to explain her situation to james lily james yelled back in surprise he jumped off of the slow moving train and ran over to her hurry we can still make it on the train he grabbed lily hand they ran toward the back of the train where the luggage compartments were as the rest of the train had begun to disappear round a bend many intrigued hogwarts students peered out their compartment windows curious as to why two of the most popular students in the school were racing along beside the express one still in her pajamas to boot the luggage compartment door was still open and james and lily climbed into it just before the train sped off towards hogwarts they collapsed to the ground their breathing laboured thanks lily said in painful relief her chest feeling as if it might explode from exertion anything for lillykins james chuckled between breaths can i just ask you a question sure i think i can manage that said lily smiling gratefully why are you still in your pajamas james inquired looking amused damn it lily hollered in annoyance blushing the two sixth years dissolved into fits of giggles as the hogwarts express headed towards the castle they had both been waiting all summer to see v author notes v please continue to read and review
