 awkward feelings i just had to write something that was ok and i didntleave hanging i hate being left hanging but lack of reviews cost me my enthusiasm and i gave them up please review if you want this story summary a simple love story with as few strings attached as i could manage disclaimer these wonderful characters do not belong to me but to jk rowling the talented writer who invented a character that stole me heart guess who chapter 1 how it all started hermione sighed as she thumbed through the pages of the book it was no use she knew the whole book off by heart already and studying just made her head spin worse her eyes wandered to the quill next to the book and then the ink bottle next to that until finally she found herself starring out the large arched window it looked nice outside it was unnaturally warm this april she rested her head on her palm and let out another sigh the giant squid in the lake was lazily propelling itself from one side of the lake to the other something clicked and she remembered she had to get back to studying the pain was clenching in her head and she felt a flash of frustration when she spotted the word potions which she had seen at least 2000 times already she leaped up from her seat flung her chair back and picked up the book she let out a loud scream in frustration and threw the heavy fusty book across the room and into the wall it collided with the wall making a muffled thud noise the whole of gryffindor common room froze and stared at hermione harry and ron and ginny had started to cautiously make their way towards her she just stood there breathing heavily as she stared at the crumpled red book on the floor her frizzy hair crackled with electricity from anger and her eyes blazed with a dangerous light hermione ron said slowly and cautiously erm are you feeling a little stressed interjected ginny with only a small amount of sarcasm hermione glared daggers at her but didntanswer harry handled the situation better than both the weasleys maybe you should step outside and get some air he said firmly she felt some of the anger fade into exhaustion and she sighed again nodding she headed for the portrait hole with a quick guilty look at the book lying on the floor harry sternly shook his head hermione knew he was right although she felt an incredible urge to pick up the book and take it outside with her she knew it would defeat the purpose trying to gather as much dignity she could muster with half the common room still staring at her she strode out of the room the second she closed the portrait behind her a wave of regret swept over her newts were less than two months away she almost went straight back in if she hadntthought of the firmness and honesty in harry expression yes she was working too hard with a longing look at the direction of the common room she set off she didnttake her time and practically rushed down the stairs to the grand entrance the sooner this was over with the sooner she could study again although she knew this attitude would not help her calm down she couldntfight it she decided the maximum time she should spend outside should be 20 or so minutes then she could catch up easily enough on her work now that she had a time limit and a plan for her studying she relaxed immensely she reached the lake and looked around taking in the cool calming environment with as much enthusiasm as she dared with a glance at the dirt at the shore of the lake she reached inside her large robe pocket and wrapped her fingers around her wand she spied a rock close by picked it up and placed it where she wanted to sit with a small graceful flick of her wand she transfigured the dark misshapen stone into a comfortable and rather large red cushiony blanket she found a long piece of grass and turned that into an enormous pillow that was big enough for 5 or 6 people to lie on with a smug look of satisfaction she sat down and leaned against her pillow spreading her legs out in front of her she took in a deep breath and prepared for a long break the birds fluttered sluggishly overhead as her eyes slowly closed the sounds of the trees moving slightly in the breeze filled her ears and she decided it wouldnthurt to take a short snooze hermione sat there quietly for 7 or so minutes absorbing the good feeling when her good vibes were violently disrupted footsteps were drawing near she felt herself snap out of her daze she blinked twice before bending her neck back as far as it would go over the large white pillow to get an upside down view of whoever was approaching once she got a glimpse or who it was she snapped bolt upright all thoughts of relaxing had disappeared into oblivion professor snape was walking towards her she hoped with all her might that he would walk right past then realised that that would cause him to walk into the lake she did not take back that wish however when he stopped beside her she held her breath wondering if she might be in trouble or whether he was just here to insult hermione did not turn her head his way to acknowledge him but watched him from the side anyway may i sit down it was not a question but not so much an order either no you bloody well may not she thought to herself but didntsay anything out loud he sat down a fair distance away from her on the thankfully oversized blanket she did not take her cautious eye off of him refusing to blink he did not lean back on the pillow however preferring to remain upright and alert this was the last thing she wanted an uncomfortable discussion with snape he was his tense and usual stand offish self finally she turned to face him am i in trouble professor she asked with as much snap as she thought appropriate his face clouded for a mere half a second before he answered not at all unless you have something to hide he fixed a harsh stare on her she didnteven flinch i wanted to enjoy the view too unless this position is reserved for know it alls alone his snide remark did not sting as it once would have merely reflecting off her instead of mulling over his comment she began to think of how ironic it was that he was most likely a know it all too he fitted his multiple descriptions of one perfectly snape was not pleased when her mouth twitched slightly as she hid a smile his black eyes seemed to burn for a moment amused he asked a subtle iciness about his voice no hermione said as firmly and surely as she could his voice changed from accusing to inquiring why are you outside so near to the exams this is most unlike you his tone was less icy and more confused hermione could feel all her dozing going to waste at the thought of the exams i um had an outburst er pretty similar to a nervous breakdown she trailed off slowly and lamely snape hardly looked surprised in fact his look of confusion lifted to be replaced by smugness hermione did not ponder this ah now that fits your character much better he nodded his black hair swaying his hair definitely suited his character she found herself thinking what exactly happened he asked pulling his brows together in mock concern hermione found herself tormented by the fact he was her teacher and she would have to answer him a small amount of color rose in her cheeks putting herself in a defensive position she looked her criticising professor straight in the eye taking a deep breath at the same time wishing him to turn into a toad she replied i got frustrated with studying so hard from this book she began and when i reread the same word what seems like a million times i got angry and her defensive posture was rapidly disintegrating and i kind of well i picked up the book and threw it at the wall and screamed she looked at her toes not wanting to hear his distasteful remark but on he contrary he looked shocked at her behaviour and there was a slight concern she did not catch while staring at her toes do you know how to transfigure a sofa into a dragon his remark surprised her she did not see its relevance with a slight trace of her surprise she answered of course then that is transfiguration out of the way one less thing to concentrate on do you know all the spells in a charming way to succeed off by heart and can you perform them all he already knew her answer yes her surprise and confusion was becoming more obvious well then charms is pretty much done too he glanced at her that takes two subjects off of your priority already you figure out the rest he then looked at the squid slowly spinning it tentacles on the surface of the water hermione just sat there quite shocked realising he was right she had pretty much mastered all the contents of the newts before doing her owls this revelation seemed to make a much bigger difference on hermione than he had intended though he hardly noticed this then her mind wandered back as to why he was sitting next to her to begin with but she darentask him the reason for five minutes there was absolute silence but it was tense silence with every second hermione wanted to get up and leave more and more but felt obliged to stay as long as her professor was there she didntnotice the sadness and depression in his eyes which many students had supposed to be a look of emptiness today was worse than usual but he was hiding it well finally after what felt like an age snape broke the stillness with another irrelevant question out of curiosity his voice had no anger spite or indifference or any emotion whatsoever hermione did pick up on that you said that it was one word that put you over the edge may i ask what it was again she knew he wasntasking hermione thought for a second she couldntremember the word and when she finally did she said it before she had even stopped to think potions she said and a second later clapped her hand over her mouth and looked at him waiting for him to make her wish herself dead but nothing happened on the contrary snape looked at her blankly and then silently rose to his feet and without a word of farewell swept off back towards the castle at least she was honest he thought dully to himself hermione just sat there as she watched his back she had not expected that it had been enough to set him off but she didntunderstand why it seemed to make him well sad wasnta description that fitted her professor at all more like downcast and miserable and it certainly did not seem like a reason for him to leave not that she wasntgrateful of his disappearance but now she felt something other than hatred for her potions master that felt uncannily like pity with a twist of interest she misjudged this feeling by only a little she knew that snape did not need nor did he care much for pity she was blissfully unaware that this was the start of a change in direction an unwilled alteration of destiny she curled herself on her blanket far more comfortably now that she was not under the gaze of piercing black eyes her thoughts wandered to her friends and what they were doing at that moment as she felt snape fading from her mind there was one subconscious part of her that knew something was not right this was where it all began about 3 days after his encounter with miss granger severus snape sat in his study of his chambers his chambers were not too large or small with bookshelves in every room his study had three high backed green velvet chairs facing the fire a desk for potion making covered with various items of curiosity and beside a large ebony cabinet there was a chessboard with dark green marble and pale silver marble pieces the only light in the room was the fire in the fireplace and an unusually soft orange glow filled the entire room his bedroom held a large bed with dark green sheets and a silver rim the high drapes on either side were an even darker green on which were hanging silver tassels beside his bed on the black beside table there was a pile of four books and a small silver statue of a cobra and his storeroom need not be described because it was nothing more than a room full of shelves of certain ingredients for potions snape sat in the middle chair of the three that faced the fire in his study he was leaning slightly forward his elbows on the armrests and his head resting on his hands his raven black hair fell in dark curtains beside his sharp face his pitch black eyes that resembled caves appeared even more hollow than usual his slender pale fingers tapped his cheeks continuously as he stared blankly into the fire he felt so empty so miserable that he felt as though his insides had dropped a foot or two his reluctance to move left him feeling fused to the chair the mere thought of moving was out of the question he still couldntbring himself to come to terms with the news he had known his little sister had been unwell for almost a week his little sister stella had always stood by him and been there for him even in his dark days when his parents had disowned him not that he cared much about that and she had always been one of the few he felt close to the others being dumbledore and his elder brother but even his elder brother had not always supported him as she had stella had a graceful intelligence and had an understanding of people that he had never mastered she would help him in those situations in which such knowledge should be needed if it should occur she had been the only reason he had turned to dumbledore instead of killing himself after he realised his mistake in joining the death eaters and now she was gone he breathed in deeply at the sudden feeling of his heart being wrung like a wet rag by a pair of strong hands it hurt too badly he couldntbear to stay awake any longer and take this torture with a very strained movement he peeled himself from the green chair and headed over to his work desk every movement was a struggle with his mind he finally got there and slid open the desk drawer inside he found several round glass bottles with long necks and stoppers filled with many different colored potions he reached forward and picked up the one containing a very clear crystal orange removing the stopper he flipped his head back and downed the whole thing at once he placed the empty container on the desk and started over to his bedroom he only had a few minutes before the potion started to work fully it seemed forever until he reached his bed which he dropped into the sheets without bothering to change finally he would have some release for his constant ache inside him that felt like it would never go away a very quiet sigh escaped him and he pulled the covers up to his chest with a final look at the silver snake beside his bed he closed his eyes slowly when he opened them again it would be morning hermione yawned and stretched feeling good today after she had been easier on herself and eased some of the studying time from her schedule today everything looked good pavarti and lavender were still asleep in the beds next to her with a quick look at the time she flung back the covers and slid out of bed her feet fitting into her slippers perfectly placed beside her bed skimming across the floor like she was walking on water she felt as though someone had inflated a balloon in her chest to create a pleasant floating feeling she headed for the shower dumping her clothes for the day on her bed before doing so 10 minutes later she reappeared with her hair wrapped in a towel she shuffled in her fluffy white slippers towards to the large round mirror in the center of the wall facing the beds ruffling her hair with the towel as she went standing and looking in the mirror she felt the need to look nice today to match her feelings she reached for her wand and pointed it at her performing some drying and curling spells on her hair until she ended up with large curly locks in place of her usual drab frizzy mess she looked at her work proudly today was definitely going to be a fine day heading back to her bed she got dressed into her school robes once that was over with she grabbed her bag and started for the door lavender stirred and looked up at hermione just as she was about to leave ooh hermione i love your hair she said in wonder while she removed the night spells she had placed in her own hair hermione just smiled in reply compliments only added to her good mood breakfast was no different than usual harry ron and ginny were all discussing the usual the news anything interesting and how much they hated snape and trelawney when hermione arrived they all looked up love the hair grinned ginny enthusiastically harry and ron nodded ron had a trace of jam on his nose but she felt it better not to tell him about it this time as soon as she sat down then they resumed their conversation so where do you suppose snape is ron asked as hermione reached across him to get to the toast once she had had her toast she looked up at the staff table and confirmed that he wasntthere it a mystery to me mate shrugged harry as he added some sugar and lemon to his pancake but all i know is i grateful for whatever reason it is that keeps him as far away from us as possible ron nodded violently in agreement now dontsay that said ginny the only one so far who showed any hint of caring for all you know it might be something really bad she added seriously so said ron genuinely raising his eyebrows hermione frowned as did ginny how can you say that what if he dies or something would care even in the slightest hermione snapped although she did not like snape to wish him dead was another thing entirely ron appeared to look thoughtful for a moment searching for any ounce of compassion then he blankly looked at the three of them not really he then resumed his breakfast ginny gave him a disgusted look really ron that is disgraceful you cold hearted pig ginny growled i am ashamed to call you my brother ron looked up with a puppy face from his plate and the discussion broke down as ginny forgave him the subject moved away to other things and snape was forgotten for the moment first lesson of the day was potions and it was now obvious to all the students in hermione grade something was seriously wrong when they had come in their teacher was nowhere to be found and after half a minute the panic had start to set in snape was late there was a constant hum of muttering worried and inquisitive voices the sound filled the air and made the concern levels sharply rise snape had never been late whatever the circumstances he had always been waiting for them behind his desk and he did not appear to be the kind of man who would suddenly break years of habit hermione however was silent not answering when harry or ron asked her opinions on where he could be her good day was rapidly turning into a confusing one she straightened her robes and leaned back into her chair as she thought this had been the second time in three days that snape was acting weirdly now she felt she should have concentrated more on his unusual behaviour by the lake it might hold some answers his reaction to a small insult that day she have been a clue enough to point to some emotional misbalance she shook her head the idea of emotions and snape in her brain felt like two puzzle pieces that refused to fit together just then a full twenty minutes after class had started snape burst in the door the aged door slammed into the wall in its usual way and the whole class froze if they hadntbeen under his sight they would have definitely started muttering again snape hair was not a wild mess but it also was not neat and straight like they had seen it all their hogwarts lives his robes were not crisp and un creased not to mention the very light purple ring under each of his eyes hermione was sure she heard lavender gasp although these were little differences that for a normal person would be ignored they had never seen the slightest hair out of place as long as they could remember but what surprised hermione was the look in his eyes she had failed to note the sadness in them at the lake and now it was obvious to not just her but the whole class a thought occurred to her that maybe all the time they had been sitting in his class under the gaze of his empty black eyes that they had never been empty today we will be learning how to make a good will potion he started in his normal voice from which you could not tell that anything was wrong but his walk continued to give him away instead of striding over to his desk with his robes billowing out behind him he took average sized steps slowly to the front of the class with a flick of his wand the steps appeared on the board you may begin the last word had leaked some of his exhaustion and he sank into his large chair the class stared at him silently for a moment then afraid of a detention or sharp remark started bustling around collecting ingredients from the student storeroom all the students including hermione noticed how he had ignored the fact that he was late offering no explanation maybe there was none to give no there was definitely something he was hiding he did not march up and down the rows and more than once he ignored them completely even when neville cauldron melted again he did not even look their way so harry hermione and ron had to help clean up the mess themselves when the bell came they brought their samples up to the desk as usual even though this time he did not ask them to students all dared a glance at their professor once before filing out of the room the second they left the room they began to discuss amongst themselves the noise in the hallway was incredible considering everyone was whispering hermione stayed behind gesturing harry and ron should go on without her they gave her a questioning look before leaving and finally she was the last in the class slowly without thinking she approached the potions master he looked right through her when she approached new hair he thought blankly in the back of his mind better than the usual frizzy mess er professor she said hesitantly as though she was only just starting to realise what she was doing are are you ok his eyes snapped up and fixed up her so sharply she almost jumped she regretted it almost instantly what could she have been thinking snape anger flared inside but his depression overrode it the nerve that little witch has but what came out of his mouth was nothing but a sigh go away miss granger he said softly but the threat in it was more than obvious when she did not move he gave her a half hearted glare but she didntflinch in the slightest what is it he groaned rubbing his temples with his fingers to prevent a horrible headache i was just wondering i know the whole class was what happened hermione pressed knowing damn well she was pushing it very far the hatred in his glare became much more readable and visible now hermione did flinch normally she wouldnthave expected to even to make it past that sentence but today he wasntacting normal i dontsee why miss granger why you should even care he hissed gently hermione stayed stone silent he nodded with a small emotionless smirk now if you are quite done sticking your nose into other people business hermione blushed slightly please leave and enjoy the rest of your morning off before charms it was at that precise moment that she felt a pang of pity for her grouchy professor whatever had happened had left him a different person almost nicer at the same time a more jealous man his last sentence had unwillingly given her the impression he was envious of her ability to enjoy herself carefree she decided to quit while she was ahead with a curt nod to snape which surprised him having expected her to push it further she turned and walked over to the door pushing her now curly hair over her shoulder she turned back to look at him with her hand on the door handle i ll figure it out in the end i always do she said softly with a soft smirk and she pulled the door open and left snape just stared at the door slowly closing behind her with mixed feelings she had had the exact affect on him she had wanted he was slightly nervous at what she meant what else had she figured out he could only rest on the hopes that it was about stuff other than himself his hopes were generally correct but he could not be certain damn her her glowered at the air in which she had just stood and continued to rub his temples gently please r r like forgive the lack of excitement as of yet please bear with me as i try and keep them as much in character as possible of course it will end up with lots of fluff sigh so please review snakecharmer chapter 10 the dumbledore scare no evil twist just yet p so far last chapter only from now on harry and ron find out about ginny and draco they confront her and hermione sticks up for her they let it rest for a while until exams are over they are over pretty fast because of lack of events and once again the rumour queens get to work spreading the news around the school by breakfast everyone knows and all eyes are on ginny when draco enters the great hall he is met with the horrible surprise of everyone knowing the slytherins wont let him sit at his table and hermione offers for him to sit with them gasps from everyone in the hall he does more gasps later hermione dares to tell him her secret knowing he could tell no one because no one would talk to him she then goes to visit severus in his classroom having not seen him for a week or so we have to talk she sighed it was severus turn to dread what she would say next he looked down at the mass of curls on her head that pressed against his heart he frowned in worry and tightened his grip on her she could not have decided to dump him a voice said in his mind she had just kissed him and been scared when he had teased her a moment before yet he still worried maybe we should sit in my study she nodded into his robes but hesitated before letting go of him he felt so good to hold she let her hands linger on his shoulders a moment before she dropped them he was so much taller than her and his figure loomed over her imposing and threatening she licked her lips and watched him brush past her over to the storeroom trailing close behind she stuck to his shadow preferring to be as close to him as she could he stopped before the door of the storeroom and hermione waited as he unlocked it and opened it he stepped aside to let her walk in first and once she was inside he shut the door behind him he turned and stayed behind hermione as she crossed the narrow dark room lined with wide shelves she felt a little edgy but the rhythmic and sweeping strides of severus behind her comforted her some she looked over at the outline that was severus snape she sighed softly so that he could not hear then tearing her eyes away from him as he halted and stood over her shoulder she pushed the tall black door open it creaked a little and once she stepped inside the room the fire flared up filling the room with its orange glow she suddenly realized she was cold despite the warm weather outside she felt the tiny hairs on her neck prickle up severus did not notice as he was used to the atmosphere of the dungeons he brushed past her once more and motioned for her to sit in one of his chairs but occupied his favourite before hermione could steal it once more she smirked a little and chose to walk in a relaxed pace over to him his eyes followed her every movement and she knew that no one could stare in the calculating way he did she was sure that he could read her as easily as the pages of a book at least was that what it appeared she sat down in the tall high backed green chair twisting in it so that she could face him better now she returned his captivating gaze trying the smother her chill well his voice quiet but demanding you wanted to talk that the thing she sighed leaning back into the chair we haventonce talked he raised a black brow i dontknow that much about you other than what i ve observed in classes severus straightened stiffly as if bracing himself for a bombshell i want to be with you i know that too but i worry that i worry she trailed off not knowing how exactly to say what she felt severus relaxed although not visibly and understanding was now starting to dawn on him he was even able to guess she was about to say next you worry that all we have is promise he asked as she lowered her eyes she bent her head and nodded her curls coming over her face and anxious features he smirked a little that is perfectly understandable he stated blankly and in an odd way it reassured her we have like you said not ever properly talked she lifted her head once more once again he was faced with her soft chocolate brown eyes they had an effect on him he made sure she was unaware of they made his nerves tingle all throughout his body but i know it not like we can force it can we she added he nodded you re quite right he said then paused to think there is the hogsmead weekend coming up soon she noted a little uncertainty in his voice and she considered it sweet and i was wondering if you might be able to slip away and join me for the day she had not been expecting that there was a deafening silence in which he grew more and more nervous with anticipation of her reply he had assumed she would say yes but as she simply looked at him with her eyes that knocked some of the sharp edge out of his own stare he dreaded her response might be a rejection of course i can she said eventually a small smirk escaped him and she grinned back at him the fact that he tensed at the thought of rejection was to hermione adorable in its own right she wished she could reach over the chair and hold him but the arms of them held her back and she suddenly despised the chairs as she never had before she put a hand into the inner pocket of her robes and immediately found her wand when she pulled it out severus tensed sharply his kept a cautious eye on her every move what are planning on doing this time he said not taking his eyes off of the wand she smirked widely at his reaction these chairs are starting to irritate me so stiff and i want to be closer to you his posture softened somewhat she pointed her wand at his chair and in a moment in place of their two seats there was a long dark red leather couch taking up the space of the room severus eyed the color with distaste did it have to be red he sneered she grinned again and shuffled up closer to him once her leg was touching his she felt she was sufficiently close and stopped much better she sighed severus just watched her carefully as she put the wand away so how much do you know of the goings on from breakfast this morning she did not need to look at him instead choosing to bury herself in his victorian gothic clothes he still felt a little nervous at her touch but did not let it show i can guess as most other staff members have that from the display this morning miss weasley and mr malfoy are romantically involved correct hermione nodded as she slipped her arms around his waist as well no longer feeling so cold i was not alone in being shocked by your actions and mr malfoy too for that matter hermione smirked against him she was only half listening the other half was thinking about how nice he smelt like musk with a touch of sandalwood mm that effect was intended she mumbled against him he looked down at her clinging to him and could not help feel a little odd how strangely things had turned out he could not see her eyes for the curls but that was probably for the better they had the ability to weaken him call me crazy but he started sarcastically without sting i was under the strong impression as was everyone else for that matter that you disliked mr malfoy hermione snorted but the sound was caught by the thick black material of course i did i am unsure whether i still do anymore though she said leaning slightly away from him to be heard better what with what been happening these days i did not think it possible to drop such a long term hatred such as that he raised his eyebrow and hermione frowned and looked away neither did i she sounded sad he realized and frowned too but things change he picked up her bitter vibe you wish for things to return to the way they once were he asked it with no show of his anxiety hermione did not think that he was talking about them and nodded solemnly into his chest he felt his heart sink it can be arranged this time he could not help the thin trace of disappointment he was unwilling to let her go so easily hermione jerked upright with surprise a look of pure horror and regret on her face no no she gasped looking at him straight in the eye that not what i meant i was talking about ginny and draco the weight on his heart lifted why would you even think such a thing she leaned against him once more feeling a little cold again about a million things he sighed and hermione felt his chest rise and fall with it it is still a wonder to me that he hesitated that of all the people to choose from that i was even considered hermione felt as if a knife had gone through her heart he was so insecure she squeezed him tightly it is still a wonder to me that no one else got to you before i did she said as she listened to the rhythmic beating of his heart but why would i settle for anyone else i was afraid for the longest time that you would never be aware of what i felt that i was beneath you he scowled whatever gave you the impression you were beneath me there was a protective bite to his voice as if he would hunt down the source of such thoughts you oh hermione stifled a giggle if had seemed he had forgotten all his snide remarks he had constantly shot her with throughout the years well his tone was apologetic you must excuse my behaviour i had automatically labelled you as a friend of potter i am aware that that is very closed minded of myself but then i have never claimed to have an open mind hermione nodded and twisted her head up to look at him i dontneed an apology nor do i wish for one your actions were perfectly understandable she looked up into his eyes and he could tell all was already forgiven he let himself focus on the softness of her wide eyes i never really took the insult insufferable know it all seriously anyway he looked slightly caught by surprise i am glad he said recovering fast as you probably have guessed i could find no sufficient fault and resorted to twisting your intelligence to appear a negative thing when it is most assuredly not she felt the compliment he implied and smiled softly at him thank you she concealed her brown eyes and features once again in his robes he noticed how her touch was soothing and comfortable and put his arm around her in return but she remembered their original topic that they had been sidetracked from how bad do you think it will be if people find out about us severus black eyes clouded this was not the sort of thing he enjoyed considering but he had to it would be far worse than what you saw today he said reluctantly with a returning bitterness they would not leave us alone for maybe months and it may even find its way into the newspaper because unlike miss weasley and mr malfoy i am still your professor and you are still my student hermione felt him shudder a little she gripped him closer not for much longer she reassured him he nodded and watched the flames of the fire in front of them flicker spreading its light around the room there was a silence as they just sat together on the maroon leather couch hermione snuggled into his robes and severus kept his arm around her as he watched the fire crackle it was a cosy atmosphere if it had not been for the concentrated frown on his face shadowed by his long black hair hermione was on her way back to the common room she didntthink that now after her visit the glowers of her housemates would make the slightest dent on her happiness they had had a successful conversation from which hermione felt she had extracted more information about him that was what she had been nervous about but now any worries were put to rest she was at the bottom of the steps that led up the portrait of the fat lady where she was greeted by the by the irritated glower of draco malfoy she was startled back to reality what kept you he snapped hermione bit her lip she had totally forgotten that she had told draco to wait for her she looked up at him with false guilt he frowned i take that back i dontwant to know he pulled an appalled face at the small smirk that spread across hermione lips growing slowly yes maybe you don t she said mysteriously she enjoyed the abhorrence in his features as she toyed with his imagination eugh he stuck out his tongue he didntdare say more because of what she was about to do to help him she smiled broadly and innocently at him and he sneered right back she started walking up the steps and draco was behind her quickly his growing apprehension was blatant i not so sure about this he started nervously as they stopped in front of the fat lady the portrait eyed hermione then draco curiously her utter distaste at the fact she was perhaps going to have to let in an intruder was apparent in the way she ruffled herself nonsense hermione said brightly tomato salad she directed the password at the fat lady she sent a reproachful look at draco and offered her the chance to change her mind are you sure about that she said eying malfoy incredulously as she did yes she said stubbornly the portrait swung open slowly and hermione crawled through first deciding it was the better way to go about things she looked over her shoulder to make sure that the portrait did not close before he had a chance to get in once she stepped out on the other side she was greeted by three smiles from harry ron and ginny who had decided to emerge finally while she had been gone she was also met by a wave of icy glances from everyone else but no one spoke harry looked like he was about to say hello but when a moment behind her malfoy stepped into the room his jaw dropped to the floor everyone else jaws dropped too and there were several shrieks of surprise from the stunned crowd h hermione harry spluttered are you out of your mind ginny was sitting silently staring at draco who stared back and hermione knew they were ignoring the looks they were receiving lavender stood up from one of the chairs and pointed an accusing finger at him there a slytherin she screeched in our common room and although she was merely stating the obvious it seemed to bring people back to the realisation that malfoy worst enemy of the gryffindors other than the slytherin head of house was now standing in their private space where they were supposed to be safe from him hermione yelled dean next to a speechless seamus did you let him in the scattered glances that were on draco ginny all directed at her suddenly and the whisperings subsided as people waited for her explanation all the stinging eyes sharp like daggers did not daunt her in the slightest yes i did she said plainly and there were collective gasps his own house has turned on him he has nowhere else to go and since he is involved with a gryffindor i see no harm in it her voice now took on a rallying tone and as gryffindors i think it is our place to be the nobler and accept malfoy presence amongst us there was a buzz of mutterings that filled the air like bees but how can we forget the things he done to us neville piped up from the back he stood like lavender and there was a defiant and confident glint in his eyes that draco had not seen before there were several mumbled agreements draco looked neville up and down with no hint of malice but none of apology either because he changed replied hermione patiently and there are things about his personality we have obviously been unaware of otherwise why would our ginny she gestured at ginny who sent a horrified look at hermione for dragging her into her speech see fit to date him think about it there was more mutterings and cautious glances at draco and hermione while they talked hermione decided to sit down with harry and ron draco cast an anxious look at the room before slowly hesitantly taking a seat next to ginny while harry and ron watched his every move unblinking when he sat down he saw their discomfort hermione gaped ron is malfoy really sitting in front of me or am i going stark raving mad hermione gave him an irritated look of course he in front of you ron she said tersely as she reached for her book on the table next to their chess set get over it get over it hermione he said faintly this is not right he and harry winced as draco leaned over and kissed ginny briefly on the lips i cantbelieve you just kissed my sister he snapped at draco who looked up at ron sarcastically now do you he said as he leant over again and gave her a much more lingering kiss harry and ron both looked away in horror and hermione chuckled she knew the whole room was watching and she thought although it would be an unwelcome sight to many it would help them to accept him just donttry anything funny malfoy you re on uncharted turf warned harry once he dared to look back and draco nodded to show that he meant no hostility she opened her book with a smirk to the page she had left it at sliding a finger under the next page to make it quicker to turn she wished she could see severus again but it would look suspicious if she left once more to go to the library while she had her own book in her hands she was also amazed by the fact no one took any further action after that and draco was silently permitted to join them that lunch draco walked down the great hall with them harry and ron kept constantly muttering about how strange it all was hermione was thrilled that she had been the one to help ginny with getting others to accept their relationship although she knew it was odd she was too busy getting others to accept it that she did not have time to think about it for herself they walked over to the gryffindor table and the whole hall stared as they had that morning now equally blaming harry and ron as well and ginny and her they managed to pretend to be ignorant of their eyes and all sat down together hermione had only just started helping herself to food when she heard the sweeping steps and flutter of a heavy cloak that she recognised well she paused and when the footsteps stopped right behind her she thought it appropriate to turn and look severus was standing between the slytherin and gryffindor table at her back tall and brooding his robes hung down from his folded arms and there was a condemning hint to his black eyes that bored into her she wondered if was more than for appearances alone and frowned in reply she so wanted to run up to him and kiss him but kept the glower for the sake of her privacy miss granger a word he purred dangerously she wavered a moment before following his direct order she cast a confused look at harry and ron but not draco and ginny who like hermione suspected he just wanted to talk with her she got up and stepped over the bench in a moment he swivelled and was striding out of the hall and she hurried to keep up almost tripping over her feet at one point once they were well out of sight of prying eyes and walking together alone down the hall she finally spoke what going on severus she saw the look in his eye when she said his first name however he chose to shush her shh you dontknow who listening he said quietly then raised his voice once more the headmaster wants to talk to you and saw fit to request that i get you hermione frowned does he know then she said apprehensively she saw her feelings reflected in his features i dontknow he said with a hint of tenseness but he straightened his back a second later as if he had just revealed a weakness hermione looked over at him walking beside her with his robes flowing out behind him as a result of striding they suited his character so well plus they looked great on him she thought to herself you cantlose you job over this can you i almost a graduate she knew this is what had been eating away at him but you are still a student at this present time and if he sees fit he may well choose to release me he retorted and hermione let the sting wash over her his frustration was understandable he can t she attempted to reassure him he needs you his black gaze fixed on her for the order you mean he kept his voice as quiet as possible yes she nodded also keeping her voice low he does not need to keep me at the school for my assistance however he may consider it important to have as many of us at hogwarts as possible she nodded so it could go either way she began to blame herself it was her fault she was the one who had got the crazy crush in the first place and kissed him given that he could not remember that kiss until after their proper kiss but that had to be her fault too somehow and she searched for a wild reason to make it so there was a long depressing silence that spread out between them making it seem that they were further apart than they actually were and yet being in his presence alone was enough to make her feel better she could not explain it when they finally arrived at the gargoyle that guarded his office hermione wished that they would both keep walking together strawberry bonbons he said with a strong look of distaste at the password hermione could not hold back the smirk at his expression the gargoyle came to life and leapt aside for them to go up the moving staircase severus always the gentleman stepped aside for her to go in first she did so and waited until he was once more at her side before getting on one of the steps with him they stood close together and hermione again was surprised to find that she needed to restrain herself from leaning over and holding him dumbledore office door came into sight and at the same time they both stepped off of the staircase and severus moved ahead to knock he rapped on the door thrice loudly and moved his hand down to the door handle he pushed opened the door and once more let hermione in first hermione walked into the round office lined with curious objects she didntspend too much time glancing around it however she was too worried she looked over at the desk at the back of the room and dumbledore sat behind it his bright crystal blue eyes watched her intently as she tentatively walked over to him for a moment she thought she saw his silver beard twitch as a sign he may have just smiled at her but then she could not have been sure she shot him a nervous look but he appeared not have seen it once severus closed the door he swept past her up to the desk dumbledore gestured he should sit in one of the two chairs opposite him he cast a look over at her that she caught before he slumped into the soft armchair she reached the armchair and dumbledore waved his hand again for her to sit as well she did and glanced over at severus before looking back at dumbledore with a look of panic he put his hand into his pocket while they both stared silently at him as he pulled out his wand since you are both missing your precious lunch my fault then i was thinking that we should all dine together he pointed his wand at a small empty space on the desk and immediately there was a plate full of sandwiches he looked at them expectantly but they were both staring back at him blankly as if unsure what to do next eat eat he urged and hermione glanced at severus again before slowly taking a white bread cheese sandwich he took one after her and dumbledore smiled choosing not to take any for himself while hermione ate her sandwich quickly because she was so hungry severus chose to hold his until the old codger in front of him took one himself he did not trust that barmy old man tricks but his worry was unfounded since a second later he helped himself to some as well he looked down at the sandwich in his hand and did not much feel like eating it but under the gaze of the over cheerful twinkle that was dumbledore he forced it down once hermione and dumbledore had had their thirds and fourths and were sufficiently filled albus made the plate disappear and the temporary relaxed atmosphere was once again replaced by the stress now hermione she was relieved to find that the twinkle remained in his eyes when his tone became more official i have become aware of certain happenings in hogwarts that are apparently as a result of your actions severus cut him off with a frown entirely her fault headmaster he did not want her to take the blame alone for what he felt should be his punishment dumbledore smiled a little at his anxiety the twinkle seemed to become far more evident well he said as if seriously considering his last phrase maybe mr malfoy was to be held a little responsible but when given the password to the gryffindor common room it becomes hard to resist temptations severus frowned utterly befuddled a moment later it was obvious he realized that he was not referring to him and hermione being an item his frown deepened you gave malfoy the password to the gryffindor common room he turned to face her with a raised brow hermione smiled nervously at him why would you do that he had nowhere else to go she mumbled there was a good portion of pity that came with the guilt in her tone the slytherins were making life hell for him in his common room so he was just wandering the halls he wanted to see ginny too she turned to look at dumbledore sitting behind his desk with his fingers neatly entwined together i did not stop to think about the consequences she bowed her head but kept her eyes on him to see his reaction and was relieved to be greeted with benevolence in his eyes she raised her head a little yes it was predictable that we would arrive at the subject of miss weasley and mr malfoy being together after all it is all the whole school talks of was dumbledore smirking under normal circumstances this would be a grave offence with an equally grave punishment hermione held her breath but seeing as you were acting out of kindness instead of deliberately breaking rules i see no reason why we should not do what we can to bend the rules hermione let out her breath in one rush all was well once more so where will draco sleep tonight she asked still thinking in her friend boyfriend best interests i think now there was blatant mischief in his eyes that seeing as how comfortable he is amongst the gryffindors that we might be able to put a temporary bed in the boys dormitory hermione gaped then shut her mouth with a snap they were not going to like this but sir she started hurriedly no buts miss granger he waggled a finger at her i sure that he will get along fine with the other habitants of the room she knew that he knew and just sat there watching him with wide eyes like a fish out of water so i can go she wanted to escape dumbledore dragged out the space between her question and his reply she just watched him intently finally he nodded slowly yes you may he started turning to severus you as well severus he nodded shortly at him and stood hermione pushed herself up from the chair to stand beside him severus was starting to wonder exactly why he had needed to stay with them for that he shook it off hermione was standing close to him once more and the heat and sweet smell of her hair was enough to weaken him they both started for the door severus got there first and opened it for her to go through when dumbledore spoke be careful both of you until graduation he called after them cryptically hermione froze but did not turn to look at him she took a deep breath and continued to leave severus shot him a bewildered look before exiting and shutting the door behind them both what was that she looked up at the tall brooding characteristics of severus he briefly met her eyes and then ripped them away the old codger knows he sighed hermione gasped raising her hands as though she was going to cover her mouth then changed her mind how she seemed surprised by dumbledore peculiar ability he on the other hand was just relieved that he was going to leave them be that was more than he could have hoped for i have no idea but that is simply what he does he knows everything that happens in hogwarts he could feel he was detaching himself a little from her but that was just his way of dealing with his brush with unemployment hmm she frowned at the floor a moment later she buried her face in her hands catching severus totally off guard he could not see whether or not she was crying but strongly suspected she was for an uncomfortable moment he just watched her at a loss for what to do then he turned and pulled her against him her arms were crushed a little but she did not care he wrapped his arms tightly around her wondering what exactly he could say she was shaking a little in his secure hold her quivering frame sent shock waves of realization through his body they reached the bottom of the stairs and where the stairs stopped moving they stood still silent his black robes cloaked her and made her feel sheltered he was keeping a careful eye on the exit to be prepared for anyone coming in but no one did when after a minute or so she still had not stopped quaking in his arms he stroked the full length of her back in an attempt to calm her she shivered at the soft touch and slowly she relaxed but he did not let go when she sighed against him as a sign she was now no longer sobbing he pushed her back a little to look her straight in the eye she dragged her gaze up to meet his and he saw her russet eyes were watery and red she swallowed as he looked her over carefully she could not remember seeing such concern before he brought a hand up to her cheek what wrong he asked silkily his voice quiet and gentle she suddenly looked angry at herself for crying and revealing her insecurities i dontthink i could deal with the reactions her voice cracked a little w when they find out i thought i could because of what i did for ginny and malfoy but she pressed her face against him once more in an effort to hide it a completely different thing the sound of her voice came out muffled from his clothes he frowned we donthave to worry about that yet he said soothingly but she could not see the anxious look on his face not for a while yet hermione sighed once more against him taking in his scent and feeling a lot better suddenly he tensed and at first hermione could not understand why then she jerked away from him hurriedly when she heard strawberry bonbon being said by most likely professor mcgonagall outside severus likewise pushed her away from him so that she was standing a foot away and when the wall opened to reveal mcgonagall they both looked up at her nervously she looked slowly from one to the other taking in the watery eyes and blotchy cheeks of hermione and when she saw severus standing next to her she needed no further explanation she gave severus and accusing glance as she walked past them and up the stairs severus it is not nice to make the students cry she tut tutted as she got on the moving staircase she sent a slightly pitying look at hermione but did not say any more severus narrowed his eyes and glowered icily after her until she disappeared from sight maybe we should go somewhere else hermione muttered as severus glared at mcgonagall back he turned to look at her indeed you should return to your house he said there was a slight stiffness in his order but she ignored it he looked as though he was just about to leave her there but hermione held onto him once more alright she said and put her face up to his to kiss him he shot a worried look over her shoulder at the staircase but hermione doubted mcgonagall would come back down so soon she smiled at him for a moment before she closed the gap between them the feeling of kissing him once more conjured up hot liquid bliss that flowed through her veins in place of blood she melted against his touch and felt a lot better this way than she had a few moments ago her worries died in an instant it was too right to be wrong the warmth of his kiss made her realize she did not need the approval of anyone only him she did not want to break the kiss and when he did she was sorely disappointed and wanted more she looked up at him and was frustrated to find that he was looking at her uncertainly as though he still did not feel he was worth her time she put a hand up to the back of his neck and stroked it softly repeatedly and was pleased to feel him shiver he closed his eyes why did she do this to him suddenly the door at the top of the stairs creaked open and hermione leapt backwards away from him in surprise he shot an edgy look at the stairs and gestured she should leave quickly ahead of him she caught his eye shortly and turned to leave before mcgonagall came down she stepped out of the opening in the wall and raced away so there would be fair distance between him and her as she rushed down the hall she already felt withdrawal symptoms like an addict she wanted to turn around and run right back to him but she could not her breathing became shallower she needed him to be able to relax and to breathe she was certain that if she was kept away from him long enough she would shrivel and die like a plant without water as she slowed and rounded a corner she frowned in thought she was attracted to everything about him his tall dark brooding posture the black of his eyes and the sweep of his walk but did she love him she had not even considered it until now she roughly shoved that thought away she did not want to think of such things just yet when she got back to the common room she was not too shocked to see draco sitting with her friends and although this was still a new sight for sore eyes she did not even bother to wonder at it ginny was sitting in his lap and ron and harry were twisted violently in their chairs to block out the view as much as possible they were still playing chess she noticed as she approached them ginny grinned up at her hey look who back she was smirking and draco raised an eyebrow at her but harry and ron overrode her happiness to see her again with their curiosity harry green eyes locked on her what happened he asked her standing up as if he was going to help her over to a chair but she sat down in the spare one before he could do anything she sent him a shaky smile and he sat down again watching her closely she looked at ginny and draco who were staring at her knowingly and appeared far too smug for her liking but when she looked at ron and harry she was met with questions in their eyes and she sighed softly dumbledore wanted to speak with me she began and suddenly the smugness disappeared from their faces hermione slumped back into her chair feeling heavier and dragged down now that she was without severus the softness of the chair was a welcome feeling what why ron looked horrified by the fact that hermione might get in such trouble it was about the fact that i let draco into the common room harry glowered at draco but hermione shook her head no no it alright dontworry she sighed exactly how should she break it to them he said since i was not acting in my own interests that he would bend the rules however the boys tensed and she saw draco looked a touch guilty for being the cause of her troubles but it did not bother him that much since he cannot go back to his own common room she hesitated yes malfoy raised an inquisitive brow hermione shot an uneasy glance at harry then ron ginny frowned there will be temporary bed set up in the boys dorm what ron roared hermione shrank in her chair harry looked as though this was too much even though what had already happened had been far too much as well ginny went pale things had been going well so far draco had almost been accepted as a presence by the other gryffindors but how badly would they react to him moving in several heads turned but by now the urgency with which people attention shifted to them was definitely diminishing what now called seamus from the other side of the room he almost asked lazily several more people looked up from what their business malfoy moving in with us harry appeared surprised at the sound of his own voice and his looked around the room disbelievingly come again said the equally disbelieving voice of colin creevey says who snapped dean thinking they were just trying to trick them draco wasntallowed to move in with them was he dumbledore said harry still sounding sceptical lavender gasped but she was the only one this time draco had not so much as moved a single hair since he had first heard the news he had been more stunned than all of them moving in with the gryffindors he would have thought this would be his worst nightmare but he found a small part of himself wanted to belong the fact that he had no where else to go was what had made it more evident why did he do that the eyes of the people who were bothered to look up now turned to hermione who seemed the only person who could answer such questions seeing as she was the one who was usually behind such happenings she looked up at them and for the first time since she had started being under the accusing eyes that breakfast she actually felt petrified of their attention she had blindly helped them and not once considered the stares she got but now now she was imagining different reasons for why they watched her every move she imagined that they had found out about her secret would it really be worse than this how much she outwardly kept her cool glancing once at ginny on malfoy lap he said it would not be wise for malfoy to go back to the slytherin common room at this moment and that since she was going to have to twist his words some since the gryffindors have been so kind so far that he was sure that we could find it in ourselves to let him sleep here too some looked happy others miffed but harry ron ginny and draco watched her sceptically once everyone else had lost interest and turned away ron leaned forward he didntsay that did he frowned ron knowing her too well hermione raised the corners of her mouth nervously and shook her head no her nervous smile dimmed some but he did say that say that we have been getting on well enough and he was sure that you would be gracious enough not to rip out his throat ginny snorted and looked at harry and ron be nice wontyou she glared at them they looked tentative and for a long moment it looked as though they were seriously considering ripping out his throat but eventually they nodded slowly ginny grinned broadly at them then snuggled against draco hermione felt insanely jealous all of a sudden ginny had her forbidden relationship and people had accepted it and she was free to love malfoy in public what more she wanted to be in severus arms in a similar way to the way draco held ginny but she knew that it would take a lot for him to be so easily accepted so much was wrong in her world it had been flipped upside down in about a month or so but she refused to imagine a life without severus they were meant to be there was no question sorry no telling when the evil will kick in even i dontknow well sort of i know when but not how much more writing also i have to give u guys the situation at hand 4 me to give u an idea as to when i can next update i am using my dad portable for the internet connected through the phone line to his company

for the first time draco actually goes into the common room and the gryffindors though shocked let him stay at lunch severus is sent to fetch her to go and see dumbledore they think that he knows and he does but he is just warning her about letting draco into the gryffindor tower he bends the rules and even lets malfoy sleep in the boys dorm however on their way out he hints that he knows about them hermione starts feeling some of the pressure and wishes that like ginny and draco that their secret could just come out and people would accept it a cute poem i wanted u to hear to a friend there is a magic upon your lips there is a chasm to your gaze and the sound of your voice ethereal music of a dream portrays there is a serenity on your brow there is a darkness in your hair a flurry of floral spirit all around where er you walk floating in the air there is a treasure if eternal wisdom in the dimple of your cheek a fount of health flowing from your mind which to all hearts doth speak within you is a world of spring that soulful chaotic season which i cannot possibly forget but dote upon without a need to reason emil aarestrup 1838 hermione was in heaven if heaven was this good she was lying on the large leather couch in front of the enormous fireplace with severus her head was lying on his moving chest they had not spoken once but it might ruin the atmosphere hermione shuffled a tiny bit closer to him and he held her tighter beside him he was leaning against the arm of the sofa half upright his beetle black eyes did not move from her face he had a hand resting on her upper arm gently she was wearing a sleeveless shirt and jeans so the touch on her arm felt more electric than usual her curls spilled over her shoulders and she closed her eyes sighing he could feel her frame rise and fall in his grasp he was clad in his usual black gothic victorian style clothes and robes the slender fine boned fingers that brushed the warmth of her skin made her want to shiver their legs were spread out in front of them entangled loosely the heat of their bodies mingled and in the cold of the dungeons hermione was kept sufficiently warm the way he held her was as though she was delicate and precious and if not handled correctly would fall apart he rested his chin at her temple as he watched the radiating glow emitted from the writhing amber flames she placed her hand softly on top of his that rested on her arm several stray strands of straight black hair brushed her cheeks and she closed her eyes the sensation of being held in such a way made her sure her life was complete severus breathed in deeply beneath the smell of her sweet hair was the soft milky scent of woman he would never have imagined that he might one day hold the warm body of a young intelligent woman such as hermione it was too much for him to contemplate so he left the thought to rest while he watched the fire burn brightly there was a sharp crackle from the sputtering fireplace and he felt hermione shift slightly against him sighing again he looked away from the fire and into her large brown eyes that were looking back up at him he kept his features cool and intense and she smiled at him before pressing her head against his chest once more his eyes slid over to the small table beside them on which lay a good sized book of poetry they had been reading together for a while before they had decided to settle for silence he lowered his gaze from the red backed book to the flames and rested his chin back on her temple she closed her eyes again her lashes stroking the thick black material of his long robes this was the most wonderful feeling she had ever experienced and it filled her up like a warm creamy liquid i love you severus she whispered soothingly severus was caught off guard she loved him loved him it seemed surreal things were in their early stages yet and those words were not ones easily taken back so she must have meant them then it led to the question did he love hermione her presence calmed him and he felt so free of his own chains that he had locked himself in she affected him in ways he had never thought possible so did he it wasntproper it wasntsupposed to be i love you too hermione he replied his silky voice also in a whisper but he was met by her slow rhythmic breathing and he realized she had fallen asleep in his arms while he had paused he looked down at her to be sure and indeed her eyes were softly closed and her face was relaxed it was his turn to sigh and he held the sleeping hermione tighter he was unsure of what to do next he did not want to wake her could he sleep here tonight he hardly ever slept properly anyway and often he was unable to sleep in his own bed he saw no reason why not so he shifted into a more comfortable position and with his head resting on hers he closed his eyes too where were you asked a panicked harry when she trundled into the great hall at breakfast to sit with her friends she was on cloud nine so she was not really listening fully to all he said but replied as if everything was normal she sat down on the hard wooden bench next to ginny and looked over the table at harry and ron i woke up a few hours early and couldntsleep so i went down to the library to read poetry she smiled sweetly she picked up a piece of toast and dropped it breezily onto her plate the smile remained on her lips as harry and ron shrugged at each other finding her excuse a valid one then where were you last night ginny said quietly while the boys across from her were immersed in their discussions of quidditch while ginny was turned away from him draco pulled a face over her shoulder at hermione their looks were accusing you were out all night she frowned glancing across the table to be sure they were not heard hermione suddenly felt patronized she glared at their blameful looks since when do i need to ask permission for what i do from you she snapped draco leaned across ginny and stared at her hard did you sleep with him he hissed ginny pushed him away from hermione sending him a disapproving look but not apologising to her for his actions she wanted to know as well hermione gaped at them are you serious she spat back ginny and draco shared a look no not like that i did sleep with him draco paled drastically and ginny jaw dropped but i slept in his arms by the fire they both relaxed immensely ginny even appeared happy oh that ok then she smiled at hermione that sweet draco stuck out his tongue i think it disgusting he said brusquely snaking an arm around ginny as he did hermione just grinned back at him squashing his bitterness with her ungrounded contentment that ok she said cheerfully as she spread marmalade on her toast i dontcare what you think draco glared at her as she started to eat her breakfast but she ignored him for some reason ginny liked this snarky pompous slytherin and so she was going to do her best to get on with him that did not necessarily mean she would be friends with him but she was shocked when after a while draco joined in harry and ron discussion on which possible quidditch team would win the world cup next year ginny was just as surprised but even more relieved it seemed that draco was staring to fit in how odd nothing much else happened for a while about ten minutes behind her severus swept past them up to the staff table she breathed in deeply to catch the scent of musk and sandalwood but apart from that breakfast was uneventful hermione finished her toast quickly but as usual she stayed back to talk with ginny and waste as much time as possible when exactly is your graduation again i heard they moved it ginny asked turning to her before finishing off her pumpkin juice hermione frowned resting her head in her hands hmm it right after the hogsmead weekend which is two weeks from exams so that would be about half a week from now she had mixed feelings about graduation she would be finished with school and being a minor and student but at the same time she was leaving her home of seven years she couldntbear the thought oh that so soon ginny sounded miserable hermione glanced at her i dontknow what i ll do next year without draco and you three it going to be hard i ll miss you so much hermione ginny unconsciously held draco tighter i not gone just yet she tried to lighten the sad mood save the sorrow for the last day she decided she may have room for a little more juice and helped herself to some suddenly there was a sharp noise of a fork being tapped against a goblet that rang through the chatter and a silence spread over the hall hermione and ginny stopped talking and draco harry and ron looked up at the head table mcgonagall had tapped her fork against her goblet in the way she always did when there was going to be an announcement while everyone else was watching dumbledore waiting for him to stand up and talk hermione stared at severus who was looking as irritated with the world as usual their eyes met for a moment and just in that instant all general malice melted and faded from the deep blackness in his eyes hermione dared a smile at him seeing as everyone else was distracted i am sad to inform you dumbledore began in his usual speech voice that there have been some slight alterations in the schedule for the next hogsmead weekend there were mutters of disappointment flittering across various groups of friends but hermione stayed silent frowning instead of it being this weekend or a weekend at all for that matter it will be moved to two days after graduation i would like to make clear that i am sorry for those who desperately wanted to go before hermione was sure he shot her a blatant glance but she had sincerely hoped she had imagined it but she remembered severus offer he wanted to meet her at hogsmead technically she would still be a student for a few more days but now graduation would come before hogsmead making it so that if they were caught severus would not loose his position as hogwarts potions master was this deliberate on dumbledore part hermione was unsure he had done similar things before it would not be unlike him but on the other hand was she being paranoid thinking everything was about her somehow she looked back at severus to see his reaction and saw he was rigid and she knew he was thinking the same thing well if it had been intentional it was definitely in their best interests you cannot be serious gasped hermione as ron burst into a mischievous grin his eyes lit up with mirth and there was a notable glint of something that reminded her of fred and george and speaking of fred and george not another weasley wizarding wheezes hermione looked shocked although slightly tempted by the notion harry smirked a little to himself too he watched the end of the corridor they walked down with pleasant interest as he listened to ron convince hermione his black tufts of hair sticking out in every which direction seemed to be getting messier with each year the three of them and ginny and draco who were trailing a fair distance behind were on their way out to enjoy the summer sunshine and despite the light and airy tone were all savouring each and every second they had left in the castle the sun shone bright through the window high up the walls causing bright shafts of light that highlighted squares of stone ahead of them their feet though after the years they failed to notice it anymore clacked loudly against the floor i more than serious he said brightly moving a little away from her to suggest mock offence i sure malfoy would have no problems with it either i mean it not like the slytherins are his friends any more he frowned a little but the mirth did not fade but what kind of example will i be setting being head girl she tried to argue ron just saw this as an opening hermione was not rebutting the idea but instead pointing out that it was inappropriate so she did want to who says they ll figure out who did it he grinned once more and hermione couldnthelp join him the spark in his eye was contagious her smile was slightly guilty but broad all the same they can guess she started but harry cut her off reassuringly but they wonthave any proof he began to smirk as well and the three of them walked arm in arm around the corner and found themselves at the head of the large stairs of the grand entrance hermione struggled with her morals but part of her loved the ingenious inventions of fred and george despite all her attempts to drown these feelings she tossed her hair back over her shoulder behind her she could hear ginny and draco muttering softly between themselves and for a moment is compelled to dream of being in the arms of severus she forced her thoughts away from the graceful and sinister presence known as severus snape it is a great idea she started reluctantly considering the effects of such a stunt ron grinned twice as hard if possible and the edges of his enormous smirk almost touched his ears he took his arm out of hers and clapped it on her back cheerily hermione stumbled a little under the strong slaps ron strength has grown over the years and he appeared unaware of it that the spirit hermione he beamed and hermione brushed aside the curls that had fallen back into her large brown eyes but if i get in any sort of trouble you two are coming down with me she added as a condition fair enough harry shrugged he also slipped his arm out of hers as they neared the base of the elegant and wide steps i cantwait to see the look on their faces when they wake up in the morning hermione notices that ron hasntlooked so happy for a long time but what they were about to do was something of his speciality we owe fred and george so much he sighed in respect however the smudgy smirk on his face revealed the better of him how much would they charge for a stunt like that he glanced to ron past hermione for his answer his green eyes filled with a slight curiosity oh they have to give us a discount because well we re us hermione snorted and i their brother plus the mere idea is going to make them proud we ll be advertising their latest product to all of hogwarts so i would say that it would be a maximum of two galleons he scratched his head messing up his bright red hair his face scrunched up a little at having to calculate the simple math the day of graduation then or shall we do it after harry seemed to be thinking a lot more practically than ron because although it was his idea hermione observed that he has not even considered these things until now hermione spoke for him graduation although the most effective time is probably not such a good idea because the place will be swarming with students and staff and we will probably get into worse trouble if we were to be caught the day after we will no longer be students which might mean they can no longer punish us harry nodded ron just thought about what she said as if he needed time to weigh the differences in value of being punished but making the slytherins suffer more on graduation smart thinking he agreed and they got off of the bottom step together graduation was now closer than ever today was saturday and graduation was on monday they strolled towards the wide open doors and the glowing sun outside that cast its rays gloriously over the grounds there was a distinct smell of summer in the air hermione wished she had worn a skirt rather than jeans she slipped her arms back into ron and harry to keep the atmosphere that she loved so much and would miss so dearly when they left for good she looked down at the three pairs of feet that keep in timing with each others and she felt relieved that she would be staying with harry and ron after she left hogwarts maybe luck would have it that they would all get into the same university she was torn between many and was going to send off to hundreds that she wanted to attend harry and ron had no idea as to which schools were the best and so they planned to apply to all the ones she had suddenly she felt both boys tense beside her she raised her head looking up from their feet trying to find the source of the boys sudden apprehension she glanced at harry and ron both were radiating a stiffness that she recognised as being reserved for only one person her eyes slowly moved up to confirm her suspect her gaze was met by a rough black glare and once again she felt as if she was the only one there she blinked hard to try and plant her feet firmly back on earth and looked to harry to see his reaction harry was staring back darkly at snape as he shot a look of distrust their way severus did not stop to insult them instead he just strode past with no more than a glint of contempt in his eyes at the sight of harry and ron flanking hermione she knew that he was keeping up appearances and for once she wished he wouldn t she wished he would sweep over to her black cloak flowing out behind him and pull her away from harry and ron and into a soft kiss but alas he passed them silently and ron watched his back carefully until he was sure snape was not going to turn back hermione sighed silently has either of you noticed harry leaned closer to them both lowering his voice how snape has been avoiding us lately hermione and ron frown together hermione tried to save this topic from becoming a serious curiosity avoiding us he just hasntbothered to come right up to us and insult us i think he just cantwait to see us leave she convinced him he shot a disbelieving look to ron who shrugged back it just strikes me as out of the ordinary he made a final stand but hermione logical explanation crushed any final worries he may have of course but school has finished we haventhad classes so of course we are going to see less of him it not like he avoiding us and besides she added her tone had switched to her special tone reserved for explaining things in class and to people who could not understand their homework why would he want to see more of a person he hates harry nodded feeling stupid and ron shrugged once more his freckles were suddenly pushed up his cheeks as he broke into a sunny grin but isntmy plan just ingenious he said brightly he had steered away this boring topic and back to his area of expertise yes ron ingenious agreed harry although there are only so many times we can continue to praise you for your thinking hermione laughed softly her shoulders shook with amusement we re going to have to enlighten malfoy on this he ignores harry comment at his expense he the one with the password to the slytherin common room we ll need his help he frowned once more in thought and slowed dropping behind hermione and harry hermione was the first to react and slow down too then harry dawdled too he rolled his eyes at ron who still seemed unrealistically boyish in his actions he was scampering over to his sister and her boyfriend who were contented to stay behind until rudely interrupted by him yes said draco coldly but politely his silver eyes fixed on the unsure characteristics of ron but all hinting in his stare was lost on ron lack of ability to pick up on subtly dontget so prickly he grinned back quashing draco icy glare you may like what i ve got to say his blonde eyebrows twitched up in interest just as harry and hermione approached them pacing was a habit of the past yet severus was unable to shake it off he continued to strut up and down in front of the over warm fireplace he knew that it was too hot but he was unprepared to change it just yet until it became totally unbearable the thick material of his robes weighed him down and suffocated him they were retaining his own heat and he finally after trying to distract himself from the growing warmth he stopped his pacing he put his fingers up to his chest and pulled off his outer robes in one fluid movement he folded them twice loosely and laid them on the chair that hermione had not transfigured then his fingers rested on the stiff buttons of his frock coat but he hesitated and left it on the dark mark was still burning black under his skin fresh from the dark lord unexpected meeting last night severus a soft female voice that caressed the chords of his heart he dropped his hands quickly and turned to face the source of his name he came eye to eye with hermione who was smiling gently at him hermione her name still sounded peculiar on his tongue she came to him he looked her up and down was it possible she had grown more beautiful in the day they had been apart she looked wonderful in her white summer skirt and light blue camisole her hair spilled over her shoulders half way down to her waist in large golden brown curls her eyes were shining and it was hard for him to believe that she was so pleased to see him again once she was right in front of him he put his hand on her waist and kissed her shortly on the lips he pulled back and glanced at her questioningly his pitch black eyes searched for any signs of worry but he found none is there something the matter she saw the concern lighting his stare the comfort that filled her at his protectiveness made her smile not at all as he watched her he couldnthelp adore the sweetness of her smile he took a hand from her waist and gently brushed the tips of his fingers against her jaw i missed you her voice quietened mainly because she was so snug the way she was right now that she darentdisturb the moment she slipped her hands up around his neck and lightly slid her fingers into his long black hair she knew that she could never feel this way again with any other person the warmth of his breath against her cheeks made her close her eyes and she sighed quietly he leaned forward to kiss her again she complied more than willingly his straight raven hair brushed the curve of her cheeks and made her heart flutter against her chest but before he got to taste her once more she laid a finger delicately on his lips to hold him at the close distance for a moment he stopped but kissed the tip of her finger softly while looking into her light chocolate brown eyes what wrong he wondered frowning a little hermione smiled again and any doubt he may have had was sufficiently put to rest i just want she paused she was looking apologetic and maybe even a pinch guilty to savour this she hurriedly continues as if she has to explain because soon i ll have to leave hogwarts and i wontbe able to see you again for a long time she sighs deeply and she is unaware of the sadness she reveals in her features as she looks away from his face his scowl deepened i see what exactly are you planning on doing once you depart he was never really bothered what a student did once they were out of his care but it still sounded too strange yet he knew he loved her he could not for a moment remember feeling otherwise he stroked the skin of her neck and smirked slightly when she shivered and leaned into the touch she opened her eyes again and tried to stay as serious as possible staring straight at him i planning on becoming a charms mistress his smirk broadened with a faint pride a wise choice he nodded approvingly however you re skills in potions are no less than perfect i would have thought you would choose something in that field hermione smiled at his subtle teasing there was a tingle under her skin where his fingers traced the line of her neck she couldntconcentrate but somehow managed to i ll be gone for two years at college she tried not to think about it but she knew she had to tell him it was important and a decision of life but i can spend the three years of practical under the instructions of professor flitwick his black eyes glazed with puzzlement and the scowl spread across his face easily but flitwick is not a master of charms i know but he has more than thirty years experience that good enough by their standards then i will be able to enter a proper establishment that will take me to the level of mistress that alone should take four years after that i am unsure but if flitwick should ever retire i plan on applying for his position so that about nine years altogether hermione suddenly looked daunted that was more time than she had spent studying at hogwarts she hadntthought of it so far yet learning was what she loved to do and the thought of never having to learn again was scary in itself so she was happy to prolong it with her aim of becoming a charms mistress so i wontbe able to constantly see you for two years she noted the sadness in his voice and felt glad once again that he returned her feelings but you will be back at hogwarts for a full three years there was a certain hope in his silky smooth voice i dontwant to be gone for so long she titled her head a little when his finger brushed a sensitive spot on her neck she took a deep breath then continued but that wontkeep me away from you i ll make time he appreciated the determination she had she looked back up at him and his face was mere centimeters away from hers she dug her fingers deeper into his black hair as if it would comfort her it still feels so strange severus lowered his hand slowly from her jaw and put it back on her waist hermione nodded slowly missing the feel of his fingers already i know she smiled soothingly at him and he did not understand the feeling that accompanied it her tenderness made him soften inside and he could not comprehend how a simple smile could affect him so she leaned closer and pressed her lips against his and once again he felt struck by feelings he had long forgotten existed but the fact that what they had however right it felt was forbidden made it seem more exciting and yet he felt as if he shouldn t the touch of a woman lips against his made his heart speed up and he felt undeserving after all what had he done to deserve this he pulled her closer delighting in the feeling of holding her weasley draco gaped at ron in a slight disbelief how surprisingly slytherin of you his silver eyes sparked with a tint of evil glee he smirked as he listened to his new adaptations of his original plan for the day after graduation his blonde hair fell loosely around his eyes and he shot a glance at ginny sitting next to him she was talking to hermione in a low voice leaning over her dinner so did not catch his eye ok so you admit i am a genius he dared to ask ron was reluctantly starting to enjoy draco company he pushed his freckles aside with his normal lopsided grin draco glared sarcastically as he considered what ron said watch it weasley he said softly with a strong warning although i have to admit it is not bad ron grinned harder and draco narrowed his eyes to make sure ron kept in mind exactly where he should stand which is a good thing because he almost slapped draco on the back in a friendly gesture harry just ate his pie quietly keeping his eyes on both draco and ron with amusement he was starting to come to terms with the fact that he and ginny were together he was also happy to find that his feelings for ginny were fading slowly they could not have been as strong as he had thought they were if they left so soon so in a weird way he was grateful to find out this way instead of dating ginny and finding that their relationship should fizzle out after a while hermione and ginny were muttering softly between themselves about her situation with severus ginny was in awe about the star struck look that came over hermione when she spoke of him so you re going to become a charms mistress ginny chirped that is just perfectly adorable the charms mistress and the potions master of hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry together ginny beamed perkily as she untied her hair to let it hang loose over the shoulders of her short sleeved green shirt that did not clash with her straight dark red hair in the slightest hermione mock shuddered that sounds so corny she shuddered again and ginny laughed dontdo that she brushed some brown curls over her shoulder to stop it from dropping into the plate of pie ginny being particularly bold stared up at the staff table and watched severus as he glared sourly at the hall filled with students hermione looked in her direction and her eyes landed on severus his brows were pulled into his trademark scowl and he eyed the hall in front of him with distaste his elbows lay on the table and his fingers were neatly entwined his black robes shrouding him as his shoulder length black hair as if he wished to hide himself from the pointless cheerfulness ginny quirked a brow and turned back to her perplexed i still dontget what you see in him she added totally befuddled in her tone hermione tore her eyes away from the dark stare of severus you donthave to she said it softly as if she was half not listening to her own words just dreaming if you saw what i did then i would find myself with unwanted competition hermione was cut off by a loud snort from the seemingly delicate nose of ginny believe me she assured hermione as she dug into her apple pie with her fork that is one thing you do not have to worry about hermione smirked sleepily and turned back to look at the head table tomorrow was graduation it seemed as if it had snuck up on hermione when she was not ready for it not only was it graduation the day that turned them into adults officially but it was the start of their last week at hogwarts hermione did not want to leave despite the fact she had always eagerly anticipated becoming an adult and being able to prove herself to the world as she crawled into bed she could have sworn she heard the rustle of long black robes but when she looked up she found herself deeply disappointed to see that it was merely the dark red curtains being ruffled by the night air no matter she would finally finish with being a student tomorrow and could be more at her ease and lax about hiding their thing they had she closed her eyes and immediately images of severus snape sweeping amongst rows of simmering cauldrons dangerously smooth and deathly quiet in his steps the sternness in his slitted black gaze that straightened backs and stiffened frightened students the texture of his fine black hair the touch of his fingertips against the skin of her neck she had to stop thinking this way she decided as she buried her smile in her pillow what would pavarti and lavender think if she went to bed every night smiling but then again she didntcare what they thought oh my gosh oh my gosh oh my gosh oh my gosh hermione was muttering beneath her breath rapidly in nervous excitement as she squeezed ginny hand they were walking slowly down from the gryffindor tower she harry ron draco and ginny they were dressed in their special robes that had been provided just for the occasion and their special board hats with silver tassels except ginny who was forced to stay at hogwarts for one more year ron was looking pale with tenseness and his freckles on his nose stood out strongly in comparison his lips were dry and parted slightly his blue eyes refused to blink and his neatly brushed orange red hair was parted down the middle properly for the first time hermione could remember harry on the other hand looked purely blank at hermione constant muttering he looked over at her with no emotion in his emerald eyes he nodded his black haired head in comforting understanding i know he mumbled draco was speechless like ron but he outwardly appeared cool and collected despite his lips being pressed hard together his blonde hair was slicked backwards away from his face he looked refined and harry tried to ignore the resemblance with his father his silver eyes remained fixed forward they were walking in two rows harry and ron were walking ahead looking equally unnerved as they went down the main steps at the back ginny was in the middle draco had an arm around her waist and hermione was squeezing her hand tightly ouch ginny pried her hand free of hermione as her grip tightened even further oh hermione blushed guiltily sorry gin ginny rubbed it a little to make the stinging leave but looked back at hermione with sympathy it ok she smiled i know how nervous you must be you re graduating today she said brightly there was a flake of remorse that escaped her lips that she failed to smother she did not want to reveal to hermione exactly how sad she was that she was going to be saying goodbye seeing as this was supposed to be a happy day oh ginny she picked up on the miserable note and reached for her hand again she was careful not to squeeze her too hard you ll join us next year dontworry dontbe sad ginny nodded slowly careful not to look hermione in the eye keeping her blue gaze on the passing marble steps in front of her hermione had to stop walking for a second to untwist the base of her temporary robes provided for the day she struggled for a moment with the thick stiff black material then trotted to catch up with the happy couple ahead of her she flipped her hair back over her shoulders before plonking her hat squarely on her curly haired head when she was in line with ginny and draco again she brushed the irritating silver tassel to the side of the hat instead of where it had been dangling before tickling her nose ginny felt out of place being dressed in normal clothes a plaid skirt and dark red tank top with an orange print that resembled smoke she had her hair loose as did hermione her scarlet strands stopped just below the base of her neck hermione had felt the need for something special today and had several small white flowers held into her locks by spells parents were not going to be attending graduation they never did for one it would reveal to more people than necessary as to the whereabouts of hogwarts and for another it was would be a hassle to cart hoards of parents all the way up to hogwarts this was just a simple acknowledgement of the fact they were now technically adults they started to head past the great hall and to the oversized doors of the grand entrance the ceremony was to be held outside hermione held her breath and wanted to close her eyes as they walked through the doors this was it they were going to be free of school rules and regulations forever scary ginny was now squeezing her hand in reply there was a slight feeling of numbness spreading slowly through her but it was dulled by her overwhelming nerviness they stepped into the haze of light from the darkness of the hall and walked down the few front steps in silent unison the sun was high in the sky to show that it was indeed late morning and the whole landscape was a bright vibrant green with the health that accompanied summer the sun shone down harshly on them and the black of their graduation robes absorbed the heat and magnified it as they reached the ground hermione swore she was slowly baking already the large square hat shadowed her face keeping her cool and prevented the white flowers randomly spread about in her hair from wilting in front of her ron jammed his own hat roughly on his head messing his relatively neat hair harry kept his off for now as did draco hermione kept her eyes on the path they walked letting the others lead her to the stage she didntfeel she should look at it just yet it might make it seem real after a short while of strolling tensely hermione dared to raise her head and look at the stage her large brown eyes rested on a high raised wooden platform with steps in the center she thought it was maybe a little large for a ceremony with a moderate amount of people there were rows of chairs before the platform enough for the whole seventh year and some extra for those other students like ginny who wanted to watch there were ropes of ribbon lining the edges of the stage in the four colors of the separate houses and against the back single wall were large embroideries of each houses emblem in front of the steps of the stage teachers were milling around tensely and they were talking in low voices to one another the air was alight with mutterings of soon to be graduates who had arrived before they had and were standing in loose clusters beside the chairs harry and ron stopped just before the back row and waited for hermione ginny and draco harry fiddled anxiously with the edges of his hat and hermione slipped her hand out of ginny as they approached them there was a moment hush in which the five of them where they looked at each other faces trying to read exactly how nervous the other was ron was the first to try and break the silence it was starting to frustrate him he sucked in a deep breath so he was speaking a little louder and more cheerfully than was necessary how long do you think it gonna take hermione took her eyes off of harry and looked to ron fidgeting nervously i think it going to be much shorter than most she spoke what she thought as she tried to calculate how long it would take maybe as short as about twenty minutes it just the handing out of the degrees and a few awards as well i dontthink there ll be any extras like a valedictorian good draco nodded briskly i cantstand those tediously long ceremonies anyway ginny nodded in agreement and there were mutterings of opinions between them after a while the conversation fizzled out and they returned to their silence shuffling and glancing at each other hermione checked her watch the event should be starting any minute now and just as she thought it dumbledore proceeded to climb up the steps of the large wooden stage hermione turned to watch and sparked the interest of the others who chose to look in hermione direction dumbledore strode across the platform with his periwinkle blue robes dragging at his feet a deafening hush fell over the crowd as if silence was an ice cold liquid being spilled over their heads a sea of eyes were now watching every move dumbledore made across the stage and each step he took could be heard even from the back the sound of the birds and swaying leaves seemed to stand still there was a podium to one side of the stage and it appeared to take forever for dumbledore to reach it he stood behind it and curled his fingers on the edges of the wooden stand please be seated he said politely gesturing with his right hand for them all to sit his voice didntneed to be magnified for such a small ceremony there was a light twinkle in his eyes that resembled pride harry was the first to react moving over to a chair near to the front they followed shuffling through the light green grass and walking in the aisle created down the middle of the grey chairs directly up to the stage they sat down together on the same row and turned back to look at dumbledore who was waiting patiently for the rest of the seventh years to sit hermione eye wandered down to the teachers who were lined up in front of the red yellow green and blue ribbons decorating the stage as you all know began dumbledore in his usual knowing speech voice this graduation will only be a small recognition of your seven years learning here at this school although i am sure that after exams your brains may not be able to be put to use for a while he smiled at them but all that could be seen was his beard twitching when i call your names you will come up and accept your degrees and then shake hands with each teacher in turn as if on cue which it probably was the professors turned and filed up the steps of the stage one after the other mcgonagall first dumbledore paused his speech to wait for all the teachers to line up behind him mcgonagall stopped in the wake of him and all the other teachers lined up beside her all the sitting students watched good naturedly as they waited for the teachers to finish getting into position hermione noticed that severus was the last one on the stage and he strode over to the very end of the line once he had swirled about on the spot to face the crowd with a look of loathing dumbledore continued before we begin i would like to say one thing you all have been wonderful students and each of you has great potential it was all severus could do to hold back a snort work to the best of your abilities and contribute to the wizarding population as much as you can with your knowledge i hope i will have the pleasure of seeing you all again someday did dumbledore sigh hermione shook her head to herself no he was always strong and stead fast it wasntlike him to show signs of weakness like that now dumbledore stuck a withered hand into the large pocket at his side and he gently pulled out a scroll and his wand he placed the scroll carefully on the podium before waving the wand under the sweeping motions he made with his wand a small table appeared with a large pile of more scrolls each with a calligraphic silver name imprinted on it he put his wand away and picked up the scroll on the podium again he opened it grandly with one hand with the other hand he straightened his half moon spectacles to read better the summer air was still and quiet and people waited as dumbledore opened his mouth to speak again starting with the hufflepuffs dumbledore called out the names of each hufflepuff student as he said their names from the pile of scrolls beside him one that belonged to the name called out would unbury itself from the rest and slowly rise into the air hovering about a shoulder height dumbledore would take it out of the air and hand it to the graduate when they came up the stage the first hufflepuff on the platform hugged each teacher after shaking their hands and for one moment it looked as if he was going to hug professor snape but when he was given a look that could kill from his former potions teacher he shrank away and just shook his hand before leaving the stage after that no one dared to even consider hugging the glaring potions master but no one really had planned to anyway next it was the ravenclaws and half way through ginny mock yawned and started patting hermione tassel in a bored and playful manner hermione just let her do so but threw her a disapproving look from beneath the square board time went by slower than they had imagined but the nervousness only faded a little draco decided to place his hat carefully on his head at last and harry wisely followed suit it seemed that the gryffindors were going to be last because after the ravenclaws dumbledore started calling out the names of different slytherins when it was draco turn ginny gave him a quick kiss on the cheek but on his way up he received a record number of poisonous glowers from the other slytherins hermione was starting to get impatient by the time he finally got to the gryffindors she kept glancing at severus and forgot her discreetness in a few minutes she would no longer be a student the second the degree touched the flesh of her hand she would be free to love whoever she pleased she noticed severus was hating this event and held back a smile she could understand his thinking he wanted to be down in the cool dungeons in the company of his books and potions to him more intelligent than the whole graduating class she stared at him without really being aware that she was she loved his black hair that framed his face perfectly and added a strong touch of character to his being his choice in clothes reflected his behaviour more than his actual personality because beneath the shrouds of black cloth was hidden a multitude of colors she was fascinated by the tall dark and sinister appearance he held throughout the years in truth he probably needed her more than he would ever realise for years he felt he could live without love and slowly the point of existence seemed to dissolve but hermione wanted to change that she already had she was yanked out of her reverie when lavender name was called soon it would be her however she kept her eye on severus she wished she could kiss him again and smiled smugly as she remembered the night she had spent in his arms by the fire the way he touched her set off sparks under her skin what was it about him that made him so perfect for her maybe it was like the yin and yang hermione granger dumbledore voice rang through her thoughts and startled her she jerked upright and in a daze she strode up to the steps of the stage slowly the reality sank in as she finished climbing the stairs and she shoved her dream world to the back of her mind it seemed to take her way too long to walk across the wooden platform up to dumbledore who grandly plucked her degree from the air and held it out for her to take she took it from him and the touch of scroll against her palm was frightening in what it represented she was finished with school he smiled at her with his benevolent old eyes she smiled back she reached over and gave him a quick hug before turning to mcgonagall standing behind him now she had to work her way along the line of professors shaking their hands and hugging them each in turn mcgonagall hugged her so tightly that she couldntbreathe and of all the teachers she was the must reluctant to let go obviously she had been more attached to hermione than she let on severus watched as it was hermione turn to receive her degree now she was technically an adult but he knew she had been an adult for while already she wore flowers in her hair and he thought they looked better on her than they possible could on anyone else he wondered if she would dare to hug him like she did all the other professors if she did how should he react should he glare her down for appearances sake but if she wanted to then he didntto singe her like that he shook the irritating thoughts from his head what will happen will happen beside him hermione was bending down to hug a beaming professor flitwick the tassel dangling from her square hat swung over her eyes as she stood she brushed it aside and moved over to severus she stood in front of him for a quiet moment and just looked at him studying his eyes not wanting to seem peculiar to the watching crowd behind her she held out hand for him to shake never taking her gaze off of his face he took her hand smoothly and hermione relished the feeling of his soft delicate touch she really wanted to kiss him then in a blinding instant she realized she could she had her degree in her other hand so she was free to kiss whichever teacher she wanted without getting them fired as she shook hand with severus in front of the eyes of the seventh year she glanced at dumbledore standing by the podium he was smiling warmly at her the whole class was staring at her back how would they react when they found out there was always the possibility that they would not find out but the odds were not in their favour if she were the one to enlighten them would it be better yes it would she concluded because questions such as why didntyou tell us were put to rest she looked back into the black irises and the delicate touch of his hand made her want to fling her arms around him in one rash movement she had to control these sort of desires they just made her want more than what she had and she had a lot there was a word for that greedy she thought of the crowd behind her and of dumbledore encouraging smile he had said be careful until graduation they didntneed to be careful any more when hermione raised her hands most people thought she was going to be so bold as to hug him severus even thought that but instead she pulled his face close to hers before she could think about it and kissed him lightly on the lips there was a horrified silence and even the birds stopped singing to watch severus stiffened in surprise and sharply jerked away from her what the hell did that girl think she was doing hermione did not want to turn around just yet to face the crowd of bewildered and disgusted graduates she just kept her face close to his and he searched her eyes for an answer he had no idea what she was thinking there was a whole crowd of people behind her and the whole teaching staff beside him i think i hallucinating mumbled ron pale as a sheet of parchment although a lot greener because i just thought i saw hermione kiss snape he turned to harry who was also gaping and his face was also devoid of blood did you see it too yes harry rasped not once blinking the shocked stillness blanketed the air and for a while nothing moved nobody spoke and all eyes stayed glued to hermione ok more in the next chapter thanks for sticking around so long my uncle is so nice this is his internet that he paying for very expensive so i dont have long thank u for hanging around if you are hanging around the writing going slow i about 1 3 done with 15 but now i know this story should be done by about 25 definitely no more than hirty ince i am doing this to improve my skills please please please tell me that you see come improvement from the first and latest chapter this chapter if not then i going to have to try harder which means writing slower hint hint no actually be honest please note dark mark burned on his arm at the beginning of the chapter oops i being such a spoil sport i ll stop now snakecharmer chapter 17 the skull and the snake lucius annaeus seneca fallaces sunt rerum species the appearances of things are deceptive i just wanted to let you know who said the opening quote for magic of the ancients oooeee i dontthink you guys will thank me much for this chapter or the next few so far severus and dumbledore discuss serious matters the dark circle wants hermione as a supporter and since she is not skilled in occlumency the only way to not make severus a suspect as a spy they decide hermione should sit out one confusing meeting and then they will be convinced that she is on their side once they return to hogwarts the baffled hermione is to be enlightened there are serious flaws in this plan but it is a better option than revealing severus alliance or sending hermione into hiding or so it seems hermione takes severus to hogsmead where she buys him a proud black cat by the name of decimus later the next day a couple of days after that severus is expecting the inevitable call which he receives he apparates to hermione new home where he collects her and apparates her away when severus had apparated her away from her apartment with an unreadable expression hermione had not anticipated this the colors had melted away from the lighted entrance of her new home to the darkening sky of a forest it was a clearing between the trees and the stars in the sky hung melancholy in the changing blue the trees were all pine and there was an icy edge to the freshness of the air beneath her feet was the unmistakable sensation of earth and bracken hermione was standing close to severus almost touching and facing one another so at first she did not look around her at her new surroundings she did notice something odd however just from standing before severus with her wrists in his gentle grip his clothes had suddenly changed as they had apparated she had never seen him before dressed like this it was a long dark blue almost black robe with a large hood pulled up over his head it shadowed his face and in the dim light she could hardly see the overwhelming regret in his eyes he had just changed his mind he wanted to take her back but it was too late now it was too late hermione could feel a familiarity about his attire but her nagging mind could not place it the pressure on her wrists from his fine boned fingers increased a little severus a falsely relieved and surprised voice of a man to her back sounded through the split second silence hermione started a little in surprise she was not thinking properly just letting things happen severus had brought her to this secluded area and there was the voice of another man we were wondering whether you would make it severus recognised it as the sardonic tone of lucius she turned around slipping her wrists free of his grasp there were sounds of muttering in low voices of other people as she spun round which only increased her confusion still keeping close to severus she finally laid her eyes on what was behind her she let out a quiet gasp of shock and took a step backwards sharply right into severus he caught her by her shoulders tightly as she pressed her back up against him normally she would be grateful for the touch but right now his firm grip on her upper arms felt more like he was holding her into place to keep her from escaping hermione jerkily lifted her hands to her mouth in a blind reaction to the sight she was totally unprepared for the cold air was penetrating her skin through her sweater and she started shivering she seemed to be attracting the cold the warmth of severus behind her gave her the only comfort but she was too stunned at this instant to see that yet what had made her gasp and take a step backwards was the sight of hooded cloaked figures wearing identical white masks they were all looming in the formation of tight large circle the leering blankness of the masks terrified her and the hooded figure standing opposite her in the center of the circle in an abundance of black thick robes shrouding even his hands and hiding his face from view her eyes flickered widely to her left and right as if to find a gap to escape but the cloaked figures reached right up to either side of her and severus severus it was as though she had only just remembered he was here he would make sure she was safe she gave the circle that was staring at her one long terrified glance before turning back to severus he wasntmasked to her utmost relief but when she looked to his eyes for comfort there was none waiting for her the thin icy air filled her lungs sharply as her breathing became shallow the adrenaline was already overflowing in her bloodstream and it made her shake uncontrollably as she pressed herself against him for reassurance she buried her face into the unfamiliar robes of his chest and clenched the soft material with urgency her hands stopped shaking with the security of the fabric though the feeling of security was short lived severus in turn lifted an arm tenderly and wrapped it around her back crushing her curls as she breathed his scent through the folds of clothes in shuddering gasps severus felt as though his heart was being suffocated hermione was petrified quaking and leaning into him for safety what had he been thinking to consider her capable of such a task the scent of pine filled the sense of every death eater there and the sky was nearing pitch black the mutterings were increasing between the masked people but nothing actually happened for a long moment as they waited for the form in the center of the circle to do something unknown to all his thin almost non existent lips had pulled back into a sneering smirk welcome a soft hiss escaped the shadow under the hood and hermione gasped again hermione granger he jeered with a hint of laughter in his terrible voice she tensed sharply at her name and severus observed her intently with his insides burning from pain at having to watch her suffer it was the voice of voldemort she knew it well and had never had to face him before alone without harry at her side severus was standing frozen and firm behind her shaky frame at the sound of her name being played with by his tongue hermione twisted her face keeping it squashed against his chest she looked out of the corner of her eye to the lord of evil standing calmly several feet away her breathing situation worsened so that she was gasping and hardly any air reached her lungs resulting in no oxygen arriving to her muscles and organs to revive them she wanted to ask severus beg him to explain what exactly was going on why had he brought her here he had brought her to a death eater meeting what was she to do would they kill her torture her she shook harder and severus arm around her back gripped her tighter for security she could not get the words past her lips they died in her throat and if even they didnther lips were too heavy to part anyway severus did not say anything because he didntknow what to tell her the sooner this was over with the better for all the others knew hermione was going to be a supporter and was just too terrified of their powerful presences to think straight it did more for their ego than severus liked to think about hermione did not answer to the greeting of the dark lord and watched him fearfully out of frightened brown eyes you are most likely wondering he continued hermione listened carefully holding back on her shaking and jagged breaths as much as possible why we are honouring you alone with this meeting me she repeated in a small voice was she to understand that this meeting was for her voldemort did not mind being interrupted surprisingly because her tone was not disrespectful severus flesh went clammy hermione voice was no more than a stifled squeak from her constricted throat a result of her fear which was his fault an honour you most probably feel the full weight of he persisted hermione gaped like a fish what was he talking about you are an intelligent girl miss granger a girl of your mental power has much to offer you have succeeded with over excellent grades in every subject and test laid before you hermione mind was slowing down to an almost halt because she couldntcontemplate what had happened that turned hell upside down and made the most evil man alive start praising her grades what is it that you want her voice a choked but reasonable rasp it carried out into the emptiness of the air and several more mutterings sounded silence he hissed and immediately there was hermione even tried to stop breathing so there would be silence like he wished for he turned back to her and she pushed against severus harder and he had to use strength to keep them both standing it should be obvious granger what i want he gave her a long hard stare from beneath with red coal eyes which hermione thankfully could not see for the hood he did not go on to explain what he wanted leaving her to gape against severus chest as she considered all the possibilities each worse than the one before snape the voice floating from under the cloak was demanding hermione felt him tense up sharply at the sound of his name and she gripped the cloth of his death eater robes tighter bring her forward her head snapped up to look at him with wide eyes surely he was not going to bring her closer to the dark lord as he wished her breathing went irregular and harsh once more as her heart sped up there was no expression on his face other than blank obedience the far off look in his eye made her heart go cold she did not know that he was putting all his concentration in to keep his thoughts clear so voldemort could not read them he had no choice but to bring hermione to the center of the circle as he wanted hermione was not in control of her own body and she automatically let severus take her there trusting in his decisions nothing was lighting the way anymore other than the stars and the large moon creating waves of shining glow for them to see by it lit the tops of the pine forest and the outline of circle of death eaters the shadow of severus leading a weak and shuddering hermione clinging to him dearly to the center of the ring was observed by the still eyes behind masks as soon as severus broke the circle the nearest death eaters glided forward silently to close the gap the ring was once again complete and trapped them in like rodents in a cage she found that no amount of shuddering gasps could supply her with enough fresh freezing air mcnair hermione froze at the contrast between his previous soft hiss and his now sharp yell of a command the sound of the executioner name rang through all their ears and after a quiet moment where nothing sounded hermione and severus stopped in front of him severus looked up with brief surprise that he immediately masked mcnair specialized in two things killing and severus frowned surely not what else did he specialise in he could not think hermione watched with her wide brown eyes her head lifted off of severus so she could see mcnair step away from the ring to their left he took two quiet steps forward then stopped the gap was not closed yet she studied the unrevealing mask acutely and could for some reason sense that he was smirking it was not visible however severus was holding hermione tightly now it was unnerving her instead of comforting her but severus did not understand what was going on he did not know this meeting was for her alone he had though she was merely to attend be questioned on her knowledge and allowed to leave as a suspected supporter whatever he wanted with her up close and needed the assistance of mcnair he did not know but deep inside he did know and did not want to accept it he wouldntbelieve it hermione looked up into his sharp unyielding black eyes under the large navy hood he looked back with as much encouragement as he could yes master mcnair called with his greasy sneering voice hermione shuddered violently it was a horrible voice your skills are required he told him and hermione got the distinct impression that mcnair should be honoured that he had skills at all from voldemort voice mcnair face was not visible to show his self pride but his posture definitely improved he pattered over to them feet invisible beneath the hem of his special robes his back was pompously straight as though he had been given a new reason to live if hermione had been able to think right or at all for that matter she would have found his dependence on the words of voldemort to be sickening he approached from the left and hermione eyed him with a flickering frightened stare she kept a hold of severus but no longer rested her head against him trying to see more of what was going on it was now she severus mcnair and the dark lord standing in their own small circle inside the larger one under the star speckled sky hermione turned back to severus looking up at him with confused eyes that looked on the verge of crying but the shine in them was caused by the moon and not tears even so the sight stabbed at severus heart he could not reveal his regret and reluctance to do as he had done in front of voldemort so he turned to the only emotion he could show that he actually meant care he leaned down and kissed her temple softly he knew every eye was on him but did not care they knew that he and hermione were together she leaned into the touch but when he pulled away and straightened the look in her eyes was the opposite of comforted she was frowning with confusion and her own heart was being squeezed with an emotion she couldntplace and was entirely new to her how sweet he played with the word that was totally unheard of from his tongue there were collective snickers from around the ring at voldemort words and hermione looked dispirited any console she had gathered from the small act of love was lost with the jeering of the others she opened her mouth then closed it like a fish a couple i approve of and a good choice in partnership if i ever saw one intellect and intellect sense and sense i only hope that as a pair your contribution to the circle will increase hermione brain almost halted and her heart stopped beating for a second voldemort approval was the last thing she desired hermione leaned back onto him and severus inhaled sharply at voldemort words he recovered fast thank you master severus said respectfully with a light nod of the head which was intended as a bow the word master came out choked as though it was forced but thanks to his skills in occlumency voldemort had no reason to suspect he was anything other than happy with the praise hermione was lost in all this severus thanks for a compliment she did not want only bewildered her further and she would have been certain he did not think of that as sufficient praise shall we voldemort asked but everyone knew it was a rhetorical question the silence and fresh air were no longer pervading her senses and hermione became totally oblivious to her surroundings malfoy he snapped from beneath the overlarge black hood once again the name of another death eater rang out and echoed off the edge of trees hermione head twisted round and she saw from the place she had been standing with severus a death eater come forward with a bundle in his arms she gulped she was slightly afraid and intimidated by lucius malfoy he strode over to them as though he was worthy of the honour he stopped in front of them under the cold gaze of voldemort from beneath the hood bending to a stoop lucius malfoy held up the bundle of material to voldemort hermione stared at the thing questioningly her heart pounded against her ribs and ragged breathing sped up whatever the bundle was it was the making of dark magic or for the uses of it voldemort in turn accepted the bundle picking it up with his long fingered white dead looking hands not giving lucius more than a second glance this did not hurt his pride in the slightest lucius backed away with his head still bowed low carefully and silently until he was back in his place of the circle there was then a short expectant silence voldemort took his sweet time as he proceeded to unwrap the dark blue cloth his deathly pale fingers delicately peeled each layer of soft material away from the other the whole circle watched avidly he chose to speak at the same time as he busied himself with the duty you are aware miss granger he began giving her a glance which hermione could not see for the shadow cast by his hood that there is no such thing as good and evil just power and those who are willing to seek it he questioned her severus had to rescue to situation hermione should not reveal her alliance and knowledge is power he added bravely it could go either way he could be furious that severus avoided hermione question for her or he would be impartial voldemort red eyes locked onto him and he could sense it he kept his face passive and emotionless hermione felt the horror and anticipation from all other death eaters filling the air and it fed her nervous adrenaline rush her muscles werentshaking as bad now that the hormone had begun to fade as it raged once more hermione gripped severus tighter to keep from crumpling and collapsing to the hard earth severus felt her fingers dig into his robes and in automatic response held her tighter a mistake a huge mistake this decision was a huge mistake and dumbledore was partly to blame for it as well hermione was aware of the sensation of touch of his arm around her back more than she had ever been in her life her adrenaline fed senses were on hyper drive very good severus voldemort whispered and severus tried not to but could not help let out the small breath he had been holding voldemort was almost done unfolding the cloth that seemed unusually thick and large for the small object within yes knowledge is power that is why you are worthy enough granger severus held back the frown of confusion worthy of what surely he was not speaking of supporting their side alone when voldemort finally held up the large fabric and revealed what it was severus felt his heart stop it took all his concentration and will power not to let his eyes widen in shock and to pull hermione back away from the thing he held what he held from his long fingers dangling close to the dead bracken were long dark blue robes identical to the ones he now wore his mind froze in his concentration on occlumency he did not have a spare thought for what he was going to do also in voldemort hands was a white mask which made hermione eyes grow wider than they were and she opened her mouth to obviously attempt to speak but she couldn t not a sound could pass her lips he was holding out them for hermione to take but she didn t she stood rooted to the floor and glued to severus gaping at them as though they may bite severus once again was called upon to rescue the situation he reached a slender hand forward and took them for her she watched in shock as his fingers curled around identical material and voldemort let go severus took his arm away from hermione back and she felt a great deal colder than she already was wherever they were it was freezing at night despite the fact it was summer forcing himself to do what was required of him he opened the robes and held then in a gentleman manner for hermione to slip into hermione stared at it for a moment then looked up blankly at severus in a heartbreaking way he never felt so atrocious in his entire life when he nodded at her in an encouraging motion she blinked twice in disbelief trusting his judgements too much than was for her own good she pulled away from his warm body and felt the gooseflesh rise from the iciness she expressionlessly and robotically slipped her arms into each of the wide dark blue sleeves keeping her eyes on his and his alone once the robes were resting safely on her shoulders he let go hermione made no move to do up the front clasp or pull up her hood she just stood with her open robes her arms dangling numbly hidden by the large round sleeves and equally open expression looking up at him severus wished she would stop she was making it worse than it was he did what he considered the best thing and bent forward to place another small kiss at her temple before slipping the mask into the large pocket at the side of the robes he knew hermione would make no move to wear it if he handed it to her he didntrealise this only confused her further her mix of emotions combined with this annulled any possibility of her thinking straight with the robes hanging on her shoulders and the lingering sensation of the kiss at her temple she felt a great deal warmer and the gooseflesh began to sink out of sight voldemort was watching pleased mcnair was standing at the side digging into his pocket for something hermione turned back vacantly and leaned her back against severus as she looked to the two with unblinking eyes voldemort turned his attentions to mcnair who had just seemed to find the tool he needed from his pocket it was made of metal and had a sharp tip that was all hermione noticed lift up your sleeve he sneered greasily and hermione could only look to severus to see whether he approved and he nodded at her again she blinked numbly and began to roll up her sleeve to reveal the cold skin of her forearm her actions were not her own and she may as well have blacked out for the amount of control she had over them severus sucked in a breath as he finally came to terms with what was about to happen and that he had no power to change it it was too late he still could not believe it entirely even when mcnair sharply snatched her by the wrist and yanked her arm closer to his eye severus hated him for touching her at all even in such an insignificant way this wonthurt much he snickered a round a chuckles followed his comment and hermione stared with wide eyes at severus the whole while hermione was numb her flesh heavy clammy and cold she wanted to vomit she was going to vomit in fact if she didntvomit she might faint her brain was icily jammed and like a broken record all she could think were the last words she heard see you next time then next time next time there was going to be a next time severus and she were one of the first to apparate to just outside the winged boars of the gates she had collapsed to the hard ground of the earth immediately and sat in the dark of the night curled up into a shivering ball she supported herself on the dirt with the palms of her hands but it didntdo much good the blue sleeves of the robe fell over them and puddled the ground her hair hung down on either side of her face blocking out the world with a shower of brown curls that she was grateful for her shoulders shook and she had never felt so weak and out of control of her own body each shudder created a ripple throughout her as though she was as light as a feather she didntknow where severus was and her mind tried to block him out as much as possible see you next time then he was crouched down in front of her silently watching with his observant sad black eyes his identical navy robes pooled around him in a threatening circle formation he would not touch her he had tried to touch her shoulder comfortingly and she had violently shaken him off and pulled away he didntrisk repeating it he just watched her closely to make sure she was alright only once he was certain of her being ok would he turn to his own emotions of self hatred and sickness hermione urge to vomit was growing so strong that when she did actually vomit it was a relief she went pale and sallow skinned before spilling her guts on the earth there was nothing dramatic and poetic about this situation it was the raw and pungent stench of human fear and decaying adrenaline she coughed and hung her head with her eyes closed after relieving some of her painful twisting on the inside severus didntmove away sharply as instinct advised he wanted to stroke her hair and hold her to make her calm down but he just watched with cold black eyes see you next time then wearing the blue robes with the white mask sticking out of the pocket she had never felt worse but all sensation of the earth beneath her palms the reek of vomit and the softness of the death eater robes was lost to the one thing that consumed her every thought and would for nights to come upon her lips was the drying vomit her pale cheeks were stinging with lack of blood and crying out against the sharp edge the cold night air brought with her diluted pupils hidden by her closed lids her lashes were suddenly razor sharp and felt as though they were slicing her the sensation was annulled by the silent tears she was unaware of slipping down her cheeks and soothing in the most minute way and on her arm the fresh stinging from the remnants of pain pain not of torture but of a more sinister nature see you next time then there was to be a next time she would be sure to know of it the flesh of her forearm the only part of her body not heavy with after fatigue was burning hot against the cloaking sleeve of her new robes the whole area around the single spot was a rash red and radiated electric waves of heat it was all she could think of heaven knew it hurt it hurt more than it actually did because the amount of attention she paid to it was overwhelming the rest of her skin was cold but not so bad that the gooseflesh rose again she seemed to only just remember that she had thrown up and moved backwards away from the puddle sharply she pushed herself back with the force of her palms and shuffled herself a couple of steps back away from the stain and away from severus he watched intently but did not come closer to close the gap from between curtains of fine black hair he remained frozen in place only his eyes moving he was still avoiding thinking about what had happened if he did he may as well vomit too what had taken place was no more part of his plan as falling in love with hermione was yet both had happened on her knees with tears smudged across her cheeks she was certain that her numbness was permanent one quiet sob escaped her lips and her shoulders shook harder severus could not bear it anymore see you next time then he stood carefully in one smooth movement and took a couple of steps over the vomit so that he was right before her she was huddled in a shaking rocking huddle with her curly hair hanging over her shoulders down her back and shadowing her bloodless face he felt the last of his heart that wasntalready suffering squeeze he bent down again so that he could look at her bowed face he needed to comfort her for his sake as well as hers it hurt him to see her in such a state hurt him to unimaginable proportions when his face was in line with hers he saw that now her bloodshot autumn brown eyes were open and resting on his with a blank coldness that begged him to keep away he could do no such thing he held out a slender hand to her face to push aside the hair before stroking her damp cheek for reassurance she watched his fingers with flickering eyes as they neared her pale skin her shaking did not subside the bitter acrid taste of vomit filled her mouth the closer the fingers got to her the more her pupils seemed to constrict in fear the second he touched her face comfortingly she jerked backwards away from the caress with wide horrified eyes he was startled she finally managed to find a new strength born from an angry breaking heart to stand it was a shaky motion but she managed to push herself up very quickly to look down at the crouched form of severus in his robes indistinguishable from hers if he had had his hood pulled up that would have been the last straw that broke the camel back luckily he did not she stumbled backwards a little and almost toppled as she straightened but regained some form of control the solid cool earth under her feet was moving and uneven and she felt as though the world was spinning severus stood too to try and help her he took her arm to support her and she yanked it away hurriedly and gasped at his touch as though it stung on the other arm that he hadntgrabbed was the dark mark fresh under her skin and black as the sky now the skull with a snake coming from its mouth was permanently imprinted into her flesh for all eternity and as her thoughts turned back to the burn on her arm so painful and hot they led to the image of severus standing at her side as it happened she had not been able to think frozen in confusion and disbelief she had depended on severus to protect her had it been too much to ask he had merely stood by and allowed the deed to be done severus knew that this reaction was not uncharacteristic but all the same he felt some of the weight of what he had done start to sink in when she threw his arm off of her and lurched backwards see you next time then it was a miracle she did not slam down onto the cold dirt and that she remained quaking but standing she looked at him with terror and her breathing once again quickened severus retrieved his arm and just stared at her unsure of what was the best thing to do he looked her over standing back from him pale with her hair hanging limply around her and on the blue shoulders of her new robes still balancing on her in the pocket of her robes was the white mask and severus tried ignore it as best he could you she spat her voice was shaking with uncertainty and pain she started to shiver harder than before but her tone was firm and angry dont touch me severus looked blankly surprised but his eyes revealed his grief a single tear escaped her control and slipped down her already damp cheeks from her raw red eyes she took a couple of shaky steps backwards in the direction of the castle keeping her unsteady gaze on him all the while once he was a far enough distance away from her to be sure she was safe she turned and began to attempt to race up to the castle gates but couldntmanage more than a stagger severus was quick to follow but kept his distance she was incredibly unstable and from the looks of it was getting worse he did not know how to feel and so the numbness consumed in a way he was grateful for because it allowed him to think in a sensible way he watched her sadly as she stumbled up to the castle as fast as her weak legs could carry her ok even smaller chapter eensy weensy ickle little chapter but the quality u have to admit is getting a teensy bit better what i was hoping to accomplish with this story i about a three quarters of a chapter behind schedule there was supposed to be a lot more here but it is a one piece kinda thing so that ll have to be the main part of chapter 18 i tried to make the images as real as they were in my head if you could see it as clearly as i did that means i ve done my job and thank u because it doesntwork without ur imagination however looking back on some stuff i feel a bit lame in some parts wont tell u which cos i dont wanna put u off luv snakecharmer ps yes the cat will have a later part to play though i cant say its incredibly important pps i am starting to go off this story which often results in me dropping them but i will continue to write for as long as i possibly can i am going to force myself to finish it even if it is painful because i need to say i have completed one large story having a few large ones hanging not on ff however for days now the begining of chapter twenty has not been touched i have moved over to es for a while but i will return when i feel i wontcrash into depression chapter 18 hysterics so far i think ull have to reread the last chapter if ur depending on what i say here severus takes hermione to the dark circle and she is given the honours of being recruited as a death eater oh dear and severus just stands numbly by while she is turned into one when they get back to hogwarts hermione obviously reacts in a shocked way and refuses to let severus touch her before stumbling back up to the castle she had been almost at the entrance of dumbledore office and it was surprising she made it so far before the inevitable happened staggering through the empty half lit corridors of stone in the middle of night with no one but severus who was following her at a safe distance there she was weak and limp every step was a fight and win of her self control over her shaky muscles she supported herself meekly with a slipping hand on the smoothed granite of the walls she could see the gargoyle with her watery bloodshot eyes and with the encouragement of such a sight she had quickened her pace that had turned out to be imprudent seeing as she instantly tripped and fell to the stone ground ungracefully she collided with the floor with a smack that rang so thick it was sickening to severus stomach he heard fast approaching steps and did not stop to observe which of the staff was coming to his aid before racing forwards to help hermione he did not stop to think in his natural reaction that she did not want him to touch her she lay on the floor unmoving and sobbing silently cloaked by her curly hair so he could not see her face she made no attempt to move from the floor her navy blue cloaked back was hunched and arched into an uncomfortable ball shape and she shook with each invisible sob her whole body wracked by the movement the sadness was overwhelming her choking her mind and constricting her throat until the insides of her trachea were touching she couldntlook at severus she had been staring at him the whole while they had permanently stained her forearm her self value had dropped dramatically her arm was still fresh with pain and it just made what had happened so real she wished it werentso reality sucked really sucked he bent down before her with serious caring blackness in his eyes the sounds of the footsteps were close he stroked a hand tenderly down her tensed back fluidly to comfort her that was all that he intended and he wanted to take her up in his arms but he couldn t she was too withdrawn her ragged breathing halted for a long moment and severus thought she may have calmed down but he was wrong she had held her breath sharply and when she looked up with her eyes to observe who was tending to her nerves she reacted as he should have expected if he had been thinking straight she gasped and sputtered a few incoherent mutterings as she pushed herself away from him as quickly as she could with her sweaty hands sliding on the smooth floor helped by the sleek material of her overlarge sleeves her vomit stained lips were beginning to turn raw and peel already and despite the unblinking of her wide flickering red eyes the tears flowed as effortlessly as ever several locks of hair were clinging to her moist bloodless cheeks severus once again withdrew his hand sadly and respectfully moved a little backwards to allow her the space she wished for the footsteps were almost upon them he could tell dumbledore was the one who was racing over to them all he could see were the two identically clad figures wearing death eater robes one curled up on the floor the other crouched down with the hem puddled around them he immediately recognised the black shoulder length hair at a distance as belonging to severus but of the long haired brunette death eater he did not know of severus did not speak but hermione after staring at him with uncertain hate in her brimming eyes did donttouch me she cried and if she had not been rasping for air would have shrieked it at him severus flinched back from the cold address dumbledore stopped over his shoulder observing the confusing display as he tried to fill in the blanks himself severus could hear the footsteps and his keen ears pricked up that they belonged to dumbledore after several years the ability became natural stopping to look down at the face of the female death eater he had never seen before and trusted severus enough to know she were no threat he was not prepared to see what he did his kind blue eyes clouded darkly behind his half moon spectacles and his heart went cold almost stopping in foreboding severus refused to take his pained eyes off of hermione for one second to glance up at dumbledore she was attempting and failing to force her eyebrows to glower at the cause of her suffering it looked more like her face was twisting and crumpling painfully and she gave up bursting into a fit of sobs burying her ghostly face in the sleeves and her hands severus felt his heart bleed he really wanted to hold her just to take away the mind blowing terror and sadness in her eyes severus dumbledore started keeping his shocked stare on the sobbing figure whose noises were inefficiently muffled by her sleeves and hands is that miss granger severus had never felt worse even when stella died even when his mother had died just before his coming to hogwarts this beat it all his insides were thick clammy and not held into their proper places it seemed as though they were floating around and the sensation was the most unpleasant and unwelcome he had ever experienced hermione was now on the verge of choking on her own loud sobs and was already way past hyperventilating each sound that ripped from her sore constricted throat he felt as though a piece of his flesh was being torn from him painfully his nerves were electric and tingling despite the fact hermione was the only one who had endured actual physical pain that had made him feel shoddier when he realized it it seemed there was no end to exactly how bad he could feel yes he said numbly he wasntaware that he had parted his lips or that the sound had past through them or even that he had heard dumbledore to begin with he could not look into her eyes without seeing himself reflected in them dumbledore felt his own blood go cold but reacted adequately as severus expected he brushed past severus crouched before her and swooped down on the quivering hiccupping girl hermione watched him through a gap in her fingertips that were uncovered by the robes dumbledore was nice a benevolent old man he wouldnthurt her he bent down quickly and hermione let him help her up by her upper arms she didntown any strength of her own so she depended on him to hold her fragile frame upright he managed easily he was sickened by the state she was in no girl her age should be put under such distress she continued to mask her face frightfully with her hands and severus was burning inside at not being able to touch her dumbledore had an arm around her back under her arms and she was amazed she had the energy to move her feet at all they were just outside the gargoyle anyway so dumbledore did not have to support her stumbling form far severus stood slowly feeling as though he was carrying the weight of a ton of bricks his head began to spin with images of the sharp metal instrument piercing the skin of hermione arm he had every opportunity to stop it but under the eye of the death eaters he had frozen it was too soon to reveal his alliance he was needed he reasoned but all the same he should have been more than willing to throw his duty aside for her he hadn t in hindsight he was a fool his eyes followed the two shadows of the old man holding up hermione stopping before the gargoyle he did not hear dumbledore utter the password but he must have seeing as a moment later the thing sprung aside and let them through he immediately caught up with them in quick paces that were not his own his robes billowed out behind him in his rush and he felt as though he were not moving rather floating along because he could not feel the stone beneath his feet he passed through the gap before the statue moved back into place and let them walk ahead of him they were on the moving staircase and severus stepped on it too it carried him up behind them and he kept his eyes down taking his eyes off of her did not stop him hearing her quiet sobs that she was trying to hold back and violently failing he heard the two get off the top step and the sound of his office door opening just as he reached the top of the stairs himself he was depending on his automatic gear to keep him moving at all because his own thoughts had shut down and he was running on what he supposed he should think dumbledore and hermione were gone but the door of his office was wide open and severus naturally walked over to it assuming he was to be at her side as dumbledore tried to calm her he had no more gotten one foot through the door when he saw dumbledore after having settled the shivering hermione in an armchair coming back over to him with a firm look on his face severus did not fully understand when dumbledore shook his head and pointed a withered hand over his shoulder in the direction he had just come he blinked and tried to focus enough to comprehend hermione lifted her frightened eyes over the tips of her fingers from her curled position of the armchair to watch as he pointed severus out of the room and then followed the two left in silence and her iridescent eyes trailed the movement as the door swung shut behind them there was a soft click and hermione realized she was alone she lifted her head a little and her drying cheeks with the clinging strands of hair were still white with lack of blood and her head was starting to throb painfully pulling her hands away from her face revealed the frightened hue taking control on it and making her appear sunken and drawn from lack of cheerfulness she tried to absorb some of the friendly vibe of dumbledore nicely lit oval room with the ticking objects she still did not recognise the attempt to feed off of the atmosphere to retain some form of comfort not her own was useless she only felt worse with every second and fresh tears swelled out of her painfully sore eyes and the hot watering of them as they fell away was becoming more and more unpleasant she hardly noticed however after pulling herself together enough to silence her loud sobs keeping them down to quiet shakes that attacked her whole body she could hear voices through the door there were the sounds of rough questioning and numb quiet replies she could decipher barely anything but what could was that dumbledore sounded angry and disbelieving she understood this completely of course wearily lifting her head to listen better she heard the sound of retreating footsteps once again her heart began to race dumbledore wasntgoing to leave her here alone was he even worse would he leave her here with the reason for a fresh tattoo on her forearm no he couldntbe so cruel her breathing was coming in harsh gasps that were growing more irregular the more she hyperventilated she could feel the shape of the burn under her skin plainly as though it was drawn into her memory as well as her flesh the part of her that wasnthot and stinging with fire was cold and soggy as though she were dead her blood must have stopped circulating ages ago she wildly considered and why she had not dropped already was a mystery to her the door opened again and hermione instantly clutched her mark through the dark blue sleeve of her robe automatically and didnteven notice until her skin cried out in pain and she withdrew her hand immediately it throbbed fresh under the sleeve and she did all in her power to ignore it she turned her attention to the door and who was behind it she let out a relieved sigh that sounded more like a soft rasp from her sore throat dumbledore was there severus was not there is much to discuss harry ron ginny and draco were called upon and brought to hogwarts by floo in total confusion they hadntturned in for the night as they had all been worrying for her safety hermione wasntaware they were there at first she kept her face buried in her hands and cried non stop until she heard a sharp gasp it came from the direction of the fireplace where dumbledore had left her with the promise of returning quickly she was curled up on the chair with her legs tucked under her and her head bowed down with her curly hair hanging down on either side of her face and the sounds of her crying escaped it ginny had been the one to gasp when she had seen the sight the moment she set foot out of the fireplace beside her were the three boys lined up looking totally blank and staring at the hunched figure unsurely ron was pale with worry harry was red with anger at whoever did this to her and draco was going slightly green when he recognised the robes she was wearing before any of the others did he began to shake his blonde head but no one noticed hermione tried to stifle her noises and only her overwhelming curiosity managed to contain them she took a couple of moments to try and control her body and her incessant shaking after five or so incredibly deep breaths to attempt to stave off her irregular gasps she could pick her head up from being squashed into her palms and the blue sleeves and peer up at who else was there the brightness that hit her eyes of the room was stronger than she remembered ginny would have gasped again if her breath had not caught in her throat hermione was a living wretch her cheeks were so pale they were starting to look blue ish her eyes were wide and bloodshot with raw hot tears staining them and her face her nose was red and her lips were quivering following her first instinct ginny ran forwards to the large periwinkle blue wool armchair hermione saw through the wet haze a red haired blur racing over to her and the corners of her lips twitched as she tried to contain another fit of hiccups the blur could not be anyone else but ginny she was feeling a little better but still the worse she had ever felt in her life her insides had sunk to her feet and her head was spinning with a headache ginny was upon her in a moment and flung her arms around her wracked shoulders comfortingly the warmth and security of her friend was all she needed to remind her of who had indirectly done this to her she could not help it as she broke down into worse tears against ginny shoulder the boys began to walk forward completely at a loss for how to comfort their friend also they where dying with interest as to what had happened to her to get her in such a state hermione felt so weak that in any other situation she would have considered herself a baby but her whole body was heavy and shaking totally beyond her command and her head hurt so much that it was blinding ginny was rocking her and shushing her soothingly but it did nothing but give her the comfort of knowing someone cared it would help in the long term but right now the thought did nothing for her dumbledore passed the boys and walked over to his desk to take his place behind it ginny was ignoring everything except her dearest friend who was nothing more than a rare pile of nerves hermione was sobbing into the material of her shoulder and she concentrated every thought of the thing on her arm when would the burning subside the boys gathered around the two figures as dumbledore made himself comfortable in his own large chair and observed with sad blue eyes what wrong whispered ginny in a calm motherly tone when hermione sobbing settled down a little because of lack of air the boys attention peaked and they listened intently but draco already had a vague horrible idea of what she would say hermione didntwant to answer but she knew that it would be better to let them know sooner she tried to control her ragged breathing so she could speak it was the most miserable failure and her choked sobs repeatedly escaping her lips prevented her from making a single voluntary noise she lifted her cumbersome head that was threatening to explode from pain her raw eyes rested on harry protective expression first who was looking ready to murder whatever cause for her distress it melted into pity at her glance before she looked to ron who was looking as though he may have caught her feelings like a disease for the lack of blood in his freckled cheeks draco on the other hand was looking at her in disbelief with wide grey eyes i i the first sounds to properly escape her throat were a relief to know she could speak at all but those were the only noises she could make she didntwant to do it but the only way to explain was to show them she gulped and a hot smudgy tear burned her eye before slipping away down her cheek and singeing the skin she decided she had to be strong enough to look at it even if she never saw it again she would never see it again she decided she would bandage it up and never let the skin of her forearm see the light of day ever again lifting herself with a weak courage away from ginny for a moment she kept her head bowed and her body curled she shakily held the sleeve of her dark blue robe and ginny could feel her whole body shake violently as she did hermione hesitated with her fingers caressing the smooth material between her thumb and forefinger and her breathing becoming harsher with every moment in one movement before she thought about it too long she pulled the thick blue fabric back away and revealed the flesh of her arm she pinched her eyes shut as soon as she saw a hint of the permanent skin tainted black her lids stung in protest to her mistreating them but she could not look at the ugly shape she let the others look however she heard a fatal gasp from ginny and several throat noises and choking sounds from the boys and draco sucked the air through his teeth as he confirmed his worst fear no a hoarse whisper of firm denial from harry he shook his black haired head but his eyes stayed glued to the haunting sight w what stuttered ron feeling as though his whole stomach flipped all their eyes were wide at the skull and snake imprinted on the bared arm of their crying friend ginny may have fainted if the need to comfort hermione wasntso powerful a primitive emotion in cases of stress and shock the primitive emotions take control of a person actions it was like an automatic gear for the mind hermione vomit coated tongue was about to choke her if she did not focus all her concentration on her breathing she could very well swallow her tongue forcing herself to take deep breaths did little for her wracked nerves but it did a lot for her screaming muscles the boys on the other hand were numb all over in disbelief that their friend was a death eater they could not speak their fears the reason was plain just looking at hermione she was distraught and a total shell of herself the real her was somewhere in her like a dying seed shrivelling fast into the corner of its case her heart was bleeding torpidly and pictures of severus started to surface before fading away into the image of his calm face as the tool pierced her skin it made her angry harry could not believe it how could he hermione his best friend and one of the kindest people he knew was the furthest thing known to him as what he categorized death eaters as hermione a death eater how did those two things fit together they didn t hermione abruptly tore the sight away from their googly eyes by pulling her arm away and covering it hurriedly as she sobbed and ginny was wide eyed and unblinking as she rocked her she was thinking along the same lines as harry so was ron draco on the other hand was considering how this had come to be instead of how impossible it was she had said she was going out when there had been a ring at the door they had never found out who it was but whoever it was must have been who brought her to the meeting there was only one person he could think of who belonged to that circle who she would so readily go with and his mind could not let him even consider it did snape do this to you he asked quietly and all the silent gawking eyes turned to him in startled surprise they did not know what to make of his serious question and he looked at hermione carefully who still had her face buried against his girlfriend neck yes she managed to say hoarsely and bitterly ginny let out a painfully loud gasp her eyes flying open wide it was impossible to her mind snape mean and grouchy as he was loved hermione and she loved him back she started to squeeze hermione a little too hard but her flesh was cold and numb so she did not notice dumbledore had stayed silent for the most part letting her friends help calm her down familiar voices and benevolent faces were always welcome to the hysterical harry face started to burn crimson and ron began to turn from panicked to mimic harry s they were both filled with rage to the point of steam spurting from their ears or cooking a raw egg on their foreheads how could they have been stupid enough to stand by and allow such a wrong relationship to fall through harry for better part felt he had betrayed hermione because he had always owned a lingering suspicion he was truly evil they could have stopped this had they intervened hermione was their friend and it was their just duty to do so all shall be explained once we transport hermione to a safe place to rest dumbledore said quickly before they dragged out any more foul and bitter thoughts and memories from the distressed mind of hermione he looked to their faces and they looked up at him in return all with equally demanding looks apart from hermione still sobbing and shaking where will she stay harry was the first to ask wanting nothing more than to be by the side of his second nearest friend his features were pale and drawn and dumbledore was sad to pick up that within the past few minutes each of them had matured dramatically she will of course go into hiding he elucidated and they all picked up the melancholy tone i have a house already set by which was intended for malfoy he nodded at draco who blinked in reply taking a hand and fiddling with end of his silver beard comfortingly he took a deep breath before continuing she can take that house if you do not mind he asked draco raising a white brow over his gold rimmed spectacles draco frowned as if the question were offensive of course not he snapped and dumbledore gracefully ignored his disrespectful tone but in a calmer voice he continued i however have decided to take you up on your offer at last and will share the house with hermione and no doubt the others will want to move in as well dumbledore and the others for that matter all looked surprised at his humbling act and the offer to move house once again but when they thought about it they did not need long to confirm that they were more than willing to move in with hermione into her new home is that alright with you he asked the other three who nodded vigorously with wide eyes and he smiled at them a smile with no mirth dumbledore studied each of their faces this was a mess he had had the power to prevent if he had seen the flaws with severus plan sooner severus was downstairs in his chambers he had sent him away knowing that his face was the last one hermione wanted to see it was a fresh reminder of the pain that had been caused mr weasley he addressed ron of all the others for the reason being that he was hermione dear friend and harry would have too much to deal with to take on the duty he was about to ask of him ron turned to face the large overcrowded desk properly with a blank angry expression would you mind being draco and hermione secret keeper ron was startled at first having that been the last thing he expected to hear but after a moment he gathered himself enough to answer with a still blank face it would be no more than my duty as a friend he replied coolly and blinked his unfocused blue eyes once hermione heard this all clearly and the thought of hiding sounded the sweetest thing in the world to her ears she exhaled softly against ginny now that her breathing was calm her headache was nowhere near better and steadily getting worse hiding from the world a dark room a warm bed all sounded so sweet and tempting as they never had before but if she were to stay in this house how was she supposed to complete her first stage of university as if reading her thoughts for all she knew he probably could dumbledore spoke on the very topic ron you will have to bring hermione all her textbooks and assignments for her to study from i trust she is capable of teaching herself from textbooks nobody answered because they were all waiting for the other to speak the answer was not needed because it was obvious no one was more capable than her can i go now a quiet strained rasp came from the curled up figure in ginny arms and surprised them all dumbledore eyed her long and hard in her loose undone blue robes looking more pitiful than ever peering over ginny reassuring shoulder right back at him her brown eyes were raw and her cheeks regaining their blood in blotches and her lips still violently quivering yes that would be wise he agreed hermione was so relieved despite the new salty tears trailing down her cheeks but one final question do you want severus to be informed of your whereabouts he looked her in the eyes and felt sick to his stomach when she looked mortified and pale again no she cried sharply her reaction was harsh and strong but if she was to even think his name she began to shake harder and feel clammy again no if severus came within one mile of her vision she would break down into tears of blood she could feel her heart bleed dry of love so quickly it was almost miraculous the images of any happy memory with him leaked out of her heart until all she had of him to think of was the way he had seemed so tamed and doing exactly what was asked of him by the dark lord even if it was to strip hermione of her certainty and anything that kept her sane she could not think of him by his name any more the dark lord was a sufficient title and she finally understood the engrained fear of the death eaters the others were stunned despite how obvious it should be how much she wanted to be rid of his face and his name it added insult to injury for her what should make them think such a way it should be clear to everyone who had an ounce of sense that for the rest of her life she did not want to hear the name severus snape thoughts of him blackened her mind very well dumbledore finally said mr weasley i will take you through the procedures and we shall leave immediately hermione had immediately stumbled out of the fireplace and tripped over the grate and resulted in her crumpling to the floor despite ginny attempts to catch her they had travelled separately because of their numbers by floo ginny stood by the grate waiting for hermione but still she failed to prevent hermione from slamming onto the carpeted floor of her new home her hideaway ginny was at her side in a moment crouched with a hand on her back hermione took a moment with her hands crushed between her and the carpet and her ankle twisted still caught in the grate her tears were beyond her control she had given up on trying to stop them ages ago and hardly noticed as they continued to hotly kiss her sore cheeks ginny watched her sadly and tried to hold back tears of her own hermione felt the comforting hand on her back but did not register it her face was barely off of the dusty smell of the matting and the entire world seemed so far away she struggled but did not want assistance as she used what little strength she had left to weakly raise herself by her hands and crawl away from the grate before attempting to get up as she forced herself up to a hands and knees position she felt the weight in her pocket slip out and fall to ground she paid it more attention than anything else her arms trembled under her weight but she continued to struggle for power over her center of gravity the friction burned her hands as she pushed herself meekly to her knees before allowing ginny to haul her up the boys watched the pitiful sight uncomfortably as hermione feebly got up with ginny help before stumbling forwards behind her the fire once again flared up in whirl of emerald flames and when they lowered again dumbledore was standing in its place the boys turned their eyes away from the painful scene to the much easier on the eye of dumbledore in his periwinkle robes he stepped out of the fireplace calmly looking more downcast than harry could ever remember and he had many memories of dumbledore looking downcast he looked pointedly at ron and then gestured with his hand in the direction of the front door in view of the large room they were in the house was enormous but they hardly noticed for the situation ron blinked his blue eyes slowly at him then turned to look at the front door blinked again then looked back at the weary headmaster he had no power to register what he was implying follow me mr weasley he said patiently to the numb brained orange haired man standing frozen in uncertainty he turned to ginny holding up hermione who had her eyes closed and her head bowed her hair hung beside her face limply as she gasped for air and tried to clear her mind miss granger would be better off with the room up the stairs at the far end of the corridor on the left he informed her and ginny nodded she darentopen her mouth for fear of crying as well ron blinked again he hardly remembered hearing the words that floated from the opening and closing mouth of his ex superior he spun on his heal and robotically followed the gliding figure out of the door they were soon trailed by the weak forms of hermione and ginny walking together towards the stairs this left harry and draco alone in the new room unsure of what to do where so much was happening and to stand silently occasionally glancing at the other in doubt ginny managed to find enough strength in her for both her and hermione as she got the two of them to the top of the lilac carpeted stairs and down to the end of the hall to hermione new room when ginny stopped in front of it to open the door with a pale hand hermione eyed the door wondrously this was to be her haven and she found both hope and relief in thinking here she would be safe she could lock herself away and sleep until the day after tomorrow if she pleased and that is exactly what she intended the thing swung open and ginny heard hermione sigh beside her even though she herself didntknow she had one could hardly see into the room the darkness from the closed curtains in the corner made it impossible but despite the dusty smell of disuse filled her nose and the haze of dimness she could tell the room was large and spacious there was the shadow of a large poster bed in the far corner and a desk to her right and that was all she needed ginny took her arm away from hermione back slowly pulling the loosely balanced robes further down her shoulders not that she cared in the slightest she stood straight feeling so frail that she couldntbe sure she would stay upright but the fresh clean feeling that washed over her like the salty waves stinging her yet purging the evil that chased her thoughts left her able to walk by herself into the black fog ginny followed her and shut the door behind them with a soft click that disturbed the silence like a bullet shot into the sky it took both of them a minute to even recognise the sound hermione wandered over to the bed and stood before it vaguely staring at it as if she didntknow what to make of it ginny on the other hand headed straight for the curtains hermione turned around and looked at her friend in the dark brown shadows of the room and then blinked she glanced at the curtains then put the pieces of the puzzle together her eyes widened a little then she pinched them shut when it stung so badly that she could swear the skin around them would tear no the urgent hoarse voice of hermione stunned ginny into stopping mid movement in walking to the curtains she watched hermione dirty shadow carefully hermione her voice had a pleading tone to it she gestured to the covered window you need light it not good to sit in the dark hermione looked away from ginny to where the floor was supposed to be but it was too dark to see ginny was too much in shock to realise that it was in fact the middle of the night and opening the curtains would make not the slightest difference hermione mind was in slow motion so she obviously could not figure that out for herself right now she was not going to bother reply to that she did not need light it was perfectly fine to sit in the dark and even if that werentthe case she was willing to sacrifice the good that it wasntto soothe her soul ginny dropped the meek hand that pointed loosely at the window she sighed she didntwant to admit it because she knew it was not for the best but she preferred the dark too hermione kept her head bowed and once again her thoughts were swallowed consumed by the burning on her arm it was down to a dull throb by now but still emotionally painful and fresh her chin was close to the point of touching her chest and she gripped the mark on her left arm through the sleeve so intensely that her nails dug dents into her skin ginny approached her but hermione sensed something so acutely that she was at first unsure of herself her most simple train of thought had been violently disrupted she could hardly count the fingers on her hands however she could acutely sense the emotional vibe radiating from ginny there was no doubt in hermione mind that if she stayed with her then ginny would break down into tears that would not help in the slightest it would make her feel a thousand times worse if she was not the only weak one she needed to be the only one suffering her friends shouldnthave to shoulder her personal pain no matter how severe ginny hermione croaked in a tone that implied a favour she really was trying her hardest yet to speak properly and was slightly disappointed when her voice did not improve but it was like a drop of water in to the sea for her right now ginny caught the demanding manner of her voice she looked to hermione who was talking to her chest could you get me some bandages and a safety pin to hold them together ginny furrowed her red brows at this request before looking slightly panicked at the thought that she was a useless friend for not having asked what she was about to before now you re not hurt are you she gasped in alarm she lifted her hands as if to shield herself from the bad news but hermione had none to give she lifted her heavy heavy head to look at the shadow of ginny she had her hair loose just past her shoulders and long straight bangs that were a visible outline in the dimness hermione was struck with the image of ginny as a freckled eleven year old girl who she had occasionally confided in and over the years they spoke more and more together until they were close friends in the end but now she felt so distant from ginny who was the freckled round faced little red haired girl staring at her no she said for the second time that minute she closed her eyes slowly and shook her head her draggled hair flicking her face that had become so from tears vomit and the strain of falling stumbling and trashing combined ginny relaxed visibly and her frame regained some trace of relief which helped shatter the little girl reflection hermione suddenly raised a hand to her head and pressed it against her forehead her headache had just let loose an enormous shooting pain that ripped through her brain she rubbed her temples in a strained movement what worse time could a headache come but under what better circumstances could a headache form she was unaware that she had lifted her left hand and as the huge blue sleeve slipped down to her elbow revealing her rolled up sweater sleeve and the bare skin of her forearm on which ginny had a perfect view of the dark mark this was another bonus for the darkness for ginny did not see it i want to wrap up that filthy symbol in my skin so that it may never see the light of day ever again she felt a little proud of herself for managing to give a further explanation that was not absolutely necessary ginny understood to the maximum extent someone who was not the sufferer could she turned on her heal much better off not noticing the grinning skull but still very pale and shaky and left without another word hermione stood by the bed and watched her leave for the bandages but decided to wait until ginny returned helped her wrap up the stinging foul thing and left before she would pour her heart and soul into her tears aaaaah so depressing sorry but this is what i promised in the summary and i have the full plan and everything so now i following my own strict instructions this is where i started my other story i need something light to write when not in the mood for this because as u can see its getting thick now i wanna change the ending so they ll just kiss and make up damn this story is getting too large it taking forever to write with my mind wandering to other things however it will not prevent me from finishing this story btw evanescence is good to listen to with this this story was originally a short practice starting from a few plot bunnies and it grown to this size i have much left your reviews really cheered me up i got back to writing this story once more so never fear i just dipped into hp5 and saw that the storeroom is in his office not his classroom but they must all be connected or else how would hermione get to it to steal from it in her second year in such a short time anyway nice comments always make me happy and opinions are always openly listened to and seriously considered a big tight bear hug snakecharmer ooo chapter 2 a little crush so far hermione had a nervous breakdown due to newts threw her book at a wall and decided a walk outside might help for some reason snape joins her and explains she has pretty much mastered her newts already he appears more despaired than usual but hermione doesntnotice snape leaves after a small offensive remark by hermione leaving her feeling slightly guilty and confused three days later snape finds out his baby sister closest to him has died of a mysterious disease he arrives late for class with an air of depression and arouses the curiosity of his students including hermione hermione flicked through her book not concentrating on a single word snape performance yesterday was all she could think of her naturally curios mind would not rest until she found the source of his sudden despondency she sighed the hair hanging over her face moved a little as she did so it was hopeless trying to study while her mind was elsewhere she closed her eyes shortly and thought of places in which she could research the cause for her professor conduct she pinched a curled lock of hair she had taken to her new look well between her fingers and fiddled with it as she thought and then it came to her it wasntthe most brilliant idea she had ever had but the first place she should look should be all this week daily prophets she gently closed her book and flung her hair back over her shoulders before hurrying past harry and ron who were studying beside her without a word they glanced up at her then looked at each other and shrugged returning to their own books and notes she jogged up to the girls dorm a slight buzzing feeling filling her head when she pushed open the door lavender and pavarti were sitting on the same bed talking together pavarti looked up at hermione oh hermione said pavarti with a different kind of excitement i had a small revelation today with your new hair a caf cr me colored lipgloss would go perfectly hermione glanced at them i ll keep that in mind she nodded dashing to her bedside table with today and yesterday daily prophet underneath her books she searched inside the drawers and managed to find the one for the day before as well that left her with the four previous ones to find her brown eyes flickered over to pavarti and lavender but she knew they didnteven bother getting the daily prophet just the sunday version maybe ginny had kept them she tucked the three newspapers under her arm and with a quick smile at the other girls she opened the large wood door and walked back into the dimly lit staircase she raced up the steps to ginny dorm with a little nervousness what would she do if no one still had them she didntlet it get to her just hoping ginny would have them still she reached the door and knocked before entering ginny was sitting on her bed in front of a levitating mirror plaiting her long red hair that seemed to darken by the year other 6th years were there too but she ignored them and started for ginny she noticed hermione in the mirror and turned her freckled face to her with a small grin hermione replied with an unenthusiastic grin back listen ginny do you happen to have the daily prophetss from last tuesday to friday she was almost pleading which did not astonish ginny in the slightest she paused thoughtfully squeezing her brows together actually she said slowly i think i have this whole month worth of newspapers ginny had to stop because hermione was now squeezing her with a quick hug ooff you seem happy ginny got up off the bed sliding and messing up the bedcovers as she did she headed for one of the chest of drawers to her left reached a hand for the third drawer and prised it open hermione tut tutted at the scene that lay before her the drawer was filled with old sheets of parchment that looked useless and old newspapers ginny blushed a little she grabbed the top 8 and looked at the dates on each she took the ones hermione wanted and put them into and small pile on top of the chest what is this about anyway she asked as she found the final paper needed and put it on the top of the pile she looked at hermione and was surprised to see that she had already taken the daily prophets and was on her way to the door just some personal research she said in a carefree tone halfway through the door she called thanks a ton gin before she was gone ginny frowned in confusion but would forget all about it a few minutes later hermione started with the last deciding to work her way forwards slowly just in case she decided to skim through the title of all of them just in case anything with the word snape came up in the headlines it would save her a lot of time if it did after putting down the last paper she decided she was going to have to do this the painfully long way she pulled back her hair into a loose ponytail to work better she took a deep breath and started to search for his name severus paced his study in quick long strides his black cloak billowed out behind him and whipped when he turned to retrace his steps since this morning he had slowly regained the urge to keep living his depression was still eating his insides but he was now becoming at least a shadow of his normal self he could not believe himself for his performance yesterday morning he stopped pacing and frowned he had completely lost all traits that kept the students certain that they should not mess with him to prove him own point he thought of miss granger he had lost character for one lesson and she had dared approach him with a personal question the nerve he panicked a little at her last comment that she would figure it out anyway would she follow through would she somehow find out he didntwant to think so he convinced himself that that was impossible he shook his head to try and banish that horrible memory and glided to the potions table there was always a potion that sorted every ailment every day usually ended up in him making a potion for himself tonight it was a stress release potion he pushed some of his smooth ebony hair behind his ear before reaching for his herbs little did he know that hermione was minutes from finding the cause for his depression it was only by chance that hermione saw it she hadnteven planned to look at the obituaries but as her as glided over from one page to the next she finally spotted the word snape for one confusing moment hermione jumped to weird conclusion that snape had died and now some weird ghost or look a like had taken his place a moment later she realised how stupid that idea was and looked closer at the name stella snape hermione had never heard of her not that that was a surprise seeing as how well all the students knew snape private life was it his mother his sister his cousin his wife she bit her lip and narrowed her eyes she would have to find out more about this stella person and exactly what her relation was to snape she found herself sure that it wasnthis wife because at what time of the year would he get to see her she stood up tomorrow before breakfast she would look up the wizards family trees in the library she glanced at her schedule there was potions tomorrow she would have hoped for a little more time than that until she saw the potions master again that would have given her time to figure it out completely but for tonight her work was done the next morning hermione was so ensconced in the library that she missed breakfast and had to go straight to the dungeons she was cutting it very fine looking at her watch she saw that she might not make it she ran the last stretch so as not to be late hair and bag flying behind her along with her robes skidding to a stop just in front of the door she saw people were just about to get settled and smiled in relief pushing the shoulder strap of her bag into a more secure position she sped over to the boys and sat down quickly behind her cauldron and desk harry and ron gave her a quizzical look where have you been said harry in an accusing tone he leaned across ron as though it would help him hear her reply he brushed back a black tuft of hair covering his face with his fingers you ve been acting secretive lately ron agreed pushing harry back into his seat as he did what up he asked with more concern than blame in his voice it nothing said hermione waved a hand like she wanted to brush the subject aside both the boys now scowled at her hermione warned harry dontthink you re going to get past us that easily a violent nod from ron now tell us what exactly have you been up to where were you at breakfast today the frowns vanished from their faces as fast as they appeared hermione smiled to herself there was almost nothing she could hide from the boys at the same time she felt like she should not give out the personal information of the least liked teacher in the school alright she sighed leaning closer and lowering her voice to nothing more than a whisper i have settle down ordered snape from the front of the class hermione was forced to stop and gave them a look that said leave this till later then turned to face the potions master at the front of the class she stared at snape in her mind she was now starting to think of him as an object to be unravelled and studied or a book to be read snape had returned to normal the class could see some people were disappointed and others relieved that their professor was back to his predictable self hermione wondered whether it meant he had stopped being despondent or just pulled himself together and stopped showing his depression the instructions are on the board you know what to do he glared at them all as if daring any of them to ask him what happened like hermione had done she decided on watching him until she had to go gather her ingredients and resuming her observations when she returned maybe he would give a hint of what he was feeling if he let his guard down snape did not like the way hermione was acting in the slightest her actions were unnerving every second he looked up from his desk the granger girl would be staring right at him had she found out about his little sister if she had how come so soon no she couldnthave she was probably just either hoping he would drop some large clue for her or just trying to make him feel worried he was not in the mood for the tricks of a know it all student but now he had to make sure that he didntshow any emotion on top of feeling like shit but that wasnttoo hard it was one of the things he did best he looked up and directly at miss granger she blushed and went back to her work ignoring him as well as she could he realised that there might be no sufficient way to get her to leave his private life alone hermione thoughts drifted the more she stared she began to notice the little things no one else did like how his hair was not greasy in the slightest it was merely a trick of the light in the dungeon the way he moved was another unknown reflection of him he walked cautiously and gracefully but with purpose his large robes followed behind him and swept around corners as he strode among the tables his pitch black eyes flickered across the room coolly searching for a reason to lose his calm she was so absorbed in her thoughts that she almost let her potion boil too long jerking back to reality she listed to the left to take her cauldron off the flame it was a good thing she hadntalready had a grip on the handle because a second later she leaned a little too far and lost control of her chair she put her hands in the air in a vain attempt to straighten her chair hopelessly and there was a loud crash as the chair hit the floor followed by a soft thud from hermione head colliding with the icy stone slab the whole class stopped what they were doing and looked up hermione lay on the floor beside her cauldron face hidden by a mass of light chocolate curls her robes puddled around her and she wasntmoving the only people doing anything were harry ron and professor snape harry and ron were beside her in seconds holding her head up and checking to make sure she was alright harry was checking her pulse and ron pulling back her hair to see if there was any bleeding snape however appeared relaxed he was there in a few strides and even paused to take her potion off of the fire she fine he snapped at the boys who he felt were making way too much of a fuss over a small knock on the head both of them glared at him with death wishes shining in their eyes they had obviously taken it the wrong way thinking that he was not bothered to take care of a student in need when he had simply meant she was fine he looked down at her this was a good distraction for him his classes were boring him more and more as the years went by his point about her condition was proven a second later when she started to stir already she lifted her head and rubbed it gently sitting up she blinked vigorously and looked up the first thing she saw or at least guessed she saw was professor snape she couldnttell because her eyes were watering badly she groaned and pinched her eyes shut several times more sorry professor snape she mumbled he did not see the need for the apology but did not reply miss granger go to the hospital wing at once leave your things he glanced at apathetically at the two boys i sure they will be taken care of he offered her a hand to help her up out of common courtesy really professor she said anxiously i quite fine that not necessary she accepted his hand anyway he pulled her up off the floor and she found his grip to be abnormally strong he released her a split second later with a hard look her way he shook his head firmly no you just passed out you must go to see mme pomfrey immediately he replied sternly with as little feeling in his voice as he could harry nodded in reluctant agreement as did ron but sir she decided it better to let it drop when he gave her a poisonous look falling silent she skulked to the door resignedly she found herself not wanting to leave but she didntfeel as good as she had let on and felt an unusual urge to sleep snape on the other hand was happy to be rid of her her disturbing staring had been making him infinitely uncomfortable as soon as she was gone he turned on the rest of the class well he hissed dangerously dontjust sit there waiting get back to work he left the two to tidy up and resumed his pattern around the desks inspecting everyone potion down to the finest detail there was a small instant where snape felt maybe he should have sent someone with granger to make sure she did not fall asleep on the way to the hospital wing he dismissed the thought knowing she would be smarter than to give in to sleep she had made it to the hospital wing just fine but the second she lay down on one of the beds she almost fell asleep before madam pomfrey managed to snap her out of it a few doses of several different potions later she had nothing to do but think staying in the hospital wing was lacklustre way too tedious she sighed clutching the bright white sheets she pulled them up to her chin she was thinking about snape she half heartedly tried to push the thoughts out of her head by habit more than wanting to she wasntthinking along any specific lines just about him in general the way he walked his piercing black eyes a horrifying thought crept into her mind was she starting to get a crush on him she bit her lip and shook her head to try and clear her mind but even when she closed her eyes she could still see him standing in front of her she could feel her heartbeat speed up the more she thought and a pinching feeling at the base of her throat that swallowing could not subdue with a deep shuddering breath she pulled the sheets up right over her head but it didnthelp realising that she was running out of fresh air she pushed them back down again and closed her eyes maybe she could clear her mind of everything the very idea that she now liked her professor was too much to handle luckily classes would end in a few minutes and she could expect harry ron and maybe even ginny if they found her on the way she decided to shove this weird feeling to the back of her mind and concentrated on her friends it was almost hogsmead week end she contemplated maybe she should go buy a few more books for distraction more than anything else she could use a dream translation book since she didnttake divination not that she wished she did she pondered this for a short while and then her predictions came true as the door of the hospital wing burst open and harry and ron bounded over to her she looked up at them and grinned they both snatched a couple of chairs and dragged them up as close to her bed as they could how are you feeling ron frowned anxiously studying her to make sure she was not hurt she giving gave them each a tender smile it was sweet of them to be so protective i fine really she argued pushing herself up straighter in bed harry hand pressed her back down by her shoulder she frowned sarcastically at him lie down you ll get better quicker said harry firmly hermione looked at them defiantly and pushed herself back up i am perfectly alright she snapped without any real bite i think it was totally unnecessary for me to have to leave the class over a little bump on the head she scoffed the boys looked confused you wanted to stay said ron shocked at the very idea it was a perfect excuse to get out of potions does your health matter less to you than a potions lesson unable to come to terms with the possibility hermione looked a little guilty well she started but harry scowled at her no i suppose not she said apologetically the subject of conversation quickly changed did you know snape going away this weekend ron said sounding excited a whole weekend i only wish it was on a day with potions he stared off into space dreaming of the prospect what leaving why asked a perplexed hermione no idea shrugged harry that all we know it probably just some family emergency you know hermione put two and two together promptly her eyes grew and she mouthed the word oh of course it made perfect sense she suddenly felt a wave of sadness for snape as though she was feeling his pain it was probably the funeral he was attending in the library that morning she had found out their relation stella snape was his younger sister and from the way he had been acting she could tell they were close what is it asked harry what with the funny looks hermione could have slapped herself she should learn to control her facial expressions better that thought alone was enough to make her think of severus snape and his undeniable good ability to master his yeah ron added making things only worse you were going to tell us the reason you ve been so occupied recently is there a connection damn it she should have been more discrete she decided it would be simpler to tell them now than dance around it for a while ok she sighed the boys shuffled closer you know how strangely snape was acting on monday they nodded vigorously i wondered about that said ron harry shushed him well i decided to do a little research of my own into the matter they were leaning further forward now with anticipation she looked at them closely please dontlet on to anyone else including snape that you know she pleaded harry seemed to seriously consider it but ron just replied with depends what it is that we re about to find out with a small evil smile hermione gave him a sickened look his little sister has died of some disease she snapped at him ron flinched back as though she had spat in his face he looked less pleased and harry mimicked her earlier reactions with a small oh hermione i didntknow said ron guiltily i didntmean that she knew he didntbut his reply had struck a sensitive nerve she looked at him and groaned in frustration it ok really she said but didntlook him in the eye she was getting defensive about snape and she knew she would have to stop if she didntwant to give anything away her feelings were like a small fire that refused to be extinguished the second she got out of the hospital wing she didntgo directly back to the gryffindor tower but instead she determined to go outside and sit by the lake she supposed it was in vein hope of severus joining her as before severus a name that suited him very well and when she thought it she felt instantaneously uncomfortable but the uncomfortable feeling was melting into a strange kind of excitement so that the name now made her shiver but her hopes of seeing him were dampened when she sat there for just under and hour without spotting him with a sad look around she got up and headed back to the castle chapter 2 and the love is already in the air please r r kisses and hugs to those who reviewed my last chapter snakecharmer chapter 21 the comfort spot and the burning leaving out the so far s from now on lately i ve been feeling down i dontget around much anymore so i just spend my time alone waiting for the phone to ring and i keep thinking of you i miss the language that we speak when we donteven talk you never told me i would feel lonely without you you re not supposed to make me cry and i never loved someone like this before i gotta stop thinking of you anouk stop thinking ooh yay the happiness at last well not immediately any more depressing stuff and u know it would be absurd so say hello to the end of an era except why do i still feel miserable o rite no severus take note a phoenix song is supposed to strike courage into the good and fear into the evil hearts how does severus react to it i listen to a lot of slow stuff with these chapters i dunno but it really sets the tone for example metallica nothing else matters really perfect or hello evanescence i know when i get a chapter i ve been waiting for i tend to read it quickly and hungrily sloppily so it is downright hypocrisy when i advise you take your time with this chapter is this the end what a contrast this chapter is peacefulness and serenity surrounded his sleep in a thick shade of soothing emotionless unconsciousness when he was torn from it abruptly he at first doubted whether it hadntalready been a disturbed and weak state of mind he was pulled upright with a silent gasp for air in the middle of the night the covers fell from his chest and he bent over in the dark staring at the sheets and realizing where he was what was going on and why he had woken he couldntsee anything but dim outlines of his bed and in the mirror on the wall the silhouette of him perched forwards long hair falling straight beside him it did not all come back in a horrid flood but in pieces for him to understand while he caught his uneasy breath then came the realization along with the guilt and emptiness there was a pounding sting like some horrible insect was pumping voluminous amounts of venom into the underside of his arm where the mark was burning from red to black that dreaded mark the cause of his destruction everything he had ever lived for had been swallowed by this horrid mistake nothing he had ever said or done could take back the curse of ensued duty it was a summons when he grasped this something in his mind slipped and he became detached from reality all his next actions were halfhearted and automatic as he dragged himself from his bed pointed his wand at the fire which flared up and got changed into his robes decimus who severus had completely forgotten lifted his head sleepily to observe through slit green eyes as his master reached for a jar on the stone mantel he let out an overlarge yawn of protest at such an early arousal and flatted his ears to his head he refused to shift from his curled up position of warmth and comfort so was forced to attract severus attention by the only means left to him severus had dug a hand into jar of floo and replaced it when he heard a loud mew from his bed for a split second his black eyes focused sharply as he spun round the coiled ebony cat sat at the foot of the bed looking up at him questioningly he released some of his tension by sneering viciously at the docile creature and growling through gritted teeth what are you smirking at before he turned back to the licking flames and showered it with a pinch of pale green silvery powder she actually shrieked in her sleep as she was painfully separated from her slumber she tore apart from the replenishing state of mind feeling scared and in pain why she couldntunderstand her sound sharp and earsplitting was trapped by her four walls and no one beyond the landing heard her cry she was alone in the dark and what daylight she had seen in her dreams had dissipated into a colorless haze in her mind hermione breaths were coming in pants but slowing quickly as she recalled she was sitting safe in bed tangled in her sheets and hair forming a matted tangled brown pillow beneath her head solitude it rained down on her as though from the skies and instantly she knew she was truly alone she stopped struggling for air breathing softly eyes searching wildly in the blackness for some excuse for her abrupt awakening she calmed her racing heart and noticed that she had began to break out in beads of sweat on her forehead and the back of her neck another shockwave of whatever had woken her streaked through her again as if to reveal itself to her confused mind it was a ripple of electricity that stung so badly it felt as though the flesh was peeling away under the strain it ended as soon as it had come and hermione found herself bent double upright in bed eyes pinched shut teeth clenched as she gripped the bandages with all the strength of her grip she gasped and let go as though the action had burned her in a completely different way looking around her half hoping half dreading being intruded upon she took large heaving gulps of air to restore stillness to her system she returned her thoughts to the throbbing pain of extents she could never managed to imagine from a simple mark severus put up with this constantly without a word of complaint it still was radiating a heat much worse than she had suffered the night this symbol had been imprinted into her it must be the call it had to be she had in her wallowing overlooked this small entailment how could she for as long as there was voldemort she would endure regular doses of pain whenever he so desired his dearest followers at his side she wanted to retch the way she had retched when this pivotal event went underway but she would not let herself fall so far if every time there was a meeting she would fall back in that dismal pit she would never crawl out again in her right mind she had to get over this in the darkness her eyes adjusted piteously and gave her a dim outline of her arm it hurt in ways one would never know tentatively she reached for the safety pin which held the strands of cloth together she tugged at it lightly and when the amount of pain did not increase though nor did it decrease she yanked on it hard until it tore from the bandages with a satisfying ripping sound the pin came loose in her palm and she dropped it without a care it landed somewhere beside her on the bed not wasting anymore precious moments she scrabbled to tear away at the threads until the wrappings were nothing more than a pile of shredded mesh around her blanket there is was glowing slightly in the dark she could just about make out the cursed mark she swore under her breath at it as she grabbed her arm around the tattoo to that it wasntvisible anymore beneath her own lethal grasp she heaved herself out of bed with all the spare energy she could muster there was no way she was going back to sleep this pain just drove everything from her mind she would go to the kitchen where the fresh bandages were kept about the cabinet from there she would play it by mood if she felt like returning she would slipping from her room silently she shut the door behind her and crept along the corridor clutching her left forearm excruciatingly she managed to make her way through the blackness to the stairs and stepped down them carefully so as not to arouse anyone else and successfully managed to steal into the kitchen the door swung closed behind her without a sound her eyes roving madly around her deciphering what all the looming menacing shadows truly were landed upon the sink she approached it and held her arm under the tap releasing her hold on it there were deep imprints where her fingers were as she brandished the mark unabashedly in the dark and with her other hand twisted the stiff faucet until a harsh stinging cleansing rope of icy clear water pelted down onto the pain it was unbelievably refreshing the heatedness was neutralized even numbed by the flow now dribbling down to the sleeve of her pajamas rolled up round her elbow she hardly noticed closing her eyes to double the sensation savoring the relief she stayed there for an unknown length of time in the pitch blackness with her outstretched left arm exposed to the pounding water in the sink it was only when she was certain that the throbbing and heat would not return that she slowly regretfully opened her eyes to look down at the mark as she pulled her arm gently away from the flow and rose it to the half light of the stars from the crack in the net curtains the water trickled coldly down to the tips of her fingers and dripped steadily a rising feeling in her heart told her she was calm and safe and could return to bed without another thought but a little something in the back of her mind little but powerful convinced her she was past the point of sleep her large brown eyes raked the room until finally she made out the cabinet in the far end of the room by the fridge next to the only window sure as she could be there was a bundle of fresh bandages waiting for her to use making her way into the moonlit area of the room she lowered her left arm and raised the other to reach for the pile of cloth but half way in mid movement her outstretched fingers froze and retracted slightly she bit her lip nervously as she hesitated and glanced down at the grinning heinous skull baring its teeth and the vile snake protruding from its mouth it was black but fading into a red rapidly she lifted her heavy head to look at the bandages and something made her draw back her arm what it was that made her do it was unbeknown to her but it was more of an impulse than a decision she looked away without another thought in case she would stand torn for hours deciding what to do it would be better to see the mark and accept that it was there it was there she shivered in the pale starlight and walked back over to the shelves above the dripping tap from them she dragged out a glass jar and cup and filled the jar with ice cold water with the intention of spending the rest of the night away in the first room she found with the discovery channel but the thing was the second the glass jar had passed the lip of the shelf she could not remember anything until she found herself tall cold glass wrapped in her fingers slouched in front of the enormous widescreen cinema leaning against a particularly large gold and scarlet pillow heavy feeling of sleepiness crushing her chest and eyes drooping as she found herself staring at a particularly boring documentary about some nutter with a love for scorpions and was describing their good traits hermione breathed deeply to shift the weight from herself but didntmanage to so there she sat in the dark with the enormous screen blaring colors of savannas and sweltering heats while hermione drifted in and out of concentration sipping occasionally and staring staring unblinkingly and for many hours though she lost track of when it had melted from a documentary on crawlers to plate tectonics she was bathed in nothing more than the light of the television alone slowly very slowly a dim glow poured into the room and steadily grew until it was the first light of dawn the different light brightened her face between a fussy frizz of bed hair and revealed with more clarity the puffy redness of her eyes each blood vessel in her eyes stood out from a sleepless night before a cinema gaze out of focus soon it will be light enough for me to study she thought dimly when she realized the sun was coming up blinking some of the clear hue out of her eyes and regaining a slight form of awareness her frail frame what stiff and aching she shifted herself into a more upright position to wake herself up better and what should catch her wary gaze but the mark itself it was as if her eyes could not keep off of it she should never wrap it up ever again if she wanted to grow strong enough to return to her old life the thing she knew in her heart though she tried to convince herself otherwise was that she could never truly have her old life back it was down to a raw red a color she had never observed it as before and its huge empty sockets stared right back up at her from beneath her skin she stared at it staring was soon becoming her only ability for she felt she could do nothing else the more she studied it the closer the realization came that she was trying hard to overlook she tried to tear her eyes away but couldn t the enormous screen was pounding out empty facts and long winded explanations about the obvious and somehow she failed to hear a word of it while entranced by the foul symbol eventually she accepted it no matter what she tried to tell herself she knew down to the deepest particle within her that severus had suffered mortally tonight because of her because of him either way the thought held less comfort than it should have she found herself worrying for his health he should have gone to madam pomfrey if he hadn t which is what she could expect with a man of such pride then he could still be dealing with the after effects she knew the meeting had finished ages ago how she knew she could not tell something dampened her cheek and brought her back to reality she found her eyes watering badly and a horrid feeling in her throat and chest it was as though someone had dug a hand between her ribs and was crushing her heart in its fist while the other hand choked her slowly it was the most horrid feeling she could recall the deepest sadness which somehow was more powerful than her own previous self pity something she had thought unachievable the crushing feeling did not go away and she buried her face in her hands to smother her tears hours later with the rest of the household waking she had gathered herself together enough for nothing to be suspected of her early rise or its cause she even smiled at them as they entered the kitchen one by one to find her settled at the far chair of the white table cupping a mug of steaming coffee resting on the table the coffee went cold in her hands without her drinking anything of it no one noticed her spirits brightened in her friends cheery atmosphere if they had known and shared her gloom then she might as well retreat to her room but the more she talked the more she managed to push her early morning worries away from her mind and her smile became more and more easy it was obvious the others were elated by her apparent recovery and doing all they could to make her smile and she appreciated it more than they could understand harry and ron would openly tease each other for hermione enjoyment and ginny was grinning away and readily insulting the two of them as well draco looked like it was taking all his self restraint to bite his tongue another cheering sight for hermione was the fact ginny and draco were sitting together and whispering to each other in undertones while harry or ron engaged her in conversation hermione weariness slowly left her bloodshot eyes and the sleepy heaviness eased though unforgettable traces remained but considering what happened only a few hours ago it had to be one of the most enjoyable breakfasts she had ever had maybe it was because of recent events that everyone in the room found the morning to be so pleasurable hermione found the thing that completely topped it was ginny brightly lit face as she stifled giggles and draco small smile and how ginny was back to full spirits it made her shattered heart feel ready to burst with joy that it looked as though she may very well get a clear shadow of her old life back after breakfast which lasted about an hour after the food was finished ron asked her to follow him with the remains of a grin on his face she followed with curiosity and harry followed as well to see what ron was talking about he led them through the downstairs hall and to the base of the stairs which they climbed in order hermione still in her pale turquoise pajamas harry behind her kept shooting inquiries at ron who ignored him like a fly they walked down the landing side by side hermione in the middle she was still with messy hair not having yet bothered to fix herself up but ron and harry were both dressed up in neat robes they finally stopped at a room hermione could not remember then again she could hardly remember any of them when ron held out a hand harry raised his black brows at the door ron shoved it open and both hermione and harry leaned closer to get a better look at the room it was unremarkable in comparison with the rest of the house towards the back of the room were armchairs and tables which compared strikingly with trelawney attic and another screen against one wall which did not spread its full length ron went in and both followed sharing a perplexed look severus had had it depression and wallowing had left him for all it was worth and now he was filled with bitter anger he was angry at lucius at dumbledore and most of all at himself lucius he would deal with later and take the deepest pleasure in it but for now since he could not quite understand how he would yet deal with himself he would deal with dumbledore dumbledore the wise know all who judgment was valued and hardly ever wrong why had something so flawed managed to escape his sharp eye had he intended something like this to happen had he deliberately tried to split the two of them apart when presented with the perfect opportunity to say the least severus was paranoid and at the point of raving he stood outside dumbledore office door with the most putrid black glower scarring his face as he rapped sharply on the wood he had tolerated physical torture until he had been left with nothing more than an occasional twitch in his side how much longer he would suffer pointlessly he could not stand pain did not humble him pain angered him the door swung open of its own revealing severus standing stiffly tall and clad in his long flowing black robes rigid with rage without waiting for invitation he stormed straight into the oval room pausing only to slam the door shut behind him it banged angrily off the wall and swung right back at him dumbledore was looking up from a half written document with a long eagle quill balanced loosely in his fingers and a knowing look in his eyes this has gone on long enough you have been trying to destroy me for too long and i have just sat by allowing the worst to fall through in a self pitying daze i wonttolerate any more of this i thought you trusted me to some extent dumbledore though it be small i demand to know hermione whereabouts severus barked striding right up to the desk and looming over the old man dumbledore was unfazed enough to not even blink he had been expecting this visit eventually severus he said calmly and evenly and infuriating severus even more as his shoulder muscles seized up i trust you with my life i am not her secret keeper so i cannot give you her whereabouts it is her decision severus sharp black eyes glinted dangerously then you will go and talk to her and explain he ordered bluntly straightening a little commanding a sense of power but a little uncertainty filled his voice i cantsee why she would not want me to speak for myself dumbledore paused looking at severus compassionately while he glowered straight back he knew this man had been through more than anyone should and having to explain things to him was the last thing he wanted to do she is wary heartbroken and afraid dumbledore explained wearily pushing his spectacles further up his crooked nose with a long finger severus blinked coldly finding his statement to be more than obvious afraid she has good reason to be afraid now she has been marked by the dark lord himself he said impatiently and was confused when met with a sad look of pity on the old man face behind his long silver beard no he said quietly stroking the mustard bird head with one hand and not catching severus eye she is afraid of you what he thundered why do you say that have you seen her did she tell you so all his words were in quick angry succession and he glared at dumbledore with all the spite within him severus calm yourself you will get all your answers severus settled himself huffily and sunk abruptly into the nearest armchair arms laying on rests he tapped his slender fingers on the edge of the rest with his right hand scowling darkly at dumbledore waiting for an answer i have not seen hermione herself then you have no right to judge he spat dumbledore overlooked the malevolence with ease and gave severus a penetrating blue stare which severus readily returned with one of his most feared gouging stares when i visited the house she was either asleep or in no state to be disturbed but from what i have been told her torment comes not from the mark but from what she considers the deepest betrayal ronald weasley told me of how he had had a peculiar conversation with miss granger in which she told him of what was truly irking her severus anger melted with his hunger for information but his glare stayed strong when was this he snapped about a month ago and what did she say he probed feeling furious at dumbledore for not illuminating enough his fingers had stopped tapping the edge of the chair which was now suffering his powerful claw like grip he tried not to give dumbledore the satisfaction of dangling information before him like bait and forcing him to degrade himself or reveal himself either way one was just as bad as the other that is confidential to hermione she did not expect him to tell even myself but i assure you it would be for the best if you did not see her for she might attack you severus sat silent and stunned she is convinced that she never really knew you and it would be better if she recovers of her own seeing you would stir up old emotions that she is trying to teach herself were wrong it might well be her destruction i sorry severus severus stared blankly at dumbledore with raven eyes like he didn t couldntcomprehend what he was saying i think it would be better if you let hermione move on what was dumbledore saying severus needed to take a moment to think what he asked would entail his mind kick started and reared into action possibilities and explanations were flying through his head surely if she is so distraught it means that there was something deep i cantjust let her go he said brain working fast there may well have been but if there was then now it pains her he said with an odd firmness to his tone no matter how deep it goes i feel that it would be too much to ask to have what you once did back again i know you agree severus fawkes perched on dumbledore desk let out a horrid queer note that rippled right through him and left him feeling more confused than he had already been i agree he said very slowly forebodingly after a hesitation dumbledore was watching him with concern and possibly grim pride this is my fault isntit he looked pointedly at dumbledore daring him to deny the truth severus he begun sadly it will always be more my fault than yours because i had the possibility to see flaws in a plan that a creator is almost certain to overlook i could have prevented it and it should have been obvious but somehow my old mind must be failing me severus hardly heard a word dumbledore said he was looking somewhere around the clawed foot of his desk but not truly seeing it his black eyes diluted and his hold on the chair was down to nothing and he could hardly recall feeling this weak what must she think of me he muttered deathly quiet dumbledore had plenty of room in his heart and felt incredibly for the wreck of what was never more than a proud shell of a man i hear she still worries on your behalf and if the feeling is mutual then it will do you well to know she has begun to emerge from her hiding hole dumbledore said kindly continually stroking fawkes which trilled horribly he did not know what he was feeling when those words registered themselves deep within him some kind of clash or battle of emotions was playing tricks with his heart hermione was recovering it struck up some kind of warmth to his cold insides she was better off without him and with it the warmth turned meek and soggy it was his fault if he had never allowed anything to happen then neither of them would be like this how foolish of him to allow her to get mixed up with himself in the first place numbly he made a mental note to be more reclusive in the future severus dumbledore spoke quietly giving him a piercing look dontdo anything rash i trust you he reiterated with that firm warning wrapped cozily within a compliment dontdo anything rash he echoed darkly avoiding dumbledore eyes what more is there for me to do when i cannot see hermione dumbledore chose to ignore that certain comment not wanting to plant ideas severus knew it was time for him to go he forced himself up by the armrests and looked around the bright circular room sourly as he stood you are strong i know you will be alright dumbledore said encouragingly as severus turned his back on him you re jesting severus said meekly with nothing but hope backing his sarcasm ron mystery turned out to be nothing more than a playstation he had been trying to figure out how to work it for weeks and had finally achieved his goal the previous day both she and harry had laughed outright when ron explained it turned out he had officially been turned into an addict like so many others to quote his words those muggles have been holding out on us harry humored him by challenging him to several games and hermione watched from a squashy armchair when harry begun to tire of it hermione sportingly agreed to play a game at which she lost spectacularly to ron absolute delight he had found another thing she wasntperfect at harry grinning at hermione for loosing so badly found enough desire to take over again after her at her protests at how pointless and mind numbing games like these were both men sitting cross legged in their robes nudging each other shoulders when the other lost and grinning and laughing amused hermione to no end she could observe her two friends for hours they looked no older than eleven with identical smiles lighting their faces boyishly and that classic carefree air severus though still in her thoughts became of less importance when she reasoned how would mourning him make her move on it wouldn t she had to forget him she was trying unsuccessfully true but achieving more than she had before she was channeling some of their light mood and was elated but this did not show entirely in her face it didntneed to for boys to understand that she was rapidly regaining her charisma and zest but the incident of the playstation which lasted until lunch was minute compared to the way the household spent that late hot august afternoon we have a pool hermione echoed in disbelief when ginny had spoken to her in the process of shoving hermione down the landing at the back ginny gave her another hearty push and hermione tripped a couple of steps forward and continued to look over her shoulder at ginny freckly face we do ginny beamed and hermione stubbornly tried to stand her ground when ginny pushed her by the shoulders again will you move she snapped with mock impatience hermione blinked and yielded to the request allowing herself to be chivvied along the hall to her bedroom ginny had a bag slung around her wrist that continually knocked hermione thigh sharply and she eyed it curiously as they squashed through her doorway into her bedroom side by side ginny herself had her hair tied back in a high ponytail excluding her bangs and wore a cheerful expression as though about to get something she had been looking forward to hermione once deep enough within her room to have her own breathing space turned to face ginny who had taken the bag off of her wrist and was now opening it before her her whole appearance clashed horribly with the blood red wall behind her she dug into the bag and her hand must have closed on something she had been searching for because she looked back up at hermione lost looking expression i knew you didnthave one so i got one for you as well she said pulling out the subject of conversation from the bag at first sight hermione thought it was nothing more than a fistful of some latex material but turned out to be a red bikini hermione raised her brows at it skeptically and gave it a mild look of disgust dontlook at me like that i wearing one too hermione dropped the expression but continued to look skeptical she was even more skeptical minutes later when she was changed into what she considered practically nothing and had forced her frizz into a ponytail ginny had reappeared in her room moments later changed into her own white one hermione looked down at herself and then back up at ginny with a stubborn frown at which ginny stepped forward caught her by the wrist and dragged her away down the stairs pausing only to collect a couple of beach towels hanging on the banister hermione felt disinclined to jump into a pool leaning towards a cozy nap in her warm dry bed she let ginny lead her without complaint by her right wrist down out through the back glass sliding door by the kitchen and down a paved path which led around the corner of the house out of sight hermione looked around in wonder forgetting her outfit entirely it was a hot day the final burst of sunshine before autumn started to creep up on them the leaves were that darkening green on the trees which lined the edge of the large lawn at a distance the lawn itself was grand and nothing compared with the size of the forest beyond it she wanted to explore it but when barefoot and in the clutches of an enthusiastic ginny that was virtually impossible she watched it longingly until they rounded the sun warmed bricks that marked the corner of the house once it was blocked from view she looked back to ginny who had slowed and saw the reason oh was all she could say when she saw the enormous pool tiled with dark blue tiles that gave the water a dark crystal effect as it rippled under the hot breeze that was attacking hermione skin it was sunk deep into the ground and reached depths she could not see and three heads were already sticking out of the water the clear liquid dripping down from their soaking hair on their faces all were watching her only slight smiles and each of their eyes on hermione left arm she noticed their gaze and flushed slightly hiding her arm behind her back as she and ginny stopped by the edge of the pool lukewarm water licking their toes tantalizingly their eyes grew serious at the sight of the mark until now they had only seen it on her arm on that eventful night it had only been that morning when she had removed her bandages and she had made a point to unroll her long sleeves of her pajamas before they entered the kitchen they hadntknown she would not be wearing the bandages and were caught off guard draco was the first to recover mainly because of ginny presence and her attire ginny unblushingly let go of hermione wrist at last without looking back at her she took a couple of steps back from the pool and hermione watched with halfhearted interest she had not noticed the coldness in the warm air under the humid yellow sun she look a running leap forwards and tucked her legs into her chest just in time before she hit the water with great noise and disappearing under a tidal wave of water which splashed hermione up to her lower thighs and some of the grass around the path hermione recoiled from the sensation but it seemed that the men had gathered themselves enough to fake ignorance of the mark the noise disturbed a murder of crows that had collected on the grass nearby and they all took off at once cawing loudly in a rustle of wings ginny head broke the surface of the water again and she flicked her sopping ponytail out of her eyes flecks of water spattered the other three and ginny turned back to hermione come on it not that cold ginny urged motioning with her hand for hermione to follow suit hermione raised her brows doubtfully she had no intention to jump in like her harry and ron were now beaming at her and nodding their agreement to ginny words ron hair was distinctly darker when wet she compromised by crouching down and slipping her legs into the water which true to ginny was hardly warm she then pushed herself off the edge and sunk into the water and harry and ron had already disappeared under it hermione wondered how quickly she could escape as she treaded water but realizing she wasntabout to be let off so soon she began to swim a little it took a grand total of ten minutes for the three males to bore of laps and they all stopped in the shallows looking at ginny and hermione swim each of them shared the same unspoken idea but didntdare utter it in case it would be improper to play so rough once both girls had come to join them in the shallows which were actually deep enough to reach their necks whereas for the men it only reached about their chest temptation overwhelmed them it was draco that actually started what was inevitable all three men were bored and what could be more entertaining he caught ginny around the middle and catching her totally by surprise she did not retaliate as he lifted her as though she was light as a feather right out of the water there was a look of uncertain shock on her face as draco smirked evilly and threw her right into the air where it seemed as though she was frozen for a moment arms flayed before she crashed into the tepid water with time for no more than a squeak of surprise harry and ron were grinning at draco with something that resembled gratefulness and he nodded at them it was like a silent thank you shared between them as ginny came back out of the water sputtering and blue eyes wide in shock hermione could not help laugh her laughter was cut off abruptly by a pair of strong arms wrapping themselves around her waist in the thick water at which she gasped think it funny do you how would you like it if it happened to you harry said impishly into her ear with mock seriousness and hermione shrieked as he lifted her clean out of the water trailing streams through the air ron jeered and laughed draco was busy in pursuit of ginny who had seen that moment as a chance to escape harry did not drop her like ginny but instead pulled her back down into the water which felt cool and fresh against her skin with him and held her under for a few seconds before releasing her she thrashed about in his grip and when he released her she pushed through the water until she reached the hot air breaking free and blinking water out of her eyes looking around in the bright light harry and ron were laughing together and ginny was as well she had swum quite far away but paused to watch hermione and her giggles cost her dearly because draco caught up with her the next moment and pounced on her her sounds died as she was dragged down with draco into the deep water with a last look of disbelief and desperateness both reappeared draco was holding ginny in his arms by a hand at her back and under her knees she was clinging onto his neck for dear life as though it would save her and water ran down them ginny spat out a long rope of it and draco watched her like an executioner at the gallows giving her the opportunity to speak a final word in her defense before carrying out the deed ginny opened her mouth angrily and draco raised his brows as though he wasntabout to listen to a single word she said hermione grinned and harry and ron smirked mischievously draco malfoy you filthy little rat ginny started furiously and sternly sounding identical to her mother dontthink you are getting away with th splash draco had cut her off in mid sentence by leaning back into the water suddenly and pulling ginny with him because she was clinging so tightly to his neck her last word was drowned by both water and laughter hermione failed to stifle a bout of chuckles the two others were for some peculiar reason subdued in their snorts and snickers harry emerald eyes were glinting and so were ron blue and both of them turned to look at hermione again both with identical expressions that read are you looking at me hermione thought it would be worth it to try and flee their clutches safely and so quickly turned and made for the far end of the pool harry and ron mutually decided it would be more sporting to allow her a head start and watched her swim away for a few moments before following both men were much more strongly built and would have caught up with her easily with their ability to plough water had hermione not been intercepted she had actually touched the far side of the pool with her outstretched fingers before a rough hand caught her ankle tightly and held her in place she clawed to try and get a firm grip on the edge but didntmanage before draco pulled her back with one hand with ease in his other arm he held a struggling ginny to his hip she could hear the two other boy like men stop when they noticed their prey had already been caught hermione knew they were far too strong for her and was less inclined to protest other than verbally when draco dragged her through the water backwards right into the reach of harry and ron nononono she half groaned half pleaded as draco handed her over to her captors why thank you draco old pal ron said with a false posh accent as he got a firm grip on hermione other ankle hermione let herself float scowling at the retreating edge of the pool wet hair clinging to her face not at all my good friend draco said likewise with a short nod and hermione felt herself being pulled back to the shallows while draco returned to his hostage who had taken to laughing weakly every time she tried and failed to loosen his pincer like grip around her shoulders but all in all she was putting up a terrific fight and draco was starting to get red claw marks along his arm from her scratches hermione continued to scowl as she was dragged backwards and could not see where the others were though feeling them each holding a different ankle suddenly she stopped moving and the rush of water around her that kept her afloat stopped and she almost disappeared under the water hadntshe been scooped up most uncomfortably by harry the air was much cooler the second time she was pulled out of it as it dried on her skin and harry black hair was damp and remarkably flat he grinned boyishly at her and hermione opened her mouth desperately as he shifted her slightly in his arms like ginny to let out a string of verbal protest ron had stopped on her other side to block the main means of escape and making it further impossible to avoid a good dunking harry dontyou dare no i ll get water up my nose she said wildly looking pleadingly from harry to ron who both had their brows raised at her then shared an amused look between them hermione was not about to follow ginny mistake and refused to hold on to harry despite the feeling that she would accidentally slip right out of his grip harry had begun to grin wickedly but ron looked as though he was trying really hard to feign sincerity harry lifted her up higher but ron held up a hand to tell him to stop harry grin faltered with slight confusion ron to show that all was still fine mimicked the wicked expression hold on a minute harry ron said moving the dripping hand he held up to reach for hermione wrist she didntprotest as he took her left hand in his own out of curiosity we canthave a lady in discomfort hermione jaw dropped sardonically he lifted hermione hand up to her face and took her forefinger and thumb and pinched them over her nose for her implying she should do the same she kept her fingers in place when he took his hand away we are gentlemen after all ron said reasonably hermione found it hard to snort when pinching her nose and settled for exclaiming instead gentlemen ha you two little rascals dontknow the meaning of the word her free right arm flayed a little in surprise as harry deliberately threatened to drop her but picked her up again at the last second that wasntvery nice ron tut tutted with mock disapproval he took a couple of steps back in the water and hermione eyed him warily over her hand there was a loud splash behind her and she tried to twist to see but harry wouldntlet her though it was obvious draco had gotten ginny again from the gurgled shriek of laughter hey ron said harry suddenly making hermione look up at the underside of his jaw ron looked back at harry with apparent mild interest as though he had been thinking of other things catch hermione gasped as she was thrown bodily into the air in ron direction and the sensation made it feel as though something heavy had been dropped into her stomach drips flew from her as she began to sink rapidly and she knew that any moment she would be gone under the surface of the water but to her surprise ron reacted fast enough and she felt herself gently caught and the scary sensation in her stomach settled slightly she was cradled in his wet arms and still had a hand over her nose ron was smirking roguishly and hermione tried to let go of her nose and get a hold on his neck like ginny had deciding that being dragged beneath water was much more tempting then flying through the air again before she could even release her fingers she was lowered then flung up into the fresh august air like a spring and collided with harry bare chest who caught her somewhat more roughly than ron had she was too busy trying to follow exactly the same plan on harry by getting a hold of his neck that she didntsee ron look innocently into the sky and take a big step to the right with an ignorant expression harry was too quick for her and ripped her free of the water again and physically chucked her in the direction ron was supposed to be standing with a huge grin hermione still had the hand on her nose and caught a glimpse of his expression before she hit the water with complete shock having expected ron arms to be there to keep her from dropping she sunk out of sight and a heavy ripple of water washed over the two laughing men hermione head broke free a moment later spluttering and she lifted her hands to wipe the water out of her eyes ron when he had enough space between snickers to force the same sincere look gave her his apology oops sorry hermione he said trying to sound apathetic but his lips twitched uncontrollably missed he shrugged he grinned at her playfully and hermione in return scowled good naturedly in a way that meant you know i will always love you you little brat and though she didntknow it at the time that was the first moment in months severus had been entirely driven from her thoughts the next day saw hermione and the rest of the household in an incredibly cheerful mood she grinned at everything that walked including the squirrels she was dry once more and grateful for it with free time on her hands she had finally had a chance to get her wish and after breakfast which was just as long as the one the previous day she had collected a good book from her bedroom and informed the others of where she was planning to go in case they panicked she was about to at last explore the open spaces of the bright looking forest which looked a lot brighter than the forbidden forest she strolled along the paved path until it stopped then kicked her way through the bright green grass blue robes dragging her down and book clutched firmly in her hand her hair had been restored to its old curls expertly for the first time in ages and it gave her heart that extra lightness that accompanied the reflection of feelings in appearance a smile refused to remove itself from her lips not that she tried to the fun she had had the previous day was still on her mind and she felt unbelievably cleansed as though if dunked enough in the water of the pool the water would have magical healing properties her mind was fresh and clear of poisonous thoughts she grinned at a couple of snails dragging themselves across the dirt between blades of grass she entered the edge of the small wood and kept going until the grass slowly began to disperse and thin she continued to walk until the end of the lawn was definite and the only thing covering the dry earth was bracken she stopped looking around her and breathing the scent deep into her lungs there was a large oak to her far right a little deeper into the forest and it looked perfect to lean against she approached it and put out her free hand onto the smoothed bark checking it werenttoo lumpy and deeming it perfect she smiled and withdrew her hand turned and settled herself cross legged at its roots drawing her book into her lap and letting it fall open she found it perfect to the shape of her back and the ground to be sufficiently warm and firm under her and was ensconced in a matter of minutes her nose buried in the pages of her book she hardly noticed the time fly and when her stomach let out a hearty growl she broke her sentence in surprise to see that it was already lunchtime she gave a regretful look at the base of the trunk as she picked herself up and returned straight away after lunch and her tree fast became her comfort spot for the next two years ooooo two years what do you think this means is this the end of the story was this the bad ending i told you about hang on where do you think you re going it might not be finished there will definitely be another upload so stick around but i will not say whether it is the epilogue or another chapter you ll just have to bite your nails until then am i sounding a little mean right now sorry if they are a little ooc in the last bit but that scene was based somewhat subdued on my peculiar summer which was a mixture of deadly dull on some days and over exciting fun on others let me tell you it is not half as fun as it seems to get dunked though you tend to laugh a whole lot more i dunno why i think it a reflex reaction or sumthin like that if u r curious i actually attempted fanart okay i have no talent to draw but the two pics look relatively human which is more than i can say for anything else i ve ever drawn before if you wanna check it out this is the website shh the second picture is based on this story although i cannot master curly hair it is of hermione outside the gates very simple there was severus but i had to cut him out if u saw the drawing u would agree review i really appreciate them those of you who have already reviewed ur too nice theories and opinions always interesting to read p p see u next upload snakecharmer ps i only just yesterday finished this chapter in bed and have no idea when the next will be up because workload is mounting should i have given this chapter to u later yes its short i know u ve already noticed but there u go its only part of chapter 23 sorry read on to find out why cookie crumb of chapter 23 the hate of love o so sorry yet again but i did warn u i know i should be hung up on a stick and left for the vultures but these past weeks have been the most eventful and still slow paced i can recall i suppose i used to write to relieve myself of thinking of severus too much i could pour it all into my writing and breathe easily but now severus is not what haunts my mind dontworry i will always love him etc all that but when u find something real it so much more confusing and wonderful and i completely hate it especially when u can question their sincerity surprisingly that is not the inspiration for this chapter i ve had this plan since august just like romantic verses just like a joyous end just like a memory it twists me just like romantic verses just like a joyous end twist twisting me afi stands for a fire inside celluloid dream go look up the lyrics for it they re amazing its pure poetry the whole thing all their stuff is i have now definitely finally found my favorite artist to tell the honest truth closes eyes and waits for slap i completely forget about af totally forgot this summer i found it hard to tear myself away from a computer now i still find it hard to tear myself away from the computer but for different reasons u know as much i would love to get into great detail of this long story almost as long as this one i wontdeprive u a second longer its not like ur reading this anyway o it struck a chill to his marrow his whole flesh was consumed by shivers of nonexistent pain he had never been stung by an insult but her voice did strange things to him he could not move despite the overwhelming urge to step forward and either shake her violently by the shoulders or kiss her could the woman not see how she had burned him he knew that wasntthe correct order of things he had burned her and suffered for it but humored his temper with lies what are you doing here she continued when he made no move to speak the confrontation between the stranger and snape made several heads turn in curiosity severus spared them a few dark glances which sent them scuttling off to the great hall i do believe i work here he said it and then it was too late to take it back he was giving her the tone he would give a misbehaving student this did more damage than he liked to consider hermione flushed angrily this had confirmed her suspicions of how little she had meant to him that he could just dismiss her like anyone with his snide retorts you belong in azkaban with all your friends or she stopped herself before she outright wished him dead hermione he began attempting an apology for his comment to appease her he took a step closer to her back she took one sharply backwards and cut him off loudly dontyou ever refer to me by my first name ever again she spat temper rising along with her voice a few people began to stop and stare in blatant nosiness she had a fiery rage smoldering in her pained eyes and severus felt it prudent to back away slightly for both the stares and her possible actions which he had misjudged terribly before perhaps he said in a soft calm voice that held enough edge to it for appearances sake we should go to my quarters to discuss things if there is to be a confrontation here is the worst of places ha hermione burst out in a sarcastic hysteria there was a collecting crowd now that were failing to look as though they were just moving very slowly to the great hall as she laughed her hood slipped back off of her head and curls following the sight of her face there were a few loud gasps from the older students i dontknow why you try to defend your reputation severus she snapped spitefully feeling the deepest of revolting twisting inside her she was furious with herself for letting his brooding menacing sight get to her it was never the most wonderful of reputations severus tried to force a stern glare onto his features under their watching eyes that was uncalled for he began icily but as hermione began to swell indignantly he continued in softer tones and i deserve far worse there was a small moment affected by his gentler voice where they locked eyes and all retorts and hatred deserted her hermione granger gasped a rather impudent and obtuse dennis creevey it was enough to bring her back to earth she looked around at the faces there were so many she hadntseen more than five at a time for the past two years and their attention was slightly intimidating she turned back to severus looked him hard in the eyes less openly than a moment before and lifted her chin maybe your quarters would be preferable for a conversation of this sort she said frostily and brushed past him towards the dungeon he cast a dark glower over the sea of peering faces which had given up pretences he then swept after her close on her heel and heart pounding deep within his chest o did miss granger arrive safely minerva mcgonagall was in a fluster and had asked that question repeatedly in the past ten minutes of the welcome feast start she leaned over her food to get a better look at the open doors into the empty grand entrance all students had been seated all words had been said minus an introduction of hermione and the food had appeared before them and their returning student had not shown her face dumbledore had a deep seated unease that he knew exactly where she was and didntwant to consider the difficulties that would result amongst certain members of staff this year he turned to mcgonagall with a benevolence and weariness in his tone minerva my dear have you taken a look at our staff table this was the most information she had been able to extract from him all evening she blinked behind her square spectacles and shook her head dumbledore closed his eyes and swept out a weathered hand slowly to imply she should do so she followed the direction of his fingertips past to familiar colleagues and then her eyes fell on an empty chair and it was not that of any ordinary staff member either severus snape had not shown up for the welcome dinner and neither had hermione and it clicked smartly into place oh my god albus this isntgood she panicked and in a flustered movement forgot composure and her food entirely pushing herself back from the table to stand dumbledore laid a hand on her arm quickly and she hesitated long enough to fall prey to his penetrating blue stare using unspoken words mcgonagall was made to calm down and settle herself in her seat again but her eyes flickered uneasily around the room hermione can take care of herself minerva this has been held back long enough mcgonagall didntanswer but bitterly stabbed her chops with a fork o im so sorry keep a look out i will replace this chapter with the full thing but for some reason every word is a pain to get through so it may be a while cough sound familiar but i had to give u guys something soon or else that would be just mean of me this is all i ve got down its not as long as i expected it to be there will be a confrontation for those biting their nails but what will be

herself minerva this has been held back long enough mcgonagall didntanswer but bitterly stabbed her chops with a fork o she felt him behind her brooding and menacing close over her shoulder and scowled as hard as she could trying to force bitterness and ignore him as a presence her hands were shaking as balled fists and she kept them hidden in the long sleeves of her robes and concentrated on breathing normally and trying to slow her heart rate the two of them rigidly walked down the torch lit corridor the tension in the fine cool air thickened and pulsated seeing the leather couch still there by the fire never transfigured back into the original two winged high backed armchairs made it impossible to look away no specific memories leapt out at her but her mind fogged in a smudge of emotions and multiple colorful images she realized she had stopped moving when a pair of hands rested lightly on her shoulders from behind she quickly moved away from the touch but there was something in her that regretted the action she couldntturn around to look at him couldntfind the strength in her to yell so she weakly moved over to couch and smoothly sat herself in the corner of it with her chin in her palm her heart wouldntstop pounding two years and not even a warning of this happening he was supposed to be dead her heart gave her a painful sting in reply to that thought ok at least in azkaban her heart only gave a weak squeeze of protest and she satisfied herself with that the crackling fire cast a dancing glow across their drawn faces severus stayed back silently observing like a still shadow as hermione watched the flames with glazed eyes and tried to collect her thoughts and logic the silence was not uncomfortable but heavy and seemed to last a second when in reality it spanned out to about 25 minutes of pure silence and held poise he was waiting for her to scream and yell at him she was waiting for him to coolly tell her that she would have to pull herself together if they were to work together and they were never to bring up anything that had happened they had never spoken out of the classroom he watched the side of her face half obscured by her hand with a piercing gaze he could not read her she seemed sad but otherwise unfazed or she was frozen in fear and struggling for thought or she was stewing and stirring her anger with every second silence and nursing her hatred for him maybe all three and there was nothing but the flickering she looked so much older his fault suddenly hermione seemed to snap and cave internally she curled herself up into a small ball in the corner of the couch pulling her knees up to cover her face and hugging them furiously she didntappear to be crying though within her her heart was doing back flips and she felt the world close in from all sides i cantget it to stop make it stop she mumbled to her knees so softly that severus could distinguish no more than a few sounds she closed her eyes more aware than ever of her eyelashes and the sore stinging behind her lids she took three slow long breaths to ease herself and with a sigh uncurled herself from the corner severus knew the silence had to be broken how do you propose on staying here three years in my presence and not expect to cross ways he asked softly yet darkly hermione felt a flicker of bitterness as much as i can wish for it that appears to be out of the question she retorted snidely not taking her eyes away from the fire so she paused i suggest we clear things out of the way leaving no unspoken tension severus stiffened i see he muttered averting his gaze away from her in that case i would like to make certain that you are aware of a few things such as such as i never intended for you to be dragged into the dark sides dealings or to be made one of the circle hermione snorted thickly still refusing to pay him a glance her heart betrayed her and raced wildly she had never considered she would hear this argument she assumed he wouldntdeny his intentions i dontbuy your bullshit she spat with finality it is not bullshit he growled in frustration taking a step closer and i resent that no one ever told you otherwise seeing as dumbledore himself was aware of my plan before i took you to the dark lord hermione forgot how fascinating the fire was and jerked around dropping the hand that supported her chin dumbledore knew what you were going to do he may not have liked the idea but he concluded that there was no other way hermione shook her head and tore her eyes away from his again and returned the fire giving him the shoulder i dontbelieve you it not a question of belief he said calmly continuing to approach her at a tedious rate slowly advancing silently on her he stopped over her shoulder trying to catch her forestalled gaze still careful not to touch her he leant close to her ear hermione free hand slipped into her inner pocket dontthink there hasntbeen a moment when i haventwanted to kill myself for what i put you through a moment when i haventached in a way i would normally have despised to admit a moment where i didntrealize what i had thrown away it happened too quickly hermione had ripped out her wand in a flash but severus reflexes were intact and in the span of half a second she had her wrist held above her head in a pincer like grip with her wand in her fist there were angry tears budding in her eyes and her teeth were gritted to hold back a wince at the bite of his fingers she hesitated only a moment avoiding his eyes before she struggled to pull herself free of his grasp he let her go almost at once for fear of bruising her and she withdrew roughly kneeling on the sofa she looked a perfect wild mess in his eyes of beauty battered you bastard she shrieked i didntcome here to have you try and ensnare me again in your poisonous traps she aimed her wand at him and stumbled off the couch flawlessly he simply stood his ground watching her through an unreadable look while she retreated hurriedly he knew better than to follow her he had learnt his lesson by now about hysteria so he just watched her leave heart consumed with pain but it was just emotional pain he had gotten used to it by now he could live like it wasntthere tomorrow he would give her time to cool and then and then he didntknow o hermione broke out into a run as soon as she cleared the dungeons streaking right past the great hall with a sudden loss of appetite her heart was racing at a hundred miles an hour and the wound stung like a dried flesh wound that had been rashly split open oozing vile putrid juices and burning like acid she fled down past the kitchens in the direction of the hufflepuff house and begun to slow as she realized she didntknow where she would be sleeping she snuffled quite pathetically and wiped a couple of unwelcome tears roughly away stopping completely she felt so lost and helpless that she felt no shame in sinking to the floor and hugging her knees once more as though they would save her mentally she cursed herself for her lack of strength and vengefully started to fabricate fantasies of what she could have said that may have been more suitable miss is lost hermione started nearly out of her skin in surprise having depended on the fact she was alone she looked up hurriedly and laid eyes on a curious looking house elf whose bulbous eyes were round with worry how come miss is not up enjoying the feast she prodded squeakily noticing the startled expression the elf proclaimed smartly i is wigma the house elf i is i heard someone walking and wondered why they was not at the feast they must be lost says i her ears pricked up and she smiled proudly in her little toga robes oh wigma hermione said relieved and seeing her chance it a good thing you came i not hungry but i would like to find my chambers but i do not know where they are wigma eyes bulged ooh ooh she squealed gesturing at hermione countenance and hair you is miss granger hermione nodded and felt grateful for the recognition we house elves is hearing many things about you hermione heart sank again reflecting on moments before i knows where your chambers is hermione felt a slight feather of relief lighten her heart she eyed the elf with shinning eyes of gratitude then did something that would horrify wigma and that she would never speak of to another soul hermione reached for her and gave her a thankful squeeze of a hug o in her new chambers hermione had thanked a stunned wigma and sent her back to her kitchen where she was meant to be helping with the feast but she refused to watch hermione go hungry and promised to return with a tray of food she would leave at her desk her room was not particularly large being just the right amount of cozy without being cramped it was perfectly square with a door to the bathroom one corner was home to a massive oak wardrobe with drawers beneath the wall beside it revealed a large window between it and the bed a traditional princess dream with pulled back drapes the other wall was covered from top to bottom with books she suspected dumbledore had had a hand in it the final corner adjacent to the door held a fair sized desk perfect for long nights with a quill what caught her eye was something shaking on the bed the luggage she had sent ahead was waiting for her on the bed and one wicker basket was quivering hermione shed her traveling robes and threw them over the chair at her desk before hurrying over to let her furry familiar loose she did the clasps and crookshanks leapt out she scooped him up for comfort crookshanks she exclaimed and he good naturedly put up with her embraces which he would normally wriggle free from for he had missed her too she lay back with him on the bed abruptly overcome with a wave of exhaustion and crookshanks settled on her stomach under her arms purring loudly under the moonlight she fell into an uneasy slumber her reveries were invaded by a raven blackness o two left well i used to judge when it was time to end a chapter depending on it size but for these last chapters i dontexpect them to be much more than this length at most i so excited the end is near and this time i really mean it now off i go to write the next chapter love any of you who are still interested and if you can still remember the plot cause i didn t blush snakecharmer chapter 4 breaking and entering so far after snape acts strangely in class hermione decides to do some digging and finds out that his little sister just died feeling bad for him inevitably leads to her discovering a strange liking for him she comes up with a plan that will satisfy her weird feelings temporarily not really understanding what she is getting herself into after class she puts in action phase 1 finding out his initial reaction to touch snape was leaving later that night but hermione knew that she couldntbegin stage two until tomorrow since it was hogsmead weekend she concluded that that would be the best time snape would be gone and she could stay behind on the pretence of wanting to study the one part that scared her the most not counting the actual rule breaking was having to borrow harry invisibility cloak without him knowing but apart from this hermione did not feel the full weight of what she was actually planning to do her logic was impaired by her heart there was a fuzzy kind of excitement rising deep inside her when she went to bed she snuggled herself up under the covers and relaxed letting her imagination take control she wondered what exactly it would feel like to have snape arms wrapped around her waist and to feel his warmth not just from her finger tips like today but from her whole body to be sheltered by him she smirked to herself in bed without being aware of it what would it feel like to have his fingers stroking her hair as she rested her forehead on his shoulder what would it be like to be able to stare into his eyes and see a reflection of her emotions she chose the setting to be the side of the lake exactly where it had all started for her they would both be lying on the large red blanket and pillow he would be holding her close to him so that when he breathed she could feel the air brush the back of her neck giving her shivers she would be able to feel his heart through his soft black robes that suited him so well and he would talk softly to her all night as they sat under the large pale moon hermione sighed and in seconds she was asleep a tender smile planted on her features the morning could not come soon enough next day hermione leapt out of bed the moment her she opened her eyes she stretched her heart sped up nervously as she prepared to go downstairs she skipped down the steps and did the last two buttons on her shirt before pulling on her robes on her way she slowed at the last few steps trying desperately to hide her bubbly excitement from harry and ron pinching her lips together she repeated in her mind the excuse she was going to use just to be sure she didntgive off any uncertainty ron awaited her at the base of the staircase with a grin and she seized the opportunity to vent some happiness by beaming back where harry she asked struggling to force the smile off of her face oh he was still getting dressed when i left him he said offhandedly listen ron she started i think it would be better if i did not go to hogsmead with you guys today i really have study she said with an amazingly convincing look what he frowned eyes flicking to the boys staircase for a split second as he saw harry come down then back to hermione hermione he sounded exasperated you are the last person who needs to study you deserve a break he rolled his eyes hermione firmly shook her head harry finally stumbled over to them with a toothy grin hey he struggled to straighten his robes as he said it did i miss anything hermione wants to stay here and study today said ron with distaste looking away from her harry turned on her aw hermione he said enthusiastically please come hermione temporarily forgot about herself because she noted the unusual lively happiness in his voice that she herself was feeling she had a firm suspicion that harry was either infatuated with someone like herself or seeing someone she chose to keep quiet about it shaking her head firmly again she started moving towards the portrait hole the boys followed her lead they filed out of gryffindor common room silently they remained quiet for most of the way and hermione inkling that harry was indeed seeing someone grew at the glowing look plastered onto his face she on the other hand found that her excitement was short lived as it was rapidly dissolving into panic was she really going to do this was she really going to break into snape chambers she leaned over the banister teetering dangerously she waved goodbye to harry and ron who waved back energetically in her head the words i cantdo this i cantdo this were repeating over and over again when their heads disappeared into the bustling crowd hermione pushed herself back off the stone banister she sighed softly and ambled slowly back up the steps the second the last person was gone and the grand entrance was empty hermione dropped her slow walk and raced up the marble staircase she ran down the corridor hair bouncing and her robes flapping behind her until she skidded to a halt in front of the portrait muttering the password she climbed through the hole in the wall she sniffed and straightened her robes trying to look normal for the first and second years sitting by the fire striding past them she discretely slipped up to the boys dorm when none of them were looking she tip toed quickly up the steps and when she reached the door she pushed it open gently just in case no one was there of course she hurried over to harry bedside table yanked open the drawer and found the cloak folded neatly in one corner looking around her once to be sure she snatched it and hid it under her robes once out of the room she sneaked past the first and second years again and slipped out through the portrait hole as she was walking quickly she felt the adrenaline start to pump yes she could do this and she would she wasnteven one hundred percent sure why she wanted to in the first place she just knew she had to she had a burning desire to she wanted to see what sort of books he read where he slept where he worked she shivered those thoughts did not sound right she was certainly not stalking him she thought of it more like getting to understand him better she was almost swamped by another daydream on her way down the more she considered her mysterious professor brushing those thoughts aside for the moment she concentrated on how she was going to do it probably a simple alohamora sp would do it but she wasntsure she doubted whether he put serious locking spells on his chambers but she had checked up on a large number of counter spells for them just in case she was down in the cool dungeons in minutes and she passed their classroom the room to the left of it which was attached to the class was the student supplies on the right hand side was a door to snape personal supplies also connected to the class but forbidden for students she looked along the wall past the storeroom although she could not see a door she knew there was one somewhere but she did not want to waste her time trying to find it because to enter needed a password she was instead going to assume that snape private stores were joined with his chambers and try there first she slipped into the classroom looking around to see if anyone was coming once she was inside the empty room filled with silent desks she pulled the cloak out from her robes and wrapped it around her winding her way between the empty cauldron holders beside the desks she reached the personal stores of severus snape standing before the door she almost hesitated but she had already broken into here before the only difference was she was going to have to break into the other door inside she slipped a hand into her pocket and pulled out her wand muttered the spell she had used last time and pushed open the large door it swung open easily and the sight that lay in front of hermione was more fascinating than she had remembered the shelves stacked to the ceiling with the rarest and most wonderful ingredients awed her she stood there floored for a good amount of time then remembering what she was doing she turned around and closed the door behind her she took a couple of daring steps forward taking to time to look at every single curious item there was she even managed to find a few she had never heard of before one was strangely similar to ginger root except it had a pair of closed eyes and long root like tentacles draped over the edge of the shelf the smells filled her senses and she felt herself becoming strangely elated she was stepping into severus snape world she slowly made her way to the back of the room and came to a corner that could not be seen from entering because it was hidden by the shelves hermione rounded the corner and found what she was looking for a tall black door pointing her wand at it she muttered the first unlocking spell that came to mind then tried the door handle she nodded smugly to herself quite unaware that it had already been unlocked she leaned forward and pushed the ebony door open cautiously the moment she stepped into the dark room the fire automatically flared up making her start once she saw no one was in the room she relaxed it wasntas if they could see her anyway but this invisibility cloak was stifling her she quickly ran to the doorway across from her and checked in each room there was no one with a heavy sigh she pulled off the crushing cloak it was so much easier to use when harry and ron would help her hold it up taking in her surroundings she saw the room was really comfortable with three tall green chairs a spartan desk with a few flasks of potion in one corner a green and silver marble chess set and bookshelves piled with fusty books she looked back at the potions on the table to distract herself from the number of books she had never laid eyes on she sidled over to the table picking up the corked glass container with a pearly purple potion inside she tipped it slightly sideways to check its consistency it was very thick most likely a stress relief potion she uncorked it to catch a whiff definitely a stress relief potion for a vague moment she wondered why he would need it then it all came flooding back the pity for him welled up inside her again he was not allowed to show his feelings bound by his own rules of conduct that he had set up to protect himself with putting down the potion in its spot she turned back to the bookshelf it was so big that it towered above her she gaped never had she seen such a wide variety of rare books she spent a good ten minutes reading the names of different books with wonder suddenly she gasped with excitement right in front of her was the magic of the ancients there were only eleven copies in the world the ministry owned one copy she was sure dumbledore must have another but she was speechless she wanted it so badly that she did not even think as she reached her fingers forward and pulled it out of the shelf by its spine ever so gently she slid it open to the first page she held her breath as she silently read the caption under the title fallaces sunt rerum species the appearances of things are deceptive what was that supposed to mean was that a clue to what sort of spells this book contained she felt the adrenaline starting to flow as she turned the next page she frowned then shut the book with a snap no she should not spend her time reading without really thinking she put the book into her bag for another time she couldntwait to read it again she did not consider at that time that snape was bound to notice turning back to the apartment she went over to the fireplace and took a seat in the middle chair facing the fire she felt a slight impression in the chair she was sitting on it was a very comfortable chair or impression she got up again quickly she decided she wanted to see his bedroom before leaving she did not know why but she was starting to feel like leaving maybe it was the book she wanted to read she strolled over to the bedroom and peered inside it was magnificent with high drapes hanging over the bed and very elegant shelves and cupboards lining the walls what struck her was the fact that there were still more books in here as well it was then that she decided she had to leave before she got too sucked in and stayed too long with a longing look at the books she turned to go back she picked up the invisibility cloak on her way and shut the large black door behind her hermione entered her common room and was greeted with a surprise ginny had decided not to go to hogsmead as well and when hermione closed the portrait behind her ginny leapt up from her chair in front of the fire beside the first years hermione jumped in surprise ginny why arentyou at hogsmead she asked with a little more concern than she had intended ginny frowned at her with confusion i ve been wanting to talk to you where have you been she looked really curious hermione dodged the question with a question why this is really important she snapped exasperated she grabbed hermione hand and proceeded to drag her towards the girls dorm she did not see what was so important if she had not known where she had just been she was forced to trot up the stairs behind ginny and pulled roughly into her dorm she snatched her wrist out of ginny death grip and followed her over to her bed ginny sat down on her own bed and hermione sat opposite her at the other end now what is this about gin she said with a little bite to add emphasis she was starting to look nervous and guilty avoiding eye contact and shuffling on the spot well she said nervously it something that you cannot tell the boys hermione understand hermione just nodded slowly wanting to hear more ginny took a deep breath and continued it was sort of an accident at the same time it sort of wasn t she was not making much sense i kind of wanted it but i didntthink it would ever happen it just so strange what are you talking about hermione leaned closer to hear better looking at hermione carefully she spat it all out at once hermione i i i kissed i kissed draco malfoy she looked straight back down at her lap hermione felt as if she had been slapped in the face with a wooden stick she found herself struggling to breathe what she croaked gasping for breath malfoy she looked at ginny in shock who looked back with wide innocent eyes the draco malfoy who has made our lives hell especially harry and your own brother for as long as we can remember ginny started to fiddle with her hair tensely ginny i surprised at you but then she thought of her little crush on snape and her shock dissolved into interest looking at her with a small smile she leaned forward tell me more it was ginny turn to look surprised huh you give me all the details and i ll tell you where i have just been she hesitated then smirked but you cannot tell the boys ginny eyes widened in curiosity and she let out a small oo of excitement leaning back on her pillow with the air of someone with a very important message she began to recall the exact details of how it had happened ok details well i was walking back from the library yesterday when i ran into malfoy alone there was no one else in the corridor and we started insulting each other while we walked i dontknow why but i could tell he wasntintending those insults to really bite they definitely werenthis best hermione lay on her stomach and propped her head up on her elbows staring intently at ginny he was putting you down she asked with skepticism well it was more like an insult match each one had to be worse than the other last comment i was actually having fun i ve secretly been attracted to draco for a while now but i kept pushing it away because the circumstances are all wrong uh huh said hermione hanging on to her every word carefully then his last comment was actually really hurtful i wontrepeat it it really did sting hermione eyes widened then he stopped dead beside me when he realized what he had said and put an arm out to stop me i was so upset i almost stopped liking him altogether i almost kept walking but i stopped and faced him hermione took a sharp breath he made me look him straight in the eye and sincerely apologized for what he said i was gobsmacked nobody i think has ever managed to get draco to apologize before i just looked at him for the longest time you know then finally i think the tension was killing him he leaned forward and kissed me she gasped and smiled at the same time more more well he was a very good kisser i ll give you that very sweet use your imagination i was unable to realize what was going on because it was too much for me to comprehend draco liked me back and he was kissing me then afterwards he gave me this look that said he wanted to make sure i was ok with what he had just done so she smirked i kissed him again o o said hermione excitedly that is so sweet who would have thought that malfoy could act like that ginny nodded violently in agreement is that all she asked now getting nervous that she would have to reveal her secret it had sounded at first that her kissing draco malfoy was as bad as her liking snape a world gone mad but she was starting to think that draco was not such an unusual thing so said ginny snapping out of her dreamy mode and becoming much more focused on hermione where were you today she added a small smirk in reply to her earlier one oh she said offhandedly just went for a walk by the greenhouses ginny frowned suddenly i dontbelieve you why arentyou going to tell me i told you something very confidential and you even offered to tell me you cantjust decide to leave me hanging ginny whined hermione felt slightly guilty and decided she was right and dropped her voice this is going to make your kiss sound insignificant she started very seriously ginny laughed yeah right i serious ginny she snapped ginny smile dropped this must not go any further than you you understand ginny nodded curiously ok she sighed i started researching the cause for snape behavior one night ginny features contorted as she began jumping to multiple conclusions ginny she said sharply dontcreate a more dramatic story in you head whatever you do and dontmake assumptions just let me tell the story she nodded apologetically now where was i oh yeah that was what i needed the newspapers for ginny eyes showed understanding i was surprised to find that his little sister had died ginny gasped i started feeling bad for him everybody jumps to the conclusion he an evil person because he hides himself from the rest of the world he intrigued me ginny frowning in confusion again so she started but hermione cut her off let me tell it like it is she said sternly when he started acting normal again i began watching him to see any differences to prove he still was in pain he hides it really well i found myself starting to admire him ginny head was whizzing with the information and i started thinking of him more and more she trailed off slowly so she said carefully leaving pause to make sure hermione would not cut her off again what your trying to say is that you like snape she choked on her own words hermione nodded quietly ginny made a funny noise in her throat wait that doesntexplain where you were today she continued with a look of comprehension on her face where you hermione gasped no no snape gone away for the weekend to his sister funeral she sounded sad again today today i er i sort of broke into snape chambers ginny gasped so hard that it looked painful hermione you didn t hermione started reaching over the bed to open her bag she very gently pulled out the magic of the ancients ginny just watched silently as she put it softly in between them on the bed hermione what is that knowing very well it was a book but not seeing its relevance she looked up at her and back at the book seriously this is a very rare book one of eleven made after a small pause she continued i took it from snape personal bookshelf ginny shrieked in scared excitement oh hermione i cantbelieve you did this hermione nodded in agreement neither can i i also cantbelieve i was stupid enough to bring this with me he got to notice she sounded remorseful ginny felt sorry for her it ok she said comfortingly it ll all turn out for the best you ll see hermione nodded gloomily harry and ron returned later that day and hermione was relieved to find that harry did not notice anything out of the ordinary when they went to greet her nothing appeared different but when they sat down for dinner together in the grand hall hermione and ginny kept sharing knowing looks that were driving him up the wall but he knew that there would be no point in him asking they would just cover for each other he had enough on his mind anyway hermione felt that sharing with ginny had definitely been the right thing to do she felt a whole lot better and she and ginny were much closer than ever before when malfoy got up to leave hermione gave ginny a signal with her eyebrows that meant she should leave too there was a shared smile and then ginny was gone moments later she still felt that she had a lot to deal with knowing that she had in a way brought it all on herself just made it worse she had failed to mention to ginny what she planned to do next just thinking about it gave her severe butterflies that night in bed she dreamed of his arms around her and his breath on her neck sunday came and went severus would not be returning till late that night so she spent the whole day reading her book shut away in her dorm harry and ron had to send ginny up to check on her ginny grinned at her and left moments later convincing the boys she was studying she spent most of the night reading and went to bed early in the morning having only read the first seven chapters of eighty six she decided that either the pages were incredibly thin or it had some sort of charm to make it appear like a relatively normal sized book morning came way too soon for hermione she felt her limbs crying out for sleep as she sat up in bed she moaned at the brightness of day but then her eyes snapped open when she realized snape must be back and he must have noticed his missing book already she had to finish it as soon as possible and return it when she knew it was safe she hurried to get dressed and shower today was the day the excitement was welling up in her and her worries of the book were forgotten he could not guess that she had taken it anyway she could hardly believe it later today the last two stages would be carried out later that day she would hopefully satisfy some of her growing peculiar wishes severus brushed to the soot off himself distastefully as he stepped out from his fireplace he leaned back towards to fire to gather his trunk it had not been the most cheerful holiday obviously it had been rather disturbing to watch his baby sister be lowered into a six foot hole as she went down he thought of all the times she had helped him out of sticky situations he remembered the heart broken look on her face when he had told her he was joining the death eaters he tried to shake his sadness and decided on having an early night sleep for the first time in years he gripped his trunk tightly he really should unpack but he did not want to he went over to the study if he put it in his bedroom it would be irritating knowing that he was putting something off until the next day as he entered the fire flared up in its normal way he moved towards the desk and propped it against the leg and was about to leave again when he froze something was definitely amiss there was a strange scent that did not belong in his chambers only snape would have been able to find the significance of an alien scent when it would have naturally been overlooked by anyone else that is what becomes of a potions master who can identify many different concoctions by their smell this smelled sweet possibly bananas he could not tell but he could tell that it was a distinctive smell that had no reason to be here had someone been here he looked around the study for any signs of abnormality his eyes narrowed as he spied a gap in his bookshelf he saw to it that the only gaps on his shelves would be when he was reading one of them why would someone take a book from him he wandered over to that area and tried to recall which books where there and checking to see they still were when he could not find the magic of the ancients he frowned harder that was one of his best books why would someone take it if it was a student how would they be smart enough to know that this was one of his most valuable he breathed in again trying to identify the sweet smell but without success he felt his head fill with questions and concluded the only sure cure was sleep he gave a long look at the gap then turned and headed back to his bedroom hermione said ginny firmly but with a lot of concern in her tone eat something hermione looked down meekly at her plate food did not seem so appetizing right then she felt the blood leaving her face the more she looked at the food so she closed her eyes and shook her head ginny frowned and stopped eating herself she stood up to lean over the table and put a hand on hermione forehead she was surprised at the same time appreciated the fact that ginny had mrs weasley as a mother are you feeling ok she said as she sat back down hermione shook her head again are you ill another shake of the head hmm she picked up her goblet took a drink then stared at hermione again then what hermione felt that maybe it would help to tell ginny what she was planning she knew for sure she could not go on like this for long it was killing her she leaned forward to whisper come with me luckily the boys were busy talking beside her and the sound passed unnoticed ginny eyebrows shot up behind her bangs and she instantly dropped her toast and stood after hermione harry and ron stopped talking and watched as hermione and ginny left the hall together breakfasts left half eaten they shared the confused look they usually did and resumed conversation not thinking much of it ginny trotted after hermione as she strode quickly out of the hall getting paler if possible hermione turned sharply right and headed out the grand entrance ginny skipped along beside her getting the secret telling vibe radiating from her ginny stopped quickly when hermione did she looked around there was no one outside within hearing range ginny hermione started seriously looking her straight in the eye i didntquite tell you everything on saturday she took a deep sigh but it was not a tired sigh more like an excited one if that were in some way possible what do you mean asked a perplexed ginny wondering what else there could be i have this sort of plan ooh she gasped excitedly tell me hermione looked around once more to make sure that there was nobody before lowering her voice as if afraid of hearing it herself ok oh my gaped ginny you re really gonna do that hermione nodded surely the image of snape striding amongst the cauldrons shrouded in his large black robes filled her mind certain i thought maybe it might actually help get him off my mind she said sincerely how would that work asked ginny sarcastically hermione frowned and shook her head not wanting to listen shut up ginny she said with only a little trace of sarcasm ginny was not offended this is exciting bubbled ginny with enthusiasm really really exciting oh i wish i could be there hermione looked shocked hell no ok ok she said resignedly hermione now felt so much better she decided to alter the course of the conversation so she smirked what been happening with you and draco ginny blushed to the roots of her red hair hermione smirk grew the heavy feeling on her heart was lifting slightly oh well he a real sweetheart towards me he offered to take me to hogsmead with him on our last weekend before the summer hermione grinned and what did you say of course she grinned back mischievously then the topic of the summer crept up we ve decided we want to see each other whenever we can i not sure how i ll get away neither is he but he said that he sure we ll manage ginny gave hermione a quizzical look as her features contorted what i really am trying hard to imagine malfoy being all sweet and romantic she said with exasperation but i cantdo it ginny smirked again understanding completely it not much different for me trying to imagine what exactly makes you attracted to him but whatever it is it works for you and it works for me she said with an air of wisdom hermione smiled at her she was very grateful that they now were sharing these secrets it took a lot of weight off of everything and she felt less peculiar she then looked down at her watch oh we re going to be late if we dontgo now hermione said ginny with curiosity by any chance is your last lesson of the day potions hermione blushed and grinned harder this is going to be interesting severus snape was looking more and more fascinating to hermione he was intelligent no doubt about that and she noticed he had a quick whit to match she tried to restrain herself from spending the whole time staring at his deep black eyes that flickered dangerously across the room when he brushed past she felt the butterflies get violent in her stomach the class was taking too long to end but at the same she wished it wouldn t she tried half heartedly to rationalise and convince herself that this was a crazy idea and that this feeling would eventually go away and she would be sickened with herself for thinking such a way but these thoughts faded fast when the lesson drew to an end she had taken up her sample and cleaned out her cauldron she stayed behind on the pretext that she still had to pack up her ink bottle and stuff and the boys should go ahead without her they did so without suspicion severus looked up from behind his desk and rolled his eyes when he saw miss granger had stayed behind he was starting to get used to her butting into his life and wondered what it would be this time nothing however could prepare him he stood up and walked around his desk miss granger he sighed looking at her folding his arms what now hermione slung her bag over her shoulder and started towards him well he sneered once she was close hermione paused looking deeply into his eyes snape could see the thoughts rapidly crossing over hers he wondered what this could be about suddenly before she thought about it too much she leaned forward and kissed him eek finally please review keep in mind more will be revealed in the next chapter love all of u who review snakecharmer chapter 6 party time so far snape acts weirdly in class due to his sister dying hermione finds out and pities him starts to get intrigued by him then eventually ends up getting a crush on him she puts forward an unusual plan that comes in four stages and ultimately ends up in her getting a kiss from snape that he does not remember but hermione still has his book from when she broke into his chambers she could not believe she had accepted the invitation from ginny newts were so close now that she really needed to study more than she was everyone else convinced her she was studying enough as it was but her nights were no longer taken up by reading until early morning she had to take it much slower she did not want to be caught falling asleep by severus again she went down to breakfast and met harry and ron there they had not waited for her that morning but she did not ponder as to why they did not have to always she greeted them with the usual hi and immediately propped a book up against her goblet when she sat down she read as she ate and harry rolled his eyes to ron hermione give it a rest said ron smiling at the typical behaviour you already know what it says next anyways she looked up at him crossly that and we want to talk to you he added at this hermione dropped the angry look deeming the excuse a valid enough one to put down her book she closed it and put it back in her bag leaning over the bench her hair shrouded her eyesight for a moment and when she flicked it back the first thing she saw was snape talking to mcgonagall she quickly looked away what is it she said munching on her toast and giving them both her full attention ginny told us you re going to the party this saturday said harry excitedly i think it will really be good for you you are working awful hard added ron his freckled nose twitched as he bit into a piece of fruit you definitely could use a break like that finished harry hermione was not in the least bit anticipating the party and refused to show any signs of enthusiasm she just picked up her goblet to drink and murmured a small uh huh before gulping down her pumpkin juice she put it down and looked up to see ginny enter the grand hall she pursed her lips to hide her smirk as she noticed that ginny was looking slightly flushed and a moment behind her malfoy came towards the slytherin table looking cheerful ginny ran her fingers through her hair to straighten it and she walked over breezily to them and sat down very close by but started talking to her fellow sixth years after sharing a quick look with hermione that they did not catch a glance over at the slytherin table showed malfoy talking helping himself to food and smiling crabbe and goyle being the two goons they were did fail to register the change in his attitude she found it incredibly difficult to try and ignore them and turn back to harry and ron when is the last hogsmead weekend she said looking at harry ron answered for him two weeks after exams why just wondering i need some new books for the holidays he rolled his eyes at harry and they shared a look harry grinned and shook his head flicking his messy black hair back he looked up at her and held her gaze with his green eyes what are you planning to do after the end of this month she saw his implied importance but did not understand what do you mean are you going to live with your parents still or are you going to find a place of your own what are you planning on doing when we leave hogwarts forever he said in a semi quiet tone out of respect for the subject hermione froze the last word hit her in the face and she could finally feel the weight harry had implied she had not considered it she was leaving forever she did not want to leave what was she going to do she suddenly felt at a total loss she looked away from harry down at the bench she sat on she was going to find a job maybe she would have to find her own place it was just what she felt she had to do she would apply to all the top universities of course she felt strangely alone it was going to be her against the world i think i ll find my own place and a job to help pay for the university fees harry could read the look on her face we were wondering ron said they had already planned this if you would like to bunk with us and when she finishes ginny hermione looked up surprised really she said with a lot of hope that she forgot to hide ron grinned at her of course what did you think that we would drop you like a newborn rat the second school finishes it ll be the same forever ron said excitedly after giving hermione a sceptical look she let out a sigh without being aware and she closed her eyes briefly harry shook his head to ron when she could not see and ron spun his finger beside his ear especially so she could see she grinned and pushed him playfully i cantimagine life without you guys saturday came ginny found hermione buried in the library at lunch time she was sitting at a table in the corner surrounded by old hard backed books on shelves all the way to the high ceiling the table was round and light brown with five wooden chairs pulled up around it hermione was leaning her cheek into her palm her fingers held the corner of the page ready to turn the yellowing paper fast she slumped over the book blocking her own light her doe brown eyes flickered rapidly over the words ginny marched forward hermione did not look up nor notice she was even there she planted her hands on her hips and stared at hermione determinedly for a short while but hermione still did not see her standing right in front of her finally ginny came right over to her and grabbed her arm hermione started and snapped out of her trance she looked up and saw ginny trying to drag her away she closed her book and stood tucking it under her arm as she did so she let ginny pull her away not willing to fight it ginny hauled her through the aisles of shelves by the upper arm until they reached the entrance what going on ginny she eventually asked unsuccessfully attempting to get ginny to let go the party starts in six hours she snapped hermione frowned as she was forced to follow her so ginny stopped she turned and faced hermione looking genuinely surprised so so we have little over six hours to prepare if i could have found you sooner it would be more all of a sudden ginny started dragging her along again hermione smiled and rolled her eyes at the same time she sighed as loudly as she could deliberately so she could hear hermione did not want to spend six hours preparing when she could be reading ginny you shouldntget so worked up it just a stupid party and everybody knows what we look like without makeup and spells anyway so explain to me the point of six wasted hours because at a party one should look one best it like an unspoken rule exciting things are meant to happen and when they do everybody wants to look as good as they can hermione rolled her eyes again whatever ginny she concluded the only way to make the pain lessen would be to let ginny do whatever she pleased to hermione that way she could get a few hours rest hermione felt like a display doll it was not natural to have on as much makeup as she did now but she really had to admit ginny had done a fantastic job she felt very fake but looked good her hair had been tied in a high curly ponytail with multiple strands hanging loose in picture perfect poses and her face made up with the amount of paint a model uses on a photo shoot she sighed for the thousandth time that hour at last the party was starting she had been waiting ages in the clutches of a feverish ginny for the thing to start so it could be over and done with ginny had forced her into a dress she had found hidden in the dusty parts of her closet she could not remember the last time she had worn it it was a long flowing crystal peach dress that showed very little skin except for a tastefully placed diamond shaped cut to the right of her bellybutton it was off shoulder and ginny had dug up from her own wardrobe the perfect necklace to match it was a long silver snake chain joined together by a silver rose clasp ginny stood back to admire her work on hermione then turned to a mirror she smoothed down some hair she had straightened hers and was wearing a dark blue dress with dark blue gloves and it suited her eyes well shall we go then she said leaving the mirror hermione nodded gratefully i feel way too dressy if everybody else is wearing jeans i will see to it you shall not wake to see the sun shine tomorrow she threatened ginny just grinned they left the dorm treaded carefully down the spiral stone steps and got a few looks as they left via the common room the portrait of the fat lady swung closed behind them and ginny turned on her and placed a disillusionment charm on hermione before on herself this party has not been approved by the teachers she explained it would be better if they did not see us dressed like this hermione sighed harder than before it was not only a waste of her time it was now an unapproved waste of time i suppose the reason you re so hyped up is because draco malfoy will be there ginny nodded happily are you planning on going public tonight then there was a pause then ginny shook her head hermione felt bad for her but just as bad for herself at the same time she had pushed snape out of her mind all day and she had a very close shave at that moment because she almost lapsed into a state of self pity she let that particular area lay to rest for the moment where are we going she asked ginny replied with a slight melancholy that hermione only just noticed the room of requirements wise choice she nodded she wondered if ginny had wanted to make it public but malfoy had stopped her or it might have been the other way round it may even have been that they both wanted to reveal their relationship but circumstances would not allow but at least she had a relationship they walked in silence careful to stick to the darkest areas of the corridors and dodge teachers they finally reached the door opposite the tapestry hermione tapped gently on it three times she opened it and found that to her relief everyone else had dressed in their best all the guys were wearing their dress robes and all the girls wearing whatever fancy dress or outfit they chose they were not out of place she pushed it further open and let ginny go in before her before closing it behind her ginny pointed her wand at hermione then herself lifting the charms she spied harry and ron over in the corner of the large room the edges were strewn with bean bags for those who did not want to stand there was a bar selling butterbeer and cold drinks in the corner seamus finnegan was running it the lights were not too bright to make it an uncomfortable setting and hermione felt less prone to hate this party just yet they smiled up at her when they saw her too they dropped their conversation when she joined harry gave her a fleeting glance you look really great tonight he said as convincingly as he could with his eyes on another part of the room really great agreed ron sincerely he nodded and his orange hair fell into his eyes he brushed it away thank you she adjusted ginny necklace i really wish i could be reading however harry frowned disapprovingly and ron tut tutted she noticed harry had not taken his eyes off of one particular person in the room to her left she was about to turn and see who when ron totally surprised her with what he said next somebody here has been especially looking forward to your joining this do he said mysteriously he looked at her hard huh she frowned what does that mean ron raised his eyebrows and shrugged pretending to know nothing of what he had just said time to mingle he beamed and with that he slipped away from them and lost himself in the gathering crowd in the dim light definitely muttered harry heading in the direction he had been staring before hermione gave him a questioning expression which he ignored or did not see and with that she was left alone in the crowd she looked around to find ginny and was not surprised to see she could not be found and neither could malfoy maybe she should get a drink first she definitely felt like a butterbeer she wove amongst the crowds of people until she got to the bar in the corner she picked a stool and pushed herself up onto it she leaned on the tabletop and looked over at seamus hey seamus she smiled trying to be friendly can i get a butterbeer he stopped stacking glasses on the shelf behind him and faced her with an equally friendly smile hello hermione of course you can he whipped a butterbeer out from under the desk he took off the metal cap suddenly he threw the uncorked bottle up behind his back it span so fast in the air that nothing fell out as it started to fall he caught it upside down right over hermione glass so that the liquid went straight in not a drop was spilled hermione was awed wow was all she could say how did you learn to do that she looked at him with big eyes he grinned as he put the half empty bottle beside her glass for her to top off whenever she wanted to oh practice makes perfect he shrugged but kept grinning at the compliment she smiled back and picked up her glass she drank a good amount of it and started to top off the glass when he spoke again did you come here with anyone he asked one eyebrow raised hermione shook her head slowly not if you dontcount ginny she said and took another swig he nodded to himself he was holding his wand up to control the drying of the glasses in the sink next to him that was alive with bubbles and moving brushes and tea towels there was an occasional spatter of soapy water that went flying dontyou just love this room said seamus with an air of wonder whatever you want it to be hermione nodded drank again then started to stand she slid herself off the stool and finished her drink she passed the empty glass back to him i should probably go and mingle she excused herself she smiled at him and he smiled back cheerfully she left the bar and burrowed into the crowd to find a conversation to join there were people she never talked to standing around chatting and she saw lavender and pavarti talking with a group of friends of ginny s she considered hearing what they had to talk about she was almost there when harry approached her out of nowhere startling her he looked less happy than usual have you any idea of where ginny went he asked looking around the room his black hair was still messy but there was a noticeable difference tonight an obvious attempt to flatten it no why hermione lied she looked around the room with a strong suspicion of who she was with maybe not where i cantfind her anywhere he said still not looking at her too busy with looking around a thought dawned on hermione and this time she was careful to hide her facial expressions harry had been acting funny recently and while she had been totally self absorbed she had overlooked it until now his happiness was damaged by the fact ginny was nowhere to be found so did that mean he liked ginny it made prefect sense it filled in all the blanks oh but this was not good this was not good at all ginny was dating draco malfoy need more be said harry was going to get his heart broken and be humiliated and angry when he found out and from his behaviour he may well find out soon she did not want to be in the same room at the time he did discover who ginny was with she gave him a pitying look never mind she probably fixing herself up maybe she decided the makeup was all wrong for her dress she tried to throw any suspicions he might have off for a while that might buy them some time she turned and left harry standing there she had the intention of joining lavender discussion but was interrupted once again this time by seamus hermione may i talk to you he said he looked up at her seriously with light brown sharp eyes his long ish hair fell over his face lightly he had asked sweetly and politely hermione had not really ever heard him speak like that before she nodded carefully she wondered why he was not taking care of the bar she looked over his shoulder and saw ron had taken over the duties seamus reached for her wrist and gently pulled her to the corner of the room severus marched out of his chambers in a flurry of black material the wall closed up behind him hiding his rooms from view he stopped for second the dimly lit cold corridor that sloped upwards was cold and narrow the grey stone slabs made the walls floor and ceiling like a tomb he looked around then continued up towards the light of the entrance hall tonight was patrol night he walked determinedly his long black hair shrouding his face sinisterly his black eyes narrowed when he noticed a disturbance in the air passing by him he stopped and watched as the shadows of two people passed him and up the steps of the entrance hall he immediately recognised the disillusionment charm and pretended to ignore them until they were a fair distance away then he abruptly changed direction and followed closely behind they did not notice the black shadow trailing them he wondered where they might be going if there was a gathering or party of some sort he would have to break it up such a shame he thought sarcastically he followed them for three floors or so until they finally stopped in front of a door that severus did not recognise they knocked three times and the door creaked open let them in then closed severus stepped forward he examined the door it had not been there the seventeen years he had been teaching he checked the surroundings the door was opposite a tapestry of some historical crazy figure he took note of it for another time with a sharp look at the door he pondered whether to get the other heads of houses to help him and decided against it with a slight smirk he approached the door and put his hand on the handle hermione frowned to herself when seamus brought her to the corner of the room there were two bean bags there a red and blue with silver embroidery of stars and moons she naturally assumed they would sit on them but he chose not to what is it she asked politely not trying to sound too aggressive she did not expect the reply she got in the slightest seamus swiftly leaned forward and planted his lips on hers she had no time to think she did not want the kiss and with a sinking feeling in her stomach she realized this is what snape must have felt the same way too she felt herself stiffen in the same way he had but she had to admit seamus was a good kisser and he was very sweet gentle and probably completely unaware of her discomfort she did not have time to push him off she was just starting to come to her senses when the door burst open she could not turn and see who it was because of the way she was being held she had an inkling that whoever it was was not here to enjoy the party judging by their entrance she shoved seamus off of her harshly and he jumped back surprise written in his eyes she then turned to see who had just come in when she did she found herself face to face with severus snape he just stood there tall dark and towering in the doorway he was also looking straight into her eyes for a split moment she was captured by the deepness of his stare she saw him tear his eyes away from her to the rest of the people in the room the sinking in her stomach worsened seamus next to her looked horrified as the rest of the people in the room did but hermione just looked guilty there was a heavy silence as people waited with baited breath for what snape was about to say he decided to draw out the silence making the mood worse deliberately by looking at the face of each person in turn hermione glanced sharply at seamus next to her he caught her gaze he obviously could not tell she had not desired a kiss from him at all and that she did not feel the same about him whatsoever she realized that he must have assumed that she had pushed him off only because snape had come in she held in a sigh things had to be sorted out finally the silence cracked with the soft stinging voice of snape well well what have we here he smirked evilly the room tensed further my guess is it a party tsk tsk he shook his head since there are so many of you that would mean too much for me to handle alone and there are too many for detention so everyone held their breath since i am in such a sporting mood i will give you all to the count of fifty to return to your common rooms then i shall come after the stragglers so i suggest you start moving he neednthave added the last phrase people had already started scrabbling for the door past him seamus had left too hermione chose to wait till the crowd was gone she did not want to get caught in a crush one he began with a small smirk at the bustling crowd two three the room was now almost empty hermione finally stepped forward and joined the last few people heading out as she passed him she did not need to look up to feel his icy stare on her she tried to ignore it she was not feeling so good a rising wave of wanting to throw up took all of her mind to suppress she gave him a quick glance as she passed but almost got lost in his eyes she shook it off now was not the time the second she was out of the door she did not follow the other gryffindors back to the tower she did not want to go back just yet she wanted to be alone she wanted to sit outside if she was caught she was caught she was willing to risk it she checked the hall to see if there were any other teachers then ambled away sleepily severus stood alone in the abandoned room he had stopped counting at six he had not the smallest intention of going after the students anymore he knew they would all get back to their common rooms even if he did not hunt them out he had definitely not expected nor desired to see what he had when he had first entered the room miss granger had been in a lip lock with finnegan it had been a funny experience because he felt the itch on his brain return he dismissed it immediately but had been unable to take his eyes off the scene for a tantalisingly long moment until she pushed him off and turned to face him when he looked at her he had seen something unreadable in her eyes it was not guilt and it wasntsadness and certainly not fear he had thought if she had to choose one of her peers it would have been someone better than him he thought she was way above him still he did not understand why he cared so much but there was an image burned into the back of his retina of the two of them and a small slice of anger became evident he gave a cross fleeting look at the room and swirled round he marched out and slammed the door shut behind him careful not to close it on his dragging robes he still had to patrol and maybe that would take his mind off of things without thinking he headed moodily for the nearest steps down he felt pissed off to unimaginable dimensions but was further frustrated by the fact he could not understand why he could not shoulder the feeling it simply would not go away he walked down to the ground floor he was too absorbed in his thoughts to notice he was walking out through the enormous front doors that were permanently open the cool night air blasted him in the face and somewhere inside he knew he was on the school grounds but his conscious mind had not acknowledged it just yet he slowed his walk down as he thought but he wasntreally thinking anything in his attempt to push the thoughts out of his mind it was more of a trance he blinked slowly with a new form of exhaustion he was not familiar with he suddenly stopped as his trance dissipated he realized where he was then looked all around him the sky was speckled black with white and silver stars and the large pale moon swallowed some of the darkness to his right the lake was glimmering it was a pale blue with rippling bright lights the forest even looked elegant and bathed in the light of the moon he shook his head and started back for the castle when something made him stop he peered into the shadows of the sides of the castle steps there was a person dressed in a pale colour dress sitting there a girl she was sitting on a small square rug she had her knees brought to her chest and her arms lay folded on top her chin rested on her arms and her curled hair was let loose cloaking her shoulders and neck he realized it was miss granger without even looking at her face because she had been wearing that very same dress upstairs not ten minutes earlier when he did look at her face he saw there was a determined frown set upon her features he walked over to stand right in front of her gaze maybe to startle her out of her thought but when he was standing directly in front of her she looked right through him her eyes did not move nor even blink as he began to approach her miss granger he snapped just to let you know summer is coming come first of july i will have no access to the internet for two months unless by some stroke of luck i find an internet caf o and i decided to change it from a simple love story it was starting to bore me and when i get bored i tend to drop stories and i promised this would not happen it is at one point going to suddenly change tone no telling when but for now its still simple and also i upload as i finish the next chapter so before i leave for beirut i may well give u guys a double chapter just to keep u busy thank you everyone and i know i ve kind of been nagging about reviews they just boost my confidence thats all u dont have to luv snakecharmer chapter 7 finally so far snape acts weirdly in class due to his sister dying hermione finds out and pities him starts to get intrigued by him then eventually ends up getting a crush on him she puts forward an unusual plan that comes in four stages and ultimately ends up in her getting a kiss from snape that he does not remember but hermione still has his book from when she broke into his chambers one horrible party later seamus kisses her and she goes outside to think getting caught by severus miss granger he snapped with a little more malice than was needed she started so hard that she visibly jumped she focused her stare and noticed him standing a few feet away from herself she gulped he gave her a disapproving look and stretched a hand her way for her to take she looked up at him from beneath her eyebrows with big eyes then hesitantly took his hand and stood up she suppressed a shiver at the touch of his hand he let go once she was up and she did too reluctantly walk with me he said darkly and hermione did not consider this a good sign he smoothly walked towards the stairs and hermione followed alongside they were just entering the grand entrance when he next spoke do you wish strongly for a punishment i gave you a fair chance to avoid one she ignored the bite in his voice i sorry she lied i really just did not feel like going back up to the common room at the moment she looked at her feet and snape looked at her openly his black gaze was unreturned this would not have anything to do with a certain mr finnegan would it he sneered hermione was surprised she looked up and caught his stare there was a quiet silence as they walked for a few seconds before hermione forced herself to answer it may she replied honestly he nodded coldly she bit her lip nervously why she dared to ask he ignored the question you could have done better he said before unconsciously speeding up hermione had to quicken her pace too she frowned excuse me i take that back he said sincerely it is none of my business she frowned harder what was that supposed to mean i dontmind hermione felt relieved to have the ability to explain what had happened to her i really did not expect him to kiss me it wasntmutual severus brows shot up i going to have to clarify to him later exactly where i stand and where is that he asked curiously i have absolutely no feelings in return for him she said firmly severus suddenly felt how unprofessional he was being the word feelings had snapped him back to his sense of boundaries and yet he felt relieved in a way he could not comprehend why did you choose to sit outside he inquired steering the conversation away from feelings but prolonging it so that it may seem to her that he would forget to punish her and in that particular spot i not quite sure i wanted fresh air and i wanted to be in a dark corner where i would not be found he suddenly felt that they shared something other than thought patterns he remembered that sensation all too clearly it still lingered if you do not mind sacrificing fresh air then the dungeons would have been the best haven he stopped himself too late he wished he could take back what he had said there was no doubt that she would make the connections he glanced at her and when he saw her eyes widen only in the slightest he took a deep breath are you feeling any better these days she asked it lightly but he knew what she meant he frowned now that she mentioned it he was reminded of stella he had pushed the thought away i was until now he sneered hermione looked confused then she looked worried oh i sorry she said earnestly he frowned directly at her and saw she was kicking herself inside he abandoned his annoyance just to make her feel better dontworry about it he said offhandedly he waved a hand vaguely and hermione sighed relaxing he was disturbed by the fact that he now was comforted by her feeling better am i in trouble she asked hoping to see how far she could push her good luck he raised a corner of his mouth slightly she definitely had nerve he avoided looking at her preferring to keep his eyes dead ahead do you want to be because it may have just slipped my mind she could read the truth behind what he said he was going to let her off the hook i suggest you get back up to bed now immediately he stopped half way along the first floor corridor and turned to face her she stayed back too she looked up at him for a long moment before smiling he glared in reply trying to get her to stop it had been a mistake to talk to her she was now smiling at him good night sir she said thankfully with a cheerful bounce to it he had never really noticed in her voice when talking directly to him before he nodded briskly back and stayed still as she left he watched her leave her curls shrouded the back of her crystal peach dress and the skin of her shoulders he turned his head and looked away as she disappeared around a corner he did not lift his dark haired head at first for fear of accepting that there was something other than a teacher student feeling for miss granger it was not too strong so it may not be too late to squash that thought soothed some of his frustration at himself he sniffed and lifted his head again proudly and strode off back to the dungeons hermione did not see him until the next lesson on monday she had the whole sunday to read the magic of the ancients around five o clock that day she finished it closing the last page with satisfaction it was a very informative book it also enlightened her more on the nature of harry scar she dropped by ginny dorm a few minutes after finishing it and they talked for while they discussed the party the fact seamus had kissed her snape behaviour afterwards and what she should do with the book now she had completed it hermione left feeling happier than she had in weeks things were looking up there was one black spot on her good mood however that had to be removed as quickly as possible that black spot was seamus finnegan she left ginny dorm and skipped down the steps to the common room she hoped she would find him there she needed to explain things to him and get him out of the picture as soon as humanly possible she reached the last step and paused before she walked down it she looked around the room quickly sure enough under the streaming light of the common room window sat seamus and dean thomas talking together over a table filled with strewn books and parchment she paused once more checking to make sure she was not being watched the last thing she wanted was to cause a scene when she was sure nobody was indeed looking her way she sucked in her breath and brusquely walked over to his table seamus looked up and smiled at her completely ignorant of the emotions radiating off of her that was the total opposite of severus she noted he would have been able to pick up on the slightest change in mood hello mione he smirked hermione eyebrow twitched and she resisted the urge to glare at him seamus may i speak with you privately she said stiffly he cast a vexed look to dean then stood he was starting to slowly pick up on her hostility he cautiously walked towards her she turned and headed for the portrait hole he continued to follow closely nervously she did not exit through the portrait however she chose the corner of the room seamus came up to her nobody was near enough to hear if they kept their voices low with the exception of extendable ears yes he said unsurely hermione finally unleashed her icy stare why did you kiss me at the party without my consent she snapped he shrank a little his flimsy light brown hair brushed his cheeks and partly covered his eyes i was hoping you felt the same he said lamely she glared harder you did not even bother to find out if i felt the same she growled there is no way seamus that i would feel the same so you may as well drop it he looked disappointed let just forget this ever happened she finished and lifted her head sharply before spinning around and joining harry and ron at the nearest table harry looked up from his book and greeted her warmly then he looked past her and seamus standing numbly in the corner of the room what was that he said sending a questioning look at ron as well hermione looked at ron and saw that he was blushing guiltily ron she started carefully you wouldnthappen to know anything about this would you she said sweetly with a twist of bitterness erm he looked up at her with puppy eyes i thought that there would not be a problem on your part of him making a move he was slowly sinking deeper into his chair but obviously there was he said with a small voice hermione was not angry at him after all how was he supposed to know about her obsession about about another man it over and done with now she said shrugging and ron sat up with a huge sigh wait said harry utterly lost seamus made a move on hermione what did he do when he looked between the both of them at the party seamus kissed me when i was totally unprepared and then snape walked in she said bitterly what relevance does snape have asked ron blowing some orange hair out of his eyes hermione was forced to make a quick save that supplies an answer as to when does it not ron nodded seeing her point harry attention though was drawn away from his friends as a person entered the room from the girls tower hermione glimpsed in the direction harry now stared and saw ginny coming down the stairs she was wearing a pretty skirt and t shirt that went well together and her hair was done up in a high bun with a straight curtain of dark red hair falling from underneath it hermione pursed her lips to keep herself from smirking all her new looks had started cropping up ever since the first kiss from draco she saw that the conversation was as good as finished and went over to ginny she smiled at her and as she passed her up the steps of the tower she muttered nice outfit and ginny smiled back gratefully to her ginny took hermione place with the boys and hermione took this opportunity to see if it was possible to return the book today she did not have access to an invisibility cloak and she needed it way more than last time she raced up the stairs to her room she shoved open her door and grabbed her book from her bed she ran back down and when she left the common room under the questioning looks from harry ginny and ron she excused herself saying she needed some air she watched the portrait close behind her as she sped away down the stairs she did not have the time to be nervous she had to think she would wait until snape left the classroom before she would go in obviously she should wait in the darkest areas of the hall outside with the help of the disillusionment charm she was half way down to the dungeons when she ran into an unexpected surprise malfoy approached her on the second floor she kept walking at first but he headed straight for her showing no signs of passing her by she quickly hid her book in the huge inner pocket her robes she stopped when he came to stand right in front of her what do you want malfoy she said carefully he may be a sweetie to ginny but she had no idea what his attitude was towards her anymore she straightened her robes trying to hide any showing bulk of the book i was hoping to talk to you sometime and now that i ve found you earlier i might as well get this over with he said bluntly hermione denied the fact that she admired his honesty she blinked he gestured in the direction he had originally been walking shall we hermione did not want to put off returning the book but found herself forced to she nodded and walked alongside draco in the direction opposite that of the dungeons this is about ginny i presume she said wisely he nodded his silver blonde head so you are aware he stated the obvious and she rose an eyebrow when she saw him visibly un tense his new relaxed self was something hermione had never witnessed does anyone else know there was some urgency in his voice not that i know of she frowned she brushed some curls back off of her shoulder not harry and ron if that what you mean he sighed but she continued in a tone that made him snap to harry has an obvious and probably serious crush on ginny well he canthave her he spat starting to get prickly and defensive they headed up some moving stairs i know she snapped back i just warning you because when he does find out it may be worse than you have anticipated malfoy silver eyes gleamed and from the way he been acting he may make a few moves before the year is out and you may have to deal with the relationship being revealed a little sooner than planned thank you for the warning he sneered ungratefully but i trust ginny will not reveal a thing until she has discussed it with me she would not do something like that he said firmly and surely hermione was struck by the caring in his voice he obviously felt strongly for her and he was utterly convinced she felt the same way fortunately this was true is there anything else she said checking her watch malfoy seemed irritated by the fact he was merely a distraction and straightened his back and cocked his chin nothing pressing he said sharply in that case i should go she said racing back down the stairs before they changed again goodbye she called from the bottom of them he nodded back frostily she was behind schedule she had a time limit for the amount of time she could spend waiting for snape to leave his classroom before appearing suspicious to harry and ron she had wasted a good many valuable minutes with malfoy she was soon out of his sight and on her way back down to the dungeons as she had been before she stood at the beginning of the dungeons hallway that sloped dangerously down in front of her she slipped a hand into her pocket pulling out her wand never taking her eyes off of the emptiness ahead of her she muttered the charm pointing the wand at the top of her head in a moment she was nothing more than a disturbance in the air she slipped into the darkest shadows where the torches were weakest and very carefully tip toed over to the edge of the potions classroom she stood around the corner leaning against the wall listening she heard nothing she dared to peak around the door frame and she could not spy snape anywhere she relaxed her tense posture keeping her wits about her she crept forward into the classroom the empty desks stayed silent and the feeling of being alone in this room started her nervousness she approached the storeroom door and hesitated for a long moment before she bit her lip and pointed her wand at the lock snape however was just coming back down the corridor having forgotten his note taking quill on his desk he swept silently down the hall and cast a smooth black shadow on the wall that glided alongside him flickering in the torchlight hermione was unaware of this she had just stepped into the large storeroom she paused to take off the disillusionment charm not seeing any use in it now she had got past the classroom she found herself once again in awe of the shelves of aromatic potions ingredients of the rarest and most powerful kind the light in the storeroom was terrible she could barely see the end of the room she paused for half a minute feeling that she could afford it she read the names of several particularly interesting items then got her thoughts back on track with a small gulp she took a tiny step forward severus halted abruptly half way to his desk something odd just caught his eye he raised a brow and turned the storeroom door was wide open he was certain he had not left it that way he took a few calm steps closer and blinked when he saw something move inside he came to stand in the doorway he was further surprised to see the brown curls of the back of a head that he recognised all too well he slowly and very quietly walked over to her and stood right behind her but did not say anything waiting to see when she would notice him he just remained a towering black presence blocking the light from behind her despite his cast shadow she remained blissfully unaware of the intent and powerful gaze upon her he became increasingly aware of a sweet smell radiating off of her soft curls he breathed in deeply and he recognised it with a frown she was about to start walk towards the black door at the back of the room he grabbed her shoulder sharply so fast that she had not taken more than the small step forward she whirled around even faster in nervous surprise she felt her stomach drop to the floor when she was faced with a pillar of ebony robes the grip in her shoulder was firm and she felt it stinging under his tight hold she slowly and anxiously dragged her eyes up to meet his she had expected him to be furious with her and to start yelling but as she stared at him with big doe eyes she could not find any hostility he was not thinking straight he just studied her face the curve of her jaw the shape of her lips the color of her eyes she watched his eyes flicker over her anticipating him to still explode at her the hand on her shoulder loosened and she felt the pain leave but he did not take his hand away she did not know what was happening but she felt her own emotions being pulled out of the corner of her mind she was blinded by them and unwillingly took a small step closer to him they were inches apart and hermione just wanted to lean closer still and snuggle against him like a kitten she resisted the urge with all her might and gently closed her eyes severus did not remember ever feeling this way he could not control his actions he could feel the heat of her skin from his hand on her shoulder he saw her close her eyes softly and he could not stop himself from smoothly sliding the hand up to her neck she sighed quietly he wished she would open her eyes so he could see them again and she did she studied the face in a similar way to him just now his shoulder length black hair highlighted the shape of his cheeks and added emphasis to his captivating eyes the hand on her neck made her shiver it was a soft touch his gaze caught hers and for a long time the silence between them spoke volumes she wanted to kiss him and tried to show him so with the way she looked at him he seemed to be hesitating struggling with his morals and boundaries she lightly placed her hand on his other arm and he glanced at it quickly before looking back into her eyes with a look of confusion she blinked slowly unable to hold himself back longer he raised his other hand cupped her jaw with both hands she sighed again and he leaned closer to her face then paused their lips barely a centimeter apart he could feel her warm breath against the skin of his face and he closed his own eyes before pressing his lips against hers and in the dark light of the storage room they shared a soft passionate kiss sorry for the small chapter you forgive me dontyou of course you do mush and fluff for everyone tons of fun to write mr mcghan if you are reading this then you have no respect for

chapter 9 draco harry and ginny o so far sighs ill keep it as short as possible stella snape sister of severus snape dies this causes a change in behaviour from snape which arouses hermione curiosity which leads to her gaining a small crush on him she stupidly or blindly breaks into snape chambers as part two of a four stage plan to steal a kiss from him she takes a book without thinking hermione is dragged to a party kissed by seamus and severus walks in just in time to see it he finds himself irked by what he sees he catches hermione outside still after curfew and they talk he lets her off the hook and she goes back to bed hermione finishes her book and goes to return it running into malfoy on the way once in the storeroom severus catches her and impulsively kisses her you have to reread it he cannot believe what he did and they talk in his chambers after hermione goes back to tell ginny later that day she on her way to the library when she is grabbed by the hand of an unknown person o note from now on in my summaries i will only put events from the last chapter i now going to depend on your memories to not forget the rest o hermione had been on her way down the library slowly she had not been feeling as full of energy as she had this morning and she was approaching the dim light of the library entrance when she had been startled by a rough grip on her upper arm she was spun around so quickly she did not have time to think the burn on her arm panicked her she could feel the aggressiveness she gasped she was brought to look straight into the eyes of the person who had caught her forcefully for a moment the fear lingered as she was caught by such a dangerous stare but when she recognised the intimidating features of severus snape she visibly relaxed in his hold she did not take her eyes off of his she did not blink and neither did he although she was no longer scared she felt strangely nervous and excited at the same time she anticipated his next move he was so unpredictable there was a moment where time stopped and both of them were frozen as they looked at each other the posture of snape was threatening as he looked down at hermione staring up with big eyes in his grasp she gasped as he abruptly turned and pulled her roughly into the empty classroom next to them she almost tripped as she tried to keep up to speed he slammed the door shut once she was in and locked it with a satisfying click now they were alone she shivered to think she was trapped with him despite herself he let go of her arm and she took a step closer she thought so many things so quickly that she could not really focus on what was on her mind she kept her sharp eyes on him tall and dark with his black robes to match the rabid butterflies in her stomach fluttered once she had stepped closer he took a deep breath and looked at her intently she was looking up at him with excitement he did not pause to think he just followed his instinct she gasped again as he pinned her against the wall in one fast sweeping motion she smiled a little the feeling of being safe but totally unsafe at the same time caused an explosion of good feelings inside her like two opposite potions mixed together his body was pressing against her crushing her slightly but it felt wonderful she had been close to him before but now she could feel his warmth more than ever before and she felt her heart stop she was shadowed by his thick robes though the room was already dark so she could hardly see him she loved being powerless like this she just let herself be led unlike the two times before where it had either been controlled by her or no one he put his face close to hers he could feel her chest heave with each breath she took he could even feel the speed of her heart from their closeness she found herself holding her breath as she waited for him to kiss her she wanted to be kissed and the time it was taking only made that wish grow she all of a sudden stopped feeling anything for a moment when their lips met the raging and boiling liquid hot sensations inside her just dissipated his kiss was the cure for her constant dissatisfaction the soft touch of his skin made tiny cool flames beneath her skin flare in delight and the feeling of drowning in her own comfort seemed too real to not be so now this was better than anything she had ever implied when she had talked or even thought of spontaneity o hermione rushed to make her arithmacy class she wondered if she had ever in her entire life felt so wonderful she guessed not she sighed as she waited outside the door to go in there was a ridiculously smug grin plastered in her face throughout the lesson o professor mcgonagall strutted stiffly up and down in front of her desk as she looked over her glasses at the class as they read over their notes she appeared to be nervous for them that did nothing to lighten the stressful mood of the exams if their teacher worried for them then it was time to panic hermione on the other hand did not feel that anything could make her heart race the way severus had when he had kissed her earlier she sighed again for fifth time the lesson had only just begun she let the small smile escape her when she realized that she had been smirking for a full five minutes in oblivion for no apparent reason she stopped she looked back at her book quickly before anyone could notice she frowned as she stared at the jumble of words spread randomly on the pages in front of her why had harry and ron not seen and inquired as to her constant smile she dared to look up again and turned to them on her right she was surprised to find them muttering furiously together behind an especially large textbook that they held up in front of their faces she now understood why they had not seen her they had been too absorbed in some discussion that appeared to have a great significance she frowned as she saw harry was glowering sourly and although he kept his voice low she could hear the pure hatred and resentment in it she could not see ron face but his voice sounded bewildered and disgusted she checked to see that mcgonagall was not looking before she leaned over to join the discussion what going on she whispered harry and ron stopped their talking abruptly and both turned to look at her the concentrated looks on their faces dropped and they looked at each other blankly and then at her harry then furrowed his black brows and his green eyes almost flared orange in the firelight he leaned across ron so she could hear a look of strong distaste poisoned his features ginny he started viciously is dating a slytherin he spat and not just any slytherin but malfoy he continued his voice slowly climbed and the last word was heard by the whole class hermione gasped and ron nodded looking very green hermione had not gasped from the news but how the hell did they find out mr potter snapped professor mcgonagall do you mind explaining what exactly it is that has caused you to disrupt other studying she was not angry at him and hermione could tell she was just agitated harry frowned slightly not daring to glare he opened his mouth to speak back rudely he could not be held accountable for his actions she concluded he was fuelled by rage ron put a hand on his arm and shook his head to prevent him from telling the class harry decided to close his mouth and he looked up darkly at the professor i sorry he mumbled she nodded briskly and continued her pacing harry could understand that ron did not want the school to know his sister was dating a malfoy i dontbelieve it ron muttered in a barely audible voice that reeked of his disbelief he was getting progressively greener and greener harry was panting hermione was just sitting there with wide eyes how did you find out about this she gaped this could not be good this was so incredibly bad ron shook his head implying that harry was the one more up to replying neville saw them kissing behind on of the greenhouses and ran off to find us he was in shock he was losing the control of his facial expressions and his face contorted into a sneer hermione shuddered at the glint in his venomous green eyes they had always been a soft green before she wondered if ginny was aware of the fact that their secret was out bloody hell ron continued under his breath his freckles now stood out against his very pale skin his pupils were dilated in horror does she know that you know she kept her voice low and her expression as nervous as possible with little difficulty no he spat but tonight he nodded jerkily at her and she knew what he meant tonight tonight things would get ugly poor ginny o ginny came skipping to meet them when they entered the common room before hermione had a chance to warn her she felt her blood run cold in her veins she was so cheerful she grinned at them and her smiled slowly died when she looked at their faces ron looked sick harry looked outraged and hermione looked worried hermione widened her eyes at her to try and hint something but ginny did not get it what wrong she asked seriously with a slightly scared note in her voice harry sneer deepened malfoy he hissed he knew she would understand and she did she gasped and put a hand to her mouth she took a small step back the blood was leaving her face faster than it had ron s or maybe you would prefer if we called him draco said ron numbly with blank repugnance ginny continued to gawk at the both of them she looked around for escape knowing that there was none he a slytherin burst out harry all of a sudden shouting at the top of his voice she flinched hard the whole common room stopped what it was doing and turned to listen in ginny shrank a little under his twisted glare i i she stuttered quietly at a total loss for words she looked up apologetically at ron but he looked away as if he could not look her straight in the eye without seeing draco bloody hell ginny he said softly but the revulsion was plain what were you thinking his voice was climbing too ginny opened and closed her mouth several times but nothing escaped he has made all our lives a misery for as long as we have known him said harry hotly hermione just said nothing knowing she was unable to help ginny in the slightest no matter what she said he malfoy ron suddenly broke into a yell there were collective gasps from the whole room and lavender screeched from the far corner ginny gasped once more and shot a horrified look over her shoulder to the room filled with accusing stares i she looked about ready to faint hermione took a step forward and put an arm around her she suddenly realized that she had to stick up for ginny and couldntfigure out what had possessed her not to until now she had been afraid of what they would think but she knew that she needed a taste of what it would feel like if they ever found out oh i so sorry ginny she whispered helping her stand it did not look like she could support her own weight much longer harry and ron jaws dropped the rest of the room held their breaths all eyes were now on her hermione yelled harry what are you doing the bewilderment and fury of the words stung like wasps ginny looked up at her with wide and grateful blue eyes hermione smiled back she then glared up at harry i comforting ginny she snapped what does it look like there was another gasp from somewhere in the sea of unblinking eyes behind her and ginny ginny closed her eyes as the tears began to well up she kissing the enemy cried ron despite the fact he was talking about his own sister ginny looked up at him with watery eyes and snivelled hermione felt the rage bubbling and rising inside her too she growled loudly and ron suddenly looked less sure of himself does that make her any less human she said her voice an octave higher than usual and much louder harry looked blank she scowled at them both i dontthink she highlighted the word as she raised the level of bitterness in her stare that it is you place to judge her she hissed have you gone stark raving mad hermione harry looked furious mystified and totally insecure at the same time did you forget one tiny detail it malfoy cut in ron for him remember him hermione suddenly the fact that he dating ginny is enough to make you forget the things he done hermione eyes narrowed and her nostrils flared this is not about malfoy she growled yes it i started harry lividly no it is not she shrieked this is about ginny harry just let his mouth hang open and ron waited to hear what she was about to say the fire inside her was melting and eating away at her guts causing pain which only stoked her fury it is her choice to date whoever she pleases and as her friends she practically spat the word in their faces and both of them flinched then you should support her no matter what she does i think it is obvious who ginny can trust the most is it not she voice lowered from a shriek to an angry whisper the whole room was stone quiet harry and ron did not speak the anger was still faint in their eyes but a rising guilt was appearing but ginny rasped ron sadly sounding ill why him leave her alone she said bitterly but in a much calmer tone than before she does not have to answer to you she turned to ginny giving her a pitying look but ginny wanted to answer this one she shook her head softly it ok hermione she said quietly thank you the look in her eyes was so grateful that hermione was so happy she had stood up for her i love draco there were shudders from not the boys alone because when i with him he makes me feel like the only other person in the world he treats me with the deepest respect he loves me for every little thing i do and say and even the things i dontlike about myself he has been catching my eye all year and just being near him sets off the butterflies it was not allowed by you she pointed to them forlornly but it was meant to be i would not be happy with any other man because this is what is meant to be it is just so right to be with him hermione froze as she heard a few of her own feelings being spelled out for her by her friend harry was now looking sicker than ron had the whole time hermione realized that what ginny had failed to remember harry liked ginny and she had just dismissed him saying that she did not belong with any other than draco malfoy she felt a small pinch of pity for him but he had just given ginny hell so in a way he deserved it ginny all of a sudden widened her eyes and she could tell that she had finally remembered but her eyes narrowed a second later in defiance ron was speechless he looked as though it had not been a good enough explanation and was tempted to ask again but he held his tongue harry on the other hand had a look of defeat on his face that is how you feel then he asked quietly ginny let go of hermione finally finding the strength to hold her own she straightened her back and the confidence leaked through the pores of her skin that was thanks to hermione help yes she nodded stiffly harry looked down but he sucked in a breath and puffed up his chest he brushed past her and went towards the boys tower ron followed quickly after him giving ginny one final ill look the second they were gone hermione turned and hugged ginny tightly scowling lividly at the whole gryffindor common room over her shoulder immediately everyone had something to do or somewhere to be and the silence broke down as people pretended to talk about homework exams or texts from various books hermione closed her eyes and sighed letting go of ginny she kept her hands on her shoulders ginny looked at the floor her red hair shadowing her cheeks maybe you should get an early night she muttered softly ginny nodded and turned without looking up hermione was at her side as she trudged up the spiral steps and into her dorm good night good night hermione it had been a wonder how fast hermione good mood popped like a bubble harshly jabbed with a pin but that night she before bed she revisited her memories o severus had never in his entire life felt the way he did now heavens knows at one point he came so close but this was different there was a danger to this feeling it was the forbidden fruit of relationships at moments he felt ashamed and repulsed by what had gone underway because that was the way the world went despite the fact that nothing other than social boundaries held them apart there was going to be uproar if it ever got out he intended to keep it a secret but as a secret it became something he could not have anticipated but it was all still in it beginning stages there was no telling where it would lead she may even drop him the second she leaves school he had no idea because although he knew her well he did not know that sort of stuff about her he wanted to speak with her about it but he did not want to spoil it and he certainly hoped she would not forget him the moment she left school talk with her he would have to hogsmead weekend was coming and he knew where they could slip away to get some privacy but the more he thought the more they lapsed into pictures of her in his mind his imagination was so vivid and real that he could almost see her standing right in front of him she was an incredibly intelligent beautiful woman he decided and he had no idea what made him worthy of her affection o quit it snapped hermione with absolutely no hint of bite in her voice more like irritation harry and ron grinned harder as they dangled honeydukes candy in front of her nose while she was trying to study it was a long gummy worm that wriggled as if it were alive hermione made a swipe at it but they snatched it away before she could get it you really dontwant me to pass my newts do you she sighed she tried once more to continue her sentence but once again the worm was lowered slowly in front of it she pursed her lips to hide a smile she snapped her book shut quickly and caught it between the pages so ron could not take it away it squashed but luckily did not leave a stain on her book she opened the book took out the flattened worm and chewed on it as she continued to read hey what she said with a smile ron raised his eyebrows crookshanks leapt up from the floor onto hermione lap and curled up into a fuzzy ball purring loudly while hermione read you really have studied enough he said in a more serious tone we should do something to relieve stress hermione rolled her eyes she lifted a corner of her mouth in a half smile ron i know this pressure is killing you but exams are next week we will have all the time in the world after the exams to enjoy ourselves but right now study she said shoving a nearby book into his hands he grudgingly accepted it and wrinkled his nose as he opened it to read he knew she was right he knew he should study but he was in desperate need of a break harry just resumed his reading after pausing to watch their conversation they almost never failed to amuse him always sounding like a couple of eighty year olds o she felt the stress mounting slowly she could hardly think that week that led up to the exams she had not seen severus in all that time out of classes but her work had made it so that she could not notice he had not been surprised in the slightest she spent several hours extra working late into the night but she kept his earlier advice in mind that sleep was necessary for best performance during exams and when the exams actually came she had been so surprised in a good way she had found her first to be a piece of cake all the questions had been the simplest she had seen even harry and ron said they thought they did well on their transfiguration test she had been further pleasantly surprised to find that all the other tests to come had been just as easy although when it came to some of them the boys could not agree with her o the final test had been charms and she not wanting to think like too much of a big head had thought she had done pretty well she walked out of the great hall that had been filled with single desks flanked by harry and ron they were looking a little worried but mostly ecstatic that the exams were over they were silent respectfully as they left the hall as were the rest of the seventh years the second everyone was out of the grand entrance and in the warm air of june there was a short and tense pause followed by a huge roar of noise people started screaming and yelling whooping and jumping the other years watched as all the seventh years slytherins included hugged each other and everyone grinning stupidly amongst themselves hermione screamed along with everyone else the relief that the worst was over and now she could start studying for university she hugged everyone in turn careful not to miss a single person yes even the slytherins she was as quick as she could be with crabbe and goyle but when she came to malfoy she squeezed him tight and muttered in his ear treat her well once the bustle had died down and people were dispersing to talk amongst their own groups of friends as usual hermione managed to find her way back to harry and ron in the swarm of students there was a comfortable silence between them as they walked away together down the steps and out onto the green their footsteps in sync for a long while they did not speak just content to stroll together along the grass that led down to the lake and greenhouses there were others walking nearby in the same direction including pavarti and lavender they were gossiping together not bothering to keep their voices low hermione frowned at what she heard they had approached some ravenclaw students of the same age and immediately informed them of their topic of conversation did you know pavarti asked with excitement looking at the puzzled ravenclaws that draco malfoy is dating someone in gryffindor two of them gasped and the other made a choking noise in her throat the looks of pure horror on their faces seemed to satisfy pavarti and not just any gryffindor she said knowingly loving the power of knowing something they did not one of ravenclaws held her breath rather audibly and hermione could see a smirk playing with lavenders lips none other than she paused for effect our dear friend the only female weasley the gasps were harder and louder and hermione pulled a face of disgust and pulled harry and ron away from them she brought them over to their favourite spot under the willow tree on the grass leading to the lake she sat down and waited for them to follow suit and they did the soft green grass was comfortable and harry allowed himself to fall backwards onto it his school robes lying about him in a mess ron on the other hand chose to take off his outer robes in the heat of the day throwing it casually to one side letting it sit in a crumpled pile the sun was shining down and all the boys wanted to do was relax and bask in the relief of knowing the exams were over hermione had other thoughts though can you believe them she spat not looking at either of them they just love spreading the pain and making it stronger they are deriving pleasure from ginny privacy and not once considering how this only makes the situation far worse if it is all the school knows about she will be the center of attention and will suffer greatly she looked about her at ron who was not really paying attention rolling up the white sleeves of his shirt and harry was just lying still with his eyes closed trying to doze in the sunshine she scowled and looked angrily at the lake roughly pressing her chin into her palm to prop up her head the annoyance was obvious hermione dontthink about it now ron finally said finished with rolling his sleeves he shifted so he could lie forward on his stomach and sleep like harry exams just finished she had never really noticed how much the boys had changed but now she saw with his shirt sleeves up that ron was rather toned and realized harry must be too she looked back at the lake and refocused her hate on lavender and pavarti he folded his arms and let his jaw rest on them hermione simply sighed harry did not so much as twitch does malfoy know about this she asked all of a sudden straightening abruptly she could not see ron face so watched harry reaction she saw his brow crease although his eyes stayed closed there was a distinct show of revolt on his part please hermione he said with a groan can we just drop the malfoy subject for now i have no idea if he knows or not i do not feel like confronting him hermione pitied him and did as he asked dropping the subject but continuing the thoughts in her head as she considered telling him about the situation herself she replaced her head on her palm and let her eyes glaze over as she followed the movements of the giant squid on the surface of the enormous lake o by breakfast there was a loud buzz of gossip in the air there had been all week but it had been much slower because lavender and pavarti were studying for exams and not many had enough time to listen to rumours anyway but now there was nothing better to do than hear what exactly was going on when hermione walked down to breakfast beside the two boys she had a look of abhorrence plastered on her face and was all she could do not to wrinkle her nose at the crowds of people lining the halls whispering about none other than the keeper of her biggest secret she glared at anyone who dared to look her straight in the eyes they all sent her questioning looks and continued to mutter they were almost at the great hall when she spied a large group of fifth year slytherins all looking as appalled as she did but not for the same reason as they passed hermione felt the anger rise and tried in to contain herself that gryffindor bimbo gasped one of them does he have no standards hermione growled loudly but thankfully they ignored her harry and ron both put a hand on her upper arms at the same time as a hint that she should try harder to keep her cool she took a deep breath and it did not help her much she allowed herself to be led to a seat at the gryffindor table all three of them automatically took the vacant spots in a tight bunch around ginny the three of them disregarded the stinging glares and poisonous stares directed at them and especially ginny hermione noticed that her fellow sixth years had abandoned her and shuffled further down the bench and were talking furiously amongst themselves all the time watching her ginny was half heartedly prodding her eggs on her plate her head bent and her red hair shrouded her face as if she was attempting to hide behind it and failing her blue eyes were glossy with unshed tears and her back was hunched hermione took the seat nearest her hugging her before she helped herself to food for the longest time they did not speak the boys were sullen and although they stood by ginny they had no idea what they could say to comfort her knowing whatever they attempted would sound awkward and forced ginny was looking more miserable and downhearted with each second that passed and she kept looking up at the doorway hermione eventually looked up at the doorway too while chewing her pancakes then she glanced shortly at the slytherin table where she could not find malfoy he should have been easy to find seeing as the slytherins looked murderous and were talking bitterly amongst themselves when he came in he would probably be ambushed ginny was pale and looked very scared hermione decided to leave her breakfast for now she looked up at head table and was caught unaware by the sharp stare of severus there was a moment where nothing moved and the only people in the room were the two of them before he tore his deathly black eyes off of her and they rested on the riotous slytherins hermione looked back at ginny quite at a loss for words does draco know yet both boys shuddered simultaneously pausing whatever stage of eating they were in she sent a frosty look their way ginny shook her head she slowly lifted her head to look at hermione in the eyes hermione could then see that the tears were starting to spill over the rims of her eyelids and that her bottom lip was quivering slightly she was on the verge of breaking down into a crying fit not yet she snivelled her lip quivered more violently but when he does what if he dumps me she wailed keeping her voice low enough she released the flow of tears and leaned forward to bury her face in hermione shoulder the muttering in the hall grew louder and hermione sent venomous looks around the whole room attempting to quiet them down once again her eyes caught with severus and she noticed that he was not the only teacher watching ginny sobbing in her arms most of them were staring intently interested to know what was going on she dropped her gaze and returned to the quaking ginny she held why would he do that she said softly he truly loves you i saw it in his eyes he protective as well why would he just dump you when he cares about you besides the truth is out all you two have to do now is wait for this to die down and people to accept what is between you and the you will be rid of this extra worry sooner than you planned she patted her back gently to soothe her ginny stopped shaking in grief but refused to lift her head to face the hundreds of eyes on her i dontknow hermione she mumbled into her shoulder what if he didntreally care about me and was just using me what if i was simply too blind to see it hermione shushed her firmly feeling suffocated from all the attention she receiving harry was watching with sad eyes and ron was just watching there was no readable emotion in his characteristics she let go of ginny who reluctantly straightened and grabbed a napkin to dab her watery eyes poor ginny hermione thought to herself sadly it was the risk of sneaking around behind their backs and she shuddered to think what they would do if they found out about her it would be less bad after graduation because she would no longer be a student so therefore less improper however the reactions would still be bad suddenly there was a frightening hush the fell over the hall as if someone had dropped a huge cold blanket over the whole room hermione harry ron and ginny heads snapped up to see what caused the silence and their brows rose when they saw draco standing in the center of the doorway he was frozen and looked around the room at the whole room that was looking right back at him he was getting progressively paler as he spied the faces of the students at his table and their mutinous glares his silver eyes then slid over to the gryffindor table where ginny was looking frightened and had tears drying on her blotchy cheeks she was staring at him too with panic in her eyes his lips parted a little in what must have been his version of a gape there was a long drawn out silence as he looked over at the slytherins again and he knew he could not approach them he looked back at ginny sitting next to hermione he could feel his heart clench in anger at what they had done to her hermione decided to do something that shocked the whole hall she gestured draco to come sit with her ginny ron and harry there a few quiet gasps of surprise draco looked just as shocked as everyone else but the terrified faces of the gryffindors looked a lot more appealing than the deadly looks he was getting shot from his house table harry went a pale green when hermione waved her hand for him to come ron froze and remained very still with a nervous look on his face she realized as draco tentatively started to walk over to them and the people sitting closest to them fled to the farthest ends of the table that she enjoyed interfering and being the different one in uncomfortable situations she was the only one behaving the way she was but she felt like she was doing the right thing it gave her an unusual rush to the head there where more gasps as draco hesitated and actually sat next to ginny ginny looked so incredibly relieved and the rest of the gryffindors were mortified all of their jaws dropped the slytherins looked horrified and sickened too hermione looked up for a third time at severus sitting at the head table he was looking shocked and unable to move she smirked at him but he barely noticed this was the most contact they had had in over a week now she redirected her attention to the looks she was now receiving instead of ginny they were looks of betrayal and revulsion to her surprise they did not faze her she ignored them and she resumed her breakfast in defiance draco sat still before helping himself to food too ginny looked so much happier and even felt up to eating as well harry and ron on the other hand were watching with open mouths at the sight that lay before them they could never have expected this in their entire lives however they chose to close their mouths and eventually continued to eat keeping a watchful eye on draco and preferring to keep silent o hermione sighed the stares she was getting were now starting to irritate her in a way she could not recall it had always been harry who had been the center of attention but now it was her and ginny after her display at breakfast that morning people had felt that she was just as worthy of their evil glances as ginny was since exams were finished they were free to do as they willed with their time and sitting in the common room with all eyes on her was not exactly her idea of fun ginny was upstairs hiding away harry and ron kept giving her unreadable looks but did not articulate their thoughts they had grudgingly been the bigger men that morning and allowed him to sit with them despite all he had done and she had been so proud of them they were entitled to feel a little peculiar she suddenly stood while ron ordered his horse to beat up harry queen in a game of chess harry scratched his head as he looked to find the cause for his loss ron folded his arms in triumph before turning to her where are you going he asked curiously i think i ll sit in the library she mumbled shooting a look at the others in the room ron looked at them briefly too then nodded yea maybe you should he said as he turned back to his game of chess hermione however had not the slightest intention of going to the library she intended to seek out severus instead she wondered what he would think of the situation in comparison to their own she said her goodbyes and they did too she left via the portrait hole and strolled calmly and slowly down the halls there was no rush anymore so she took her time stopping to converse with several paintings on her way she hoped no she relied on severus being in the classroom or his chambers she did not think it would be such a bad thing to get inside his chambers any more the only thing he may not like would be the surprise she kept her steps short and was not startled to see malfoy shuffling about the halls without crabbe and goyle flanking him he looked as though he could not think of a better way to waste his time she stopped to approach him after all there was no rush he glanced up at her cautiously and once he recognised her he let down his bristly guard he even dared to reply to her sympathetic smile with a small lax smirk why are you wandering around here she asked she gestured that they should walk together he grateful for something to take up his time did not hesitate to join her on her way he did not look her in the eye when he replied i cantstay in the slytherin common room any longer he sighed when i not dodging hexes i dodging glares he started to gain back a little malice and he snarled slightly when talking about his housemates i dontknow where to sleep tonight maybe the room of requirements wherever did you find it i had no idea it existed until the party she knew he was changing the subject that doesntmatter she said offhandedly i dontknow what to tell you she said slowly he nodded in acceptance i know i would like to thank you however you have been of great assistance to ginny and i he said nobly and hermione was honoured what you did this morning i could not say any slytherin would have done the same and sadly neither would i but then again i am no gryffindor that is why you belong in that house all i can say is that i would never have thought i would have been talking to you like this or sharing breakfast with potter and weasley ronald weasley he added for her benefit although she did not need it you are going to join us for lunch again and i will not hear a word against it they ll murder you at your table draco nodded where are you going anyway he asked looking slightly nervous as the reached the dungeons corridor not the slytherin common room his cool was replaced a ruffled edginess can you keep a secret she decided he of all people other than ginny would be the only person she could tell she felt a little sick at the thought despite herself he raised an eyebrow curiously do potter and weasley know he asked lowering his voice a touch she looked reluctant but shook her head he raised his other brow i she paused was she really going to tell malfoy yes she was i like professor snape she kept her voice low she could see of all the horrible things he had expected that had not been one of them he froze jerkily and hermione was made to stop and stay with him w what did you say he stuttered in disbelief and we kissed she added in a weird way she enjoyed the horror in his stricken eyes as he took a step back away from her no he shook his head violently his blonde hair swaying your just trying to make me puke you are joking arentyou he looked up at her begging that she would start laughing and tell him he was stupid for believing it in the first place but she shook her head he gagged into his hand and had to pause to lean against the wall he continued to shake his head no that is more than wrong that is simply disgusting he looked like he had been struck with a heavy bat with the words disbelief carved into it he could not bring himself to think such things i wonder if that is what the slytherins are thinking right now she snapped starting to be irritated by his response it had the intended affect on him he remembered what she had done for them and attempted to hide his revolt and failed but he muttered quietly looking at her with his silver eyes it snape a shadow of a sneer played on his lips she raised an eyebrow in amusement that what harry said about you only he replaced severus name with yours she smiled draco glowered at her it had sent shudders of repugnance through his body to hear his first name being said by her in such a tone and your on you way to visit him he refused to say his name in case it might help him come to terms with it yes she said composedly he could not look her in the eye despite her kindness towards him eugh the snarl of distaste escaped i think i ll leave you now he said pushing himself off of the wall shakily and started to hurry off the password is tomato salad if you want to see ginny the entrance is the portrait of the fat lady she called after him he froze and turned on the spot he gave her a perplexed look as he stood far away from her and she simply gave him a sweet smile why would you tell me that she never failed to astonish him she smiled harder and shrugged you want to see ginny dontyou and you have nowhere else to go he gaped at her as she turned to leave before he did wait he called after her she stopped but did not turn i cannot go in there without you they ll think i broke in or something they have to know a gryffindor let me in she realized he was right and sighed this would mean more hostility from her housemates she continued walking once more and called her reply over her shoulder i ll be with you as soon as i can wait for me at the bottom of the steps up to the portrait she did not see what he did next and she focused on finally getting to see the stare of severus that could strip her down to her soul she could not hold back the smirk as she continued to imagine him but images in her head were nothing compared with reality she still felt nervous as she approached the open door of the potions classroom but in an entirely different way to how she had most of her student life she pushed the door open warily it creaked a little on its damaged hinges as she peered around the door into the empty class room lit by torches along the wall she was met with the silky voice she had been expecting close the door behind you he said softly only glancing at her briefly before returning to whatever it was that he was doing she stepped inside and closed the door gently she had not really expected him to greet her with something like i missed you anyway that was not his style once the door snapped shut she started to walk towards him between the desks she froze when he held up a hand to stop her he kept his hand there for a lingering moment why did he want her to stay back was he changing his mind about things she just held her breath panicking while she stood still staring at his bowed head as he lowered his hand the wait seemed far too long for her to handle it was not more than half a minute while he scratched a few more spiky words onto his parchment it felt like an hour finally after and age he dropped his quill and looked up at her and that alone was enough to make her start breathing again she could not begin to describe the features of his face alone that made his intense stare so intoxicating she kept still just watching his every move he got up in one fluid movement and swept around his desk in a flurry of his large robes and as he strode over to her she held her breath once more was it over was he going to dismiss her or was he going to kiss her she felt her heart pound and her blood felt like sand in her veins the fear and hope mingled into a new form of feeling inside her he halted perfectly a half foot away and she bit her lip she wished she could read him better he looked down at her and there was a short silence he was well aware of her discomfort and found himself basking in it her anticipation made him feel a little better she definitely still felt something and that was what had been irking him recently it has been a while he stated delicately not wanting her to know just yet what he felt he did not understand his pleasure at her uncertainty it gave him a certain sense of power but it also he knew made her heart race he decided to take a small step closer to confuse her further she nodded her eyes not moving i sorry she muttered quietly with nervousness i ve been so busy with exams he finished for her yes i am well aware i was not accusing you now he would let the small smirk he held back loose hermione he watched her close her eyes and sigh her relief made him feel good too he was beginning to get confused as to what exactly he did not like about her he could not think of anything insufferable know it all was not one he had ever really meant intellect was of great value she smiled at him a little he had been toying with her she realized she closed the gap between them and crept her arms around his neck he kept his expression cool but he placed his hands at her waist tsk tsk she said softly leaning closer you really had me panicked there for a moment severus she could feel the shiver crawl down his spine as she had intended at the sound of his name he gazed at her with the black caves in place of his irises he did not apologise i know he lowered his voice and it was her turn to quiver in pleasure because it had come out at almost a soft growl he put his face very close to hers and smirked at her shivers there was a pause before he kissed her in which they both relished each other company hermione had decided however much her body screamed at her that she should break the kiss quickly she pulled away and he eyed her cautiously she told herself she had to let go of him and take a step back so they could talk but instead she rested her head against his chest enjoying the rise and fall with his breathing we have to talk she sighed it was severus turn to dread what she would say next he looked down at the mass of curls on her head that pressed against his heart he frowned in worry and tightened his grip on her o is that cliffy i sure hope not it just this chapter was starting to get a bit too long so i had to cut it somewhere i am so sorry for lack of sshg in
