 chapter 16 forbidden forest part i the halls were awash with the smells of pine trees popcorn and supressed excitement christmas was coming snape looked up as lily brushed by him in the entrance hall to the feast without a word she slipped a piece of parchment in his hand then she was gone disappearing in the sea of students severus took a seat at the end of the slytherin table just in time to watch the gold plates fill with food there were plates of steaming mashed potatoes and simmering gravy there were piles of breaded and grilled chicken tenders and legs roast beef steak and several varieties of tender fish vegetables ranging from broccoli to roasted peppers decorated the edges of every platter cold orange pumpkin juice filled large gold pitchers that were arranged with one every eight seats after filling his gold plate with rice and grilled chicken tenderloin he unfolded lily note and read it while shoveling food into his mouth ready for those da lessons we discussed on the train meet me by the edge of the ff at mn for your first lesson bring your w and a few cushions lv severus looked across the hall and saw lily sitting alone as usual though in the same position himself he couldnthelp feeling a pang of pity as a slytherin severus was like the rest of his house in valuing his own life over that of others but he knew at that moment that if it ever came down between his own life and lily s he would die for her so that when he made his decision he would take her to dumbledore and his order whether she wanted to or not he d talk to her at the lesson tonight he swore to himself just to see if she d agree lily sat with her back against a tree that overlooked the calm dark lake the light of the full moon was reflected on the still water broken only by the random splash made by the tentacles of the giant squid she exhaled slowly watching the light mist appear before her eyes only to fade away again in the cool crisp air lily was also cold but she delighted in feeling the sensation against her pale skin heat was the fuel for emotion hot passionate fury or fiery embarrassment or love no lily was cold emotionless she couldntafford heat so she relaxed in the chill as midnight and a night of work neared with a boom of hogwarts main clock to accent the hours as they swept by but no matter how cold her exterior was her soul was on fire burning determination and unquenchable spirit lingered behind her mint eyes ever thawing away at her mask she was no one pawn good or evil no matter how desperate her situation got she would not turn to the light side for assistance she was her own master she was just imprisoned by voldemort at the moment she d escape eventually lily suddenly sensed a presence beside her there stood severus watching her through inscrutable eyes how long have you been standing there she whispered a minute or so thinking about him he asked looking over at the lake more like escape from him she replied as still as the calm waters before her have you ever thought of of asking dumbledore for help lily looked up at him startled he was still gazing away black eyes distant and contained yes replied lily and there absolutely no way i will not only is there too much at risk but i going to solve this by myself she sighed but enough of that though are you ready did you bring the cushions severus tore his gaze away from the lake and nodded i had to filch them from the common room but they re here good now put away your wand this lesson will be wandless she said jumping nimbly to her feet wandless he repeated as she arranged the cushions on the rocky ground staining the silver pillows brown with the dark dirt i thought you said that i should bring my wand isntthat what the w stood for did you happen to notice what forest we re next to lily asked softly as she lined the cushions up in a two by six block the forbi oh exactly i didntwant us to be caught without protection by whatever in there she stepped back and looked at the pillows now what should we start with throwing things ripping burning boiling freezing changing let try freezing first said severus lily nodded and thrust her hand towards the lake suddenly tendrils of ice began to creep across the still waters as the ice went further out in the lake the frozen water was solid white indicating the exceptionally thick ice that appeared from the sheer power of lily evans lily felt her energy waning so she halted the ice progress and leaned against a tree now she took another breath you try focus on something cold like a memory or feeling severus closed his eyes now imagine the ice running through your veins but dontlet it freeze you she growled as severus began shivering many wizards have died trying to create ice for it might form in their veins instead of outside the body now focus on the chill and let it fly trough your fingers the slytherin flung out his arm sharply but no ice left cold he hissed pulling his hand close to him think of warmness this is all controlled by your mind think of sunlight or daisies or something lily was getting panicky seeing an icy paleness wrap around severus fingers warm summer something fiery your hate for potter and black think of how much you loathe them and let it run through your hand for a second lily wasntsure that severus heard her but then she saw the blue rapidly retreating from his fingers replaced with a healthy pink glow good severus now sit down and rest for a second the black haired boy fell to the ground airily caught by the pillows lily had laid there just for that purpose it was several minutes before he opened his eyes again what happened he asked you couldntget the ice out no worries it happens to most of the wizards who try it for their first time did you asked severus meeting her frozen green eyes she shook her head and looked back to the lake she shouldnthave given him this option lily knew that the dark arts were deadly and she shouldnthave put her friend in such a situation lily we re not safe out here said severus suddenly up and standing beside her i know that the arts can be startling the first time you try them but you ve got no lily not that severus pointed at the reflection of the full moon on the lake that then as if on cue there was a blood curdling howl a startled bark and the sounds of distant hoof beats werewolf breathed lily please review reviews just make my day whether you hate it love it or just want to make a comment about grammar or plot please tell me oh yes and the next chapter is dedicated to the first person to

lithe man a pair of black beady eyes looked into the black hall over a broken nose she recognized him immediately the auror alastor moody so my elusive stunner finally trapped you really had me stumped as to how you got in here until good old dumbledore found that used instant portkey in the library of course that just adds another charge to your long list any two of your crimes can send you to azkaban until you re an old man gray and crazy as he spoke the man edged down the corridor lily slowly reached her hand to her pocket for her wand but found it missing the auror as though sensing her confusion said you canthave been a death eater for more than ten years or so never put your wand in your pocket and run looking with her night vision eyes lily could see moody twirling her wand over his fingers let see who you are said mood lumos lily thrust out her left hand and used her magic to cover her face in the cloak of darkness though her magic was barely strong enough to do even that her sleeve fell back revealing a hissing snake tattoo racing along her arm painfully obvious in the light emanating from his wand beckoning her last ounce of power to come forth the girl pushed her hand forwards and summoned her wand from moody hand and was soon aiming her loyal wand straight at the auror moody gasped but was looking not at the wand but the tattoo behind it the mark of sal stupefy said lily as loudly as she could trying to add the power of her voice into the strength of the spell the moment the red light hit the auror lily stumbled past the lingering silencio spell cast so long ago caused her footfalls to be completely silent how she made it to the gryffindor tower was a mystery to her but she pondered on it little for sleep overtook her mere seconds after her head hit the pillow evans evans get up lily opened her eyes to see fairfield shaking her awake for once her face was bare of makeup and she had a terrified look on her face mcgonagall getting everyone up i think something wrong what time is it asked lily calmly 5 30 get up dontget dressed just throw on a dressing robe or something lily slipped out of bed and pulled on a dark green cloak over her silver silk pajamas she walked with the js down the stairs lily called tonks at the entrance of the first year girl dormitory do you know what going on lily shook her head but had a feeling that she knew exactly what was happening once every gryffindor was downstairs mcgonagall looked at them sadly last night there was a break in here luckily we have an auror staring here just for this reason and he was able to identify the intruder known as the stunner the intruder works very close to lord voldemort murmuring ran through the crowd and tonks looked very frightened for her hair had just turned jet black as though she was trying to shrink inside of herself last night the stunner was in the restricted section of the library for reasons unknown to us said moody after stunning mr filch who cannot give of any details on his appearance he headed towards the slytherin common room probably to gather the other death eaters said a voice behind them lily turned to look at a scowling sirius black moody continued as though he hadntheard black comment however he sent a decoy spell down the hall towards to room and tried to escape while the professors went on a wild goose chase towards the great hall mcgonagall looked ashamed and began examining her nails i however had my suspicions that he was really going to escape a different way so i went down and heard a noise in a dark corridor silence filled the common room as every student held their breath i used lumos but he was able to use wandless magic to stop the light from exposing his face on his arm was the mark of salazar the mark of salazar repeated a frightened looking third year the rest of the room jumped forgetting that there was anything in the room but the entrancing story mcgonagall answered the mark of salazar is a living snake tattoo given to slytherin heir and friends apparently he who must not be named and the stunner are very good friends erm excuse me asked tonks stepping forward mr moody er if you caught him then why are we all so worried moody scowled i had him cornered but he used his wandless magic to take his wand back and stun me he said rubbing the back of his head where he hit the ground i hope it hurts thought lily coldly i spent too much time well mocking him and not enough killing him he took out his wand and made a poster fly and paste itself on the wall on it was a wanted sign wanted the stunner reward 100 000 galleons 5 0 5 7 has mark of salazar on left arm on the picture was a slightly inaccurate drawing of the mark for it was silver with green diamonds and had black pupils the real tattoo slipped down her arm and she looked at it it was looking very nervous the visual display of lily emotions she quickly jerked the sleeve of her pajama shirt over her hand moody walked forward to make sure the stunner isntamong the students we will be checking everyone left arm for evidence of certain incriminating tattoos go get dressed and the search will begin at 9 00 until we find the stunner this school will be on lockdown dismissed can you believe it the stunner here at hogwarts said tonks absolutely stunning said lily flatly so lily darling how do you think he got in said a voice behind her black was gazing at her curiously potter nudged him warningly but he paid no heed lily shrugged mr moody said he found a used instant portkey didnthe one would assume that the stunner used that to get in potter met her eyes in confusion wha i do not believe i disclosed that piece of information growled a voice in her ear lily froze without moving she said are you sure i was almost positive that what you said moody grabbed her shoulders and spun her to meet his black eyes she felt a probe poking her brain and she set up nearly every block she had an occlumens eh with red hair and small build are you accusing lily evans of being voldemort stunner interrupted potter protectively and what does red hair have to do with anything blood red hair has been found at the scene of every crime committed by the stunner said moody she can prove herself innocent though go get your wand why waste your time just check for that tattoo and leave her alone said james fiercely is there a problem here alastor asked mcgonagall sharply moody growled under his breath and said loudly as soon as miss evans here shows me her arm there will be using every ounce of her power she halted the mark of salazar at the highest point of her shoulder it could travel with her right hand she thrust up her sleeve and hissed there not tattoo may i leave now moody turned over lily pale arm scouring for any mark of green ink lily began feeling faint the power it took to stop the tattoo from sliding right underneath moody fingers was almost more than she could bear her irritated subconscious caused the snake to start hissing loudly what was that asked moody sharply lily immediately pulled her arm back and dropped the sleeve that was me realizing how many of my rights you re violating right now unwarranted search and seizure slander searching with reasonable suspicion is perfectly legal growled moody as an auror i must have constant vigilance seeing a redheaded petite person inside of hogwarts who happens to know that we found an instant portkey at the scene of a crime really strikes me as suspicious you checked me yourself for the mark would you like to check my wand too if you wouldntmind said moody bowing mockingly towards the stairs minutes later lily was watching as moody looked over her wand it looks like the one i found last night but i know one way to know for certain finite incantum you like you dontlike review chapter 19 realization from the wand came a faint white glow it lumos said lily calmly i used it last night so that i could read while my roommates were sleeping donttry to lie miss evans said moody scathingly i am also told by this spell when you used the spell mere minutes ago yes to walk down the stairs right lils i had to also because it too early for the candles to be lit yet moody scowled at tonks who glared right back at him mcgonagall grabbed the auror arm come alastor we still have to tell the ravenclaws and hufflepuffs moody looked back threateningly at lily over his shoulder but followed mcgonagall placidly thanks tonks said lily softly i had forgotten that i had to use it on the stairs tonks looked at her with a raised eyebrow i was just covering for you the candles are lit now really where were you last night in my dorm whispered lily making sure to keep all worry out of her eyes as she met tonks s i got in at curfew and stayed in then why asked tonks coldly were you not there when i came to see you at 10 30 i was in the bathroom i had forgotten to brush my teeth said lily after a slight pause jessica jennifer and that other blonde said that they hadntseen you since classes ended argued tonks what is this everyone accuse lily evans day leave me alone she hissed before stalking up the stairs to her dorm to get in some sleep in case moody was going to check her again later are you sure she wasnthere last night asked james again tonks nodded i dontknow what up with her lately james ran a hand through his hair in exasperation if lily kept acting like this the marauders would never be able to figure out what was happening to her the three marauders aware of lily secrets and tonks were seated in the boys dormitory safe from any prying eyes and ears no matter how enclosed the room was james still whispered his next sentence we do what yelped tonks hush sirius scolded that not helping anyone least of all evans you know what up with lils tonks hissed in a scary imitation of lily and you didnt tell me her hair turned hot orange in indignation well we werentpositive until just recently said remus blushing it was this red coloring that lit remus cheeks as he spoke to tonks that caused sirius and james to suspect the werewolf had a crush on the fiery young metamorphmagus yeah so you know about her new dad right asked james tonks nodded hair paling as her anger cooled we think we know that he the stunner dumbledore practically told us interjected sirius remus blinked no what asked james and sirius sharply no dumbledore told us to run when we saw him so asked james in complete confusion so dumbledore wouldnthave known the stunner by name because well no one knows his name now tell me the one man that dumbledore would think would attack us in public and that the three of us all top duelists of our year couldntstand a little chance against even together james shook his head there isntanyone except voldemort said sirius slowly marvolo smith is lord voldemort interesting the marauders know that lily father is voldemort but they dontknow that she the stunner yet oh yeah and apologies for the shortness of the chapter but i ll update tommorrow or the next day to make up for it dedicated to pesche realizing first that it was her anger that gave her the power to use her voice emotion in my fic is power as severus will state in this chapter emotions were what gave humans their strength so as she continues to mask her emotions she loses the strength that she was naturally given once her anger reached boiling point she was not trying to mask her emotions and was able to use those emotions to give herself power here are some answers to the reviews no i am not in a writer block i have the entire fic planned out but i am looking for ideas on see no evil i am so happy that so many people have started reviewing finally for a while i thought i was going to end up one of those writers who posts for two people i also realized that people update most when i leave off with a cliffhanger maybe i should make more of those evil laughter i have the next five chapters typed so i ll update every time i get on the computer with only one week left until winter break severus could barely stand staying in school lily had just been confined to order headquarters an old deserted hotel in muggle liverpool he had to see her she loathed him now but he didntcare her safety willing or not was his sole concern he had been watching her torn emotions eating her from the inside for months raw feeling tearing at her very soul he knew from experience how it felt to be ever on your mental guard even around severus her one true friend lily was never able to be the lily she had been before ever encountering voldemort and the twisted world of magic though she never showed her guilt of being who what she was severus could only imagine how the stolen lives were weighing down her petite shoulders emotions were what set humans apart from other creatures by being able to feel guilt to feel hate to feel love humans were given strength in lily case her emotions were always held at bay and it affected her ability to be herself it showed in her voice it stayed blank and quiet until emotion consumed her and then her voice was elevated back to human potential severus just wished that it hadntbeen him that had sparked her flame of anger so fiercely in gaining the trust of dumbledore he had lost the trust of the person he cared for most severus whispered narcissa frantically jolting him out of his reverie do you think he will kill us i dontknow what you re talking about narcissa now what wrong he asked though he knew exactly what her fear was about the stunner gone we got a letter from marvolo smith today asking for her i thought she was with him didntyou we were supposed to watch after her what is dumbledore caught her narcissa severus hissed the blonde quieted but tears were formed in her opaque blue eyes if something like that did happen to the dark lady not saying that it has but if it did we could not have stopped it the dark lord knows this severus drawled now wipe away your tears and quiet down talk to bella she ll tell you the same but i cantfind bella either sobbed narcissa what going on here asked bellatrix from behind them as narcissa turned to weep to her sister severus picked up his books to leave oh and severus said bellatrix would you mind writing back to the dark lord and explaining this whole mess you are the best with words severus nodded and grabbed the letter from bellatrix waiting hand he retired to his dorms to explain to the most evil wizard in the world that he and the other hogwarts death eaters had lost lady velisna he just hoped that voldemort wouldnttake out his anger on the messenger severus tapped his fingers on the desk as professor williams passed out the timed writing papers okay guys and gurls he said enthusiastically you have thirty minutes to finish the essay which is part of 30 of your grade go ahead and start severus scanned the topic sentence and grinned an essay on how dementors performed their soul sucking duties this would be easy he heard crabbe and goyle groan behind him and could almost hear the stupidity radiating off of them severus dipped his eagle feather quill into the black ink and began throwing words onto the paper ever annoyed by the sluggish pace that his hand was making against his mind he let himself lose his thoughts in the meaningless essay blocking out his worries for lily time called the professor severus who had simply been scanning for misspelled words dropped his quill only to pick up all of his troubled thoughts enjoy your break said professor williams jovially you too said the hufflepuffs as they exited the room severus felt like wrapping their little yellow scarves around their cheerful little necks and going phantom of the opera on them stupid happy careless flufflepuffles severus slinked back to the slytherin common room and ran right into rudolphus lestrange on his way up the stairs where are you off to in such a rush asked the large slytherin lazily leaning against the stone wall course hair shadowed his square jaw and his black hair looked as though it had never seen shampoo rudolphus was always the first slytherin to send the new little first years on some frivolous errand just to prove he could just eager to get out of this place drawled severus rudolphus agreed heartily and severus relaxed he wouldntbe the one to realize the real reason severus was in such a hurry oh yeah and severus better watch your back i hear potter scouring the whole bloody school looking for you severus grimaced a smile thanks for the warning rudolphus the other slytherins never helped severus in his never ending war against the marauders actually they seemed to find it amusing he entered the dark seventh year boys dormitory with a heavy heart bo crabbe and george goyle looked up at him for a second before returning to their invigorating game of bloody knuckles the boy went over to his long packed trunk and cast a spell to make it float obediently behind him he walked upstairs calmly and was almost out of the common room when bellatrix called him back the train doesntleave for another hour severus come over here she said imperiously severus slid over and stood vigilantly behind narcissa armchair that spell of yours really worked said antoni dolohov lazily severus nodded accepting their gratitude be looking out for my owl bellatrix said i think we ll be having a meeting soon once the dark lord learns that we lost lady velisna it your fault you know my fault repeated severus nonplussed your fault the dark lord knows now said bellatrix matter of factly you told me to tell him said severus huh said crabbe goyle and the newest recruit macnair together bellatrix however just shrugged and you were the first one of us to realize that she was who she was so she was your responsibility realizing that severus could never argue with bellatrix twisted logic he gave a small bow and left the common room with his suitcase trailing humbly behind him he scowled at nearly every portrait he passed and felt like kicking the innocent suits of armor he had been so busy worrying about lily that he had almost stopped worrying about himself the dark lord would be on the rampage looking for his daughter and severus wouldntbe at the snape house where voldemort might expect him to be no the deserted snape house would remain as such and severus would be having a jolly old christmas with the jolly old order of the phoenix in an entire house worth of people who donttrust him and one girl who hates his guts as his thoughts drifted once again to lily he didnteven notice that he was about to run into a tall black haired boy why hello sni snape james remus and i were just looking for you said the boy pulling him back up to his feet black he said shortly by way of greeting let get to the point said potter ah yes the point always a good place to start dontyou think so moony said black happily looking at him closely severus noticed that black had a bright red santa hat perched on his head in place of his wizards hat severus forced himself to look away from black and back at potter who was glaring at black right well we know that you re on the good side now so i think we should call a truce you are going to be staying at hq with us over the break right potter said severus blinked and swayed on his feet feeling slightly nauseous christmas with the marauders was dumbledore trying to kill him nothing could have made his day weirder it was at that moment that peeves shot by overhead arms full of parchments peeves hollered professor williams the bald professor raced by give those here nuh uh i get lots of money for doing this peeves cackled peeves are you the one with the robes and no hair no so gimme those papers look out below the poltergeist said before snapping his fingers causing the timed writings to shoot up in flame nooooooooo cried the professor severus blinked as the man leapt up off his knees and said well off to mexico he conjured a broomstick that was painted to look like a parrot and turned his wizard hat into a sombrero adios boys he called the frozen marauders and severus before throwing a bag of galleons to peeves and zooming out the window okay that was one thing that added the weird cherry on his weird day turning his attention back on the boys eyed them curiously a truce said severus warily just until we get lily back on her feet said lupin calmly not at all fazed by the peeves incident i mean we shouldntact like we hate each other in front of her right she mad enough as it is without blowing up the hotel to get revenge against because of some prank severus took a deep breath and met each of their eyes when working with the dark lord i have to pretend to feel things that i dontand pretend to like people i don t when i working with the order i am not going to continue acting you pretend all you want but i am never going to call a truce with you no matter what happens between us i will always hate you and nothing is going to change that he finished he left the boys standing there and got on the train early planning what he was going to say to lily when he finally saw her now the thing about williams and peeves is sort of an inside joke and comic relief to the serious tone of the story please review and gimme your thoughts also i decided to add a little question to push your minds at the end of most chapters so here question number one if it was a choice between saving yourself and one loved one spouse sibling parent andsentencing one hundred other people to death which would you choose you can give me your answer in a review or you can just think aboutit to yourself i want my fic toopen thoughts for you so choose your answer you dontwant to answer i would love to see predictions of where you think this fic is going i already have it planned out but if there a really good scene you have in mind let me knowand i can incorporate it into the story if yourguess is completely off then i get a good laugh just kidding i really want to know what you think oh i also wanted to clarify reviewer said that this was the climax of this fic not quite right if my plans work out this is about half way through the fic this story will either gountil lily and james get married or when they announce their engagement no i will not go into all those details of before the wedding engagement maybethe last two chapters will skip ahead in time a bit to theproposal and ceremony trust me i have big plans for this i will try not to let it get to dull please review long chapter sort of depressing but i like it new info on lily past lily could not believe it after six years of being on her guard and stopping anyone from ever figuring out who she was she was finally caught she had woken up tied to a chair in what she soon learned was the order headquarters and been fiercely questioned by alastor moody of course dumbledore did not support use of the cruciartus curse so lily was able to keep all of her information to herself nothing the order could say or do could cause her to tell them anything however moody had been able to get dumbledore to approve of pain if she lied he wanted to make sure that if she did tell them something that it was the truth and that it wouldnthurt anyone she slumped against her bonds and glared once again at the plain door that blocked her from freedom it was a shame that she needed her hands to use wandless magic for with her powers she could have been in brazil in the blink of an eye three times a day moody would charge in and give her ten minutes to stretch use the restroom and eat a small meal then he d ask her a few questions which got little response and then storm away from the noises that came from downstairs lily could easily guess that even if she got past moody she d be met with at least a dozen order members being tied in a small unfurnished room really plays tricks on the brain as lily soon figured out the first two days she was perfectly content in the room using one of the advanced branches of occlumency to keep her mind separated from her still body but soon boredom caused her to want to explode the thoughts she had been able to hold back over the past few years were the only things she had to entertain herself she was a gryffindor she knew that in her position severus and many other people she knew would have done exactly as she had done chosen the life of her sister over that of other peoples and her own petunia had no clue that her life was in lily hands at all times every time lily stunned somebody knowing that a death eater would soon follow her to kill them she had to think of the life she was saving the life of her sister of course she now thought bitterly petunia was one of the meanest people lily had met there was no real reason why lily chose to save her sister and not the innocent muggles but she supposed it was the fact that petunia was the one she knew she loved petunia deep down so deep down in fact that the emotion was merely a subconscious feeling when she actually thought about it petunia had been nothing but annoyed with the fact that lily had been exposed to the magical world though petunia would never have given her whole life for lily the girl found that now she was protecting someone who had absolutely no gratitude for the pain lily went through for her sake she wished she didntalways feel she had to do the same as robin did lily jumped at her own thoughts she had not thought of robin in a long time the memories of what had happened were so painful that lily had been able to block them out but now trapped in a room alone with her thoughts the memories were her life robin she whispered brokenly lily bit her lip and refused to let even a single tear slip down her face she been doing that all week said moody gruffly james sirius remus and snape all stood behind the wall watching her of course she doesntknow that we can see her or else she d be trying the find ways to kill us james watched her silently snape spoke from beside him can we see her you re looking at her now arentyou boy said moody in annoyance no i mean can i we speak to her the boy said james had never seen this side of snape before it almost scared him to see that there can be so much more to a person than meets the eye take evans for example the marauders had been inches away from figuring her out for months and now that it had finally come out james didntfeel any better he could not remember why he ever wanted to know what was wrong with her sirius said we d really like to talk to her james looked over at him the usually cheerful boy looked as though seeing evans like this was a major reality check the sparkle was gone from his silver eyes and all that was left was a determined glint moody raised a thick eyebrow if you all go in together he said tilting his head at snape to make his point it was painfully obvious that moody trusted snape about as much as he trusted voldemort but he looked as though he was seriously considering the proposition go ahead you guys talk to her while i make a pot of mint tea it ll calm you down afterwards he said why would we need something to calm us down after just talking to her asked sirius moody raised an eyebrow at him trust me he growled before turning on his heel and heading down to the hotel kitchens let go said james taking a deep breath he looked once more through the two way wall and his determination was renewed the four boys stood in front of the door uncertainly room 326 the room evans was being held in was in the middle of a long row of white doors on the third floor of the piton hotel it was possibly the most secure room in the building as it was centered in the very middle the room to the left was the room in which they could observe evans and the room to the right was moody bedroom across the hall was kingsley shacklebolt one of the newer recruits fresh out of hogwarts and in auror training kingsley was the strongest person james knew and between him and moody evans would never be able to escape sirius was the one that opened the door evans emerald eyes shot open and she glared at the boys as they entered as snape came in last and closed the door behind him a hissing sound came from her james saw the infamous snake tattoo racing down her pale arm illuminated by the candles floating by the walls the tattoo raced to her hand which was tied behind her back where james could not see hello black potter lupin snape she acknowledged coldly the slytherin seemed at a loss for words he finally croaked you called me snape that your name isntit asked sirius snape turned to sirius but seemed to not be able to think of a sufficient comeback evans looked at snape emotionlessly i only call my friends by their first names but you dontcall anyone by their first name exclaimed sirius hotly i think that her point mumbled remus elbowing padfoot hard in the ribs why are you here she asked softly without waiting for the answer she tilted her head up at sirius i bet you feel stupid she said icily you danced around the truth for ages without figuring it out sirius walked forward and knelt in front of evans suddenly james was worried what sirius was going to say he was known to be utterly rash at times how did your parents die he asked so quietly that james almost missed the question evans looked as though he d slapped her for a split second before putting a blank mask on her face why ever do you think they re dead james opened his mouth but remus nudged him into silence sirius didntsay anything either evans sighed i never knew my parents they died when i was born suddenly a siren louder than a foghorn went off and evans clenched her teeth and braced her shoulders remus caught on first where does it hurt he shouted going over to her and kneeling next to sirius she didntanswer and her eyes closed as though she was blocking everything out just as quickly as they had turned on the sirens went off moody entered the room and said lucky i was checking up on you that means she told a lie he said gruffly pointing at the ceiling he went behind her and messed with the metal cuffs on her hands is she okay asked james quickly for she had not opened her eyes yet she ll live the spell just tightens her cuffs and burns her a bit said moody carelessly james walked around and saw that the cuffs were thin sharp metal how hot do they get well they turn red if it a normal lie and white is it a lie that could hurt somebody you know i cantfigure out why she keeps doing this lying and letting herself go unconscious said moody she not unconscious said snape it just a certain type of occlumency it lets her escape from her body for a few minutes it reduces all pain by about half she a very skilled occlumens he finished so we learned said moody in annoyance well there a button in the other room that turns off the sirens so you all should be able to handle it while i downstairs the tea almost ready he stuck his tongue out at evans and left the door had been closed for a minute when evans opened her eyes again it was your fault you know she said softly that you lied asked james blankly that they died she said the sirens stayed silent but james found himself wishing that they would go off could it really be his fault that he parents died i could have stopped him but your stupid spell wouldntlet me use magic you mean that one that stopped you from breaking school rules asked remus she nodded how did they die asked sirius once again he killed them she murmured and then you became a killer like him said sirius coldly no not like him he killed in order to kill more i kill to stop a killing said evans softly who robin asked james evans eyes grew wide and the tattoo started hissing again get out of here never say his name again out she hissed snape raced forward lily because of your ignorance everything i ve done is for nothing he going to kill her and it all your fault thanks friend no listen pe i hate you all she hissed the sirens began wailing and evans eyes snapped shut let go said remus they closed the door and went to the other room to turn of the sirens the four boys trooped down to the kitchens forgetting their own differences as they thought of the stunner upstairs snape was muttering to himself i ve got to tell her that her sister safe i ve got to tell her they all slumped into the chairs around the table and began to slowly drink the tea that was already set out in mugs for them told you that you d need it said moody knowingly glad you guys in general approved of robin thanks for the reviews please keep up the good work so basically it is my job to get information and if possible recruit you to the cause finished the man lily gazed up at him dully his name as he had readily given was edgar bones green and gold eyes sat somberly under a lock of thick brown hair and the recently named auror was tall and muscular from years of training he had yet to call her as moody did stunner and lily found herself relieved though that had indeed been her occupation for the last six years it was not a thing she enjoyed dwelling on from the sounds around the hotel she assumed that father christmas would be arriving in a few days time what with black robustly singing christmas carols from all corners of the building any questions asked bones at her silent stare he clapped his hands and said good well no use sitting here twiddling our thumbs let get started lily she blinked for some reason she had assumed that all the order members had been informed only of her last name moody would certainly not let lily slip through his lips bones conjured a chair twirled it around and sat down resting his head on the back of it anything you d like to say to start us off he asked amiably go to she stopped deciding that cursing would not be the right path of action plus she had never expressed such rage other than with snape for a long time and would not let this auror provoke her whether he meant to or not she bit her lip and shook her head he pulled out his wand and waved it around the room for a minute or so with lily watching him silently albeit curiously that ll stop any use of magic in here at least any magic without a wand he seemed to have no worries that she would manage to obtain his wand and though she had been through six summers of intense training had doubts on her own abilities to defeat this man in combat now i am no legilimens but the lie detector is still up so if you re gonna talk make it the truth first i ll confess something to you i do not approve of torture generally speaking i have and will use it as a final step in defense i especially disagree with alastor on his stance on your cuffs he says perfect plan i say unnecessary especially since your friend told us that you re able to reduce it by half anyways dontget me wrong i can tell from your scars that it still hurts why add injury to insult we ll all know you re lying and we ll just move on but he said frost suddenly dusting his words i ll set those babies to their highest frequency and roast you if you hurt anybody here understand lily had to physically stop herself from nodding she would not go down just because some pretty boy gave her a threat she didntask for this and was not going from slave of the dark to slave of the light she just wanted the freedom to choose for herself i got alastor to turn off the heat of the cuffs until he back in charge which by the way is when i walk out of here if you re good after a few days we ll take them off during out sessions bones was quite the optimistic fellow lily kept her face smooth she knew that this man could be as dangerous as the dark lord to her and she would not put her guard down because he was being so cheerful are you even going to move again while i in here he asked suddenly lily forced herself not to jump or move in any way he raised a hand and she couldnthelp it she flinched but all he did was run it through his mass of brown hair she kept her face blank as though she hadntreacted but the look in his eyes affirmed that he had noticed go ahead say something anything i dare you he said with a grin suddenly his face fell here i am trying to talk to the stunner you got my cousin you know deborah bush do you even recognize the name lily whispered i not informed of names when and where that all see now we re getting somewhere he said ever been given a why or a how running out of patience lily hissed i the stunner what do expect i supposed to throw daisies at them see talking is good let out all the anger he coaxed at her silence he said let me tell you a little about debbie she was smart funny always had a joke handy debbie was also an artist i remember once a couple of years ago she locked herself in her room and painted a mural of forty seven cats she was so july 12th 4965 dovescote lane lily whispered suddenly what he said sharply i only learn the when and where she said again bones rose suddenly that all we have time for today we ll continue this tomorrow he banished his chair and left the room her handcuffs gave a sting as they turned back to full alertness and she sighed softly y know i learned a lot from her said edgar watching lily from the two way wall after her words he had been curious to know her reaction when she was alone and had quickly went to the observation room moody snorted you learned your own cousin address what progress edgar scowled and rolled his eyes i learned that she cared enough to remember and that you ve hit her before moody jumped only when she back talked he growled a bop on the head never did anyone harm would you want to join someone who smacked your head i bet that you re first on her to kill list along with that snape kid they looked through the wall at evans who had her eyes closed after a few minutes she murmured just loud enough for the audio spells to pick up july 12th debbie she finally had a name six years with no names and she finally knew one deborah bush somehow the name made everything hurt even worse the door creaked open lily lifted her head from her chest awaiting the intruder bones had told her that he wouldntbe back until tomorrow and moody shuffled his feet unlike this person hey lily said snape softly lily quickly froze her face and refused to meet snape pleading eyes it was his fault that her hands were handcuffed tightly behind her back at the moment it was his fault she was trapped in order of the phoenix headquarters it was his fault petunia was going to die i just came to tell you that your sister safe dumbledore put her somewhere in scotland until this blows over petunia she asked quickly hardly believing her ears maybe her sacrifice wouldntbe for nothing yes petunia evans from what dumbledore wait a second you said his name stated lily pardon asked snape in confusion the headmaster name you ve been speaking it for a while and i hadnteven noticed if i had been paying attention these past few months i could have found out your little plan sooner said lily icily snape took a deep breath and continued where he had left off from what dumbledore said she hadntheard from you in six years didntyou tell her about him i ve told you about petunia she wouldntunderstand her greatest fear is someone learning she related to a freak like me not that the most evil freak of all is after her lily blinked and remembered where she was and who she was talking too but maybe you ve forgotten that since you got all chummy with the headmaster i saved you and your sister you should be thanking me on bended knee he whispered harshly yeah because i always thank people who ruin my life she hissed unable to keep a blank face around the person who had once been her closest confidante i never heard you complain when the dark lord did it if you dare to even say that then we have nothing to talk about with renewed determination she tried to separate her mind from her body but found herself unable to technically occlumency is a form of wandless magic said snape with a condescending smirk lily felt as though her insides had turned to lead to think i wasted my time saving your life so many times that i ve lost count if i had just left you for the werewolf i would never have been in the library with filch which means i would not be sitting here right now so next time i wontbother if they kill you here there wontbe a next time said snape fiercely lily narrowed her emerald eyes you a gruff voice interrupted snape you know where the door is please use it moody stood behind snape the slytherin whirled around and stalked out cloak billowing behind him without your occlumency you ll get real bored in here real fast edgar told me to tell you that quote you need only to say that you d like to talk and i ll be here in a jiffy end quote you tell bones that my thoughts provide more intelligent conversation than he ever could she hissed rage still pumping from her row with snape however she immediately regretted her words for the anger in moody eyes was enough to scare her which was saying something voldemort never showed his anger so you never were aware of when you were in trouble but it was always clear where you stood with moody lily closed her eyes and waited for the sharp blow to her head that always came after one of those angry looks the longer she waited the more tense her shoulders became finally with a sinking feeling in her gut she opened one eye instead of seeing as she d expected with a striking hand or a green light she saw the auror turning and exiting quickly when she was sure he was gone she relaxed her shoulders with a relieved sigh with him out of the room she was able to calm down and let her raging emotions show more plainly on her face lily busied herself in learning the art of guarding emotions without magical help with a little practice she hoped to pull off complete magicless mind blocking by the end of the week give me a review i like the cookie monster only not well be

locked in an intense battle of wizards chess knight to e4 demanded sirius blowing a lock of dark hair out of his silver eyes the knight slid across the squares to remus pawn the pawn burst into a million ivory pieces when the knight drew his sword and sliced him out of the way james rolled his shoulders and yawned not that this isntthe most interesting thing to watch but i to try to talk to evans he said to his friends rising from the comfortable armchair good said sirius with a cocky grin now you wonthave to watch moony endure this terrible loss checkmate said the werewolf lazily leaning back in his chair a glint of laughter in his amber eyes sirius cursed loudly and said the terrible loss of one of his limbs moony completely ignoring sirius anger waved his wand and restored all the pieces back to normal best five out of nine challenged sirius placing all of his black soldiers on his side bring it said remus raising his chin up defiantly james rolled his eyes and left the hotel living room heading up the flights of stairs to evans cell on the way up he ran into kingsley who had a towel around his thick neck i headed off to the weight lifting room would you like to join me nah said james i going to see evans kingsley raised an eyebrow but continued down the stairs james ran up the last flight and strode to moody bedroom he knocked on the door but received no answer he decided to try the observation room upon entering he saw moody sitting in a lounge chair and drinking a cup of steaming coffee have to stay awake he grunted when he noted james inquiring look have you stopped watching her for a minute the entire time she been here asked james with a roll of his eyes of course said moody not catching on to james tone i leave when either kingsley or edgar volunteer to watch her for an hour or so i know that this weak stuff is just an act she ll try to break out any minute now and i want to be the one to catch her james looked doubtfully through the wall at evans who appeared to be sound asleep just wondering but may i go in she must get lonely in there said james moody shrugged and pointed to a chair in the corner of lily room edgar decided to keep that chair in there you can sit there if you d like but be careful she dangerous lily blinked yawned and opened her eyes fully sleeping when tied to a stiff chair was an uncomfortable experience to say the least suddenly she noticed a person sitting in the far left corner of the room her head snapped to the side to stare into the eyes of james potter he was sitting in bones chair watching her silently though tempted to tell him to get out lily decided that ignoring him would be the best tactic to ensure his speedy departure she focused on the opposite wall and gazed blankly at the smooth white stone she kept her ears intently listening for any sound of movement from the marauder but his steady breathing was all the evidence that the boy was even in the room at least sev snape had talked to her she found that she preferred his hot anger to this cool silence she was enduring though she felt loathing for both boys the fact that she knew severus made her more open to expressing her rage at him while her anger at potter was something that she couldntexplain to others the feeling of hatred had risen slowly in her during first year when potter played a prank on her daily about halfway through the year he had discovered the perfect way to annoy her asking her out day in and day out he would casually mention sitting together at lunch or snogging in the broom closet on the third floor after a day of finding it a bit annoying lily began to hex potter when he d ask her a question of any kind even when it would turn out later that his comment was going to have been an innocent homework question or something that fact that he was so determined served only to infuriate her more right before the summer after first year potter had cast the spell that stopped her from breaking school rules she had of course thought that the spell wouldntaffect her at all what with the name lily evans being the epitome of all things anti rule breaking however once summer hit she found herself longing to break a little school rule by flying her broom in the nearby muggle park around midnight but no page 5346 section 4 and paragraph 8 stopped her from even doing that of course for the first month it just served as an annoyance once robin died however she thought to herself that if she had just been able to show him a magic trick he would have waited around the house for just a minute longer after already being depressed about the death of her older brother lily life was flipped upside down when voldemort had apparated into her yard the girl had pulled out her wand and tried to hex the man into oblivion but was stopped from doing that by the book potter spell had casually missed letting her slip through any exceptions or loopholes voldemort had quickly killed her parents knowing that they would have served as only a threat when he was trying to teach her to become the most feared stunner in the world without her wand she could only stand and watch helplessly as her parents perished in a bout of uncontrollable hatred she had leapt at the dark lord with the intent to kill only to find herself restrained by a burly death eater that when petunia had walked outside and screamed if only the stupid muggle hadntscreamed if petunia had escaped then lily would have gladly sacrificed her life instead of working for voldemort she realized that hours had been slipping by as she pondered and wondered whether or not potter had left yet lily was unable to control her head from swiveling around and looking to where potter still sat motionless in her cell with his large hazel eyes glued on her still face what annoyed her most was that somehow he was able to block her from seeing emotions through his eyes it couldnthave been occlumency for the room was set to block that maybe she just wasntlooking hard enough she held his gaze for another minute before whispering what he jumped and shook his head as though to dislodge burr entangled in that mop he called hair he blinked and met her eyes i just was wondering whether or not you feel guilty you know for all the killings he said meeting her eyes how dare he look upon her like he doubted her gryffindor heart well if he wanted evil then that what he was going to get of course i feel guilty she sneered in the most sarcastic voice she could muster she had to tell the truth due to the confines of the lie detectors but she could only hope that potter didntrealize that he just met her eyes silently now this she could handle most conversations with the dark lord consisted of the follower talking and the master giving an unnervingly flat stare she had been able to hold his gaze for hours without letting a drop of feeling show through and if she could do it with voldemort then she could definitely do it with some seventh year they slowly blinked at each other for what felt like and probably was hours finally potter leaned back in his chair and said the weather really nice today lily held back her surprised blink here he was sitting with the second most feared being in the world and all he could do was comment on the weather remus sirius and i are going out to play quidditch later maybe we ll get sn severus to play seeing as we need more people now staring contests lily could handle but she knew that even if it was voldemort saying such a ridiculous statement that she would not be able to hold in her disbelief she snorted and her eyes twitched in a would be roll doesntseverus play quidditch asked potter in surprise lily could not escape the remark from flying out of her lips not since jessica fairfield cursed that broom to buck him off she said pursing her dark lips afterwards then what can we do together potter asked still in slack jawed amazement do you practice the dark arts asked lily potter looked scandalized no then you and snape have nothing in common she said then what does he do for fun asked the messy haired boy he was leaning forward in his chair as though actually wanting to hear the next words lily sighed to snape the darks arts are the epitome of fun do you agree what do you do for fun lily cocked her head slightly to one side and met his gaze i run ah he said wisely run like track or run like from aurors he asked with a raised eyebrow lily did not look at his eyes instead looking straight at the wall above his head in truth she ran in her wolf animagus form when she got the chance but adding illegal animagus to her list of crimes would not be wise instead she shrugged did robin run track asked potter lazily but lily could see the intense curiosity on his face lily froze and made sure her eyes were frozen how did you guys learn his name she asked in monotone you said his name when you were asleep answered potter leaning back in the chair and crossing his arms as hazel eyes pierced into her well she said harnessing her anger and smoothing over her face i was jut dreaming i dontknow anyone named robin she was proud of her ability to tell truthful lies lily used to know robin but his death caused her not to know him anymore have you ever known anyone named robin he asked lily refused to answer looking intently at the wall just over potter messy hair i see he said softly and lily eyes narrowed sometimes potter was smarter than he looked well if severus doesntlike quidditch and i dontlike the dark arts maybe we can try something else like what asked lily baking brownies and since when have you stopped calling him snivellus and since when have you started calling him snape retorted potter leaning forward again my opinion changed just as quickly as yours did that because he had been lying to me she whispered harshly realizing what she had just said lily faltered i mean he i sev snape he no friend of mine she concluded i never said he was said the boy calmly and he been hiding stuff from me too i didntknow about his order membership he had no obligation to tell you lily hissed defending the boy who had just become her enemy would you tell bellatrix black that you had gotten into the same defense against the dark arts class that she did potter blinked that completely not what i meant black is evil he said from your point of view severu snape thinks that you and black are evil she pointed out see he agrees with me said potter lily sighed and let her eyes flick to the ceiling sirius black she murmured with a sigh oh said potter slowly lily struck with an idea said how about you go ask snape what he wants to do potter also looked surprised great idea he said before racing out of the room i win lily murmured allowing a smirk to cross her face alastor watched the argument curiously the stunner obviously had no fear of potter or any of the other teens staying with the order and it showed with i and edgar her biting comments were kept at a minimum and even the slightest display of emotion was a rarity the stunner seemed to display multiple personalities and alastor was having trouble keeping track of them all which one was the real one or was there a real one maybe her character was as undecided as tonks appearance he turned back to his silent vigil over the stunner determination etched in his gnarled features lord voldemort paced in one of the back halls of nighshade mansion a small piece of parchment was clasped tightly in his strong tan fist and he could not help glaring down at snape words once more upon finding that the horrible truth had not been a mad hallucination voldemort threw the parchment against a green wall he pulled out his wand gave it an irate flick and watched triumphantly as the pale paper burned tendrils of black ash overtaking the ghastly words he needed to know who he needed to know how and he most definitely needed to know why the first human he had been able to care for missing at first he had only recruited her because of the rumors of her knack for curses beyond her years when he had seen how brilliant she truly was he felt a bond with her someone needed to teach her power she would not be raised as voldemort himself was with only a common school education sometimes she had to be persuaded into taking the right course of action her annoying bond with that muggle sister of hers was often the best way it was because of that filth that he knew velisna would not stay away for long suddenly the self named dark lord ran to where he knew his followers were in the banquet hall go now and check on velisna sister the death eaters looked at him in surprise one daft fellow dropped his fork the dark lord ignored it and hissed go a few followers slinked out of the room bowing rapidly after ten excruciatingly long minutes they returned one look in their nervous faces told him all he needed to know bring me those who were in charge of watching the muggle he hissed softly to the silent room when no one moved he clenched his fists now as death eaters scurried about he twirled his wand around lean fingers the unwatchful follower would pay now to those of you who have not yet reviewed this is me begging you to my only motivation for writing this story is the reviews so if i do not get 30 thirty reviews for this chapter you shall hear from me no more i will write this story for the amusement of my friends and to sate my own imaginations cravings to be solidified into words review please what is this i ask for 30 and how many do i get stalks around like an angry kindergarten teacher dramatic pause over 35 i love you all so much oh and to persche i love the idea about letting her go the work out room and you called my demand for 30 reviews ridulously high well hmph i got more than that dances wildly around to milshake d thanks for all the reviews the chair dug painfully into her back and she squirmed a bit against it the number of christmas carols sung had been increased and lily had a feeling that the holiday was coming ever nearer her keen ears picked up the sounds of feet approaching her door lily sighed and straightened her face as the doorknob twisted open looks like its time once again for twenty questions she thought annoyed lunchtime said bones as he strode jovially into her cell we have a special guest today he mentioned lightly as he levitated in three plates and goblets after conjuring a table he ll be up in a second the door closed behind him due to a command from bones his hazel eyes were bright and cheerful and his slender and commanding presence filled her cell his assured steps led him to the chair she was tied to bones unlocked lily cuffs and she stood unbidden and stretched calmly he picked up her chair easily with one tan hand and set it by the table he had conjured as she slinked towards it he pulled it out like a gentleman lily resisted the roll of her eyes and sat down lightly on the edge the lunch on her plate consisted of a small salad a cheeseburger creamed corn and various other vegetables the gentle aroma of the food rose to the girl nose but she ignored it as her mind once again set into velisna mode lily let her emerald eyes drift slowly to the white door of her cell maybe she could bust out when the guest tried to get in she would of course have to get by bones but she might be able to trick him into thinking she was just get that look out of your eyes said edgar sharply startling her out of her planning it took him forever to get out of work long enough to see you suspicion flooded lily veins and fear clouded her brain the guest was someone she hadntseen here yet the only other order member she knew of was sorry i late edgar had to conjure up a glass of lemonade from the castle said the headmaster taking off his tall wizard hat and bending down so he could enter the room trapped in a room with an auror and albus dumbledore she thought wearily this is as bad as being trapped in a house with voldemort and fifty followers lily felt like she attracted these kinds of shaky situations that alright albus you know lily evans correct he said gesturing at the seemingly calm but really fuming redhead her snake tattoo raced across her hand moving so fast that it was merely a green blur the silver stars on dumbledore royal blue robe glistened as the bearded man sat down by the table setting down his aforementioned glass of lemonade china blue eyes sparkled disarmingly at lily at first glance voldemort didntlook like much of a threat either bones walked to his own chair which was across from lily and sat down nobody saw you come here did they he asked dumbledore minerva watched out to make sure no one else was near this part of the hill is normally quite empty once this hotel went out of business all of the other shops moved nearer to the city dumbledore took a lazy drink of the glass despite all tales she had heard of his strength his hands were looking wrinkled and weak i hear you ve been giving alastor a run for his money in your avoidance of questions said dumbledore amiably to lily taking a bite of a potato wedge this was a man you couldntlet your guard down near lily reminded herself his innocent baby blues would lull you into a false sense of security and then he was in your mind according to the dark lord at least if you tell us all you know we can stop him said dumbledore calmly lily kept her face as calm as she could keeping her emotions locked firmly behind her emerald eyes you dontreally want him to kill all the muggles do you asked the old man obviously not anticipating a reply why was he playing these games he held her sister the ace what was the point of acting like she had a choice go ahead and eat lily said bones causing lily to blink in surprise she picked up her fork and gazed uncertainly at the food worried for the first time about a slip of veritiserum in her meal according to all of her training this was the time she was supposed to concoct a brilliant escape plan but staring at edgar bones one of the top aurors and being aware of dumbledore presence at her side not a single stroke of genius came to her edgar sighed we ve been over this there nothing in that food other than some bad cooking and a dash of flavor lily raised an eyebrow at him the one dumbledore couldntsee and set her fork firmly on the table now really lily said bones shaking his head if she not hungry we cantmake her eat said dumbledore lightly that was just like the headmaster trying to make her think she was wrong as desperately as wanted to talk she refused to it wasntjust her intense training that held her tongue fear stopped all sound but the quick beating of her heart so edgar what was this sweet you were telling me about she her something like that said dumbledore amiably digging into his food hershey s offered edgar as the two order members began conversing about muggle candies lily took deep breaths she knew the location of her two greatest threats and moody was sure to be lurking nearby if she ran now her odds were best no one could pop up and surprise her later but would she be able to make it out the doors no matter which side she was on she was going to be loyal even if she escaped dumbledore wouldntkill petunia she hoped so her goal would be complete if moody bones dumbledore or some other light wizard killed her before she escaped at least she would not have to betray voldemort the current holder of her loyalty the dark lord was the cause of all of her misery but becoming a turncoat was not a gryffindoric quality if she was going down she d do it on her own terms and this was her only chance to do that slowly lily inched her chair backwards masking it by eyeing her food with a falsely frightened look she rolled her shoulders in the week old robe and wiggled her toes in her black tennis shoes actually i ve always thought that skittles and m ms looked to alike to be a coincidence bones was saying focused on dumbledore face lily took a deep breath and slinked out of her chair covering the length of the floor with her long low steps when she was mere feet away from the door a bright pink spell hit the knob recognizing it for the powerful locking charm that it was lily froze sit down ordered dumbledore calm voice from behind her lily hadntbeen trained for nothing using her pent up energy from the past week as power lily kicked the door with all her might as she had expected it was protected against magic but not pure strength it flew from its hinge and lily leapt out of the opening and ducked a spell that flew her way i told you edgar growled a gruff voice from behind her as lily rounded the corner before they could blink just as she had thought moody had been close now there were no powerful surprises before her she leapt down the stairs three at a time not daring to look back the fact that it was a spiraling staircase saved her the spells from her opponents were far away there was a little loft that could only be seen when walking down the stairs located in the wall above the foot of the stairs lily guessed that it was inaccessible to humans without a ladder or broom so she turned into her animagus and leapt onto the ledge she turned back into a human and used her cloak to help her blend with the shadows the three men raced right under her not even considering that she could have made the jump lily eyes widened as it sunk in she had escaped the room looking down at the scars on her newly unchained hands she knew she wouldntgo back alive then it hit her not in the room she could do wandless magic a small fire lit in her pale hand chasing away the oppressive shadows lily morphed her ears back to those of a wolf and listened for her enemies the closest sound of breathing was in the loft lily increased the fire in her hands and its soft orange light lit upon remus lupin who was sitting in a meditative pose watching her through amber eyes she pushed out her hand to cast a wandless spell but halted when he murmured dontworry lily raised an eyebrow he kept her gaze without apparent fear of her reputation the years of school must have made him think that she wouldntkill him as bad as it was for her own future she had to admit that it was true she hated killing and would not hurt lupin any more than she had to i say that if you can get out of here then you re free to go you wontgo back to voldemort even if you did get escape so i wontstop you he informed her meeting his eyes she saw that there were no lies hidden within deciding to ignore his presence for a moment lily slinked to the edge of the room and peered at the staircase i going now if i hear one noise out of you she murmured leaving the implications to hang in the thick air not a word he said calmly oh and congratulations on the animagus lupin said as he closed his eyes again lily jumped down landing nimbly on all fours and ran back up the stairs to enter a long corridor there a window rested at the end of the hall she began running towards it but heard footsteps coming up the stairs she decided to go up another level so as to avoid the oncoming person once up the stairs lily nearly ran into a tall black man who she recognized to be kingsley shacklebolt he pulled out his wand but lily was quicker she thrust out a hand causing shacklebolt cover his eyes to shield himself from the blinding flash of white light she grabbed the wand from his limp grasp and stunned him the auror collapsed back head softly falling on the carpet the covered the stairs the rest of his body hit the hard wood that floored the halls lily turned to face the wandpoints of black and potter who had creeped up behind her with a snarl she stunned black quickly and pushed potter against the wall with a blast of pure wandless magic the girl raced down the hall to the window morphed into her animagus and leapt out of the window ignoring the slices of shattered glass that when about three stunning spells hit her with their blood red light k 8k 8k 8k 8k 8k 8k k james stared at his own wand and then turned to moody emmeline vance and sturgis podmore in surprise simultaneously they rushed to look out the window at lily evans who was laying brokenly four floors below if i may draw your attention to the line about moody stunning her eariler it was said that she thought that moody would kill her if she tried to escape she was wrong this shows you something about moody his bark is worse than his bite but his bite is still quite formidable please review oh and i need once again 30 no i wontnot ever update but i wontupdate for a month unless i get all 30 of them c mon gimme some predictions pain that was the first thing lily registered when she regained consciousness soft sheets engulfed her battered body it was just a really long dream she told herself not daring to open her eyes the obvious answer was that she had just endured another intense training session and someone would be in soon with an illegal potion to make her feel completely like new she shifted an inch in her bed for comfort but found such searing pain rushing through her body that her eyes shot open though her vision was clouded with the pain all she saw was black and white this was worse than nearly everything she had been through other than the cruciartus but even that was just temporary you are extremely lucky to have lived miss evans said a calm voice from beside her if you hadntbeen unconscious when you hit the ground we wouldntbe conversing now that shot the dream theory right out the window slowly the room came into focus the white stone walls were gone replaced with solid concrete maybe they had finally decided to take her as a serious threat who knows maybe they would take moody advice on the methods that should be used to get information out of her before it had seemed to lily that the order had thought that moody was being paranoid in his avid suspicion of her but she knew now that she had lived up to being the most capable stunner in the world flicking her eyes to the side she saw that the door was reinforced steel probably soaked in defense spells she sighed but immediately gasped in as her chest seemed fire to her it seemed like a very focused cruciartus curse but it subsided with her rapid breathing fine i admit it said moody gruff voice from out of her view we underestimated her but who in their right mind would think that a teenage girl would try to escape a room with the two of you and have time to not only become the world greatest stunner but an animagus too was it her pain crazed imagination or was that admiration in his deep voice you forgot the fact that she totally ripped said bones voice from her other side moody snorted when did she have the time he asked in exasperation well she wonttell you said bones finally they get it she thought triumphantly i knew that if i avoided their questions long enough that they d finally give up half of her ribs are broken he finished yes that would hinder one speech said the voice which she assumed to be dumbledore lightly well miss evans we just wanted to inform you when you awoke that giving you a healing potion is out of the question if you were at full health we wouldntbe able to keep you from trying to run again despite all of the enhancements made to your room lily would have nodded mockingly if her fear of the pain wasntso great who knows said bones maybe someday you ll willingly spy on voldemort for us lily tried to sit up at that moment but the combined pain and panic caused unconsciousness to overtake her senses again mum wontmind if i stay with you a few days pick me up by floo at 3 00 on the 22nd if you can love nymphadora tonks finished sirius folding up the letter and setting it on the coffee table we should go get her it must be near three already said remus it was at that moment that the clock struck one two three four sirius growled a very colorful swearword and leapt to his feet the marauders raced to the fireplace in the hotel kitchen and grabbed a handful of dull floo powder 3712 leather lane said each boy as they entered the emerald flames like evans eyes thought james suddenly he ignored the thought as he spun around in the fire traveling rapidly to the muggle neighborhood james fell onto sirius who was staring up at tonks in fear her hair was stormy gray and her eyes were the bright intense yellow of lightening you re late remus fell out of the fireplace on top of james who was on top of sirius and the three heads all looked guiltily up at the young girl sorry nymphie said james we just got your letter he trailed off i wouldntargue said ted tonks nymphie father with a grin she been stalking around the house getting all worked up because you werentcoming and you gave her a whole hour to get mad the metamorphmagus picked up three water balloons from a leather chair with a wild grin on her face and a gleam in her eyes sirius groaned not my hair he whimpered you ll hair ll be first tonks growled run yelped sirius shaking james and remus off his back the three boys ran through the house before breaking outside sirius ducked a big red balloon and laughed you missed nymphie the next balloon burst right on his head i hit he said dramatically save yourselves james and remus exchanged a glance looked at the high fence that blocked the muggles view of what happened in tonks yard and pulled out their wands i ll get nymphie said james softly tonks squeaked and ran to the back yard james gave chase as remus sent a jet of freezing water at sirius the girl in front of him was fast very fast she looked over her shoulder and lobbed her last water balloon over her shoulder at him it smacked him square in the chest as james began contemplating nominating her for seeker once he had graduated she stumbled over a muggle water hose james shot a blast of water at her but tonks rolled on the coarse grass and grabbed the end of the hose the force of the blast of water made james drop his wand it cold out here and that not helping he growled picking up his wand you re in for it the ensuing water fight was grand enough that it remained in the marauders memories forever finally the freezing drenched quartet retreated indoors and collapsed by the roaring fire andromeda tonks tonks mum passed around mugs of hot cocoa thanks mum said tonks taking a sip of the scalding drink wands said andromeda holding out her hand once she had all of the marauders wands firmly in her hand she said you can dry off the old fashioned way tonks sighed and looked into the fire the crackling flames reflected off of her eyes i wish lily could hang with us she having winter break with voldemort james flushed if you re going to spend christmas with the order then you need to know something about lily evans he said le le le le le le le le le lele lelelelelelele lelelelelele le le l severus for the first time wondered it he had made a mistake in turning lily in to severus finding a place where he could help was the best thing that happened to him from the snape house to nightshade manor to the evil infested slytherin house this hotel that served as order headquarters was the only place where severus could actually help someone with no reward in mind but lily seemed not to feel the same surely lily could see how great of an opportunity this was not only did they offer escape from the dark lord but also letting her aid in his downfall they gave her the chance for revenge against her parents murderer the man who had forced her to become a killer too if it had been him severus would have given dumbledore every drop of information he had not even contemplated escape she had been so anxious to escape that she had tried to leave a room with bones dumbledore and moody watching her so anxious was she to get back to get back to a man who would kill her as soon as look at her that she nearly died in the attempt knocking sounded on the door to severus room he dragged himself off the top of the bed covers and opened the door coming down for dinner asked emmeline vance kindly her abundant hair was short and curly bound in a low ponytail over her sapphire blue robes severus shrugged and slightly nodded his consent i ll be right down he said looking away uncomfortably oh good i just made some shepard pie and knew it was your favorite vance said a bright smile lighting her slim face severus smiled tightly thank you see you in a minute then the woman said severus closed the door and walked over to the light wood dresser he stared at his pallid reflection in the small mirror picking up a small black comb he ran it through his black hair though certain of his classmates insulted his hair severus liked his hair because it was just one more thing to separate him from his late brunette father the comb slid easily through the long curtains of hair and severus realized that his hair was getting too long instead of cutting it which would have been disastrous severus conjured a small black hair bow and tied it in a low ponytail he straightened his black robes and turned to the door his long cloak hit a lamp and it nearly fell but the lamp caught itself a panel on the wall slid open to reveal a tall mirror that was engraved beautifully he stepped towards warily he halted in front of it staring into his own black eyes suddenly as he shifted to face the mirror the image changed he saw himself standing with lily laughing and grinning this was not the only surprise both of them were tanned and the dark mark was nowhere to be seen on his bare arm severus gazed at it longingly for what seemed a mere second then shook his head and left the room at a brisk walk eager to leave behind the future that could never be his room was safely on the second floor apparently they did not want him near lily the clatter of silverware on dishes informed him that dinner had begun maybe he had stared at the mirror longer than he had thought the teen swooped into the kitchen silently headed for his normal chair at the end hello severus said emmeline vance amiably severus glanced over at her and softly said hello though still shaken by the mirror ah hello mr snape come sit here and try the creamed spinach it really is delicious dumbledore said gesturing to the last seat of the clumped order severus sat down quickly aware of moody suspicious presense across the table what he doing here asked a voice from down the table severus looked up sharply and stared at lily metamorphmagus friend who was staring at him with wide amber eyes he in the order too muttered potter severus shoveled some shepard pie onto his plate and ate quickly anxious to get back to his nice quiet room who else is here asked tonks with a laugh malfoy severus growled under her breath making sure that dumbledore couldnthear it lucius was always the most supportive of muggle torturing of all the death eaters he also happened to be engaged to the beautiful narcissa not that severus cared of course nope he the only slytherin here said black calmly moving his head so the small bell on his father christmas hat jangled dumbledore looked over at black and said reprimandingly referring to someone by their house is not fair you all go to hogwarts but slytherins are evil gits said black gruffly dumbledore apparently didnthear him and severus ignored black and are his last of food severus rose i ll retire early tonight he announced to anyone who cared i should be going up too said moody quickly levitating up plate and glass and limping to the stairs severus and moody walked up the stairs together neither speaking severus knew that the only reason moody had left the table was so that he could make sure severus didntgo break lily out or something night snape grunted moody leaving severus at the second floor severus watched the auror limp quickly up the stairs with narrowed eyes if he had known moody was going to be lily guardian severus would never have turned her in pushing those thoughts out of his head severus entered his room and cast one last glance at the strange mirror before going to sleep not wasting my time looking up again she said that my begging for reviews was disgusting which is almost as funny as if you had said icky but that got me thinking how many less people will review if i dontbeg and or threaten well only one way to find out if i get equal or more i wontbeg any longer and the disgusting reviewer can strut away feeling all proud l or if i get a little less i ll just politely ask for reviews at the end if the amount of reviews i get for this chapter is signifigantly lower then i can threaten with the consistency of a drug lord voldemort then t hat reviewer can go do something that i would rather not post of fanfiction for fear of massive repercussions thanks for all the reviews alastor sat in the observation room watching the stunner sleep her bed faced him so that he could be sure that she wasntjust faking the injuries most people hit with four stunning spells would be dead but the stunner had a strong endurance instead of normal meals the kitchen had supplied different types of soup for the injured girl the auror leaned back in his chair keeping both eyes locked on the complex creature nearly every death eater they had ever caught spilled information in a flood telling everything from other death eater names to the shop that they ordered their official robes from of course when dealing with death eaters the information would vary from one to the other each would claim to never have done anything wrong while the others would tell tale after tale of what that person had done the stunner tried to roll to one side in her sleep but she let out a whimper and her shockingly emerald eyes flashed open alastor watched her take deep steadying breaths flinching almost imperceptibly with each movement of her chest despite himself alastor was impressed his pupils at the auror academy had been trained not to show pain but when the time came few could keep their feelings in check this girl not yet graduated from hogwarts could ignore pain with the best of them he could guess that though voldemort inflicted much pain the dark lord did not respect those who showed it from his limited experience with voldemort showing pain only caused more to be dealt if the pain was not openly acknowledged men like voldemort lost interest evans would make an amazing auror if she wasntalready completely devoted to lord voldemort they couldnttrust her alastor watched the eerie mark of salazar trail down her hand lazily entwining between her long slim fingers the stunner opened one eyes and sent an emerald glare down at the tattoo on her hand the faintest growl was picked up by the auditory sensors and suddenly a dark layer of red fur covered the tattoo the girl let a small smile light her dark lips as she drifted into sleep then again alastor thought maybe she not as devoted as she acts professor may i have a word severus asked his reflection in the normal mirror no that wontwork erm professor i found something in my room no he put a hand to his head and walked back over to the strange mirror and sat on the floor in front of it inside he and lily were laughing and chatting amiably severus smiled tightly when he saw the wedding band on his reflection hand instinctively he knew that his wife in this alternate future was narcissa black though not a strand of her white blonde hair showed in the mirror he jumped as a loud knock sounded on the door snivellus can i come in said a voice outside severus cringed he hated that voice no go away severus said sharply keeping his eyes on the mirror the friends in the mirror kept laughing unaware of severus annoyance the door creaked open behind him i told you to go away potter severus hissed not turning from the mirror you know came another voice staring at a mirror doesntmake the reflection any better this got severus to turn around first his eyes flicked to the wand that was resting on his bedside table then to potter and black who stood just inside the door he slowly got to his feet severus glanced over his shoulder at the mirror the laughing friends waved cheerily at him what do you want he hissed venomously glaring at the two marauders actually said potter stepping in front of black we came to ask you some questions about evans severus raised an eyebrow you may ask but i might not answer um let take this elsewhere shall we potter just walked farther in nice room he commented interesting mirror severus quickly started for the door let go he heard an amazed gasp from behind him and groaned snape does this tell the future asked potter from behind him severus turned to see potter staring dumbstruck at the mirror that depends what do you see evans and i married then no it doesn t said severus curtly it just your dreams now i believe you had some real questions for me the other boy just stared stupidly at his reflection shove over prongs i want to see black pushed potter sideways and took his place before the mirror his face hardened and he smiled coldly it figures of all my dreams this is the strongest what do you see potter asked curiously i ll tell you later he muttered casting a wary glance at severus actually i was on my way to tell dumbledore about it would uh you like to join me severus asked anything to get them away from his mirror black gazed a moment longer then turned stonily to the door severus sighed and said i guess potter not coming black turned back let out a growl of frustration and went back into the room the only gryffindor black grabbed potter by the arm and pulled him forcibly away from the enchanted mirror may i see her please tonks pleaded moody the auror shook his head firmly once more why not she whined she very weak moody informed her gruffly the stunner gets very angry very quickly and it may cause permanent damage i promise i ll be quiet i just want to see her tonks said with wide beseeching blue eyes accompanied by the short blonde hair she had given herself she succeeded in making herself look an angel moody grunted dontstay long he turned his attention back to his cup of coffee scream if you need help he leaned over and pressed the unlocking button for the door to lily cell thank you said tonks with a wide smile she raced out of the observation room before he could change his mind lily she asked softly as she entered the room no sound came from the bed tonks knew from what she had seen in the observation room that lily was asleep on it the metamorphmagus tiptoed over to the sleeping form of her friend are you awake she sat gingerly down in the hard wooden chair by her bed and looked at the girl lily was even paler than usual and her blood red hair was limp and greasy it me tonks lily eyes snapped open and flicked to the side still unable to see her lily rolled her head slightly to the side tonks saw her grit her teeth and wondered how much pain her friend was in fury flashed in lily eyes when she saw tonks and she rolled her head completely to face the other direction tonks straightened indignantly in her chair i came up here to see you and now you re just going to ignore she remembered her promise not to anger lily but if lily was going to get mad then tonks could too by merlin i find out that my best friend is some bloody murderer who works with a psychopath and what does stupid tonks do i go to see her to see if she okay lily head remained turned stubbornly to the side well i guess i shouldnthave worried since you apparently have no heart tonks stood up knocking over the chair and raced out of the room tears burning her eyes which had turned back in her rage as she turned to head down the corridor she nearly ran into moody i promise i ll be quiet he mimicked well well who cares if she gets hurt she the stunner i thought well maybe it wasnttrue and she was still just lily but no she a mean heartless murderer who was only friends with me so that she could kill me from inside the room they heard a blood curdling scream lily could not believe it she was being forced to compete in a one sided conversation with he rex friend the girl had the nerve to tell lily that she had no feelings lily wasntthe one who had been yelling the fact that she couldntyell had nothing to do with it it was the thought that mattered now that tonks had finally stormed out her indignant anger burning rage the grief that she felt at being captured and recaptured the betrayal of her friends and the physical pain that engulfed caused her energies to gather she took a large breath in her battered lungs and let out a scream lily tried to rise from the bed to go and give tonks a piece of her mind or fist then fell back to the bed the protests of her broken body won over those of her breaking mind she attempted to simply slide off the bed each muscle pulled back as she pushed it sideways but she was able to inch sideways annoyed by her slow progress she threw the left side of her body over the right rolling and rolled right off the edge of the bed the pale wood hit hard on every bruised and broken bone and once again unconsciousness consumed her alastor watched as the stunner rolled off the edge of the bed slipping between the sheets and straight to the floor he left tonks to stare at the unconsciousness stunner and strolled to get kingsley shacklebolt hello he grunted as he entered kingsley room across the hall the other auror who was busy doing sit ups on the floor sat up and said hello alastor he rose and rolled her shoulders the sound of cracking tendons filled the room what up the stunner fell off her bed rolled off to be exact kingsley immediately walked past alastor to get across the hall and alastor trailed closely behind when they entered tonks was still frozen staring at her with a look of shock kingsley looked at her closely out cold he decreed they could not simply levitate her as the uneven balance of air could snap something so the two had to lift her themselves blood red hair covered her white face and her body was completely collapsed i ll take heads alastor said he knelt down and put his hands between her robes and the cold floor down the small of her back kingsley supported the rest ready alastor asked three two one lift kingsley said her head dangled as they lifted her so alastor stopped slightly and set it on his shoulder let me get the sheets said a girl voice tonks walked over and pulled the sheets and comforter back from the base sheet kingsley and alastor set the girl onto the soft sheets alastor put her head onto the pillow tonks covered her up with the beige sheets and the floral comforter tenderly who cares if she gets hurt alastor asked tonks quoting her previous words not us that for sure she scowled at his sarcasm and ushered them out of the room forgetting about her previous anger the mirror of erised said dumbledore in amazement james glanced into it once more he and lily were sitting together laughing and talking james knew that the wedding bands on their hands meant that they were married how well it was his deepest wish despite what snape had said james would do anything to make sure the future in the mirror came true dumbledore looked into it from over james head his head cocked and his eyes softened wha began sirius but halted he asked a different question how did this get here you see said the professor we are not the first wizards to use this hotel as a base this used to be the hideout of the smugglers and they kept their wizard and muggle prizes stored most of them were taken away when we discovered this place but i guess we missed a few i ll have this one transported to my gringotts vault immediately thank you for telling me the four boys nodded you all need to clear out for a while severus i ll be finished before tonight so you wontneed a different room someone grabbed his shoulder and he was steered to the door along with remus let go guys said sirius as he pushed them along snape followed close behind once they were out the door and it was closed tightly behind them snape went down the corridor and sirius began to push them down the other way bye snape called remus over his shoulder james turned to see the slytherin freeze halfway down the hall goodbye lupin said the halting voice sirius pulled his two marauding friends to the hallway that contained their three rooms along with sturgis podmore and edgar bones s soon they were all seated in various locations around remus room so said james nonchalantly what d you guys see in the mirror a cure for lycanthropy said remus readily with a weak smile james nodded solemnly sirius stood abruptly and picked up a glass bauble from the wooden chest in moony room he tossed the sparkling glass up and down in the air illuminated by the orange muggle lights what about you padfoot asked remus sirius rolled the ball from hand to hand james realized that however good sirius was at wresting information from others he was still ill at ease when sharing it himself i was proving my family wrong he mumbled suddenly he set down the glass and began pacing how they were wrong about voldemort and muggles and purebloods and slytherins and wealth and about me i hate that mirror because i know that it will never ever happen he averted his gaze for a minute then strode to the door i going to go work out bye the remaining marauders said calmly sirius did some sort of physical exercise when he was worried about something in his own life he preferred to sweat his problems away instead of thinking through them james rose from the couch i ll go check on tonks you coming he asked remus i have a book said remus by way of reply drawing one from his bag let me know when lunch is ready as james headed for the stairs that led down he was hailed from behind he turned to see edgar bones on the bottom stair of those leading up hey james what are you doing hey edgar i just looking for tonks have you seen her anywhere he asked walking over to him she up with lily edgar took a step towards his room then stopped which reminds me listen i need you to answer truthfully do you know exactly how close lily was to voldemort james raised his eyebrows you dontknow bones waited for the answer he adopted her according to the girl herself did she love him like a father bones asked his hazel eyes intense on james from what we know no she was scared of him try asking sni snape he knows her best james informed him and yet you re the one who loves her he murmured james cocked his head in thought i think snape loves her too not in the way i do but i honestly doubt that there a limit to what he would do for her as much as i h dislike him snape was her closest confidante take it up with him i might just do that the anticipation of breaking a case lit a fire in the auror eyes that caused james to realize that edgar truly loved his job edgar bones left walking towards quickly to his room james walked up the stairs his legs were so used to the innumerable stairwells in hogwarts that the mere flight he scaled was nothing his feet led him automatically to the white door of the observation room he went to the door next to it and entered inside tonks was sitting next to evans bed silent and watchful is she awake he asked softly as he knelt beside her chair unconscious she informed him james straightened and looked down on evans her pale face looked void of blood other than a sizable purple bruise over her temple how well er had an argument tonks said softly james brightened she can talk um no tonks averted her eyes but i could tell she was mad at me so i kind of yelled at her then i guess she just sort of rolled off the bed no one was watching so we dontknow whether it was on purpose or not knowing the girl james could guess that it had been are you still mad at her he asked motioning for tonks to scoot over she made room for him to perch on the edge of the chair i feel sorry for her and sad that she was corrupted but mad not really tonks had subdued the color of her hair to a mousy brow noting his gaze she said this is my normal hair i hate it dontyou bright colors are much cooler james did not answer he looked at evans hair which pooled on her pillow like blood of course your favorite color is red right james tonks remarked with a grin seeing his face she blinked blimey you really do like her james nodded did you get her something for christmas james felt his jaw drop um james tonks said with wide eyes christmas is tomorrow go get her something now she said shoving him he toppled off the chair and sit the floor with a thud he scrambled to his feet and ran to the door to his eternal embarrassment he heard moony gravely laughter echoing in the observation room as he leapt down the stairs nearly colliding with the walls at every turn he wondered where he should go to buy the present at the bottom of the stairs that led to the second floor he nearly collided with sturgis podmore where are you off to in such a hurry old chap he asked as james helped steady him i was going christmas shopping he said peering down the hall towards moony room as an adult i can give you official permission to leave sturgis said with a wink you can go as long as you take sirius and remus he started past him then said why dontyou asked snape along with you it d get him out of the way he been wandering around the house aimlessly since dumbledore kicked him out of his room and who knows he may have gifts to buy um okay james replied uncertainly sturgis tipped his hat and continued on james went into remus room the lycan was deeply immersed in a thick novel christmas is tomorrow he exclaimed as he entered remus looked up dontworry i bought your present months ago i not worried about me i forgot to get evans a present you re buying the stunner a christmas present he asked as he dog eared his book and set it into his bag uh james still could not fully grasp that lily evans was the stunner i guess so an approving smile lit on remus face i should too let go find padfoot all right james said oh and sturgis said we should invite he trailed off invite who remus asked as they started down the hallway er no one never mind he said averting his gaze to the blank white walls of the hotel edgar scoured the house but could find not the slightest trail of his quarry as he rushed by kingsley for the umpteenth time the auror said he in the kitchen edgar skidded to halt why didntyou tell me before it was funny to see you running around edgar did not grace this with an answer he strolled casually towards the stairs oh go ahead and run you know you re dying to talk to him it not that important edgar said slowing his pace even more however he only made a few steps before swearing loudly and apparating quickly to the kitchen ignoring kingsley laughter edgar had seen werewolf transformations been nearly devoured by a clan of vampires watched a gargantuan troll pick up a fluffy kitten and give it a sloppy kiss and had met the greatest stunner in the world but nothing could have prepared him for what he saw next severus snape was standing in the center of the kitchen with emmeline vance a long line of white flour ran from his nose to his ear and he was cracking an egg on the edge of a silver bowl now measure a teaspoon of vanilla and add it in said emmeline as snape picked up the small brown bottle edgar said magic would make it a lot easier the boy jumped and dropped the bottle edgar waved his wand and it halted before hitting the ground and floated back up to settle on the counter it more fun the muggle way emmeline informed him as snape poured out the vanilla and added it his face flushed in embarrassment edgar walked over to stand beside them what are you making a cake for tomorrow morning christmas isntchristmas unless you have cake for breakfast emmeline told him as snape picked up a whisk and began stirring the batter fiercely amen edgar said heartily but i need to take away your helper for a while okay snape froze mid stir emmeline didntnotice though and said just for a while i was going to get him to help with the christmas pudding edgar pried the whisk from snape hand set it gently in the bowl and steered him out of the room he ll be back in a jiffy now listen to me edgar said the moment the kitchen door had snapped shut behind them dumbledore thinks you dontknow anything else about lily but i do you never actually said you didn t edgar steered him into the hotel conference room and said so spill snape said nothing eyes like bottomless holes if we dontget info on her soon moody will get to use his tactics for questioning and i doubt that that why you brought her here i a slytherin snape said softly maybe that exactly why i turned her in maybe i glad that you re finally caving edgar leaned against the wall and glowered at the pale boy look kid i a professional interrogator do you honestly think i cantsee through that act what act snape asked face completely blank occlumency may work against voldemort snape blinked sharply at the name but the mere fact that you re using it shows me you re lying maybe i always use occlumency he retorted softly i bet my wand that you werentusing it in the kitchen baking a christmas cake oh and you have some flour right there edgar said savagely indicating the location on his own face snape wiped at it quickly brushing the flour from his equally pale face now why does lily have the mark of salazar edgar asked i was recruited after she had already gotten it snape told him standing completely still in the center of the room but you know cried edgar in exasperation snape started for the door i have better things to do than listen to your ramblings oh yeah i forgot the big bad slytherin has to go bake a cake is there going to be pink icing on it edgar asked with a sardonic laugh the twisted reason of a teenage death eater was going to keep edgar from making the discovery of the century and it did not sit well with him the slytherin didntstop or retort but simply slinked out of the room have you wondered why severus hasnttried to break lily out yet well those of you who have will really like the next chapter where we make some interesting discoveries please review i do not like snape however i like severus so he will be lily friend in this story get over it seeing as i like his so much he can give my disclaimer severus miss cylobaby does not own harry potter or anything created by jk can i go now i need to go kill off another favorite character cylobaby bad severus you re good in this story good do you understand chapter 3 snape lily awoke the next morning at dawn as usual the moment the sun peeked over the horizon lily eyes shot open she lay in bed resting thinking last night events had kept her awake in thought until 3 in the morning the little girl has reminded her of a child she used to baby sit that toddler she had been responsible for killing probably had had the same carefree attitude same love for life it seemed a lifetime ago that she had sat in their house and played barbies with the little veronica she could hardly imagine her self laughing with a baby of course hers was not the first death that had struck a cord hers just happened to be on the same night that other things had happened to mess with her nerves voldemort had as good as adopted her he had thought her worthy of being an heir of slytherin for all that she was a muggleborn gryffindor he often claimed fondly that if he had gotten a hold of her before her sorting that she wound have been placed in the pure house lily had had no choice but to accept his offering if she was ever to escape him she needed his complete trust the thought of escape was what kept her going escape from voldemort escape from the groveling cowardly death eaters escape from her bonds escape from her feelings escape from death someday someday she and the one she loved would be safe a knock on the door drew her out of her trance come in lily called imperiously stowing her thoughts away for later scrutiny a little bald house elf with a long nose poked her head in master would like lady velisna to accompany him for breakfast now lily nodded and said thank you primplen tell the dark lord to expect me in ten minutes primplen bowed so low that her abnormally long nose brushed the soft green carpet as you wish miss she exited the room without another room lily slipped out of the silver covers and glided over to her dresser instinctively masking her weariness she pulled a set of black robes with a black undershirt and flexible pants right before lily pulled on her shirt she saw her serpent tattoo gazing at her its emerald eyes causing its silver thin pupils to dilate in the light it too looked like it had just woken up with an audible sigh she covered it with her strict black shirt the girl stepped into her black pants and pulled her robe over top she slipped on a pair of jet black tennis shoes and went to the mirror in it she saw a pale girl of about 5 foot 8 lily had waist length auburn hair and bright emerald eyes that were surrounded by thick dark red lashes lily looked closer at her eyes curious as to what they showed eyes were lily obsession she had a habit of looking into eyes trying to sense their thoughts the emerald orbs were fathomless seemed to show no emotion and yet every emotion lily knew her eyes were the window to her soul so she often tried to keep the shutters closed her body was lithe and fit perfect for silent murders at midnight she was one thing that didntgo bump in the night she had gone through intense training over the last few summers to keep her ready for anything that may come her way she had the reflexes of a cat and disdain of one too she picked up an ebony comb emblazed with the slytherin arrest and brushed it calmly through her abundant hair the action calmed her and cleared her weary mind when it was free of knots lily pulled into an impeccably perfect sleek ponytail lily strode out the door leaving herself two minutes to get to the breakfast room she glided down dark corridors comfortable with the spooky portraits and eerie silence the nightshade mansion was unplottable in the center of a massive forest had more anti muggle anti apparation and booby traps than stars in the sky it had high ceilings and all the walls were different shades of green elaborate vs covered the rooms in honor of the master of the mansion lily entered the breakfast room casually ah lady velisna exactly ten minutes the hissing voice that came from in front of her was expected of course whispered lily she began to make her to her usual seat at the opposite end the long table from voldemort the dark lord held up a tan hand to halt her sit beside me we have company today obviously they arentas punctual as you lily changed direction mid step and settled down next the dark lord they sat in silence for the next five minutes suddenly the door creaked open and revealed a man standing behind what appeared his son both had black hair and hooked noses the boy looked familiar but lily couldntplace how at the moment the man was heavily tanned and had a naturally mean expression on his face the teen on the other hand looked as though he stayed inside as much as he could lady velisna i would like you to our newest recruit and his father tantakah snape lily nodded regally to them and looked back to voldemort master we live only to please you declared the man his son remained silent but lily had a feeling he had nodded from behind her voldemort waved lazily at a pair of chairs that were across from lily the dark lord himself sat at the coveted head of the table the snapes sat down uneasily at least the man tantakah did his son showed no emotion either way lily caught his black eyes with her green ones and detected his great skill in occlumency he seemed to notice the same in her and they looked away simultaneously a group of house elves entered and set the food on the table pitchers of water were beside every cup and the layout of sizzling bacon eggs and sausage was exquisite lily and her adoptive father ate little just enough to sustain them until the noontide meal tantakah snape however ate as much he could grab and his son did likewise but with more elegance once they had all finished voldemort said to lily the snapes will be staying here for this week show them around the mansion however i must now take my leave i ll see you at supper velisna lily nodded and the dark lord swept out of the room she stood up and motioned for the duo to do the same follow me she whispered the girl led them first to the ballroom this is where we gather if there is a meeting of more than thirty after allowing them to look for a moment she turned down a down a dark hallway that led to the banquet hall tantakah spoke up so it lady velisna now is it last time i checked you were just a lucky mudblood named lily evans lily ignored the jibe about her heritage with difficulty for tantakah had been there the day they had killed her parents instead of retorting she hissed fiercely glad to have someone to vent her anger on to i suppose the dark lord decided that his adoptive daughter should have a title a stunned silence followed then tantakah scoffed i doubt the dark lord would ever associate with you any more than necessary lily gave a short mocking laugh that caused snape to shiver slightly she whispered ask him if you dare tantakah nodded i will he then swooped off in search of his master leaving her alone with his son lily smirked slightly she knew that once he interrupted voldemort he would pay dearly not with his life but he probably wouldntbe out of bed for the next few days arentyou supposed to be a gryffindor asked the boy causally his black eyes fathomless it suddenly struck the name snape had seemed so familiar well severus i suppose not everyone is who they appear to be lily murmured indeed severus snape had always struck as a quiet boy never finding an ally against the bullies that taunted him constantly lily had in fact been itching to call him snivellus as was his nickname in school just as revenge she had once tried to help him but he had been more ungrateful than she had first expected i guess not he said as quietly probably with the same thoughts on her as she had had on him lily motioned for him to walk with her i will still show you the mansion even if your father decided to desert us to disrupt the dark lord he just might be forgiven for his lack of faith lily led him to the banquet hall in silence the spacious room was full of tabled and benches for the use of any death eater the cavernous hall echoed everything eerily causing their footsteps to seem louder than normal severus walked forward to inspect a table on a hunch lily silently drew out her wand and whispered legillimens she was in before he had time to react memories flooded into her severus was watching his father yelling at his cowering mother and felt loathing rise inside of him the marauders were taunting him daring him to respond with their wands at his throat he watched his father talking to the dark lord about the need to exterminate all muggles disgust hatred and an acute sense of being trapped filled his body an image of lake came up but before lily could see the memory she heard a panicked voice shout protego lily brain registered what was about to happen just before she was hit now it was her own memories the ones she had learned to ignore that flooded through her lily made the choice between the death of herself and her sister or being a death eater lily watched the dark lord torture a muggle child for amusement then looked away in masked repulsion panic rose inside her and she quickly stopped the flood of memories by throwing up steel blockades around her mind severus lay panting on the cold floor looking up at her with triumph in his weary black eyes lily whispered frantically i wonttell if you don t severus nodded as though she had just spoken his thoughts out loud are we the only ones who think this way he asked casually though his eyes betrayed his true hope obviously having his mind examined by an outside force had made his shields weak none within the death eater ranks all are totally faithful to the cause i had been all alone in my beliefs until i realized you thought the same way severus looked up at her tearing his eyes away from the floor and said incredulously you knew before you read my mind how ignoring the second question lily murmured only muggles talk of mind reading the mind is not a book to be opened at will and examined at leisure thoughts are not etched in the inside of skulls to be perused by any invader the mind is a complex and many layered thing how he repeated cutting her off though he had seemed to be absorbing what she said lily sighed not only did you give signs that you hated your father thus his ideas too but you also kept your mind shields up during breakfast seeing and correctly interpreting severus glance at the open door she whispered dontworry i doubt the dark lord would have paid enough attention to notice just dontturn your back on him severus nodded hesitantly obviously unnerved that a girl a gryffindor girl no less was giving him instructions on how to trick the dark lord voldemort into believing he was faithful come on i still need to show you the other 125 rooms in the mansion lily and severus met secretly the rest of the week they were often to be found in the nightshade mansion kitchens talking over a hot meal tantakah snape still hadntrecovered lily had been right in assuming that he would be painfully punished so many hexes had been placed on him he had been unrecognizable at first his being stuck in bed allowed severus and lily to meet without drawing his attention lily had discovered that severus was much like her he too had no choice but to serve voldemort disliked seeing death and torture was skilled at occlumency hated the quartet of gryffindor boys self named the marauders and normally stayed emotionless which was easy around the also emotionless death eaters lily wondered if she could stay that way if she met someone perky lily had come to think of severus as a friend almost a brother over the few days she had known him she hated to admit that she was so needy of friends that her only one had been met through mutual mind reading and the fact both of them had dirt on each other that neither wanted revealed to the dark lord not that she minded having severus for a best friend she just wished she had led a normal life it had startled how happy she had been to finally have someone she could act herself around she could vent when she was angry and not have to worry that the dark lord would hear though she would never be skilled in talking about her deeper emotions she could still show when she was confused which was not often annoyed or just plain furious one morning as they sat alone in the kitchens chatting about the founders a pair of regal looking owls swept through the open window which was high enough to dissuade eavesdroppers seeing as it was on the third floor each dropped a latter at either severus or lily plate and flew away just as swiftly as they had come lily calmly ran a short yet sharp nail over the top and pulled out a thick parchment before she read the letter she caught sight of the envelope in bright emerald ink lily d a evans large bedroom in west wing nightshade mansion liverpool it a good thing dumbledore doesntknow the function of the mansion thought lily wryly ignoring the base letter lily picked up her list of supplies each item was already owned by the girl other than the optional gryffindor scarf and the books she excused herself from severus who nodded in understanding and headed to voldemort planning room a small dark chamber on the second floor lily knocked cautiously on the thick door i busy hissed the dark lord from inside my lord it is li lady velisna i received my school letter i just wanted to let you know i need to go to diagon alley soon lily said before turning to leave ah lady velisna come in i ve been meaning to speak with you the reply surprised lily but she entered anyways lily tried to open the door pulled out her wand unlocked it and entered voldemort was seated at a circular table in the center of the dimly lit room papers littered the table some in strange colors foreign languages or blueprints lily looked away form the building sketches uneager to know which location would be invaded next what do you think of young snape he asked as soon as she looked up at him i think he will be a welcome to our ranks he has the will and courage he would make a good spy lily said honestly she knew that if she gave any sign of being more than acquaintances with severus he would be killed immediately for the dark lord believed friendship was weakness hmm i think i would first like to test him to see if he could be a field agent meet me in the challenge room after dinner good day voldemort said before returning his gaze to the parchments in front of him lily went back downstairs to warn severus about the arduous test he was about to go through thank you for the reviews i like where this story is going and i hope you do too this chapter is dedicated to both danni and hazel for going through and taking the time to review every single chapter i love you both so much i swear that made my day so this is for you d you think she d like this asked james holding up a set of dress robes uh no said remus with a smile remus had already purchased lily a gift had it approved by sirius who was the girl expert and had it wrapped james examined the robes frothy lace spewed from the neck and sleeves complementing the pale pink color nicely didntgirls like that sort of thing can you even imagine lily in that remus asked with a sigh lily is the you know and she doesntwear pink seeing james picking up a lacy blue number he added or lace or kittens like on that stupid mug you wanted before james groaned and put the robes on the nearest rack then how am i supposed to know what to get her figure it out said remus listen you ll have to shop on your own we promised to meet sirius at the beetle brow in three minutes but what james stopped remus was already out of the door walking down the street a store assistant strolled up to him a fake smile firmly in place do you need any help she asked uh i trying to find something for one of my friends the dark haired woman looked at the row of shelves to his left how tall is she she asked him um five four maybe five five james hazarded and complexion pale james told her firmly the woman turned away from the bright colors she had been looking at and moved towards the pastels what color hair does she have red what shade the lady asked as she picked up a set of robes to inspect it carroty ginger red like bloo brick red james told her the lady dropped the pale orange robes she was holding did you consider jewelry she asked why not robes james asked for a pretty little lavender robe had just caught his eye the worker sighed trust me now i not really supposed to do this but she snatched a piece of parchment off the counter go here you ll find what you re looking for james left linens covered with lace emporium then read the slip finkhousen jewelers go left then right then rt again tell them that jessica malkins sent you james started left clutching his cloak tight in the december wing the shopping plaza which was in the center of liverpool was crowded with wizards doing last minute shopping as he strolled along james wondered if evans would even care if james got her a present the more he tried to show that he cared about her the more she seemed to loathe being near him there was no way that she could have managed to get anyone anything for christmas and she probably wouldnthave if she had the chance maybe he should just give up however the moment he escaped the frosty december air by entering finkhousen jewelers he felt immediately certain that she would like his gift the store was small lit by a magical golden light that seemed to emanate from the ceiling there was a worker at each counter and nearly all of them were working with a harassed looking costumer may i help you sir asked a man behind the counter jessica malkins told me to come here to buy my friend a present james said oh jessie sent you asked a different worker the blonde girl motioned james to walk over to her counter as he did she said she only sends over the really hopel important ones well what are you looking for any ideas by her smile james could tell she knew what his answer would be i have absolutely no clue james said with a defeated sigh the girl smile widened she seemed to enjoy the promise of a challenge describe her to me looks attitude everything well she short with red hair and green eyes that glisten like emeralds and skin that shines as pale as a full moon she quiet but spirited and very beautiful he finished uncertainly the worker pondered for a minute tapping her chin with a red and green nail silver or gold james blinked well we re both in gryffindor you re from hogwarts the girl asked delighted i just graduated two years ago i was in ravenclaw so well who knows maybe i know your girl her name lily evans james told her man i should have guessed that when you said red hair she was in my advanced ancient runes class that was like one of her best subjects i think remember that fight you two had by the lake i was studying for my n e w t s but that was great comic relief as she spoke she pulled out a long necklace from her counter what about this james stepped forward and looked closely at it it was a long gold chain that was finer than any he had seen it seemed thinner than floss dangling from the chain was a gold heart charm which had a small diamond in its upper left hand corner i was thinking small charm and long chain so that she could hide it under her robes and stuff the girl said what do you think it perfect james said slowly the girl laid it on the glass counter lazily she glanced at the price tag ouch she muttered that is a serious amount of zeros she looked up it goblin crafted guaranteed not to break and charmed against theft but that means it expensive she held out the price tag for him to see he shrugged charge it to my mum vault he said handing over the gringotts card as he signed all the warrantees james could not help but sigh over the necklace she could love it wrapped the person who was packing up the necklace in gold paper please he said as he handed it over minutes later he was walking down the dark street the bag with lily gift tucked under his arm against the chill wind lily doesntreally well i mean severus searched for the right words she doesntwant to love the dark lord she wants to hate him and kill him but she doesn t finished bones with an understanding nod moody interrupted if she wants to hate him so bad why doesntshe it makes no sense the dark lord has been her father for over five years he given her everything she ever wanted all for the small price of murder moody muttered from his corner severus bristled lily has never killed anyone he spat actually to my knowledge she never used any of the unforgivable curses but it was her fault that they died bones said she as good as killed them lily had to help the dark lord severus hissed we should be glad that he never made her murder but she did bones began and exactly why did she have to help voldemort moody growled dumbledore knows that severus said why dontyou ask him and say what that we were interrogating you because you were hiding stuff from him and that you were using rosake drought and when are you going to tell him then he ll ask how you learned all of this severus said by that time lily will have told us herself edgar said confidently oh really severus drawled with a smirk what makes you think that bones looked annoyed once we know everything about her we can find the way to draw information out of her oh please dontflatter yourself severus whispered harshly the more you know about her the more freaked out she ll get she wontsay a word past what did you just say what ll you do when she refuses to talk my handcuffs will take of that moody growled ice raced through severus veins but the fire of fury was in his coal black eyes he flicked his eyes back and forth from moody to bones in barely restrained panic you said you promised that you wouldnthurt her already a plan was formulating in his mind he would run to lily cell and carry her out then they d apparate to brazil in a second he was at the door of bones room bones and moody seemed to finally realize what was happening for moody stepped in front of the door and bones jumped to his feet wait bones instructed severus ignored him and stepped close to moody if these aurors were going to go back on their word severus would not remain there any longer looking into moody gnarled face severus felt fury like none before this was the man that was causing lily pain using lily advice he allowed energy to flow through him then imagined it coming from his fingers a blast of pure energy slammed into moody and knocked him against the door knocking him out 1 severus bones sharp command made severus pause slightly he could feel his energy waning due to his use of power he didntmean it alastor just says stud you know that we promised she d be okay stop worrying and trust us come back here so we can talk severus cast moody prone body a glare and then walked back over to bones sit down bones said i d rather not the slytherin hissed bones shrugged i not going to make you now give me the short story name one thing that shows their bond one then you re free to go he made lily secret keeper of death eater headquarters severus said impulsively on seeing bones expression severus immediately wished he could take the words back bones stood up quickly blinked and sat back down she s wait what severus shrugged lightly hoping bones really hadntheard secret keeper muttered bones perfect he exclaimed by catching the stunner we ve basically caught all the death eaters he stopped with an awed look on his face by catching the stunner we ve basically just caught voldemort severus began inspecting his short nails one problem with that he said casually to bones bones seemed too happy to pay attention to severus eh there one little flaw in our thinking severus told him the dark lord made lily secret keeper because she could i dunno keep the secret despite everything she wontbetray him to you severus quickly amended his statement kingsley shacklebolt ran into the room the door slammed open onto moody unconscious form but shacklebolt barely noticed i think she waking up he roared then paused looking down at moody what happened to him no time to explain bones said hurriedly what do you mean waking up she should be asleep until midnight it only he looked at his watch nine thirty did you figure out what was wrong with her the auror asked bones shrugged noncommittally and severus despite himself was grateful all i know is that she shouldntwake up for another three or four hours shacklebolt looked confused well she opened her eyes a few minutes ago bones jumped to his feet and walked to the door as he came to moody body he quickly cast a spell that woke him up moody small black eyes opened wide and he stood up growling where is he he looked fiercely around the room when he spotted severs he took a menacing step forward you we have bigger problems bones said grabbing the collar of moody robes and dragging him out of the room severus said shacklebolt as he tried to follow go down to dinner she fine the slytherin though seriously doubting his words obeyed the auror and headed downstairs one interesting and generally unknown side effect of the rosake drought is that it prevents the drinker from going unconscious at first that doesntseem too bad the only people who say that are those who have never tried it of course very few people will ever take the potion they must be a wizard or witch they must brew dark potions they must have access to a dark potion rehabilitation clinic and last but not least they must have a damn strong pain tolerance the latter is important because taking rosake drought in even the smallest amount is nearly as painful as the cruciartus curse and much more prolonged to take much of the potion without proper training is to forfeit your sanity excerpt from so you d like to heal really quickly by catherine bushe now lily had never read so you d like to heal really quickly nor was she particularly inclined to do so but she could easily have written the aforementioned paragraphs after laying on her cell bed silently screaming in agony for two hours lily could also honestly say that having every bone and muscle in her body aged long enough to heal was the most painful thing she had ever endured the pain stopped abruptly with no warning or signs lily gasped and her eyes shot open she felt energized better than she had felt in years lily stayed still for a minute taking deep breaths then she sat up straight though rejuvenated her muscles seemed weak she hadntused them for a week or so but it felt like it had been months when no one came into her cell after a few more minutes lily swung her legs off the edge of the bed and stood quickly already taking her first step to the concrete enforced door that when her legs crumpled from underneath her and she collapsed to the concrete floor she sat up carefully and looked down at her legs she tried to lift the left one it hovered an inch off the ground while her muscles stretched and ached every tendon in her body screamed with disuse of everything that had happened to her in the past two weeks this disconcerted her the most it one thing to be betrayed by your best friend it a whole other to be betrayed by your own body even while the pain from the fall had stopped her from moving at least she had known that she could have moved if the pain had gone but now lily looked down at her legs which were sprawled on the floor in front of her the last time she had felt this physically helpless was when voldemort had killed her parents as she sat on the floor back leaning against the edge of her cell bed lily was taken back to her parents deaths the smells of the grass and dirt that had surrounded their picnic basket overpowered her nose she could hear the sounds of the death eaters apparating in lily could see the leader take out his wand and with no apparent regret murder her father she could feel the other death eater arms hold her back as the dark lord killed her mother now she fought her own weakened body as she had that death eater strongly fiercely futilely edgar raced down the hall alastor at his side what is the other problem growled alastor as they ran edgar did not answer only turned and started up the stairs alastor stayed beside him a look of surprise on his face she s supposed to be unconscious he panted taking the stairs two at a time edgar lengthened his stride to meet alastor s she a quick healer he said calmly as he jumped up the stairs however he was mad at several things despite his calmness a lily enough said b voldemort enough said c the bloody stairs and d dumbledore for casting a spell so they couldntapparate within a floor of lily room therefore making them run up the aforementioned bloody stairs alastor threw open the door to lily room and they saw her immediately she was sitting on the floor leaning heavily against the bed though trying to lean forward so she could support herself she sat up straight and then fell back against the bed she had not noticed alastor and edgar who were now leaning against the door which they had quietly closed with tears in her emerald eyes she tried again to move to do anything she managed to gather her knees against her chest her arms holding them in place then her arms loosed against her will and her knees fell to the side a tear fell out of her eye as she blinked she finally pulled her gaze away from her legs and saw to a flurry of mixed emotions bones and moody standing just inside the door watching her silently seeing that she had caught sight of them bones walked forward he sat down next to her casually leaning against the bed too she waited for the reprimanding voice telling her how severus was in jail now and that she d be joining him in an hour or two but it didntcome all bones said was your body has been sped through time you ll need intense work outs every day if you want to regain full use of your muscles with that he put a hand on her shoulder the action reminded her so much of her that another tear slipped down her face we can start in the morning he said gently let get you back up the auror put his arm around her waist and lifted her to her feet reluctantly she leaned against him for support together they took a step backwards and sat on the edge of the bed lily moved her protesting muscles back onto the base sheet and bones covered her with the other sheet goodnight lily said edgar as he closed the door to the girl immense astonishment she heard a gruff voice say g night evans as she closed her eyes she figured that moody no longer thought of her as just the stunner 1 he should have turned him into a ferret alright to all of you people who got mad at me well fanfiction was messed up and wouldntlet me upload my chapters on here so this chapter has been written for a while but i just wasntable to update not my fault and last week i was on an island with no computer access i hopefully will be bale to update soon but i in a camp for the next two weeks okay well i just wanted to say thanks to all my reviewers i actually wasntgoing to show anymore of the interview of severus by edgar and alastor but so many reviewers asked for it i had to i really didntthink of that as a cliffhanger but reviewers make the world go round so i obeyed the last part of the chapter starting with the book excerpt was supposed to be in the next chapter but i thought i should make this chapter longer because the next one is like 10 pages christmas comes next chapter oh and sorry for the longest two weeks in fanfiction history the last two weeks of lily life have been going on for like 10 chapters my new goal for this story is 1000 reviews by the end of the fic it supposed to be around 100 chapters review ps in the next chapter we have christmas and either in that chapter or the next we get to meet edgar fiance she very anti stunner so she might just make edgar not trust lily at all maybe i haventwritten that far what do you think oh and before i forget i wanted to ask what you all would do if you were in severus situation you know that you could do something to help your best friend either with voldemort or drugs but they really dontwant help and they ll hate you if you turn them in what would you do another of my life question things for my reviewers to chew over well i officially disclaim there happy cole turner the hot demon lawyer from charmed backs off no dontleave oh and a special note to judge loblaw thanks for the review it nice to know that someone really is anaylzing my story but still likes it enough to keep reading i ll try to find a friend to beta for me i ve gone through two already at first i was worried that you were flaming me but you ended up giving me some things to think about thank you of all the days to sleep in said a voice from above him james groaned and buried himself deeper under the covers nice soft covers james shouted sirius why wontyou get up james refused to budge only snuggling deeper into his plush pillow it christmas james attention had been seized he sat up and said wazzat christmas morning idiot sirius said slowly did you get him up yet remus asked from the doorway his amber hair had been neatly combed to the side and he was wearing a set of dark red robes james rubbed his hazel eyes and shook his head as though to shake away the troubles of the night istmas he repeated uhday oh well sirius sighed then turned from his friend and joined remus at the door i guess i ll just have to take all of his presents a shame really considering we probably got the same stuff james rolled off the bed and said i up i up he shouldered past his two friends to get out of the doorway not bothering to straighten his bed tousled hair uh james remus said the tree in the hotel lobby james nodded and kept walking remus grabbed his arm and pulled him down the stairs this way james mumbled i knew that but his friends paid him no heed i saw mommy kissing santa claus bellowed sirius as he went down he stairs behind them underneath the mistletoe last night they reached the bottom of the stairs and turned right heading towards the sounds of crinkling paper and laughter the moment the three boys got into the lobby they fell ravenously onto the piles that consisted of their gifts thanks padfoot said james ripping away the orange paper to reveal a powder that turned all hair dark pink he then opened a book entitled masterminding pranks by frederick charles syacuse from remus a box of candy each from tonks emmeline and edgar after opening several gifts from people at school he came to a large box in silver and red wrapping the tag said to james from mum and dad seeing that sirius was already in the process of unwrapping his james opened it under the paper sat a gleaming oak box with the words deluxe quidditch set he glanced at sirius who was gazing awestruck at whatever was contained in the box he tapped the heavy gold padlock with his wand please create password after tone beep lily potter he said softly please repeat your password louder he did so and the box opened to reveal a set of quidditch balls along with a signed jersey it was spectacular the quaffle was engraved with dragons the bludgers gleamed menacingly the golden snitch had ruby lining and the jersey was signed by the clint harvise wilbourne wasp keeper sweet closing password accepted said the box nearly snapping shut on his fingers lily potter he muttered tapping the box again and it opened your mum got me the entire collection of creature diaries signed cried remus as he finished opening his last present i love mum said sirius and james together did you give lily her present yet remus asked as he opened book one love first bite james cursed and jumped to his feet and it already ten sirius followed his lead in both the cursing and the standing what about you moony i told edgar to give it to her when she woke up remus replied placidly already engrossed in the novel well you re coming with us anyway sirius pulled him to his feet groaning the lycan closed the book and rested it on his pile of presents lily rested her hands on the bar as instructed now take three steps forward bones continued lily gritted her teeth and told her right leg to move it did so grudgingly achingly it seemed each tendon was asleep and was simply refusing to wake up and help lily along the girl managed the three steps and then put all her weight on the bars she hated this looking and being weak and helpless now another three steps her inquisitor cell keeper and now her trainer ordered lily refused to make any sound as she made her legs move one two three instantly her body tried to collapse but she stood up as straight as she could eyes forward waiting for her next instruction she was going to get better no matter how hard it was after already exercising her arms abs and every other possible part of her body lily was ready to relax of course her training with the dark lord was much more intense but her body had been trained to handle it now with her potion weakened muscles it was like she d never moved in her life it ll get easier bones told her the drought should help you be as good as new in a few weeks knowing you i d say you ll be healed by thursday she finally asked the question she d been dying to ask why are you doing this she panted if you dontwork your legs everything else will have been useless i mean this she said gesturing around the room while one hand pointed she slowly grasped the plastic bar with her other hand for support are you complaining growled moody as he used the chest press he was watching her progress with a beady eye no whispered lily trying not to panic i was just she trailed off there she went again sounding weak what kind of people would we be if we let you become paralyzed bones walked i and stood beside her bars now three more lily complied but on her second step her left leg gave out while her right leg was trying to step the result was that she fell forward the auror was there immediately picking her up and setting her hands on the bars you didnthave to do that she muttered so that moody wouldnthear her could you have gotten up without me bones looked skeptical lily looked away maybe he snorted try those last two steps again lily did so without falling you can go sit down now kingsley can you help her while i go use the leg press shacklebolt set aside the weights he had been lifting and strolled over he took lily arm and set it over his broad shoulders and then helped her over to a table on which four cups of hot chocolate sat the girl collapsed into one chair and the auror pushed it in for her lily looked down at the hot chocolate in distaste all of the powder had settled on the bottom of the porcelain mug and cold dregs of water and milk floated on the top she laid her hand against it and closed her eyes discreetly so none of the aurors could tell she sent a burst of heat into the mug it boiled for a few seconds then was still the cup was burning her pale hand but she did not move it instead she sent a burst of cold magic into the cup with a hesitant finger she poked it the ice stayed firm she sent in some heat again trying to make it just warm enough this time it almost boiled over the top now she was getting frustrated she focused on the cup and thrust magic into that made it swirl violently and mix then tried to send the tiniest bit of cold into it once again it froze over most people just use milk growled a voice in her ear instinctively she pulled her fingers away from the mug as though it was on fire and looked up at moody who scowling down at her shacklebolt looked up just be glad that she didntdo that to you you should ve seen her boiling that thing what thing lily whispered off handedly moody leaned forward grabbed her cup and tipped it upside down a solid cylinder of frozen chocolate fell out shacklebolt deep laugh rolled across the table like thunder though shacklebolt found the situation amusing moody was looking furious lily cast a furtive glance at bones who was completely focused on the leg press without bones to back her up would moody simply kill her aurors were permitted to use unforgivable after all using dark magic in order headquarters muttered moody shacklebolt grinned and poked the ice not very good at it though is she i thought you were an adept moody looked the smallest bit less angry lily shrugged deciding to see where events took it it not like she could run away but what she wouldntgive to make the perfect hor chocolate out of that block of ice then moody wouldntdoubt her abilities what was that moody exclaimed the ice they had been inspecting suddenly melted into a liquid that spread over the table cautiously lily reached out and felt it and found that it was not too hot not too cold she looked down at her hands in surprise she didntknow that she could do that things were happening now f she simply wished hard enough it looks like your strength isntthe only thing that needs training shacklebolt commented i guess we ll have to find someone to help her with that with a sinking feeling lily saw that he was staring pointedly over her shoulder at moody i canthelp her with dark magic he cried i think this is a good thing she has dark magic either way i think it best if it under her control than controlling itself shacklebolt reasoned i hey lily said a voice from the doorway they all turned and looked at severus who was standing just inside the room alastor shacklebolt stood up let me show you that kilenea kick i was talking about earlier but i need to but shacklebolt dragged him away severus sat down next to her and inspected the spilt hot chocolate you didn t he began she scowled and his eyes widened why she shrugged so how it going the training or the imprisonment she asked harshly i just attempted to break you out severus sniffed it almost worked too yeah great plan sarcasm coated her words there were a few unanticipated complications severus shrugged a few she repeated incredulously i can name ten oh really severus sneered go ahead well first rosake drought is administered drops at a time not an entire beaker at once two you put in soup potato soup what kind of potato soup smells like mint three it knocked me out of a few hours which would have given the order plenty of time to figure out the cause even if you hadntgot caught oh yes and that four you got caught five i was in a concrete cell six did you even read about the side effects apparently i need a week of training before i healed which brings me to seven where would i have been healed eight you even managed to mess up my magic nine they have my sister so if i had escaped she might be dead at this moment oh and ten you make an awful spy what does ten have to do with anything severus asked dryly when the last time you contacted death eaters on the last day of school of course severus despite his calm fa ade seemed a little worried ever think that there d be a meeting over christmas ever think he ll be wondering where you were i ll just say i was with you he said confidently and where was i he ll connect you with my kidnapping it elementary lily told him i talking to a dead man how will he know that you ve been kidnapped maybe he thought you died or something severus was now sounding decidedly uneasy the mark would have told him lily said with a shrug let face it if i not out of here by the end of christmas break you re dead that a cheery way to wish someone merry christmas bones commented from behind them lily gasped and whirled around i she right severus voice was casual who says she wontbe back in school come january said bones lightly both teens raised an eyebrow she will severus asked that depends on her he sais lightly sitting down across from lily she raised her other eyebrow will you answer a few questions depends she whispered well first what happened to your voice it not because you re shy is it bones asked lily pursed her lips silencio gone wrong surely voldemort could fix that bones looked incredulous the dark lord liked it better this way she muttered it good for sneaking bones nodded now answer me this and i ll make sure you re back in school when it starts up who is robin at that moment there was a commotion outside the door lily potter raced into the room i got you a present oh that reminds me why i came over here are your other gifts bones said setting a pair of boxes on the table he stood and leaned into her ear we ll continue this later the girl looked towards the oncoming trio they were leaping and hollering like a horde of crazed chimpanzees one two three potter cried we they began harmonizing the note wish you a marry christmas and a happy new year lily sat blinking up at them first she gazed at remus who was grinning lightly then at potter who was grinning like potter at christmastime then she looked at black who had a smile as bright as the silver tassels on his santa hat she stared at him the longest there was something about his smile that made her wonder if he was quite sane dontwe hate each other she whispered to him his insane smile widened we cantlet a little thing like hatred get in our way merry christmas lily potter paid you to do this didnthe lily sighed how about just opening the presents remus chuckled lily was suddenly uncomfortable dontany of you have presents to open she gazed at her pile of presents we already opened ours potter told her lily was disconcerted normally her pile of gifts numbered one a gift from voldemort those gifts ranged anything from a potion to an invisibility cloak now she had no clue what to expect she hadnta real christmas since her first year she looked over the presents carefully open mine first remus held out a box after unwrapping the paper and opening the box it was all she could do not to gasp in delight fudge i found a little candy shop that makes real fudge remus told her try a piece it delicious lily reached out a broke off a tiny piece of the white one with red and green specks she brought it to her red lips and let it sit on her tongue a cool blast of peppermint hit her senses accompanied by the smoothness of white chocolate she closed her eyes feeling as though that one taste had brought peace to the world they re a special soothing candy the one you had was peppermint peace a voice told her lily was still floating on waves of joy it a great de stressor then the taste as gone and all the harsh memories flooded her mind thanks remus you can open mine next if you d like severus gestured to a gift that was obviously hand wrapped by him lily carefully sliced through the spellotape and saw enclosed a thick book simply entitled journal open it severus said softly how lily searched the book it was enclosed completely with the protective leather not a single page showing place you thumb right there severus told her pointing to a slight indent she did so and the book glowed black for a second then returned to dark brown she opened to the beginning pure white parchment with a small brown design in each corner was enclosed in the book and said severus to close it put your thumb back on the spot lily sealed it up that really cool remus inspected it thank you lily told severus open mine black handed her a box lily opened it cautiously for black had given her prank gifts before oh my she whispered as she picked up the gift i thought you d look hot in it black said calmly it was a flowing green set of dress robes with a black lace trim and a trio of pearls clusterd at the lowest point of the plunging neckline it was gorgeous and lily could not think of a single thing to say it must have cost so much she gazed up at sirius with wide eyes then back at the dress robes when will i wear it she asked finally at dinner tonight black said with a grin oh open bones next potter told her hiding his own gift behind his back the auror had given her a thin gold ring with the inscription fire flower on the inside on top was a small black opal lily slipped it on her finger with the hint of a smile now mine potter said handing her the box he stood back and ran a hand through his hair surprised by his uncertain behavior lily slowly unwrapped the gold paper and saw a velvet box inside was the most beautiful necklace she had ever seen it wonderful she murmured thank you potter grinned want to put it on she took it out of it box and clipped it around her pale neck it was even prettier against the blackness of her robes i sorry she muttered the boys all looked at her in surprise i didntget any presents for you i d be a little scared if you had black admitted shuddering so violently that his hat jingled potter ruffled his hair actually he pointed up the ceiling floating innocently over their heads was a sprig of mistletoe do you even remember who you re talking to lily hissed furious okay so she was grateful for the gifts but this was out of the question relax babe potter was smooth i just joshing indeed she waved a hand at the mistletoe aiming to center it over black and potter instead it flew across the room and rested in the far corner lily was suddenly very nervous it wasntthat the corner was particularly frightening actually as far as corners go it was rather plain it was more the two occupants of the corner that made her pale mr moody kinglsey black shouted a gleeful tone in his voice lily gulped quietly look up the two aurors looked at black then simultaneously looked up at the mistletoe moody dove out of the way somersaulting on the floor and safely landing several feet away from the offending herb shacklebolt however threw back his head and laughed hey i brought you guys some cake came a voice from the doorway emmeline vance walked in and set the cake on lily table she noticed shacklebolt in the corner look who all alone under the mistletoe vance flipped her ginger hair over her shoulder with a grin she sauntered over and cast a glance at moody who was still crouched on the floor did alastor desert you shacklebolt nodded with sad eyes aw i ll give you a kiss she stood on her tiptoes and pecked him on the lips merry christmas shacklebolt grinned you made my day he laughed just wait til you try dinner she said leading him over to the table do i have to he looked pleadingly at her i could just apparate to the three broomsticks or something vance smacked him on the arm unsure around all the friendliness displayed by the order lily muttered i like your cooking the woman grinned at her finally someone who appreciates my culinary skills she turned to bones who was approaching i like her me too bones voice was light hey em you know i was just joking right shacklebolt said quickly i didntmean to vance rolled her eyes i know kingsley stop worrying she smacked him on the arm again so anyone up for cake as bones conjured up five more chairs vance began slicing the cake severus gets the first piece because he made it moody grumbled something but she ignored him she set the moist cake in front of severus he picked up a fork and took a small bite wonderful he said dryly we should get an award ignoring his acrimonious comments vance kept cutting who wants to next slice as everyone got their cake lily sat quietly waiting for someone to notice that she was still there and take her back to her cell the girl felt out of place just as severus obviously did and wanted to get back to familiarity as quickly as possible however she made no move to make herself noticed lily found herself enjoying watching the order playful banter it reminded her of christmas with robin petunia always was over at a friend house refusing to eat with the family on the holidays her parents often went on vacations together leaving robin and lily to spend it alone she couldnthelp but think back to the first christmas morning they had spent together after opening their presents robin and lily retreated to the kitchen er can you even cook lily asked her brother as he pulled an egg carton from the fridge robin turned to her running his spare hand through his blonde hair i thought you could robin replaced the eggs isntthat what girls do i eight lily told him and i only thirteen robin retorted and i a guy really could have fooled me lily stuck her tongue out at him robin opened the freezer how about ice cream from then on they spent every christmas morning creating sundae sculptures then devouring them rapidly despite parental warnings and brain freeze hey lily dontyou want some cake black asked as he cut his second slice all of her thinking about robin had put a lump in her throat she swallowed with difficulty seeing how the table attention was on her no are you sure vance hands hovered over the cake we have plenty left lily was suddenly annoyed these were her captors yes i sure her voice was cold and she used occlumency to keep her grief from her face she been working out all morning said bones from down the table i should probably take her back to her room lily nodded briskly and waited for bones to come around and help her up the stairs he did and they walked slowly to the door dontforget your presents black called bones levitated them and let them follow behind they finally reached her room and bones helped her sit on her bed she was panting quietly from the stairs merry christmas bones said heading towards the door wait he paused and turned back at her you you wanted to talk about robin right you can all tell why she said that right well i hope so anyways sorry for the wait i ve had band all week whoa you guys are just whoa i mean i was exagereating when i said double the reviews 45 you all are crazy and i love you for it so this chapter is freaking massive enjoy i must speak with the headmaster nope repeated the gargoyle scratching its head idly y need the p w and she d thought black was annoying i really donthave time for this open if only it would just blow up or something boom pieces of stone and dust rocketed out leaving the staircase clear once on the stars lily waved a hand at the statue returning it to its original state hey you cantdo that it called too late lily muttered to herself before she could grasp the griffin knocker to dumbledore office the door swung open would i be wrong to assume that noise was you lily shook her head dumbly come in lily slinked past dumbledore and looked around in surprise so it wasnta secret torture room however the thing that caught her eye immediately was the magnificent phoenix in one corner its scarlet feathers gleamed innocently in the new light creating a halo around it piecing amber met lily searching eyes and she quickly averted them have a seat miss evans dumbledore gestured to the chair opposite his own bigger one how may i be of service i need to know what this bracelet does she said quickly dumbledore eyebrows furrowed lily kept her face composed i ve been called to meet with the dark lord in fifteen hours i need to know i apologize miss evans i do not know the details alastor created it dumbledore sighed care for a lemon drop well then i already know what it ll do may i be excused lily muttered ignoring the offer for the sweet dumbledore didntlook ready to stop what do you think it will do they ll probably just get a message maybe but let us floo alastor and see lily had to hide a look of panic that will not be necessary headmaster i dontneed to know pish posh dumbledore moved to the large fireplace and took a gold pot into his wizened hands he threw the glistening powder into the blazing fire a wild pillar of emerald flame shot up alastor a word please after a moment or two moody gnarled face appeared in the flames what he asked brusquely looking over his shoulder at whatever scene lay there quickly please albus someone just brought in dolohov i only need a moment miss evans was wondering about the function of the bracelet dumbledore moved aside in a swish violet robes to allow moody full view of the room moody raised the remains of his eyebrows and said are you planning on escaping anytime soon lily swallowed her retort and murmured of course not however i am meeting the dark lord tonight see moody exclaimed see she just stands there and tells us she about to betray us alastor dumbledore blue eyes flashed behind his half moon glasses let her speak he ll want to know where i ve been and i have to give him an answer otherwise he ll discover the truth how moody was such a dolt i dunno torture maybe he has his ways lily kept her answer as ambiguous as possible moody rolled his eyes the whole point is to stop you from leaving school i not sure she has a choice dumbledore said calmly we must accept the necessity of this meeting but i it not like i want to go lily muttered she bit her tongue when moody looked at her floo connection must emphasize noises then why are you going lily briefly entertained the idea of blowing him up i have to give him a reason why i didntcontact him she repeated why not owl him as moody questioned her dumbledore moved back behind his desk and sat down are we bothering you sir lily asked quickly she didntwant to put herself in a position where she had to deal with an irritated moody and dumbledore no no dumbledore smiled lightly please continue lily followed his orders he ll want to talk with me personally lily informed moody just let me take it off this one night with a frustrated growl moody ducked his head out of the fire then in a roar of fire he stepped out of the fireplace lithe form covered in ashes c mere cautiously lily crossed the room to moody he grabbed her hand and waved his wand around the bracelet muttered under his breath lily was frozen as he finished the spell one rule you learned when living with voldemort was not make sudden movements around paranoid wizards especially when they already had their wand pointed at you there it off for the night at dawn the spell returns moody dropped her hand and limped over to dumbledore desk what happened dumbledore exclaimed tripped lily took a slow step backwards i d better get to charms she hinted thank you for stopping by dumbledore said pleasantly and then returned his gaze to moody once out of the warm office lily hurried down the staircase adjusting her bookbag on her back at the bottom she found the statue firmly back in place move she commanded and then looked back up the stairs to make sure they hadntheard her shan t the gargoyle sounded miffed you blew me up well now you re fixed lily replied the gargoyle pushed its back farther into the entrance me left ear crooked now let me leave and i ll fix it promise yes promise you promise yes no need to get snippy the gargoyle moved aside lily slinked past him and moved down the corridor hey what about me ear it was crooked to begin with you great ugly beast however lily didntput it past the statue to tattle to the headmaster so she waved her wand and made the stone ear quaver and tilt up an inch even forgoing breakfast she barely made it to charms in time lily took the empty seat next to peter pettigrew and looked to the teacher professor murphie a tall slim woman with kohl lined cocoa eyes and similar skin morning the professor greeted sipping from a mug in her hands varied greetings were drawn from the class though lily was silent as usual how was everyone break short affirmation in varying degrees of enthusiasm answered murphie eyed the bleary eyed class alright on your feet she said setting down her coffee mug robes shuffled as the class rose now lean to the right lily did so half heartedly she had been up all night unable to believe that she was back in her own bed her body had not appreciated the lack of sleep but still the rosake drought was seeping fierce strength into her muscles she could feel it it was not entirely unpleasant still she knew that it was at a fragile state and that though her magic would continue to increase anything could knock her body down for a while once this roller coaster state of the potion was over though she d be unstoppable she just had to wait to the left lily leaned the other way slowly now jump in a circle while patting you head and rubbing your stomach lily obeyed calmly but let her hands fall to her sides upon realizing she was the only one doing so successfully the marauders on her other side had not even attempted the exercise preferring to chat casually alright back down professor murphie said running a hand through her dark braids once the class had settled she continued now i could bore you with a back to school lecture or we could start on our next unit what d you say next unit said alice prewett eyes bright she must have been extremely caffeinated to be so peppy on the first day back to school after christmas alright now the cutting charm her dark eyes scanned the room jenna pass out the potatoes she said gesturing to a box on her desk this would be easy once lily received her potato she sat back in her chair she would not draw attention to herself by finishing first there was a quiet rustle of pages as the class turned to the number on the board er evans pettigrew asked lily turned to him had the boys told him her secret do you know what the page is lily pointed to the board he flushed and looked back to his book so the marauders hadntrevealed her secret but how long would it take them to another year another hour looking around she saw a few people had already gotten their vegetables sliced lily pulled out her wand made a jerky motion over the potato which obediently fell into small creamy cubes good technique commented murhpie as she strode by how d you do that pettigrew sounded hopeless his plump face was screwed tight in concentration as he poked his wand as the potato which had turned purple ask lupin lily suggested pulling out her potions textbook from her bag she looked in back for the advile potion she had a feeling she would need it after the night once the breathing of her roommates had slowed and evened into slumber lily slipped out of her bed and moved silently to her closet after drawing out the solid black robes from the back and transfiguring a black sock into the uniform white mask she stole out of the room her sneakers made no sound on the rough stone stairs as she hurried down the ubiquitous crackling fire of hogwarts blazed in the hearth casting flickering shadows in the common room evans a head of tousled black hair turned towards her in surprise potter she acknowlged softly continuing to the portrait hole hold up he rose to his feet lily glanced up the stairs to be sure his outburst hadntwoken anyone the slick material of her mask chilled her hand quiet she bit her tongue perhaps she had kept the cool mask off for too long why are you still up i finishing that astrology essay from over the break lily scowled at his words realizing that essays were one more thing she had to do that night if she made it back to the school at all what about you he asked eyes narrowed lily glance at the clock over his shoulder she had ten minutes she turned and moved to push open the portrait hole i ll tell mcgonagall warned potter lily took her hand away and gazed at him silently for a moment if i not back by three tell anyone you d like just wait until then dontdo anything too stupid hazel eyes intense on her still face potter nodded once be careful lily averted her eyes and walked out biting her tongue who there asked the fat lady sharply lily face hidden by her black hood raised her eyebrows get back to bed silently lily cast a memory charm on the portrait before slinking away the school was silent other than the gentle creaking of the walls and the occasional snore of a painting the caretaker heavy footsteps could be discerned a floor below her wand clasped tightly in her right hand and heart racing lily stepped out into the biting winter air the night was cloudless the infinite dark scattered by the clean light of a billion crystals but that innocence was several light years away and nothing but terror filled lily what would happen if she ran right now she d be free lily shook her head sharply to rid herself of the thought she d be hunted by both sides and that wasntthe life she wanted taking a deep breath lily set the mask to her eyes and enchanted it not to move then replaced her hood over her long ponytail the trees all but attacked her as she stepped into the forest tearing branches stretched to rip her thorns pulled her from side to side biting her pale flesh but lily did not flinch the darkness of the woods caused her to scour the trees quickly with her emerald eyes at each noise she finally came upon the field that was the pre designated area for her to meet death eaters just out of hogwarts wards now with all the new recruits a small huddle of people were in the center this she approached making herself hold her head high and her shaking hands still ten nine intones a voice near the center it was a death eater holding a silver chalice at the center of the people eight lily stood at the back of the small group seven she could run six right now five she could be free four forever three she took a hesitant step backwards two she thrust her hand to the center and touched the bottom of the cold chalice one on a rush of color and noise she and the rest of the group were deposited in a clearing surrounded by floating candles all implanted in skulls seemingly relaxed in a dark green throne in the center was lord voldemort dark hair glinting in the faint light as they formed a circle around him the wizard rose languidly my servants he greeted red eyes appraising them the spot you stand shall be yours at my side forever he murmured he didnthave to speak any louder yet lily could see underlying worry in the motions he was looking for her slowly as though out of habit he reached to his left arm and put his hand onto his elbow with a faint hiss lily mark of salazar came to life twisting and running down her arm she felt suddenly compelled to speak to him to return to his side it was irresistible this urge so lily stepped forward out of the circle to kneel before the dark lord his eyes widened slightly go he commanded the rest of the group stunned they did not move do i have to repeat myself his voice was dangerously gentle there was a flurry to conjure portkeys and within a minute the group had gone my lord she muttered head to the grass the cruciatus that hit her made her shrink to the ground trying to draw away from the fire that raced through her body to no avail the unbearable pain slowly withdrew leaving behind a violently biting ache where were you there was anger in voice sharp and clipped though desperation made him talk quickly i needed a break lily tried to keep her voice steady i thought you wouldntlet me go so i went without permission i apologize i put your sister back into her house he said i found her quickly you did not do well at hiding her lily kept her voice innocent pardon she knew he was bluffing trying to get her to break he deserted this train of thought quickly where were you he repeated motioning for her to stand she did so slowly limbs on fire where lily pain dulled mind faltered for a moment i crucio lily fell to the ground again it seemed worse every time biting and burning she could tell him the truth and die right now no more pain she should tell him but then the pain was gone and her resolve strengthened if you dontknow then you re lying he kept his wand focused on her still form the truth my lord we were in america she kept her head down and her mind clear a soft hiss came from above indeed then why could my mark not reach you we must have been under their wards lily said smoothly americans are extremely paranoid why do you refer to yourself as we voldemort voice was too soft i was with snape she murmured the time the pain was anticipated it flooded through her body rendering her muscles useless with pain and he did not tell me the dark lord voice was void of anger or anything but a manic calm he will die no master it was not his fault i forced him not to tell you why snape the dark lord black shoes stopped next to her spilled hair he figured out where i was and confronted me he sharp lily hoped with all her spirit that he would live i apologize again velisna he trailed off i am disappointed lily did not reply focusing on breathing slowly and calmly as though she was not frightened out of her mind now what about the muggle what muggle lily asked softly your sister dontplay ignorant it doesntsuit you he spat i dontknow what you re talking about apparently was too calm for the dark lord to accept it i dontwant to kill you he murmured lily let her breathing grow was ragged as it longed to i really dontunderstand she kept her eyes on the short grass meet my eyes and say that he said carefully lily raised her head high enough to meet his maroon eyes i dontknow what you re talking about she made sure her voice was not overly fearful nor overly confident a dagger slipped into her brain scouring her thoughts she kept her shields around all rebellious thoughts without warning the presence was gone i have decided to take out of hogwarts lily clenched her teeth to stop from crying out what do you say with all respect i fear the headmaster is already suspicious of me if i leave he will know for sure lily hoped that her argument was plausible the dark lord was silent for several minutes under her black robes lily muscles were tense in anticipation you have until graduation he concurred finally not a second more you are wise my lord lily murmured are you implying that i am wise for taking your advice no of course not my lord lily spoke too quickly she slowed down her words i meant every decision you make is wise then you with my decision that you should me married once school ends of course my lord married may i ask who you had in mind my lord a boy of the purest blood i could find lestrange at first i considered breaking off bellatrix and rudolphus engagement for you but decided rabastan was better suited for you rabastan lestrange lily contemplated letting him kill her again indeed my lord stand lily tried to comply the dark lord fatherly affection apparently restored waved his wand to support her to her feet what the matter you just tortured me my lord i did not get any sleep last night and haventeaten today i apologize with the dark lord it was best to tell the truth when possible you canthave enough strength to apparate he realized he waved his wand and one of the candles floated towards them briefly glowing blue get food and sleep vel we will talk later he patted her shoulder lightly you have ten seconds oh and bellatrix told me that you ve been talking to the potter boy don t with that she was pulled away by the candle which extinguished itself on the way to their destination as she landed she realized one important thing she lacked on leaving the dark lord presence the ability to stand the sharp ache of the lingering cruciartus rang through her body in her new position crumpled on the ground lily attempted to crawl forwards to little success how was this going to work lily pulled herself to the base of a tree and put her hands on it to pull herself up instantly there was a flurry of movement on the upper branches as a dozen bowtruckles came swinging down sharp claws extended in a flash lily wand was out pertifying and stunning everything that moved the forest was illuminated by the red flashes and lily realized that she was just outside of the school grounds just a few feet to crawl this train of thought was cut off by a sharp pain in her leg she looked down and saw the twig like creature clawing its way up her black pants which was lying among the leaves silently she stunned it and it fell back eyes glassy in unconsciousness lily looked around the black forest suspiciously with her on the ground like this any creature could kill her if they got close enough undetected the effort of saving her eyes from the bowtruckles had hardly affected her rosake drought enhanced magic but her body was even weaker pain bloomed fresh in each of her body as she pulled herself to her feet she would not be weak lily hissed softly as her body weight moved from foot to foot as she stumbled forward lily bit her tongue why did she go back is this the life she chose going from suspicious group to suspicious group with a few odd tortures thrown in until he was gone yes 3 01 i solemnly swear that i am up to no good black lines spread over the parchments forming corridors and symbols where is she she had sounded so sure james had thought she would never had gone back to him but if not why wasntshe back james looked over the map again there was movement in the slytherin common room the three blacks both lestranges and snape but no lily he raised his eyes and gazed at the fire leaping and burning as sporadically as his thoughts desperately he focused his eyes on the parchemtn again just as he was about to fold up the map and find mcgonagall motion on the edge of the parchment caught his eye every few steps the name stopped and zigzagged from side to side he jumped to his feet picked his wand up off the couch stepped forward moved back and put on his shoes then hurried forward with a curse he turned back and ran up the stairs to the boys dormitory hey mate said sirius but james was already hurrying away silver cloak clutched in his hand who there the fat lady asked as he exited the portrait peered into the corridor suspiciously but shrugged and resumed her conversation with a male portrait james hurried down the stairs cloak fluttering at his heels keeping one eye on the name at the edge of the map james reached the front doors in minutes the name on the parchment was getting closer to the edge of the forest still halting every few steps james hurried through the grounds silver cloak flying out behind him he did not hesitate at the entrance of the looming trees only gathered his cloak tighter around him to keep it from hooking on the thorns he kept his eyes focused on the map his own dot was nearing the other he walked to the right to intercept lily taking off his cloak and tucking the map into his pocket as he did so as the girl staggered into view james called softly to her are you okay a change overcame the girl when she saw him her face became calm and she stood up straighter of course she put her chin up and stepped forward walking steadily if slowly james appraised her scrutinizing every move in the dim moonlight her jaw was clenched and her eyes were wider than normal as she neared him she stumbled and fell james rushed forward and caught her around the waist you call that okay he murmured into her hair i tripped over a root james scanned the leafy ground and found no sign of said root but decided to drop it she would find a different excuse he kept one arm around her waist as he led her out of the forest james wasntsure whether she even noticed if she did or was offended by it it didntshow though brambles tried to hinder their progress by pulling at their clothes james was quick to detach them they walked mostly in silence through the dark forest listening to the creatures of the night absorbed in their thoughts the boy kept his steps small and slow for her careful not to throw her off balance with his movements here james said at the edge of the forest keeping his right arm around her he swept the invisibility cloak over them covered her nod was shockingly timid she was leaning into him steps slower than before he was dying to ask what had happened but felt that she wouldntanswer anyways their coverage of the grounds was at a snail pace each step careful continually james glanced at lily sometimes when he thought of her usually so strong and solid he forgot how fragile she really was james did not remove his arm as he opened the front doors and led lily into the castle the halls were harshly silent compared to the chill outdoors that why james heart nearly skipped a beat when professor mcgonagall in her cat form appeared at the entrance to the second floor corridor they were on the first thing he did was pull lily closer to him under the cloak the second was the thought cats can see through cloaks followed by a word that would have made his mother wash out his mouth lily took an automatic step backwards james pulled her behind a suit of armor quickly the faint sound of movement at the end of the hallway made james hold his breath when no more noises followed he relaxed and became hyperaware of how close lily was she as so beautiful but concern for the girl snapped him out of his thoughts she was paler than usual and the slight tremble in her limbs caused him to murmur you okay yes her voice was almost too soft to hear let go james helped her back out into the corridor and up to the gryffindor tower when they finally entered the common room the clock read 4 27 you sleep now james instructed she shook her head i have to do those essays not going to happen james declared you re exhausted i sure you can get dumbledore to work something out with your teachers she looked ready to argue so james pulled her over to the couch by the fire she melted into the warm leather not worrying about pretenses could you even make it up the stairs lily looked at the floor avoiding his attempts to catch her eye he sighed lily the girl kept her gaze firmly on the ground where were you there was a tightening in her face that put james on his guard lily i thought that was obvious she muttered james wished she would look at him he pondered for a minute on her words you re having an affair with snape arentyou james said dully i knew it that got her attention her eyes met his and she murmured please tell me you re not serious and donteven think about using the pun i wouldntdream of it james replied with a grin and yeah i was kidding i know where you went her eyes which had lit up for that second turned dark again then why are you talking to me it not like you wanted to go she looked surprised at his words eyes widening i sorry he said it not your fault she murmured james wasntsure what the right response to that was so he settled for another apology potter she shook her head softly he looked over her frail form with a careful eye they were having a real almost conversation she must have been in a lot of pain what did he do his words were more to himself than he but she replied anyways the usual i ve had worse that not a good thing james argued with the calm inflection in her voice you shouldntgo anymore if you dontwant to don t it not that simple her voice was lifeless you know that he did i still dontthink anyone should have to do something they dontwant to drop it it already five class is in three hours think you can stand up yet she nodded once and rose to her feet she looked steady enough now go sleep he instructed he watched her steps carefully scrutinizing for the smallest stumble but she made it to the staircase without trouble james watched for a few more minutes to make sure she didntfall down the stairs barely feeling the fire warmth heating his back then he rose and stumbled to his own dorm to get in some sleep before class why was it that every time she d woken up lately it had been to intense pain lily cautiously opened her eyes to see what had woken her up pale sunlight had fallen through a crack in her bed hangings making a silvery gold line across her scarlet comforter up to her face she blinked against the light what time was it lily threw off her covers ignoring the pain in her body and looked at jessica alarm clock it was already noon second day back in class and she had missed her first three classes containing her panic lily pulled on her robes put her hair into a ponytail and spelled the bags under eyes away she didntwant anyone noticing there was something wrong lily slung her bag over her shoulder and walked down to the common room seated by the fireplace were a few sixth and seventh years on their free periods including pettigrew black and two of the js as lily hurried past focused solely on not limping black noticed her lily arentyou in james potions class now oh we didntwant to wake her up jessica informed him lightly we agreed she needed some beauty sleep right girls lily other two roommates giggled black looked surprised at her words you did what god honey you re so cute when you re confused she said poking his straight nose ignoring the picayune girls lily walked out the door towards slughorn dungeon lily slinked into the classroom as the bell rang scouring it with her eyes lily i was worried you d dropped my class slughorn said laughing at his own joke i just overslept she murmured there were two open seats in the classroom potter patted the one next to him but the dark lord warning rang in her mind oh hello lily darling bellatrix drawled as the pale girl perched on the stool beside her how d you sleep there was a wicked glint in her dark blue eyes wonderfully you she replied as slughorn wrote some instructions on the blackboard i amazed that you could considering bellatrix lowered her voice companionably you know no i don t lily muttered chopping the gillyweed if bellatrix wouldntsay it then neither would she oh come on lily she purred the potion called for rat liver next so bellatrix transfigured a beozar into a small white rat it scurried around the table until her knife ended its life we both know he isnthappy with you casually bellatrix cut open the dead rodent speared the liver with her knife and dropped into the cauldron i just trying to help with a wave of her wand the body was gone lily calmly used her wand to clean some of the blood that had splattered onto her potions kit thank you for your concern bellatrix but i still unsure what you mean the slytherin shrugged wiped off her gold dagger and began slicing the butterfly wings the methodic motion of the metal slicing up innocence made lily suppress a shudder i thought you d be dead by now bellatrix confided in lily scraping the butterflies into the fiery cauldron well i not lily stirred the potion thrice counterclockwise barely avoiding being splashed by the temperamental potion as you can see i perfectly fine you should be finishing up now called slughorn lily could hardly see him through the smoke in the dungeon while looked towards him she caught potter staring at her worry clearly shining in his hazel eyes which were discernable even through the haze 1 haze is symbolic for confusion and death as you may be able to tell 1 lily checked the board they needed to add four nightshade berries to the cauldron to turn it green lily reached into her kit pulled out a quartet of scarlet berries and carefully dropped them in now we wait for three quarters of a minutes to stir eight times clockwise lily read out bellatrix nodded her face was lit eerily by the acidic green potion so where were you over the break we ve been over this bellatrix lily kept her voice calm and flat her eyes drifted to the dagger still resting in bellatrix hand that is for him to know she began stirring the potion do you ever doubt the cause she asked suddenly if you do you can tell me and let you murder me not likely of course i do not have doubts my loyalty is greater than yours could ever be mmhmm bellatrix said lazily looking unconcerned bring me your potion called slughorn i dontcare if you haventfinished mr snape the slytherin in question glowered i was trying a better way i sure you were slughorn said airily severus met slughorn eyes and dropped a lacewing fly into the potion in a flash of light it was acidic green and mine only takes four minutes he sneered slughorn puffed up then what were you doing the rest of my class well i tried your way first severus smirked and then i made it better the bell rang over their argument lily took up a flask of their potion and set it on slughorn desk nice she whispered to severus as he passed she moved back to retrieve her bag from her work station bellatrix had disappeared lily waved her wand at the cauldron to clean out its contents and hurried to lunch so like the idea of reviews are equivalent to a half page let me know if more people vote yes than no i ll do it again next time okay everyone this is not the next chapter it actually belongs to the last chapter but i forgot about it so it shortness is actually just part of the last one longness the chapter that is payment for reviews is coming soon james spotted her the moment she entered the great hall red hair glistening in the sun she was as pale as she d been in the previous period just as dull eyed he gestured for her to join him and his friends but she sat at the end of the table as before he wondered why was she sticking near the exit or was she avoiding him have you finished your charms homework for tomorrow asked peter as he sat down james pulled his eyes away from the girl and said yeah go ahead he took out his notebook and drew out the homework peter took it from him and began avidly copying down answers you know you ll fail the test if you do that remus reprimanded peter looked up but i dontget it that my point i can tutor you then you will get it and pass remus explained peter face lit up tonight remus faltered uh actually pete i have that guidance thing tonight we can still do it tom no wait i have patrol we can practice on thursday night but the test is on thursday peter mumbled did you see lily today james asked remus she wasntin herbology or arthimacy the lycan said looking thoughtful as he but into his turkey croissant she came in during potions right yeah james looked over at her again i know what happened said sirius darkly as he settled between remus and peter is she okay james asked quietly jessica turned off her alarm scowled sirius remus frowned why i dontknow and i dontcare sirius bit savagely into a chicken leg igou er he said through the bite what james asked sirius swallowed and repeated quietly i broke up with her sorry mate james sympathized though he knew that their relationship had been off and on for a while sirius laughed roughly she telling everyone that she broke up with me because of he gestured to his new blonde hair werentyou going to ask murphie to fix it remus asked hurriedly face tinged pink it had been his spell that had caused the change she said it d be good for me to look up the spell myself he grumbled but i dunno blondes have more fun anyways right we gotta talk james said into lily ear grabbing her arm and pulling her into an empty classroom i have to get to class she protested softly you have a free period now james replied i know your scheldule stalker she muttered she crossed her arms what well i james thought back he had his speech memorized if only he could remember it i was just thaveanervousbreakdown lily blinked alright once more slowly i was just getting kind of worried what happened we shouldntbe talking lily waved her wand and made the walls glow blue for a second she said he told me not to talk to you he did james gave a strangled laugh i didnteven know he knew my name this isntfunny james straightened his back and nodded nervous reaction go on he just asked where i d been lily met his eyes they were so truthful james knew she was lying i suppose he invited you to his birthday party next weekend too james retorted it at eight i charge of brining the lemonade and a dessert lily replied james frowned and searched her face really of course james blinked you re kidding lily headed for the door you are so stupid i not supposed to talk to you james called after her we really can help you dontbother trying she said over her shoulder as she left peter tapped his quill against his open charms book brow furrowed the words seemed to blend together in his tired mind meaningless and frustrating having trouble asked a cool voice behind him peter turned and saw bellatrix black standing behind him blue eyes hooded and arms crossed lazily i can help peter blinked sirius always said not to talk to his cousins you see she continued standing across the table from him in the otherwise silent library the wrong spell written in the book peter quickly scanned over his notes and checked the book but professor murphie said that shut up snapped bellatrix she took a deep breath and smiled would you like me to show you the real way warily peter nodded and stowed his book and notes into his backpack the darkly beautiful slytherin sat across from him this was the first time she had ever talked to him and he couldnthelp being suspicious especially with all of his friends warnings in his mind pettigrew dontput away your wand hissed bellatrix exasperated peter blushed and pulled it back out now she said in a calmer voice the real incantation is sectumsempra sectumsempra peter repeated slowly it felt good on his tongue what about wand motion just kind of poke at it you ve got to really want to make it work though bellatrix leaned over the chair watching him closely peter looked at the potatoe he was trying to slice uh sectumsempra please pettigrew put some passion into it bellatrix cried peter flushed dark red he wanted so badly to impress this girl sectumsempra he cried a rush went through peter body the potato split into three small sections then the table fell apart peter realized that he was panting bellatrix stood against the chair a wild grin on her face perfect she purred remember the reviews i get for this chapter will add with the ones from last chapter for your super huge chapter next week because this again it actually an addition to meetings ennerverate lily intoned waving her wand over bellatrix motionless body black lashes fluttered open to reveal her eyes which were the blue color of a half frozen river she blinked and sat up glaring up at lily what did you do what i good at she whispered allowing her voice to stay at her normal level so as not to raise any suspicions bellatrix scanned the empty hospital wing where pomfrey i waited until she went to dinner and snuck up here to undo it lily replied she couldntsee me or she know that i the stunner how are you feeling bellatrix asked quickly rising from the bed to tower over lily well i trust perfect bellatrix narrowed her eyes i hit you she muttered peering into lily face with what lily asked innocently raising an eyebrow nothing bellatrix gathered herself and gave lily a bitter smile i would never curse our precious velisna lily drew her wand and pressed it to bellatrix throat speak my true name again and i will kill you fear flared in bellatrix cold eyes fine she spat taking a step backwards stay here lily ordered bellatrix froze get back in bed and tell madame pomfrey that you just woke up bellatrix glowering moved back to the bed she barely avoided shouldering lily as she walked past her but settled for muttering curses under her breath remember lily said if i get arrested you die she turned and left the room 1 lily cried a voice as she entered the common room a blur of auburn hair slammed into lily and clutched her tightly are you okay yes lily said softly are you still mad at me lily sighed no tonks narrowed her dark green eyes you sound mad i always sound mad lily explained to lighten the mood tonks grinned reassured oh she exclaimed suddenly wanna have a snow fight not particularly lily replied warily oh come on it ll be fun she laughed we can get the boys and lily despite gentle protesting found herself outside in hogwarts snow covered grounds snow angels tonks sang falling to the lightly trampled snow lily looked around the empty grounds where is everyone it a hogsmeade saturday tonks replied airily lily looked around once more then sat down next to tonks in the snow using a charm to keep herself warm and dry tonks began rolling back and forth in the snow lily closed her eyes and laid the rest of the way down hair spilling out like rose petals on the snow let make a snowman tonks offered lily kept her eyes closed then i d have to get up she reasoned suddenly in an outburst of paranoia she looked around for signs of anyone else if he learned that she was playing with a half blood what wrong tonks asked lily looking pale nothing she lied casually listen i probably need to get in she said getting to her feet and dusting off the lingering snow tonks face fell now we can talk in the common room later lily assured her she started up to the castle renewing the heat charm on her robes something cold smacked the back of her head with a small poof lily turned slowly and saw potter standing beside tonks another snowball in his left hand leaving so soon the birthday party today remember lily drawled potter flushed that not fair lily tonks shrieked another snowball hit her head she turned to see black grinning behind her bring it on evans he challenged lazily casting one last anxious look to the castle windows lily bent down and pulled up a handful of snow patting it down splat another one hit her ear she turned and saw remus with an uncharacteristically mischievous grin on his face she was caught in a classic four pronged attack she discerned when pettigrew got her on the neck heading towards who she assumed weakest lily ran not slowing as she neared pettigrew he looked around nervously then dove out of the way as she bolted past him she turned and tonks joined her what now general she asked lily whispered you take remus and pettigrew tonks nodded five four a snowball hit tonks in the stomach and she tore after remus aiming her small snowball carefully pettigrew dove after laughing loudly so it two on one remarked james as he and sirius closed in on lily unfair dontyou think lily raised an eyebrow would you like to wait for your backup she taunted james couldntbelieve she was actually playing along he gestured to sirius that all the backup i ll ever need he said sirius grinned and threw a snowball at lily she dove away somersaulting once to left and springing to her feet both hands full of snow both snowballs hit their marks james wiped snow from his eyes and bent down to get another snowball before he could throw though another snowball hit his back traitor he called to sirius who was bent double laughing what can i say mate that chick has skills if you cantbeat her join her sirius finished by pelting james with another snowball it was dusk when they decided to retire lily was more flushed than she d been in years and her heart was racing pleasantly potter was reenacting their fight as they all walked to the welcoming castle then you were like whoosh and i was whoa and sirius was like insanely fast black snorted whoosh he repeated nice potter laughed tripped over a hidden root in the snow and fell down lily offered her hand and pulled him easily to his feet thanks he said you re rather graceful she observed he laughed again and held open the front doors for her tonks fell into step beside her as they walked in i soaked she declared lily waved her wand and dried tonks clothes thanks lily muttered sure they started to walk to the great hall but lily objected i not hungry if bellatrix saw her with the marauders when she was already so mad the dark lord would know by midnight potter shrugged want to come to the kitchens instead lily paused for a moment then her aching stomach made up her mind all right she conceded lead on isabellita mia darling black cried as he entered swooping down to engulf a house elf in a hug you re my besta frienda he said false italian accent clasing in lily ears it sa sirius said the house elf blushing at the affection anda my other marauders can ia have soma spaghetti asked black straightening to tower over the horde of house elves ah sirius you rea messing with me said the house elf lily looked around at the scurrying creatures curiously what can i get the rest of youa i d like spaghetti too lily said isabellita grinned showing carefully cleaned teeth i d be glad to helpa you said the house elf come ona guysa she called to the other chefs zese peoples are wanting some spaghetti may i have some brownies asked tonks politely a plate of fudge and blonde brownies were shoved into her hands immediately and they were all ushered to a small table in the corner we should do this every night james shrugged lily sighed maybe she said eat some of the chocolate desserts hissed the mark softly lily brought her arm up to her mouth masking her speech by wiping her hand on her sleeve would you even be able to taste it lily asked we are connected the mark answered lily washed her palette with a sip of water and bit into the nearest brownie the rich warm flavor hit her tongue like a taste of ambrosia mmmm hissed the mark how do you like it delicious she announced the room to cover for answering her tattoo her companions greeted her statement with odd looks 2 eh remus asked never mind she told them okay black began a hag and a werewolf walk into a bar right then the hag says he trailed off forget the punch line again padfoot remus asked ooklay at the oorday he muttered we re not supposed to be in here mcgonagall spotted them immediately however it was not anger on her face but relief students are to report to their common rooms immediately mcgonagall said hurriedly we need a head count why asked potter rising from his seat lily rose slower she had a bad feeling in the pit of her stomach mcgonagall shook her head and ushered them out of the door go directly to the tower as lily passed the professor touched her arm if you will come with me lily nodded carefully and gestured for tonks to go on without her mcgonagall led lily along silently both pairs of heels clicking loudly in the empty hallways professors bones and dumbledore wish to speak to you mcgonagall said as they reached dumbledore office she knocked on the door once with the griffin knocker and called i ve found her and entered lily trailed behind her closing the door slowly what had she done this time had they changed their minds was she going to azkaban i sorry bones was saying to dumbledore we should this from the start it quite all right dumbledore replied i was planning on doing it tonight anyways miss evans he said addressing lily please sit down minerva thank you for escorting her here please attend to the rest of your house now mcgonagall nodded sharply and left bones and dumbledore were the only other occupants of the room other than the brilliant phoenix in the corner mars bar asked dumbledore lily shook her head lily bones said standing beside dumbledore imposing desk we need to know what happened when you met with voldemort he believed me lily said shortly looking at a small silver figurine on a nearby table he just believed you bones asked did you change any of our excuses i left out the injuries due to rabid manitcore attack and said that i was just tired lily offered bones snorted the manticore was douglas idea well anything else nothing important lily said softly he didntmention any plans to you did her no attacks oxygen was becoming harder and harder for lily to grasp what happened lily tried to keep her voice calm bones looked away dumbledore sighed and met lily searching eyes there was an attack on hogsmeade today he took a deep breath a student was killed what going on james asked the first gryffindor he saw in the tower death eaters in hogsmeade exclaimed the girl at least thirty hufflepuffs were killed dontbe an idiot interjected her friend rolling her eyes it was twenty slytherins nuh uh the first replied why would death eaters kill their own it was hufflepuffs james left them to their argument and returned to his friends what have you got half the school dead offered remus a ravenclaw exploded peter squeaked slughorn and sprout are having a steamy love affair sirius confided say what remus asked affronted james shook his head been reading the hogwash again padfoot that was one time sirius complained further conversation was cut off by the arrival of mcgonagall silence rippled through the room and dozens of fearful eyes turned to mcgonagall dumbledore felt that you should be told the truth now so rumors so not get started mcgonagall began remus gave sirius a significant look and turned back at mcgonagall four death eaters entered hogsmeade three students were wounded and one was killed she said softly who the question spread across the room like a a quiet wildfire the self proclaimed dark lord sat carefully in his hard throne surveying the quartet of followers that knelt before him in the cold stone room you may rise he granted immediately the tallest rose tore off his white mask and glared at him we did it will you let laura go now voldemort raised his wand and murmured crucio once the man was through screaming voldemort said calmly how many did you get i killed someone panted a woman giving a breathy giggle she was pale under her dark hood and her gray hazel eyes were feverish as she laughed again one voldemort asked slowly the shortest felix kuck gave a humble bow we hurt some others two students and a teacher he said eyes downcast humbly how badly voldemort asked i killed someone repeated the pale woman one student broke his leg the other got hit with nott coughing hex the teacher got the random sleep spell the shortest reported what made you choose that particular spell voldemort asked calmly despite being infuriated my lord said kuck if he is ever in another dangerous situation he will die i suppose voldemort said so he said addressing the tallest everyone contributed correct the man paled eyes wide yes he lied softly voldemort raised a dark eyebrow what exactly did she do he asked gesturing to the woman she killed someone the tall man replied awkwardly anything else the man did not reply staring stoically over voldemort shoulder she made that building fall remember gaven answered kuck made that kid leg break remember oh said the tall man oh indeed the dark lord said smiling thinly so she got two nott got one and kuck got one what leaves how many for you the man was silent arentyou going to answer none said the man through clenched teeth ah said the dark lord and why is that i dontknow he spat my lord gaven was watching our backs said the shortest i dontlike liars voldemort hissed crucio kuck fell screaming the tallest stood straight guilt playing in his eyes now you will die voldemort told him his jaw clenched but he did not try to run you should know though voldemort continued laura already dead that brought him to life you sick avada kendavra voldemort said over him a flash of green light illuminated the small room and the annoying man was dead severus emerged from his room after studying to find all the slytherins crowded downstairs he went immediately to the couch where his allies sat oh hello snape said bellatrix calmly what going on he asked sharply narcissa shrugged her thin shoulders hogsmeade attack some gryff died who severus asked someone fairfield or other the blonde said with a dismissive gesture severus nodded careful to seem as uncaring as she was slughorn raced into the room head count he shouted as soon as he got enough breath first years line up here a group of small students moved to the front of the common room bellatrix scoffed to the slytherins around her all of us will be here she drawled we re the purest house second years slughorn called our lord wouldntorder an attack on one of us bellatrix finished triumphantly joshua smithson called slughorn has anyone seen mister smithson a building fell on him said a fifth year leaning casually against the stone wall where is he now asked slughorn paling the fifth year shrugged the wing probably slughorn moved the fireplace and threw in a pinch of glistening powder yes asked madame pomfrey do you have one joshua smithson with you he asked yes he almost healed thank you slughorn said withdrawing from the emerald flames fifth years he continued severus looked at bellatrix with a raised eyebrow she sniffed we all know that smithsons are interbred she drawled rather hypocritically severus thought besides i heard that his great grandfather was a werewolf narcissa looked horrified a werewolf how d he get into slytherin the hat had a lapse of judgment bellatrix assured them what if it was an accident the building i mean narcissa said her silvery blonde braid flashed as she moved her head to look at all of the surrounding slytherins bellatrix rolled her eyes cissy cissy cissy she purred the dark lord does nothing by accident severus nodded with the rest of the group never severus affirmed softly narcissa turned to him pale eyes catching the firelight are you sure severus blinked slowly positive lily pulled her sheets over herself listening her roommates sobs their friends from other grades clustered around them talking softly lily kept her eyes shut tightly using her pillow to cover her ears she had caused so many to cry like that to actually hear it was tearing at her heart if he had told her about it she could have prevented it maybe it was her fault that this happened because she didntgain his trust back but if she had known would she have stopped it she didntknow the answer a bitter feeling overwhelmed her stomach making her shudder when the sounds continued to haunt her through the pillow she reached over took her wand from her bedside table and cast a bubble around her bed to block out their sobs had he been trying to catch lily she shuddered again and pulled her sheets tighter had another death been completely her fault lily stayed awake restless hours after the others had fallen asleep then finally the forgiving lands of sleep accepted her sirius leaned against the wall blonde hair falling over his stormy eyes several girls passed him as they headed towards the great hall for breakfast hi sirius muttered a sixth year brushing past him hey he replied huskily she flushed and hurried away finally jennifer and jillian emerged from the dormitories they had been talking quietly when they saw sirius oh said jennifer stopping sirius pushed himself off the wall and approached them jilliane crossed her arms and scowled at him what do you want i sorry he mumbled about jessica jennifer was biting her lip looking away jillian glared up at him blonde hair in a messy ponytail donttalk to us you broke jessica heart why should we talk to you we were in hogsmeade trying to make her happy she was so sad and then she broke off losing her steam let just go whispered jennifer grabbing her arm and pulling her away sirius closed his eyes and swallowed difficultly was it really his fault dumbledore stood up china blue eyes solemn the already hushed hall grew silent but for a few sniffs a great tragedy as you all know has occurred mr and mrs fairfield wanted you to know that the funeral will be this thursday all those who wish to go should sign up on the sheet posted in each common room class on monday is cancelled let us please have a moment of quiet reflection lily bowed her head along with the rest of her table she stared unseeingly at her gold plate listening to the muffled sobs around her thank you dumbledore said gently there was a rustle as everyone sat up straight lily glanced over at the slytherin table bellatrix was in the same position leaning against her chair as she d been before there were obviously some people who didntrespect the dead food appeared along the tables steaming and delectable lily looked down at the bowl of scrambled eggs in front of her and found her appetite gone she waited until the noise in the hall had reached normal level then rose and walked to where sirius was sitting he and potter were sitting alone with no sign of remus or pettigrew hello lily potter greeted hey sirius said in an attempt at a cheerful voice lily met his eyes i know you liked fairfield so i wanted to offer my condolences she said softly thanks sirius replied oh and sirius he looked back up in surprise at her use of his first name lily paused and handed him a slip of parchment you re welcome james sat on the edge of his plush bed staring at the wall he let go of the golden ball in his hand watched it fly a few feet away and caught it release catch release catch remus was buried in a thick novel breathing deeply as he d been since he woke up peter was lying on the floor staring at the ceiling he had skipped breakfast to go to the library that morning that had surprised james but he remembered that peter was having trouble in charms he must have been studying sirius entered dragging his feet hullo he greeted heavily lo peter replied james and remus didntspeak sirius stood next to the mirror staring at his own reflection james pocketed the snitch and stood what up padfoot sirius showed him the slip of parchment that evans had given him sharp slanted handwriting read swish and jab oscurelo what it do dontknow til i try right sirius pulled out his wand and pointed at the wall speaking the spell nothing happened james noted no sirius replied sarcastically what it for remus asked putting down his book dunno evans gave it to me sirius said remus took the paper from james and looked over it for a second he gave a small smile and said try this oscurelo he jabbed his wand at sirius head black hair overtook sirius blonde spreading like dusk what sirius asked james gestured to the mirror sirius looked into it and jumped yes he exclaimed james laughed at his stunned expression looking good black is black again sirius grinned widely lily evans is my hero he breathed remus rolled his eyes and moved back to his bed james ruffled sirius black hair with a smile then his face fell are you going to the funeral i mean james asked awkwardly sirius cleared his throat yeah he grunted james nodded me too he turned to peter and remus you they both nodded of course remus said quietly did they ever er catch them he asked sirius scowled we donteven know who they were other than they were death eaters he turned suddenly to james you dontthink evans i mean they didntlike each other she was with us james said defensively she canthave had anything to do with it right the hallways were silent despite it being noon on a monday lily meandered through absorbed in guilty thoughts each new one tearing through her like a bullet why hadntshe asked voldemort his plans had they been after her to take her away or to kill her lily feet led her to the castle front doors she paused but then pulled her cloak hood over her head and walked outside the clean white snow but lily face as it came down as though punishing her was all this sorrow her fault she asked herself again lily was buffeted by the wind as she walked to the lake the late january chill seeped through her thick black cloak and down to her bones the snow crunched as she sat down by the frozen lake the wind tore her hood off her head but she did not bother to pull it back up her tight ponytail flew back and forth like a whip behind her the silent castle was a reminder of the wake one girl had left behind one death and the entire castle was off balance lily had wanted to go to the funeral but how would she explain that to voldemort why had she ever felt any loyalty to the dark lord she thought suddenly he gave me a home only after he took my other one away she argued with herself desperate for a real answer he taught me magic beyond anything i d heard of the small voice told her and he for one trusts you not anymore she retorted and he makes me use magic to hurt people innocent people i owe him nothing he ll kill you taunted the voice dontrisk it petunia safe now there only one more thing i have to do then he can kill me i dontcare lily stood up and brushed the cold snow from her robes determinedly lily straightened her back raised her chin in defiance to a monster hundreds of miles away and went back into the castle if he wonttrust me now lily though savagely i ll show him everything i could have done to lose his trust the door to his office burst open with a bang to reveal lily there was a fire in her eyes that shone with an intensity that surprised edgar lily he asked in confusion why arentyou at the funeral she stepped forward unconsciously slamming the door behind her lily stood in front of his desk hands clenched into fists at her side what would he say she spat edgar cocked his head slightly to one side what going on lily looked uncertain for a moment but then she met his eyes i his secret keeper 1 just so you all know almost the whole conversation on both sides was a lie 2 she answered in parseltongue in case you didntcatch it i left you with a cliffie so you might want to review a little more i need a vote now do you all want these super long chapter that take a long time to post or would you rather not have chapter length by review and have updates a little more often i need some input from you thanks for reading eh edgar choked out nightshade mansion death eater headquarters his house i the secret keeper she said quickly clenching her fists tighter well that s edgar struggled for a word good brilliant amazing he said as all the implications dawned on him after all these years they could really catch voldemort they had a death eater eager to sing er sit down lily blinked oh yeah she said slowly unclenching her fists and perching on the edge of the maroon chair i would offer you tea but i afraid professor williams store expired edgar said he was unsure how to continue what do you say to a confessing person he tried to remember some of his auror classes er go on lily tensely released a breath do you have a map by any chance of southern england edgar nodded and rose to look through a cabinet against the wall now was it under e for england s for south or m for maps rolling his eyes he pulled out his wand and muttered accio south england map the bottom drawer flew open and a roll of parchment shot out at him he caught it smoothly and laid it out before lily on the desk nightshade manor is here lily said pointing a short nail at a point on the map the map grew before his eyes to accommodate a previously hidden area edgar used a quill to outline the area before he forgot the location once done edgar sat back down across from lily tapping his dried quill against the desk you d say i know you pretty well right he asked suddenly the defiant look she had first bore had been slowly fading in the past minutes and now she was wary watching him as fearfully she had done when they first met she nodded once edgar brought the quill up to his mouth and chewed pensively on the eagle feather so i know you but i dontknow about this why if i may ask obviously he added lily met his eyes determination slowly rising back i realized this had gone on too long she muttered my keeping back information like this is letting people die edgar nodded and tapped the quill against his lip we should let dumbledore know he mentioned appraising her reaction thoughtfully she averted her eyes then i should probably be going she offered listen edgar said leaning forward i know what you re thinking but you re on your side now whether you meant to or not neutrality is not an option by her silence he guessed it was the latter either way you ll have to trust me and the headmaster besides he added logically you re the only one who can tell him anyways secret keeper and all that james closed his eyes and bowed his head with the rest of the congregation people stood and spoke about jessica how good she was how nice she was how wonderful she was thinking back james could think of many times when none of those statements were true but he kept quiet in respect for the dead then sirius stood up beside james all eyes of the congregation turned to him sirius cleared his throat silver eyes brimming with unshed tears as most of you kn know i was jess boyfriend i i loved her burning tears traced their way down sirius face i i i can t i cantexpress how so sorry i am that she g gone i love you jess short speech done sirius collapsed back into his chair james put a hand on sirius shoulder he looked sideways at james tears streaming down his face and gave a watery smile good job mate james encouraged lily shakily brushed a lock of long red hair from her eyes and gripped the porcelain edge of the sink staring at her reflection she was pale and her eyes were overly bright i going to die she whispered he ll know it was me he ll know how could she have been so rash caught up in the moment only one person could betray him and it was her she d known all along that any betrayal was death there was a rustle as two js entered the dormitories lily took a deep breath and exited the bathroom both girls were in black dress robes and had red puffy eyes for once they were silent both more solemn than ever lily met their eyes for the briefest of moments then turned and left the room she walked in a daze so unlike she had been those hours before on her way to her death snow was driving down harshly to the ground tearing at the trees in the frobidden forest leaves exposing their fragile pale undersides lily bent and checked to assure that her shoelaces were tightly tied then began to run magical strength flowed through her rushing pulsing through her body her black sneakers sunk into the snow piles but soon she was moving so fast that her feet barely brushed the white surface her rosake drought infused blood roared in her ears blocking out all thought there was only her body and the snow she slowed as she reached the strong iron gates at the hogwarts entrance which were left open for the returning students wide open snow billowed around her heels as lily skidded to a halt she could see lights in the distance from hogsmeade faint behind the snow beyond that was nothing but freedom she had another chance she had done her part petunia was safe and the death eater headquarters exposed earlier that day she had realized that she owed voldemort nothing now she realized she had no obligations to the order either also and almost more pressingly dumbledore would have surely gotten moody to deactivate her detection bracelet in the assumption that she would go to the funeral she hoped for once there was absolutely nothing and no one to stop her if the order succeeded in raiding the headquarters she wouldntbe hunted if not she would be in hiding no matter who she was with she would rather hide on her own terms than on dumbledore s if she didnthurt anyone surely the order would leave her alone why should she stay a bored sirius looked over the top of his charms book at remus who was studiously flipping through his own book sirius began humming quietly testing his reaction remus kept his face stoically in his book amber eyes skimming the lines rapidly sirius increased his humming volume still met with no response sirius began singing softly magic peace and love whether hippogriff or a dove remus sighed and turned the page sirius frusterated sang louder voice ringing through the library dontbe snooty just shake that booty keep it groovy babe just keep it remus casually dog eared his page and scowled up at sirius who trailed off groovy sirius grinned sheepishly sorry remus old pal sirius exclaimed i sometimes have to sing to read it might also help if you turn your book rightside up remus muttered running a hand through his short hair sirius quickly flipped the text over ah i see well now that neither of us is reading we should go to hogsmeade peter off doing something and so is prongs so we have the afternoon off remus rolled his eyes and picked up his book again flipping to the dog eared page i studying for the quiz on thursday you can go to hogsmeade not alone whined sirius not with me i cantbelieve i agreed to come with you remus complained ducking under the tunnel low ceiling sirius looked back at him and smirked you need to put down the books every once in a while you need to pass charms aurors require an e on the charms newt remus reminded him sirius shrugged i ll cram before class he almost slid on a patch of loose pebbles but balanced himself remus growled under his breath how do you do that i just amazing sirius said continuing onwards dog reflexes i meant cramming remus clarified shuffling his feet along the tunnel same reason y know how dogs can learn new tricks and stuff yeah that me remus laughed sit stay stay bad dog snuffles bad dog before remus could register what was happening sirius had morphed and tackled remus to the ground remus amber eyes widened as he fell sirius he exclaimed sirius turned and trotted up the tunnel tail raised high in triumph remus chuckled softly as he got up stupid mutt he muttered sirius turned and gave him a haughty glare before morphing back into a human i a pureblood pedigreed and stuff remus shook his head laughing most humans dontbrag about having a pedigree you ve never talked to my family sirius called over his shoulder as he reached the end of the tunnel he pushed up on the trapdoor slab help me with this remus walked over and obediently pushed on the other end of the slab when it didntbudge he said there must be something on top sirius just pushed harder face reddening sirius back up no sirius growled remus rolled his eyes and pulled out his wand wingardium levisoa he intoned swishing his wand there was a loud clunk as something rolled off the wobbling trapdoor as it rose in the air that something kept rolling on out of the opening and straight onto sirius head sirius yelped and clutched his head i told you to back up remus said just be glad it didntshatter you d have glass and fizzing whizbees in your skull then again remus continued thoughtfully as he jmped through the hole i think you already do yeah yeah yeah sirius growled if you re done gloating he held up his hand remus reached down his hand to pull sirius up sirius grabbed the proffered appendage and jerked remus back into the hole as remus hit the muddy ground sirius morphed into a dog and leapt into the cellar remus pulled himself up and moved the slab back into place thank you sirius he said sarcastically welcome sirius said airily looking at a shelf let go up top he suggested remus followed him up to the store hello he asked the candles had all been blown out the candy was stored in shrunken boxes and the counter had been cleared what going on remus asked looking around the shop for any type of clue he approached the boarded windows and peered through the crack in the wood i guess i know why now remus muttered sirius came up behind him and looked through a different hole why didntthey clean it up yet he asked gruffly the streets were in shambles bricks from the building across the street was strewn across the cobblestones remus shrugged looking over the death eaters devastation of the town we should leave remus mumbled no sirius said moving towards the door i want to see see what everything gone sirius froze fine he muttered turning away let just go the journey back to the school remained silent until they neared the statue courage plucked up remus suddenly said it not your fault you know sirius whirled on him what he demanded all this remus said gesturing vaguely around isntyour fault sirius narrowed his eyes and growled how would you know you think you re so smart remus met sirius eyes there is no way this is your fault so dontgo feeling guilty sirius exploded you have no clue what you re talking about he shouted jess was in hogsmeade because of me she died because of me you didntkill her remus reasoned fighting to keep his voice calm she probably would have been there anyways it would have been different if i hadntbroken up with her we d ve been there together i could have protected her how can you stand there and say it not my fault who more to blame remus challenged you or voldemort that completely beside the point if if voldemort wasntan evil git none of this would have happened remus continued i ll kill him sirius growled whoever did this i ll kill him sirius continued forward muttered death threats satisfied by taking sirius mind off his guilt remus followed him the rest of the way up the tunnel we need to take immediate action edgar proclaimed moody nodded sharply we need a plan of action why isntevans here we need blueprints the defense spells everything professor dumbledore thought it was best she stayed at school edgar explained this is a bit more important than education bellowed moody there is nothing more important than education dumbledore said solemnly as he entered it is the building block for life moody grumbled under his breath but did not openly protest miss evans will be joining us after her classes on friday dumbledore continued how can we trust her asked diggle abruptly she was a prisoner here only weeks ago she must be after our blood i agree said sara this is ridiculous to trust the stunner edgar put his hand over hers and smiled trust me this is the best lead we ve had yet we re not about to have a vote exclaimed moody standing i telling you as tactics leader that we re on sunday he raised his voice and if any of you lilylivers want to back out you can submit to our mind wipe and be on your way so much for democracy muttered diggle huffily moody snapped his quill and threw it at diggle we re not in a democracy we re in a war diggle ducked the first half of the quill but the feathered end hit his face what was uncalled for he sniffed i ll show you what uncalled for moody shouted taking a step towards the other man dumbledore rose from his chair alastor moody sank down into his chair muttering some more now if there is a problem with a plan please let me know diggle spluttered and sank into his chair edgar rolled his eyes at their immaturity now dumbledore said emmeline you are in charge of the stake out team so choose them carefully we need to know how often and when voldemort is in we need to walk most of the way for he will doubtless have strong anti apparation wards if we take them down death eaters will flood in before we get to the dark lord edgar you re in charge of talking to miss evans before friday edgar nodded and took notes the rest of the meeting with an fyeo charm before leaving he d let lily have the night off as it only hours after her confession i hate her screeched bellatrix the dark lord likes her best and she stunned me she threw a lamp at the wall severus casually stopped it from shattering with his wand not so loudly he warned you re not even supposed to be in here actually you cantgo to our dorm not vice versa narcissa said lightly filing her nails on a top bunk besides severus continued what if slughorn heard you yelling that we d be dead i dontcare she shrieked picking up a thick history of magic book i hate her calm down darling rudolphus soothed from his bed donttell me what to do bellatrix threw the book at rudolphus it hit him soundly on the head leaving a livid black bruise and just think chortled regulus to rudolphus you only have to spend the rest of your life married to her scat spat bellatrix pointing the the door shaking with fury he ddi so quickly dodging another book throuwn at him i dontsee what the big deal is rabastan muttered from the other top bunk so she stunned you you did try to curse her nobody beats me bellatrix shouted eyes blazing we have to get rid of her the lord will be furious if you hurt her severus said he ll understand i can be his new stunner she declared one problem severus pointed out silkily you re not a stunner stupefy she shouted drawing her wand and pointing it at severus he blocked it readily with his wand and then casually resheathed it bellatrix turned on rabastan on the other bed and repeated the bed he fell off the edge where he had been perched now you wake him up she said pointing to rudolphus he started and sat up well what the spell ennerverate severus told him just wave your wand he stood up and looked down at younger brother uh ennerverate he grunted waving his wand casually yes cried bellatrix i am a stunner it en ner verate not ennerver ate severus corrected quietly oh rudolphus pulled his wand out again ennerverate rabastan blinked awake and sat up holding his head ouch bellatrix noticed his new consciousness and let out a shriek more frightening than any banshee severus leaned back against the wall and closed his eyes he felt vaguely sorry for her fianc but peeking over at the black bruise on his forehead severus couldnthelp a small smirk just to give you all a heads up i going to write a one fic of choice for my 1000th reviewer just so you might give me the needed 200 so reviews also did any of you notice the lack of lily in the last half which did she do stay or leave i d like a room drawled lily name asked the man behind the marble counter brushing invisible lint from his suit smith levi smith she replied pulling her hood father over her face would you like a suite or your best suite would be fine of course sir said the man bowing slightly will you be needing someone for your bags he looked over the counter searching for evidence of luggage my bags have not arrived yet lily drawled if another flight loses my luggage i understand completely sir well if you would allow us to provide a toothbrush we d be much obliged please lily said subconsciously checking her hood the man held out a card room 612 i ll send someone up with some toiletries immediately thank you said lily accepting the room card the elevators are back and to the right the man relayed lily left him then slinking towards the elevators a sign to her left indicated stairs so she gratefully took them to the sixth floor with her rosake drought powered limbs it took only seconds the room was large with a quilted king bed to the side accompanied by a widescreen television and complimentary shampoo and coffee in the loo lily removed her cloak to reveal her school robes and threw herself on the bed letting out a raspy laugh she d done it finally no more never again lily stood up on the bed and spun in a lazy circle never again she told herself she raised her voice never again she hummed a little never again ne ver aaaaaagain she sang lily started in surprise as big ben tolled seven then laughed at herself never have to be scared again never work again thank you you know who for all the gold she bowed to an imaginary dark lord never have to say you know who again she exclaimed clapping her hands in delight there was a knock on her door mister smith came a cool voice i have your supplies lily clapped a hand to her mouth one second she called deepening her voice donning the black cloak that jangled pleasantly she opened the door a man in the hotel livery bowed and handed her a plastic bag thank you for choosing the hilton london green park hotel enjoy you stay and feel free to ask for anything you wish lily nodded and snapped the door closed she d have to go shopping tomorrow because her black cloak was sure to start drawing suspicion she removed said cloak and laid back on the bed then she jumped back up and opened the small doors in the cabinet in front of her plush bed and grabbed the remote jumping back onto the bed lily pressed the big red button i love muggles she thought as she allowed the mediocre comedy to sweep her away we cantspend anymore time looking for evans right now moody growled addressing the assembled order alastor right diggle announced rising to his feet we need to focus on getting you know who then we can worry about the stunner but we need more information objected edgar besides she could have been kidnapped for all we know we cantjust forget about her she did give us his location she done her part emmeline protested hotly we should leave her alone albus rose to his feet listen he said gently we need everyone to execute this plan we do not have many extras to expend as a search team now emmeline what has your stake out team learned again spat voldemort he grasped his tattoo searching for his daughter something was blocking him different than last time there was a great presense in his path so great that he did not question it simply removed his hand as though burned avery the young man ran into the room bowing repeatedly you are going to gather a group a large group and you are going to scour the univers for my stunner avery frozen mid bow stuttered t the universe milord voldemort raised a dark eyebrow are you questioning orders no of course not he simpered his fear showing clearly on his face good leave the man scampered out of the room then the question began to plague the dark lord mind was her disappearance involuntary or not i off to a meeting my daughter will be coming in soon she stayed until they could get our bags please give her a copy of the room key of course mr smith replied the man behind the counter straightening his dark blue tie lily left the near empty lobby quickly cloak jangling against the back of her legs the city streets were congested with vendors and other scurrying muggles excuse me sir would you like a watch i have rolex and no but if you could point me to the best bank in town i d be much obliged lily said gruffly let talk it over while you look at my watches eh you lily began dangerously ah leave im alone eddie i tell you said a plump woman go down dis street all de way to rogers drive den you find good bank den maybe you come back here of course madam lily said striding away what did you do severus hissed approaching bellatrix as she entered the common room bellatrix raised an eyebrow what are you babbling about snape the stunner that what he hissed what did you do to her bellatrix laughed severus glared at her until her face froze you mean she actually gone i thought severus took a deep breath yes she gone no one can find her bellatrix muttered a curse and not of the spell variety either and said does he know yet severus narrowed his eyes you didntdo anything of course not you bloody idiot bellatrix shouted the majority of the common room jumped in surprise at the shriek then looked away when she gave them a glare shaking with fury suddenly a ball of furious feathers collided with bellatrix black hair as bellatrix detached the bird severus removed the parchment from its leg as for whether he knows yet severus muttered as the slytherins crowded to see the rouge owl i guessing he does severus shoved the old parchment into her hand and slinked away from the twittering slytherins 1 that brings your total to 713 000 001 euros excellent lily said running a hand through her loose red hair now i ll need that credit card with a third of thatsoon one third into cash and the gold as is understand yes ma am however we as employees have to question you think i stole it lily said giving a light giggle do i look like a thief the man shook his head but unconsciously fiddled with the walkie talkie attached to his armani suit i found my bank in sweden unreliable and heard that this was a superior bank i assumed that wouldntbe questioned like some commoner but apparently no no ma am i of course thought as much but you know with the state of security we have to at least inquire very well lily sniffed so if you could just give us the name of your old bank we could obliviate she murmured pardon what were we discussing asked the man with a dazed blink lily smiled gently one third credit one third cash and the rest as it is of course miss he quietly checking the paper in front of him robyn it will take me a few hours to get your new credit card validated all we need now is a code question to your vault just fill it out here and your answer here good the man gathered the sheets rose and bowed come back here in an hour and we ll have your card ready thank you lily sauntered down the street peering casually from side to side where to go first well she needed something to carry her new credit card in welcome to prada how may i help you today the sharply dressed attendant greeted eyeing her solid black clothes in obvious distaste your best purse the girl perfectly manicured eyebrows shot up containing her surprise with difficulty she said it is very expensive i can handle it lily cut it show it to me what color the girl asked gesturing for her to step forward lily removed her hood and held up one of her red locks this color exactly if not she reached up and put a finger to her eyes this color would you come with me please lily followed the woman to the store back realms would you like a diamond lining inquired then attendant she looked over some large handbags glancing at lily for color reference if possible lily replied casually inspecting her worn nails after a few more minutes of searching the attendant drew out a huge red purse is this what you had in mind perfect lily muttered inspecting it closer finding no obvious flaws she met the employee eyes i ll take it oh and throw in a matching suitcase while you re at it a word snape sirius growled latching on to snape arm james stepped to snape other side we have to talk snape replied with a small nod the three boys entered a nearby empty classroom making sure not to draw too much attention to themselves snape quickly cast a spell over the room and turned to the two boys any news we were just about to ask you the same question i mean after both remus and lily during that duel we figured out our plan sirius growled silver eyes flashing snape raised an eyebrow voice calm care to inform me what that is dontmess around james interjected we just want to find lily as do i potter as hard as it may be for your feeble minds to grasp i actually do care what happens to lily however i can tell you that the dark lord did not take her back how would you know sirius challenged you and him are such great buddies right does the term spy mean anything to you black snape retorted and he continued facing james i dontbelieve it was anyone at this school james nodded his comprehension who do you think has her then snape shook his head and scowled maybe a rogue death eater maybe a rouge order member either way she is in great danger 2 with three dozen shrunken bags in her jean pockets calf high fuzzy beige boots a brown and cream shirt along with a full manicure and feathery shoulder length hair lily was feeling as though all her worries were behind her she felt like a new person she looked like a new person aria robyn crooned her new money lily came to an abrupt halt when she reached a circle of people staring avidly at a man in the center a cobra met his eyes swaying with the pipe he played lily narrowed her eyes behind dior sunglasses and slid to the front once the man was safe with the snake back in its straw basket lily stepped forward excuse me the man looked up in surprise yes lily turned to the crowd do you think that hard she asked them in response to the general murmur of agreement lily turned to the thin man how much money did they give you she asked him a few hundred i think he replied quietly if i can do it also lily declared would you all give me double there was a moment of silence before a blonde man with striking hazel eyes stepped forward i ll pay you five hundred if you can do it she only a girl came a protest cantbe more than eighteen lily straightened her back and sat cross legged in front of the basket open it she ordered arentyou going to use that instrument called a woman i dontneed it i ll just sing the snake charmer obviously dumbfounded tipped the crate tentatively sideways jumping backwards when an annoyed black cobra coiled out onto the street always waking me up it complained attack the awaker greetings lily sang in parseltongue how are you today the crowd enthralled leaned forward the snake looked at her in shock you can speak of course i can good sir lily sang gently how may i help you snakemistress it asked bowing its head slightly lily smiled softly and sang the cobra nodded when she had finished her instruction will you set me free if i do that it asked suddenly lily paused yes she said i ll buy you and you can live with me there was complete silence in the circle other than lily singing when the cobra uncoiled itself and moved towards her the black serpent slowly wound itself up her arm twisting slowly dry scales soft on her skin hello brother said the tattoo as the cobra passed it lily sang small nothings in the serpentine language to keep the crowd entertained as the snake moved slowly upwards there was a small touch of its tongue on her cheek then the cobra uncoiled itself and slithered back into its basket once the lid was back on there was an uproar of applause from the audience lily caught a hat someone threw to her and accepted the money that was thrust into it great job said the blonde man dropping a thick stack of twenties into the hat before striding away once the last few people had put their money in lily turned to the snake charmer i ll give you half of this for the snake what he exclaimed i no give away maraj oh please lily said rolling her eyes fine all the money there at least two grand in here the man paused then grabbed two handfuls of cash out of the hat and ran off lily smirked and grabbed the snake basket is your name really maraj she asked it as they slipped through the crowd that is what the dumb man called me yes he replied huffily is there anything else you d like to be called lily asked amusedly you choose it replied from its basket what about rey there was a disgusted hiss in reply or onyx onyx it repeated i like it call me onyx lily smiled softly nice to meet you onyx i aria we both have new names i like the names it said slowly aria and onyx lily laughed gently beautiful edgar stepped out of the elevator yawning a two hour lunch break and then back to work he stood by the gold fountain scanning the crowd hey edgar exclaimed a blonde man in a suit giving him a brief hug happy birthday bro edgar replied where do ya wanna eat i dunno you choose paul said as they walked to the apparation point you choose i ll pay edgar replied in that case paul said let try that new italian restaurant down the street when they got to the dimly lit restaurant they were seated immediately apparently paul had already set reservations edgar laughed as they talked over the appetizer what would you have down if i had chosen a different restaurant oh i made reservations at every restaurant for the next five blocks i should probably floo and tell them we re not coming paul joked edgar laughed shaking his head better floo soon i ve had some restaurants get pretty miffed when i didntshow changing the topic edgar said i really dontsee why you let them make you wear that this paul replied indicating his current outfit it a suit it what muggles wear to work you work in muggle relations how many times do i have to tell you that you are not a muggle edgar said sighing paul shrugged i like my suits at least you re not wearing that ridiculous hat anymore edgar chuckled hey i liked that hat actually paul said leaning forward now that you mention that i have a crazy story to tell you here your food sirs said the waiter setting the steaming plates in front of them thanks edgar said politely what kind of crazy story he asked paul i found a parselmouth yesterday paul confided really asked edgar surprised yeah i was just heading home when i stopped to watch this snake charmer and please paul said edgar rolling his eyes and taking a bite of ravioli those guys are all fake no no let me finish then this girl walks up only like eighteen or so and challenges the old guy edgar mouth dropped open i know right well she said that if she could do it too the crowd should pay her double so naturally you ran a diagnostic spell to check for insanity edgar replied slowly though positively shaking on the inside so naturally i offered her five hundred euros if she could prove it people muggle money oh so then she sits down and starts singing to the snake it was parseltongue i know it i heard it when you brought in that one death eater anyways so the snake up and kisses her cheek then goes back into the cage you let her walk away edgar moaned well that was when i put a tracking charm on my hat and gave it to her to put the money in what did she look like edgar asked quickly she was really well dressed coach prada and dior all over which makes me wonder why she wanted more money anyways she looked young but could have been fifteen to twenty her hair what color was her hair edgar exclaimed bright red real unique i think she are you still tracking her yes but give me her coordinates edgar said eyes alight lily approached the woman at the hotel counter what restaurant would you recommend if i was looking for a nice dinner lily asked the woman smiled the smile she had probably worn all day are you looking for gourmet or something foreign gourmet please lily replied straightening her armani dress very good ma am i suggest the conquistador it a good few blocks away to the left i d be happy to arrange you a limo no i ll walk the woman smile faltered it snowing she objected gently lovely lily replied airily walking out the revolving door as the woman said snow was falling gently to the illuminated streets casting a beautiful hue on the bland world lily pulled her mink lined cashmere coat around her thin frame and set forth above her the stars were twinkling brightly in the areas free of cloud she thought briefly of how those same stars were over hogwarts and nightshade mansion right now also she shook her head and blinked against a sudden gust of wind passing the corner on which she had taken onyx lily smiled softly the well fed cobra was sleeping contentedly on her king bed a handy charm set to disguise him as a scarf to any wayward maids the street containing the conquistador was packed with bejeweled women on the arm of tuxedoed men walking beside the windy street or in limos on it lily passed several potential new shopping location such as louis vuitton and a small egyptian boutique shop surely she could find some real magical artifacts there egyptian wizards loved charming everything they got their hands on a blast of warm air enveloped lily as she walked into the restaurant may i take your coat ma am inquired a solemn worker lily slipped out of her coat to reveal a sparkling long navy dress with diagonal white stripes gracing the waist diamond studded heels clicked as she approached the counter just one tonight ma am asked the lady at the desk i afraid so lily replied smoothly the woman picked up a leather bound menu we have just the thing if you ll follow me lily was led into a large room candlelit with faint mozart emanating from hidden speakers the woman pulled out her chair for her and said your waiter will be out in a moment lily nodded graciously carefully placing the dark napkin on her lap a boy came behind her and filled her glass form a slender bottle thank you she murmured lily sipped the water letting the gentle mutterings of surrounding tables wash over her soothingly hello my name is erik and i ll be taking care of you tonight may i get you anything to drink greeted a sharply dressed waiter lily answered quietly i ll just have water of course ma am erik bowed slightly and left her lily gritted her teeth as she drank more water if another simpering idiot bowed to her she was going to snap and most likely reveal all of her stunning abilities more water miss asked the waterboy yes lily said she closed her eyes as he filled up her glass to avoid seeing the inevitable bow thanks she said when she heard the water stop pouring she kept her eyes closed for another minute then scanned the menu deciding immediately she set the menu to the side sighing hello ma am greeted the waiter as he returned would you like to hear our specials today no lily replied i would like the spinach salad with the balsamic vinaigrette and the stuffed mushrooms as your entr e yes please lily finished closing her eyes again and leaning back in her chair she listened vaguely to the tables next to her there was one couple arguing over appetizers next to another couple on their honeymoon in a corner sat a small family engaged in a verbal game to occupy the children before lily could listen beyond them her salad arrived and she devoted her attention to it lily picked up the outermost fork to eat etiquette she learned from dining with the dark lord 3 and slowly ate the salad why rush she had the rest of her life her whole future would be this delicious and boring what next find a mansion in canada or america hide out forever in fancy restsaruants the idea wasntexactly repulsive though her thoughts drifted to a job maybe singing isntthat what all the obscenely wealthy americans did saturday night d day alastor rallied his troops and had a final word now remember the plan emmeline says he here now and we ll just slip through his wards with these on he said gesturing to his shoes now everyone check in one two three four cinco six there was a pause eight wait alastor interrupted where bones hearing the rustling of the waiter approaching lily pushed her empty salad plate to the side and closed her eyes hello lily said someone who was most definitely not erik the waiter 1 and twittering slytherins is a sight i d stay and see let me tell you 2 not 3 and i learned from titanic only one person guessed her insane shopping spree important she may seem really ooc but she is running from her guilt and trying to suppress all her emotions and trying to forget her old life also she in so much shock from the rush of guilt that she would have killed herself if she hadntpushed it totally out of her mind maybe this cliffhanger will get you to review skip all the bold if you dontcare about the summary well i tried to make a 100 word summary using m word but it came out like this lily nodded cautiously lily smirked lily sighed softly look lily lily sighed lily shrugged lily severus lily cursed lily scowled lily shrugged lily froze lily lily sighed severus lily lily hissed furious lily evans lily lily sighed lily lily lily lily lily lily lily lily blinked lily severus hurry lily severus severus lily lily giggled lily lily spat lily asked lily asked lily shrugged lily sighed lily drawled lily lily sighed lily asked lily rose slower lily blinked lily exclaimed lily smiled gently lily paused lily smiled softly lily asked no lily replied lily replied icily lily froze so i had to manually create a better one in chronological order lily brother robin sacrificed his life to save her from a car lily was taken by voldemort when she was eleven after he killed her parents she learned how to become both a stunner someone with an extremely potent stunning spell and a dark adept able to use dark magic effectively now that she can use occlumency lily can block out voldemort from hearing her rebellious thoughts so he thinks she likes him and adopts her using the ark of salazar she becomes friends with severus snape in her seventh year summer who also dislikes voldie the 7th year death eaters find out who she is james and the maruaders except peter find out who she is severus becomes dumbledore spy without telling lily while in the forbidden forest teaching severus when they are both attacked by remus but they use an instant portkey to get away they reappear in the library and lily stuns filch giving her away as the stunner they search the school for the stunner not knowing that its lily severus sees that being the stunner is killing lily so he turns her in she spends christmas break at order hq getting interrogated meanly by moody and nicely by edgar bone whose fianc is a loser named sara while there lily gets hurt which makes sev mad he slips her rosake drought which eventually gives her temporary super powers she goes back to hogwarts and meets voldie who is mad that she disappeared he sets up an engagement between her and rabastan lestrange lily finds out that she can talk to her mark of salazar who enlists her help to fight voldie on the orders of salazar slytherin on a snowy hogsmeade day lily stays at the castle with tonks and the marauders and has fun that day her roommate jessica fairfield is killed in a de attack lily feels guilty tells bones the location of de hq and runs away from hogwarts she gets a king cobra named onyx bones finds out where she is through his brother then gets a tip from her that the order is about to be killed when they invade the de hq they all get away safely except moody who loses most use of his leg right now she just swam across the atlantic but accidentally dropped her wand in the ocean oops back to the story lily jumped to her feet and looked over the vast ocean the consuming flame of panic in her mind she couldntsurvive without her wand her magic then and icy certainty washed over her she had avoided it at all costs fighting to leave the darkness behind her lily close her eyes and spread out her arms the magical well within her burned eager to be used again my wand she thought tendrils of smoke began snaking through her hair as the dark magic slithered from her my wand words sprang unbidden to her lips magic to magic darkness to darkness i call forth the focuser of my powers from the very depths of hell bring forth my wand she urged a wind began whipping around her and her eyes turned black the calm sea began to writhe and move pulsing with her heart she didntknow how long she stood like that unseeing face to the sea but she snapped out of her trance when the smooth wood of her wand met her hand the smoke and dark clouds above dissipated leaving lily standing in the bright sunshine of morning she grasped her wand tightly in her hand and looked down at onyx who was looking up at her silently i ll re grow you later she said dazed from the dark magic she swiftly put onyx in her belt and turned around a group of people muggles if their attire was anything to go by was standing at the edge of the beach staring at her fearfully there was a sudden blanket of pale light over them and they started talking casually to each other no longer watching her in the next minute lily found herself being escorted away at wandpoint severus closed his eyes sighing with relief as he crumbled the slip of parchment in his hand safe read potter scrawl severus wasntsure whether that meant caught by the order or let free but he truly didntcare as long as she was all right and away from him as though reading his mind which due to vigilant occlumency he most definitely was not rudolphus leaned across the table any news on the latest escape severus shook his head not yet he lied smoothly rudolphus schooled and tore off a piece of his sandwich she d better be back soon severus shrugged lightly he cantget much angrier not that rudolphus growled he looked from side to side the wedding you and bellatrix severus muttered masking his confusion by taking a sip of his pumpkin juice no evans and rabastan severus choked on his drink he used a small spell to clear his throat and croaked pardon the d he wanted a good match for the stunner rudolphus confided he looked down to where rabastan was laughing with his buddies stroking his newly grown goatee every minute or so the lestranges are exceedingly pure i just think he got the wrong one of us i sure he didntwant to split you and bellatrix you ve been engaged since birth correct severus asked trying not to burst into a rage rudolphus shrugged and his eyes darted to where the haughty bellatrix sat not replying he knows best severus said returning to his food with a mask over his furious eyes you have absolutely no right to hold me here lily said making sure her accent was neutral you ll see miss no name that we so replied the well groomed man an alien performing dark magic on a muggle beach it doesntget much worse lily had been interrogated enough to keep silent about that to be honest american aurors even looked the same as british with the exception of moody all aurors tended to have impeccable hair and intimidating poses what country are you from ireland england norway scotland the man continued lily didntflinch canada the woman cut in officer weseman just being nice yo either going to tell us now or yo going to tell us later yo only what eighteen ye dontknow the rules of the big bad world i got news this aintsome gossip secret we need yo name and yo country now we could just hook her up to a pensieve the man bluffed or inject veritaserum the woman added the door opened and a man handed a manila file of officer weseman before exiting weseman skimmed over it briefly then turned to the woman guess what they found in her belt he said handing her the papers louis vuitton clothes dior coach a boat a sn she looked up nose flared you had a cobra in your pocket the man shrugged and turned to face lily anything you d like to say before we lock you up is the fountain running she asked quietly the man frowned but the woman face froze behind him looking bewildered weseman motioned for her to stand pulling out handcuffs no the woman objected give me a few minutes with her you know please i the best i ll be fine the man nodded cautiously and left the room is the fountain running the woman repeated slowly not at the moment yo not as important as we re making out suspicious lily said name two you name two the woman challenged the two women were locked in a battle of wills but the cop gave in first well there the d man obviously she said and that one who always so moody before you get me into the american legal system you want to call one of them lily advised the woman paused then left the room ten minutes later lily was re strapping her belt with onyx finally enlarged around her neck the woman an order agent name grant as lily found out nodded to her as lily left the building edgar told me you were safe she muttered dontprove him wrong marissa grant jotted a note down about the capture and release of the order girl she could hardly believe that dumbledore had sunk to the level of recruiting a student the door to her office creaked open and weseman easily identified footfalls neared her small desk marissa set aside her quill and folded her paper yes she asked shortly he didntanswer something quite rare cat got cha tongue she joked looking up there was a strange look in his eyes a mix of fear and desperation where the girl he asked his voice was flatter than she had ever heard it he was normally so perky why she asked eyebrows furrowed you okay just tell me where she is i not joking i noticed marissa replied her hands drifted to her wand she gone his face tightened where dunno listen eseman tell me what wrong i can help marissa soothed no you can t weseman said panting no one can his wand was suddenly pointing at her face tell me now thinking back to her conversation with edgar bones she said the girl was part of a british intelligence agency they re on our side it okay weseman looked furious your side maybe you work for the order of the phoenix dontyou he accused suddenly wait weseman hold avada kedavra sorry it was short thought i should update though lily decided that virginia was the most beautiful area she had ever seen soft mountains guarded her the air was crisp and magic was free however bones knew she was here so she d have to move on montana where ya ll wanna go suggested a souvenir shop cashier nice and open you and yer group can go thur lily left the shop grateful but with ears grated by the harsh southern accent i heard ye in there said an elderly man standing by the door running from you know who lily regarded him without speaking the man shrugged under her scrutiny most brits are and only wizards would walk around a place like this wearing that he said gesturing to her designer outfit seeing that she wasntgoing to respond he leaned closer most of them go to a big colony in salem think it funny ironic like i d head there he winked and limped away lily inspected her chipped nail polish and murmured to her two and three dimensional serpent companions i know where we re not going then there were dual hisses of agreement ginger snap dumbledore asked cheerily severus looked at the proffered candies in distaste no thank you headmaster dumbledore sighed and leaned back in his chair have you had any correspondence with miss evans no sir have you not exactly professor bones spoke briefly with her in london but she vanished again dumbledore answered readily and she safe from what professor bones would see yes now mister snape i need to ask you why she left was she all right as much as usual severus replied evasively he really didntwant to five away things she didntwant known though the feeling was apparently no longer mutual lily was severus best friend that doesnthelp mister snape and you know it dumbledore said eyes twinkling in amusement i sorry sir severus said delicately i shouldntsay more but you know more dumbledore said severus you do realize why you are a spy correct at severus silence he said we need you to give us information to help win this war angered severus stared stoically at the wall above the headmaster head if you donthelp us dumbledore said seriously a resigned flavor in his voice we wonthave much evidence in your favor should you get arrested severus felt the blood drain from his face and he tried to calm his breathing could you give me a few reasons why she might have run dumbledore asked pleasant tone back though he hated to admit it severus was intimidated i sure you already know it all severus stalled please tell me anyways she probably felt guilty about fairfield severus offered the headmaster nodded for him to continue the dark lord probably did something that scared her he said tentatively you were there correct dumbledore verified at first severus admitted but when she revealed herself we were all sent away what did voldemort do surely you found out somehow dumbeldore said calmly well i sure the cruciartus was employed at some point severus muttered dumbledore frowned slightly i dontthink so he said she didntmention that why would she severus challenged he regained his calm demeanor what did you ask why what had happened of course everything important dumbledore said oblivious to the point severus was making she obvi she didntthink it was important severus told him how would that affect the war it wouldntstop you from making her go in again there was a bitter sting in severus last words they had promised not to make her a spy but she had sent in and hurt anyways i ll look into that anything else dumbledore asked shuffling a paper on his desk severus paused he also he also announced her engagement dumbledore froze pardon he met severus eyes surely she would have told us that severus resisted the urge to scowl or shout she obviously didntthat her future mattered to his war is that all headmaster severus asked icily rage boiling inside him yes said the headmaster not really focused on the conversation anymore thank you mister snape who needs magic lily asked herself speeding down the highway in her new bmw woohoo she shouted into the night onyx curled in the passenger seat groaned i hungry so are you the mark reminded lily pull over get food and let our brother hunt now that the mark mentioned it lily noticed her stomach growling she found herself a little while later in a small burger joint sipping on a chocolate milkshake and eating a greasy cheeseburger i do not like american food her tattoo told her i think i do lily muttered thoughtfully taking another bite this is a bloody waste of time exclaimed a voice lily froze everywhere e says check the moon not yet thank goodness another said i think she somewhere near just not here what self respecting wizard would be caught dead here i dunno besides we donteven know what she looks like the first said there was a crunching sound these fries are amazing the voices came from the bar only meters from lily at least she had the hat she had gotten from the man in london to cover her traitorous hair let go groaned the second she ll be in brazil by now nuh uh objected the first i wanna eat my fries lily closed her eyes should she risk drawing attention to herself by leaving or should she let them walk right by her besides the man continued if the order did get her she d be back in england take the fries wit ya said the second irritated the two rose and trudged towards the door lily busied herself by squeezing ketchup packets onto her plate hey said the second lily looked up cautiously an enormous man was looking down at her scrutinizing her can i have a few of those he asked gesturing to her abundant ketchup packs go ahead she said smiling weakly thanks he said hey joe wait up he hurried to catch up to his partner he is an idiot the mark mentioned once he was out of the door lily had to agree lily strolled through the house one bedroom one bathroom in a nice small muggle town all the necessities were there so why was she so unsure dontstop said a voice in her mind her own voice for once run lily slinked back into her sleek car and slammed the gas pedal onyx well fed if the lump in his middle was anything to go by looked up disgruntled by the sudden motion not here he asked no lily replied off handedly a little farther and to all of you who are not students meet at ten for an attack the dark lord hissed milord asked a man head bowed yes abarax he acknowledged calmly where the dark lord whirled on him immediately suspicious here why is the location of the muggles important they are muggles either way of course milord murmured malfoy any leads on the stunner voldemort hissed report to me after the meeting he told those who stepped forward first i wanted to ask a question to our hogwarts students a group of shorter death eaters stepped forward do any of you thick headed dimwits recall what i said would happen if the stunner vanished again there was complete silence in the small field well voldemort asked no one can remember still no answer cowards i believe it entailed certain punishments he allowed the words to sink in a moment before saying however i will give you all one week to locate her do not bother returning her to the school last for us to discuss he continued our little visit on sunday why were no intruders captured he paused no answer duff he asked whirling on a random follower n n no m milord he stammered sinking into a bow crucio voldemort watched the man writhe on the grass a smile twitching at his pale lips when the spell wore off duff was sobbing dontcry voldemort said disgusted crucio finally the man settled for screaming good voldemort murmured he turned back to the hogwarts students this is what awaits you should the stunner not be at my side in one weeks side dismissed america did have quite a variety of climate after a sweltering ride through an endless desert lily and her serpentine companions were in the dense city of phoenix street lights flickered under the bright stars overhead illuminating the slight girl in the silver bmw she was suppressing yawns she d have to pull over and sleep soon sitting at a red light lily looked sideways as a car revved its engine the teenager in front grinned at her and raised his eyebrows smacking his lips lily raised an eyebrow and revved her engine in return to the next stoplight she called to him his grin widened and his grin widened let go babe he replied the light turned green and they were off streaks on the road hood down and red hair streaming over the back of her silver car lily felt quite free adrenaline raced through her veins as she flew by the other cars barely avoiding hitting one van the other car stayed near her but the boy looked furious as the reached the next light with her in the lead she stopped on the other side of the light smirking he fishtailed and skidded to a halt next to her sweet ride he said wanna go again lily shook her head no thanks she replied we can raise the stakes he offered how about a date and if i win she asked he grinned that was for if you win lily laughed not going to happen mate she slammed on her gas pedal and screeched down the street leaving a baffled american behind i apoligze for disturbing you headmaster severus said stiffly that perfectly all right mr snape dumbledore said jovially their disagreement of earlier ignored there going to be an attack on muggles tomorrow night at ten severus burst where dumbledore asked severus paused i dontknow i apologize again headmaster that all right mr snape no need to apologize is that all severus nodded once and turned heel to leave the office are you okay dumbledore asked behind him severus paused thinking of the inevitable night of pain in seven days if lily was still on the loose yes i fine headmaster you are dismissed weseman lord voldemort said the man bowed quaking and disapparated voldemort paused and then cursed a nearby tree into a million pieces so that was it the order had smuggled velisna out of school then when she tried to escape and reach to him with dark magic she had been captured by american aurors and given back to the order voldemort growled and picked up a leftover mask ripping it apart they would pay the pacific really wasntthat great lily pondered at its edge all cliffs and seals maybe she d go back across the states or maybe into canada or down to brazil her options were limitless except for return to europe the thought of her home country made the open wound of fairfield death throbbed horribly and lily put a hand to her heart trying to contain her own wild feelings she shook her head grabbed onyx who had been eyeing the seals hungrily and jumped back into her car keep running the prophet the next morning held morbid news almost a dozen dead in a muggle town in southern england edgar shook his head and set the paper on his desk we need her back said a gruff voice from inside the fireplace she d have known where it was i know alastor edgar said closing his eyes i just wish she had had more time i wish those muggles had had more time too moody replied now go get her it a saturday no school get out there now i know you know where she is even if she doesntknow you know edgar sighed and faced the auror no time like the present eh moody head illuminated by the emerald flames said right and disappeared edgar tossed a pinch of floo powder into the flames after a moment his brother stuck his head through hey eddie he greeted dontcall me that edgar reminded him can i have some more coordinates i donteven get a hello fine here wait a second paul said withdrawing he handed a parchment through to edgar after a few minutes and stuck his head back in those are in america he told edgar she moves a lot eh yeah edgar agreed not listening hey thanks he said terminating the connection despite his brother protests he took a deep breath and gathered what he needed from his office in case she didntagree to come quietly lily headed downstairs to grab some of the more appetizing tidbits of the continental breakfast to take back upstairs to share with onyx the hotel had not been as fine as the others the bed was a little musty and the television had horrid reception but she was well rested in both mind and body as she turned a corner she froze upon hearing a familiar voice yes about this height she might have used the pseudonym smith lily saw bones talking to the worker behind the front desk posed casually she spun back around the corner and flattened herself against the wall we do keep customer confidentiality replied the teenage worker tentatively i not supposed to i work with the british government bones cut in swiftly this is a terrorist we re talking about her exclaimed the boy so you did see her bones said earnestly give me her room number dont lily pleaded silently don t please i was so close why should i believe you said the boy bravely though his voice broke she was nice besides foreign police have no say here leave n now before i call our police lily strained to hear ears sub consciously becoming those of her animagus wolf go on lily urged in her mind call the coppers go on listen bones said she could just imagine his bright honest expression as he leaned in for the kill not only would you be protecting your country but there also a price on her head half would go to you you re a bounty hunter the boy exclaimed though he was sounding more interested than horrified call the cops i a cop just a british one call in your police if you feel like it just give me the room there was a pause dontdo it it 419 said the boy tensely but if she doesntanswer dontgo breaking in you donthave a war hey wait up footsteps were pounding towards lily hallway she bolted adrenaline and rosake drought rushing through her veins the combined strength had her on the fourth floor before bones had reached the first she struggled to get the card into the lock glancing over her shoulder every few seconds the red lights above the lock continued to deny her entrance onyx she called through the door are you in there at first there was no answer and lily was keeping her eyes on the stairwell three doors away yes onyx said finally what onyx get away from the door lily said urgently she gave him five seconds then kicked in the door shards flew across the room covering it in a layer of wood dust onyx lily said worried he hadntmoved in time the black cobra slid out from the bathroom to her sighing lily moved forward and picked him up hold tight to my neck she told him stuffing her shrunken suitcases into her jean pocket as onyx latched to her neck she turned to the door edgar was leaning against the shattered doorway calm as undisturbed lake good morning he greeted smoothly should she run now or give him a chance to speak maybe he wasntthere to make her go back maybe lily we need you he said taking a step forward come back lily turned on her heel and was at the window in a millisecond she cast him one last look before diving out of the window and hitting the ground before the glass shards a stunning spell shot out overhead but she was already in her car and slamming in the keys she tore out of the parking lot in a silver blur once she was away form the hotel lily moved a hand up to pull the frozen onyx from her neck her fingers came away red onyx she exclaimed fearfully she pulled him off to find his lengthy body covered in blood and glass shards from the window are you all right onyx fell limply into the seat beside her it hurts sister make it stop edgar looked out of the window eyes helplessly following the course of the silver car he d have to follow quickly to catch her someone said an infuriated voice from behind him has to pay for this a man with a badge reading manager scowled at edgar as his three bodyguards looked around the wood covered room in amazement edgar casting another glance at the speeding car sighed reparo he intoned waving his wand around the room as everything hopped back in place before the muggles amazed eyes edgar turned his wand on them obliviate when he turned back to the window the silver car had vanished i sorry but we donthave anyone who treats snakes here a cobra no i sorry are you joking our expert on vacation at the moment may i take a message lily rushed into the next location on the phonebook page she had acquired the small zoo was near silent with faint splashing coming from one cage and howling from another quickly finding the long staff building lily entered hand stroking onyx battered body a man with silver streaked black hair looked up as she entered may i help you he asked politely though looking confused at the late night visitor i was just about to close up you see and do you have anyone who could help me i have a hurt snake the man held up a hand to calm her i the snake expert here what wrong he asked not noticing that the patient was wrapped around lily neck lily unwound onyx and set him gently on the desk brushing side the phone and a few papers a window shattered and the man eyes widened and he stood quickly and took a step away from the desk why isntit in a cage miss that is a dangerous animal i know she exclaimed exasperated i dontcare can you help him or not her hair was ruffled from her constantly running a hand through it and her emerald eyes were alive with worry the whole world was after her and her only friend in the country was dying the man began inspecting onyx cautiously running expert hands along with open wounds i ll see what i can do he said finally but i was just about to close up so i the only one here i may need some of your help to hold him down without my assistants all right i just need your insurance card and your permit she didntspeak eyes focused on her friend should i bite him asked onyx weakly raising his head to look at her fighting back a smile she murmured no no he going to help us lily assured him lily looked back at the zoo worker who was scrutinizing her with narrowed eyes you do have a permit to have this animal dontyou he said suspiciously stepping back from the cobra if not i afraid i cantwork on this snake seething lily said if you do not help him he ll die i ll pay you as much as you want i sorry the man said picking up the telephone but i have to report you you dial a single number and you will die lily growled wand to his head in a moment slowly the man put the receiver down dontdo anything you ll regret he said soothingly trying to look sideways at what she had pressed against his head oh i won t lily reassured him now help him the zoo worker spoke steadily we ll need to go to the er all of my supplies are in there lily nodded briskly and told onyx to wrap around her free arm he did so weakly and lily bit her tongue when she felt him smear blood across her arm lead the way she instructed the man wand still against his temple the moment they exited the office and entered a small white corridor he swung around fist aimed for her face lily caught it with the arm onyx was on and scowled didntyour mother ever tell you not to hit a girl she used her wand to send him into the nearest wall he got up quickly though his eyes were wide back down he said lily groaned this is wasting time you bloody idiot rictumsempra the muggle spun backwards into the wall again before he could get up again she had her wand inches from his left eye you dontknow what i can do she warned help me and you ll be fine now get up she ordered stepping back did you have to move your arm groaned onyx tightening himself on her as they moved forwards again sorry lily apologized he was asking for it you ll be all right the mark assured the cobra since they were sharing her arm this muggle has knowledge it in his eyes you know what else is in his eyes lily snarled as they entered the emergency surgery room he planning to try an escape again and he thinks i loony muggles the mark hissed in a voice full of contempt here we are the man said unnecessarily put your snake on the table go ahead lily said to onyx holding her arm beside the table dontbite him unless i tell you to as the snake long body hit the operating table he hissed cold a shudder ran the five foot length of the cobra as he tried to situate himself comfortably on the metal table colloportus lily muttered a few times locking every exit now she said turning back to the doctor you needed my assistance hand me the tweezers needles string and scissors he instructed looking over onyx again he walked to a silver sink and washed his hands methodically lily set the supplies on the table gripping her wand in one hand he came back to the metal table with a jar of white salve and pulled a small blue mask over his strong face what are you going to do doctor lily asked inspecting the tools hans he supplied doctor hans lily repeated petting onyx forehead lightly first i ll disinfect the wounds then stitch them up he listed mechanically pulling on a pair of white gloves have all the tools been well cleaned she asked inspecting the needle closely he nodded i believe so though we haventhad any surgeries recently scourgify lily muttered wand to the thin needle frothy soap covered it then was rinsed away there she said setting it back down begin the vet worked in silence for a few minutes then commented this is a fine specimen recently fed correct lily nodded watching as the needle deftly closed up one of the bigger gashes not fed much before that though correct there was a pause did that man feed you lily asked onyx softly feeling fury boil inside of her she ought to go back to england and kill that sleazy excuse for a snake charmer sometimes the snake replied dazedly as a numbing needle had already slowed his thoughts he needed me lily ran a tender thumb across his black forehead that right she told doctor hands before i got him she added hmmm said the man focusing back on his work for a moment he finished off the cut and moved to the next does it can it still bite he asked his eyes alight if he wants to lily replied easily the man didntlook up why hasnthe bitten me yet miss maybe he likes you she growled warningly the man chuckled softly that would make one of you he shook his head gently you re not going to tell me your name lily didntbother answering the question so he began casually where d you learn to talk to him i didntlearn lily said calmly it was rather sudden tell him something the man suggested voice still casual lily sighed deciding to humor him for example make him move his tail lily leaned in to onyx face could you move your tail back and forth once or twice onyx nodded feebly and twitched his tail before slumping back down fascinating said the man and he does whatever you say if he wants to lily replied with a shrug watching as stitched up his back she handed him the scissors when he gestured for them he trusts me we should bandage the rest said doctor hans would you give me that he said gesturing to a roll of white linen lily did so and ran a finger over onyx head again how are you holding up she asked him softy onyx hissed i am well but i have been better he ll be done with you in a mo lily told him turning back to the doctor she was he was wrapping most of onyx body in the fabric what d you say just then hans asked not to bite me i trust just asking how he was lily answered which is fine thanks to you tell him he welcome the doctor said smiling slightly as lily relayed the message hans watched the movement of her lips and she listened to him try to repeat her words softly add more of a hiss to it ackasssh narazha she said clearly he tried again accurate enough to get a surprised reaction from onyx thank you he said to lily eyes alive with the light of a man gaining knowledge lily collected onyx and draped him around her neck before shaking hans hand moving her wand to her other hand here she said handing him a stack of green paper he took it looking uncomfortable all of it for the trouble lily explained sorry for hurting you he touched the back of his much abused head that all right he said thanks for teaching me that lily smiled openly of course she aimed her wand quickly obliviate who is she paul finally burst after relaying another set of coordinates edgar looked appraisingly at his brother you dontwant to get involved he warned forget about her i cantwhen you call me every day for her location paul retorted just a brief overview please edgar paused let just say that whoever catches her will probably win the war paul paled you mean he looked from side to side death eaters are out there too he whispered edgar nodded i saw a guy with a thousand galleons bounty on his head yesterday i would have arrested him then and there but there were muggles everywhere paul shook his head i told you not to get involved in the war what ll i do when you get yourself killed edgar smiled call gringotts to see if you made it into my will he suggested cheekily paul laughed along with him thanks for the help bro edgar said pulling back from the emerald flames lily slipped her tan sunglasses over her eyes as the sun escaped from the snow capped mountains on either side of her onyx wrapped in a thick plaid blanket in the passenger seat muttered where are we in a sleep laden voice a spell made a heat lamp hover directly over him to ensure he was warm colorado lily told him how are you feeling onyx let out a small hiss dizzy what happened lily used one hand to tighten the cashmere scarf on her neck against the frigid air you got hurt so i took you to a doctor does anything hurt onyx tried to raise up to look at lily but fell back into the blanket everything he moaned when i move at least dontmove lily instructed are you warm enough she asked glaring at a snow pile on the edge of the road as though it had done her a great personal wrong light nice mumbled onyx before going back to sleep lily slowled slightly to turn a sharp corner then sped up again without onyx to talk with her and occupy her thoughts her thoughts began to drift to jessica fairfield guilt gripped her stomach making her physically flinch another death on her shoulders she gritted her teeth and pushed the gas pedal farther down leaving her thoughts behind your fault your fault taunted her mind eyes wild she urged the car to move even faster watching her speedometer push 120 she didntnotice the sharp curve of the mountain road directly ahead lily emerald eyes fluttered open to reveal a chillingly familiar room shacklebolt stood at the end of her bed pocketing his wand hello miss evans he thundered where bones she asked surprised that he wasntthere to gloat himself shacklebolt looked grave getting the anti venom we re lucky he didntdie that was a spiteful thing to do he continued setting that trap lily paused to mull over his words then her blood turned cold where the snake now she asked in an off hand voice we donated it to the london zoo lily stomach plummeted but she fought to keep a blank face you re only in here for today shacklebolt informed her you ll be returning to hogwarts in the morning because edgar wanted to talk to you actually said the auror checking his watch he should be in soon now i need to get back to work try not to cause any more damage shacklebolt left the cell with his eyes on his watch muttering to himself what asked the mark quietly happened to our brother lily quickly reined in her grief they sent him to a place where they keep animals safe she whispered the tattoo gave an angry hiss they should not take away your familiar it spat once a wizard witch finds her familiar it should never leave you think onyx was my familiar asked lily quietly closing her eyes and trying to breathe deeply the door opened quietly to reveal bones yes answered her tattoo softly lily furiously avoided bones gaze why did you run he asked immediately limping forward you know why lily spat rolling onto her back on the bed to glare at the ceiling i do bones murmured conjuring a chair to sit beside her bed and it not the excuse you ve been telling yourself worried where the conversation was headed lily stubbornly said i tired of you and him telling me what to do she kept her eyes glued to the ceiling who wouldntwant to live a long luxurious life that just what you want everyone to think bones said wisely do you want to know the real reason that was the real reason lily whispered there was a twisting in her gut as though her body was objecting to her lie i wanted escape that it no bones said i dontthink it is you feel guilty you feel so guilty that you can hardly live with yourself no lily argued softly i don t i dontcare you kept thinking of all those people you helped kill and you ran bones continued in a louder voice no lily whispered eyes locked away from him look at me and tell me you dontfeel bad bones challenged lily rolled sideways and sat up on the edge of the bed fluidly so she was directly in front of the auror she met bones hazel eyes but found that she couldntspeak you canteven think about those people you stunned the people you let die edgar said quietly each word hit lily like a knife you feel guilty because you hated jessica fairfield and now she dead killed by your father it was though there was a tiger inside of her tearing at her from the inside out no she croaked you feel guilty because you think you ve been just as creul and heartless as lord voldemort your fault your fault your fault cried her mind you you re drowning in the tears of everyone left behind you tried to run away from yourself bones finished in a whisper but to lily he was shouting she didntwant to hear this she couldnthear this suddenly she became aware of tears burning their path down her face n no i didn t she said brokenly i d dontcare at a all no emotion is more deadly than one that suppressed bones told her you just need to accept it i d didntwant to do any of it lily choked out i couldntlike petunia die she all the family i have left at least that what she told herself maybe that was just her excuse maybe she was as bad as him i never liked it like he did she told herself i hated it cantanyone get that she shrieked then why do you blame yourself asked bones calmly i should have found a way i the powerful stunner right lily shudder i should h have found a wa way to get p petunia away then let h him kill me it not your fault bones told her his face was as solemn as his words you shouldntblame yourself you just said i sh should lily exclaimed through sobs all your fault screamed her mind bones shook his head i said you did not that you should you said that voldemort took you when you were eleven then was able to break through your occlumency until last year any plans you had would have been quashed immediately that n not important lily argued i was th the one that killed your courisn remember do you not blame me she finished bitterly lily he said calmly how many times have you performed an unforgivable on an innocent person lily paused seven and they were bones prompted five imperius and two cruciatus curses she admitted remembering the screams with a flinch bones adopted a confused look well then how did you kill deborah he asked her shut up lily exclaimed just because i didnt kill her doesntmean it wasntmy fault why have you never cast a killing curse asked bones suddenly surely you know who 1 tried to make you cast it i couldntdo it she muttered all your fault do you know why bones was still speaking calmly because i weak lily snarled because you cantperform a killing curse unless you really want to bones told her you never wanted to kill anything and i know it so do you stop blaming yourself he ordered softly think it over he said standing up lily closed her eyes as he left the room and then laid back on the bed could he be right did it even matter whose fault it was if she had still committed the crimes where are you alastor growled through the fire you need to get started searching edgar gave a humorless smile one floor below lily evans alastor jumped hitting his disembodied head on the top of the hearth you found her and caught her he exclaimed surprised edgar nodded averting his eyes dontsaiy alastor growled whatever misgivings you have i dontwant to hear we shouldnthave taken her back he cut in sighing she feels just as guilty as i thought i know you wanted her to join our side but she in a very precarious mental state who are we to say she has to face her problems i could barely finish questioning her she was so distraught i dontfeel right about this i know we need her knowledge but sending her back to school would be dangerous she needs help edgar burst alastor rolled his eyes deal with it he said shortly i want her back in school and for her to stay there other than giving us more information on death eater movements and you he continued narrowing his eyes need to find a permanent replacement defense teacher i want your butt back on the field do it he instructed before terminating the connection edgar sighed leaning back in his chair how much sleep was he going to lose over this lily asked the mark of salazar tentively lily had been staring at it blankly eatching the snake silver and green diamonds and its black and red swirls wind their way lethargically around her hand mm she acknowledged softly what are you thinking the snake tattoo met her eyes you are quiet even if it wasntreally my fault they all died lily whispered voice going automatically to its comfort zone there is still all of europe and the world that blame me everyone except bones that is she muttered bitterly he just has to care doesnthe i d have been fine perfect in the states you were going insane the mark told her watching her intently i wasntalready she grumbled not really taking offense besides i couldnthurt anyone else in america she said more to herself than the tattoo you couldnthelp anyone either i already told you that master slytherin needs you to stop his newest heir the mark hissed you couldntfulfill your duty in america feeling sorry for yourself lily face froze i was not feeling sorry for myself she said words clipped yes you were argued the mark as though not noticing or caring that lily looked ready to burn her own hand off just to hurt the tattoo at that moment you ve been selfish about your own problems and didntcare about people who need you quiet lily ordered i wasn t all i do here is stun stun stun i was protecting everyone else and that why you robbed a bank to help other people the mark hissed i didn t that not i didntwant to die she muttered i dont want to die she corrected herself and i wasntreally thinking she admitted suddenly defensive lily said if you didntthink i was going the right thing why did you let me go the tattoo gave a sibilant laugh you would not have listened it reminded her i was waiting for an opportune time lily shook her head so slytherin she said sourly thank you besides i knew bones would find you soon enough after all there was that tracking charm lily gritted her teeth and whispered slowly what tracking charm sorry to disturb you professor edgar said as dumbledore approached the fire edgar shuffled on his knees to find a better position on the hard floor hundred of miles away from his head that quite all right dumbledore said easily could i offer you a ginger snap no thank you sir i here about lily edgar informed him dumbledore nodded cheery expression becoming more grave how may i help he asked clasping his hands in front of his bright violet robes first i wanted to say that she needs more than i mean she nearly insane with all her guilt and emotions i think we should send her to st mungo for intense therapy he said what about her education dumbledore asked him edgar struggled for words this is a bit more compared with her sanity in her state of i think it would be more beneficial for her to get help we cantkeep her safe in st mungo s dumbledore said she needs to return to school but i will look into options here is there anything else i can help you with edgar paused organizing his thoughts remember how you said that we need to know her thoughts to get her on our side he asked at dumbledore nod he continued well she been talking a lot to her tattoo and i d like to know what she saying do you have a way to translate parseltongue dumbledore didntfalter i ll need the memories you want to know come on through he said waving his wand to briefly take down some of the floo wards edgar rolled the rest of the way into dumbledore office his sleeping legs protesting at the sudden motion the office was as majestic as edgar remembered full of rich colors and odd magical gizmos the tall headmaster led him to a stone basin in the corner of the room unoccupied by fawkes a pensieve edgar murmured awed one of the rarest artifacts in the world just sitting in dumbledore office he inspected the rune engraved side fascinated place your wand to your temple think penasivia then pull the wand away slowly thinking of the memory dumbledore instructed edgar did so carefully focusing on what he saw of lily that morning when his wand tip was away from his head he felt strangely disoriented as though his very mind had become fuzzy and altered how many memories had he taken out which memory had he taken out it had something to do with the stunner you will feel slightly disoriented for a minute or two dumbledore said taking the wand from edgar limp hand and lowering the shimmering strand into a small unmarked vial attached to the edge of the basin as he pocketed the memory he continued i ll get a copy of the translation to you as soon as i can the results are confidential edgar reminded him dazedly stepping back towards the fireplace of course dumbledore said patting his back as he helped him back into the emerald flames i ll see you both tomorrow morning said dumbledore voice following edgar as he spun back to headquarters edgar moved to his bed and sat on the edge clasping his head in his hands now he just had to wait until it was time to talk to lily again he stood suddenly though his aching head protested he might as well wait in the observation room if anywhere despite the grilled cheese sandwich slid under the door a few hours ago for lunch lily stomach was growling discontentedly back to hogwarts tomorrow lily growled softly under her breath bellatrix black would no doubt corner her the moment she saw her lily could feign ignorance or blow her rival into a million pieces as appealing as annihilating bellatrix was lily still didntwant to return to the mundane school life and those dark nights where the dead haunted her dreams her stomach growled again the dull pain calling her attention suddenly she sat up straight on the bed where are you going asked the mark sharply as she swung her legs over the edge of the bed lily didntanswer slinking off the bed and standing quietly beside the door what do you think you re doing the mark hissed give up they ve got you you ve got me you mean lily whispered to it icily the mark twitched its tail angrily your destiny is unavoidable your job is to stop the heir the doorknob twisted quickly and lily held her breath before she could make her move however she found herself immobilized bones peered cautiously around the door then raised an eyebow lily what are you doing back there he asked in a tone a little too innocent and cheerful for her liking he levitated lily back to her bed retrieved the two plates of food from outside the door and closed it when he removed the spell from the girl she narrowed her eyes at him how did you know where i was she hissed lucky guess he said breezily more importantly why were you behind the door are you completely daft lily snarled actually you d be surprised how many people have asked me that bones said pleasantly well i guessing you were trying to run back to the land of the free right if i tell you where i going will you still follow me lilt retorted you re not going anywhere the mark told her we will not put up with any more escape acts what did it say bones asked casually inspecting the tattoo curiously nothing of consequence lily said coolly turning her head from the two beings who played the fates in her life bones handed her the plate of a ham sandwich and chips conjuring achair to sit next to her you re going back to school tomorrow he told her and you wontbe leaving until graduation i suppose that makes you happy lily muttered she was being too careless with her words she know but damn it she was infuriated actually bones said taking a bite of his sandwich i suggested that we put you in st mungo for a while lily had to force herself not to lash out at him i doubt that would solve anything well dumbledore agreed with you on that so you re going to hogwarts instead despite what you want bones said stuffing a chip in his mouth lily tore off the crust off the sandwich and ate it slowly dumbledore told me about the engagement he said suddenly lily paused and slowly swallowed the bread maybe he was bluffing pardon her voice came out icy you and the lestrange kid he continued the daft one lily features froze into her cold mask unfortunately you re correct lily murmured why do you mention it she asked if you act like you dontacre he wontdig deeper she told herself just wondering when you started dating that all bones said calmly lily jaw tightened stop acting like an idiot bones we both know you re not she said sharply i was just trying to remind you of all the reasons you never want to go back to that side bones said hazel eyes losing some of their sparkle i dontsee how i can help anymore on your side either lilt retorted you make me go to school with death eaters and go to his meetings dontgive me any freedom then expect me to respect you enough to stick around open your eyes no one in their right mind would trust a pack of conscience challenged hypocrites she took a deep breath and schooled her features just go away edgar paused looking guiltily aside then he looked back at her we have been a bit hypocritical he admitted but we were just trying to help you if you think that anything you ve done has helped me then maybe you really are an idiot she whispered eyes locked straight forward past his head she didntmove when he shot to his feet and left the room slamming the door behind him appetite gone she set the plate on the floor beside her bed and sat still on the edge carefully she closed her eyes trying to reign in her emotions her eyes snapped back open again however when bones burst back through the door if you help us we can prevent headlines like these bones said slamming a stack of newspapers of varying age onto the bed two dead muggles killed tortures dozens dead attack on hogsmeade dark mark appears again we get rid of voldemort we put an end to all this he said gesturing to the articles we just have to finish this then you ll be free the rest of your life if i have a life after this lily muttered looking over the articles i thought you said it wasntmy fault it not your fault he reiterated but it is your problem it everybody problem he turned and took a step towards the door those are what changed my mind about bringing you back here i was about to let you go then i saw what it would do 1 he says the fake name to calm her down she already on the verge of complete hysteria the final exam was simple runes had no practical portion and lily hated that it went by so quickly graduation was tomorrow afternoon and then she d be back on the train and then it was back to living as the stunner lily finished the test early so she sat staring into space for a full half hour like she needs more time to think she was considering rabastan lestrange distastefully when she heard something whizzing towards her lily ducked immediately and the ball of parchment brushed her hair before flying on to hit the wall several feet in front of her lily looked back to see sirius sitting at the table one back cross armed and scowling at her lily turned back forward without giving him the satisfaction of a reaction however once the fifth paper ball had missed her annoyance was making her finger clench into fists on the table she was surprised the test proctors hadntcaught sirius and accused him of cheating by throwing her the answers finally one landed on her desk of flying past lily saw this one had ink on it she unwrapped it and read the brief contents what the hell was the sharp message lily crumbed the paper back into a ball and allowed it to slip off her table to join the others on the floor another soon landed on her desk calmly lily opened it and scanned it coolly congratulations he heartbroken now you can go on and ruin a thousand other peoples lives with your daddy without showing her reaction she tipped the parchment off the edge of her table she knew james was heartbroken she d seen him with his friends and read his sadness but refused to repent james would get over her and his friends would just have to deal until them the balls of parchment kept coming but lily didntopen another after she had turned in her translation she hurried towards the door a hand clenched onto her forearm and turned her towards him sirius met her eyes challenging her to make a scene let talk he told her lily nodded once and allowed him to lead her out of her great hall and into the nearest empty classroom once they were out of sight of the other students lily cast a silencing spell over the room and turned expectably back to sirius well he asked gray eyes flashing angrily well what lily asked calmly meeting his dark gaze what your deal he asked why did you do it i sure james told you she said sirius crossed his arms no actually he won t so what happened lily quickly suppressed her love towards james he was protecting her even now just what she was trying to prevent frankly she said i didntlove him i never did that a lie sirius said too perceptively for her taste what did they say to you he asked eyes narrowed nothing if i could fool the dark lord into trusting me surely i could trick james potter she kept her voice emotionless knowing it would alienate the gryffindor voldemort threatened to kill you so you had to lie why would you lie to make james love you sirius asked disbelievingly for fun the words were evil to her but she forced herself to say them no reason not to and it was entertaining there were holes in her story but she hoped sirius irrational passion would aid her lies he very gullible then why tell him now school over and we graduate tomorrow sirius said voice rising he pathetic but he needed to know the truth lily said calmly sorry you ve got to deal with him now just tell him to move on sirius scowled when his hand darted to his pocket lily quickly immobilized him it ll wear off in a few minutes she told him removing the protective charms on the classroom and leaving the frustrated boy behind it just so weird remus said thoughtfully he was sitting with sirius by the lake surrounded by students celebrating the end of school things just dontadd up they spoke quietly though james was back up in their dormitory she seemed very serious no puns now please sirius said leaning against the warm grass sirius was frustrated that he couldnthelp his best friend who was in so much pain always remus noted did she really say it was for fun that not normal for her how do we know what normal for her if she been lying this whole time sirius asked what about her eyes remus asked suddenly sitting up straight why because remus said meeting sirius eyes if she was emotional then you d know she was being honest no emotions she was lying her eyes were blank sirius began uncertainly but maybe she just didntwant me to see she was telling you straight up why hide her feelings remus reasoned maybe voldemort did tell her to break up with him sirius was unconvinced we canttell james that and we cantconfront lily again if we tell james he ll get his hopes up and lily wonttell us either way but if she was forced to do it then she doesntreally want to do it remus said we should call bones he can read her well sirius nodded dontmention anything to james until we re sure he warned we cantbreak his heart again the two js were up early putting on their robes for graduation their arguing voices brought lily to consciousness but she did not get out of bed this was it after graduation she d be back on the hogwarts express for the last time and then it was back to nightshade mansion finally she dragged herself out of bed onyx refused to wake up and looked through her trunk she found the beautiful robes sirius had got her for christmas but could not wear them without attracting attention then again why not wear them this was her last day of school ever the last time she d see anyone here that she wouldnteither stun or employ later in life she shook the robes out sharply and slipped them on the fabric was soft and rested comfortably on her pale skin she brushed her hair methodically and tied it up in a high ponytail graduation was set for noon but they were supposed to gather for a seventh year reception at 11 lily nudged onyx and helped him slide up her arm and wrap around her slender neck we re leaving here soon lily assured him he hissed softly finally seeing that lily didntshare his joy he asked what wrong lily began down the staircase and replied to the invisible cobra i not ready to go back i mean i am she told the mark who had hissed in annoyance but i just not ready their conversation had to stop when lily entered the cleared out great hall where the rest of the seventh years were spread out talking to their friends and family lily stood at the edge of a small group to blend in and waited patiently for the ceremony to start lily said a voice tapping her shoulder fearing that james or one of the other marauders was trying to confront her lily turned slowly face carefully schooled to her shock bones stood casually behind her wearing a set of crisp blue dress robes and a large smile hello hello lily greeted cautiously she felt onyx shift on her neck still uncomfortable around him lily began to ask why he was there but held her tongue professor bones exclaimed another seventh year girl a ravenclaw hello marie he greeted eyes only flickering from lily face a second before returning lily may i speak with you lily nodded and gestured for him to talk he shook his head glancing around the crowded great hall outside we ll be back for the ceremony she followed him from the great hall to the same classroom she had talked with sirius the afternoon before school finally over bones said smiling i counted down for my graduation by day for two years lily didntrespond how are you feeling lily met his eyes and replied calmly prepared you ve got everything done no loose ends he pressed if you re going to ask about james just do it lily told him coolly well if you re going to tell me anything i dontreally have to ask right bones smiled and leaned against the door so anything you d like discuss it doesntmatter lily replied tonight it on the train back to being the stunner i wontbe seeing you or james or dumbledore again since i supposed to go through severus so no no last words we can keep him safe from voldemort you know i know she said dully james and petunia safe under order care next door she heard the voices quieting down so she gestured for bones to precede her through the door however he was still thinking over her words comprehension dawned in his eyes suddenly you think the ceremony starting lily said brushing past him and hurrying back into the great hall james patted his friends on the back before separating into the alphabetical line dumbledore stood at his podium and gave a short speech it was full of pride hope and memories but james barely listened this was the end of a life forever seven years were now his past the names began sirius was called up directly after bellatrix though he sent a scowl in her direction sirius was obviously happy james gave a cheer and pumped his fist in the air sirius grinned over at james before taking his place in the short line if we could hold the applause to the end mcgonagall said looking at james but a smile was on her lips as she continued reading evans lily delilah aria mcgonagall called reminiscent of the first time james had heard her name at their first year sorting james watched her as she took strode up quickly and took the diploma that made her a fully legal witch and stood to the side with the others soon it was james turn potter james leo mcgonagall said the walk to mcgonagall seemed to last forever briefly the sole center of attention he shook mcgonagall hand firmly and took the diploma she winked at him smiling congratulations she told him he stood in the line of graduates unfortunately separated from all of his friends except peter who stood within three students of james but remus high fived him as he walked back to his place in the line once everyone had received their diplomas and the cheers had died down dumbledore stood up now as hogwarts graduates please have one more small meal provided by your alma mater he gestured and the tables lining the great hall filled with platters of varied hors d oeuvres james caught sight of his mum happy face before he was engulfed in a tight hug his da hugged him next beaming i knew you d do it i so proud of you james his mum said his dad laughed you wouldntbelieve the amount of times i had to tell your mother you d be fine when we d get those letters from mcgonagall detailing your latest escapades he patted james back i really am so proud of you james heard the mutterings start around him but ignored it at first busy talking with his parents as the whispers spread james looked up from his friends and family to see what the focus of their attention was outside the tall great hall windows the day outside was bright and cheerful the students under seventh year were lounging by the lake he looked there first but everyone looked peaceful then james saw the triangle of black robed figures striding purposefully across the lawn towards the castle with a gasp he recognized lord voldemort leading the small group dumbledore voice rang out quiet he instructed silence immediately fell and expectant faces turned towards the headmaster it seems that the wards we lowered for family of the graduating had a slight glitch he said calmly if everyone would please sit down and erect a shield around your family there was rustling as people hastened to follow the instructions those still standing were the teachers bones and a few defiant students including james remus sirius bellatrix black rudolphus lestrange and lily evans james drew his wand the death eaters were there for lily they were willing to fight the students and teachers were ready to fight a few dozen yards from the destined battle scene was the hogwarts student population by the lake james gulped this was going to get ugly i going to lock down the castle and set a shield over the lake dumbledore announced to the worried parents there was a shattering of glass as a flash of red and black jumped through the window lily walked swiftly towards the death eaters not even glancing back at the stunned occupants of the great hall james felt as though the world was spinning around him james bones grabbed his arm speaking hurriedly she still loves you the words clicked in his mind while he was already running towards the window after lily his feet hit the lawn before he realized he didntactually have a plan but that didntstopf him from sprinting forward lily heard the shouts from behind her but ignored them as she met voldemort on the lawn at least this time you thought to blow the glass out before we jumped out onyx said from around her neck what are we doing this is what i have to do lily said softly they were closer to the forest than the castle when lily intersected the group of death eaters but were uncomfortably close to the lake she bowed to voldemort hello she greeted lady velisna the dark lord said sighing a smile ghosted his face which was handsome except his disconcerting red eyes he cast one hungry look up at the castle then motioned to the death eaters and the formation reversed we have what we came for he said they walked unhindered until they got close to the forbidden forest expelliarmus a voice cried behind them in unison the death eaters turned ready to fight voldemort pushing himself to the front of the formation and lily saw james standing defiantly alone in front of the half dozen wizards he saw lily and nodded to her adjusting his grip on his wand no she whispered the word was hardly audible to lily herself before the wizards had time pull out their wands lily whipped out her wand stupefy she shouted a bright flash of red swept over the death eaters and the three nearest death eaters closest to her fell over unconscious voldemort whirled around mouth open in shock that she had just attacked his forces run james she said leveling her wand with the remaining wizards as she backed slowly towards the forbidden forest it took the death eaters some time to react they had obviously not been expecting an attack from within their own group james raced past lily into the woods stupefy lily said again taking out the part of the group closest to her as they fell she turned and bolted into the woods if she could just get out far enough she could apparate away she ducked to avoid a low branch at the same time a slice of purple light shot over her head get her she heard voldemort yell and then the footsteps behind her sped up james she called her feet took her rapidly through the woods thanks to her runs and she feared she would overtake james and leave him between her and the group of death eaters james fell into step next to her startling her this way he said nodding to the left lily followed him without having to focus on directions also lily took the time to set a strong shield at their backs just in time why did you come after me she asked him following him over a fallen log we need more speed he said not answering her question he stuck his wand in his mouth and in the time of a blink james had transformed from his human body into a stag which was better equipped for running in the woods lily quickly followed by becoming a wolf she was thankful she had already set a shield because she could not cast any spells in her animal form other than speed another positive trait of their animagus forms was stealth behind them she heard the death eaters split up which meant they had lost their trail james and lily ran quickly and in sync lily felt she could predict james next turn just by being near him suddenly she realized where they were going and wanted to laugh but the wand clenched in her sharp teeth and her lack of a functioning voice box stopped her they burst into the clearing far ahead of the pursuers as they approached the shabbily made stall shade gave a frightened neigh obviously smelling lily wolf form they transformed as close to the stall as they could get and lily quickly opened the door the unicorn thestral mix backed up cautiously white leather wings folding nervously muttering calming words lily hooked shade up with a bridle with quick efficiency trying not let her sense of urgency spook the mixed breed she had ridden the hybrid but james had not but she knew they had no other choice as they led shade out of the stall a commotion from the edge of the woods threw lily into action can you jump up lily asked james handing him the reins he nodded and fluidly mounted shade but narrowly avoiding her wings which were flapping in irritation sorry he said i cantreally see her remember lily the mark hissed by her shoulder you cantdo this lily was about to answer when a pair of death eaters burst from the trees they spotted lily and james immediately and pointed their wands at them lily stepped away from james to meet them lily james said scrambling to dismount stay on she ordered i need to be able to jump on and leave right away as she spoke she drew a complex shape in the air and a blue glowing stone wall appeared between her and the oncoming death it wonthold them long she said turning back to james she stood next to him looking up into his eyes why did you come after me she asked i love you he said fiercely and you love me too i not going to let you throw your life away lily faltered if she went back to voldemort james would finally be convinced to move on without her and finally be safe if she stayed with him people would be after her forever assuming the mark didntkill her the moment she made her decision life with her would be dangerous for james and she couldntforgive herself if he died for her sake but looking into his sincere hazel eyes she knew she couldntlive without him she nodded scoot back she said james smiled and her heart lifted this was the right choice she jumped onto shade just as her shield broke letting the death eaters come through james thrust the reins into her hands locked an arm around her small waist and said let fly i ll guard our backs without hesitation lily spurred shade into a run normally they started the take off from the edge of the field and lily worried if shade could pick up enough speed before the approaching line of trees especially with the added weight behind her james cast a quick spell down at the death eaters followed by a shield to protect them one death eater fell but the remaining one maintained pursuit lily nudged shade faster they were almost at the trees she pulled the reins up giving shade another nudge her wings snapped out and she leapt up into the air the wind from her long leather wings teased lily hair and james had to turn around unable to aim at the death eater through the flapping wings shade hooves hit the tops of the trees but they skimmed over safely away from the clearing lily laughed out loud leaning back slightly into james grasp i do love you she said though her winds were whipped away by the wind she thought james had not heard but he leaned forward and spoke into her ear i love you too i sorry i ever doubted you she shook her head dontworry about it she said i sorry i ever doubted you i should have let you make your own decision whether you wanted to stay together she sighed a soft sound lost in the afternoon air do we have a plan she asked glancing back over her shoulder at the quickly disappearing castle james laughed for once i actually do the flight was long despite shade speed and endurance they stopped twice in obscure little towns hiding shade in the woods while they took a short break from the intense flying despite it being summer the air grew cold and biting once the sun started to sink onyx complained loudly for several hours but eventually accepted the cold weather and james proximity they reached their destination past nightfall the air fairly crackled as they passed through the wards surrounding the large house my house is really protected every potter has added another ward james said into lily ear shade landed on the lawn gracefully and lily and james jumped off legs unstable on the solid ground lily looked up at the mansion it glowed with warm light from its windows casting scattered shadows on the grass despite its size the house did not loom it seemed as comforting and safe as hogwarts welcome to godric hollow james said gesturing to the house lily sighed dumbledore wontlet me stay here she argued do you want to stay james asked his expression warred between hopeful and wary yes the word escaped her lip hopelessly she was increasingly regretting her rash decision but hiding with james was so appealing then i wontlet him make you leave my parents can charm this area so no one can come in no on you dontwant go back the mark instructed your sister safe with the order james reminded her there nothing stopping you from staying there are other things lily said trying to think of them without success if this house was truly as warded as james said she was protected from voldemort and dumbledore here she had no further obligation to them go now or i ll the mark hissed lily suddenly jerked back her sleeve and glared at the tattoo then do it she snapped the mark hissed softly at her showing its fangs but did not attack realization flooded lily mind and she laughed derisively you can t can you she asked you re still kin of master salazar now i am here to protect you not harm you the mark admitted but it is your destiny to no death threat then there no way i ll do what you want me to she said she jerked her sleeve back down over the tattoo and looked back up at james i i dontknow if this can last she said hesitantly but as long as i can be here i want to be here james rushed to her and swept her into his arms he leaned to kiss her but hesitated why did you lily shook her head it doesntmatter i love you she leaned up and kissed him softly he leaned back i need to know i trusted you was i right yes lily said i was worried that if dumbledore knew i loved you knew you love me back it would be a tool for him even worse if the dark lord found out you selfless james moaned crashing his lips against her i love you he said softly pulling back and meeting her eyes and that why it was the most selfish thing i ve ever done i cantstand to see you killed you could have gotten over me and i d at least know i d saved you she said that where you were wrong i could never get over you i love you lily considered futilely arguing her point but found her lips were too busy to form words the end after four years of writing this story lily finally got her happy ending i think i got everything wrapped up well the epilogue is coming soon thank you for reading and i hope you enjoyed
