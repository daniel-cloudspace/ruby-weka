 disclaimer all characters involved in this story arentmine they are strictly property of j k rowling hey thanks for taking the time to read my second story his hermione and i hope whether you hate it or love it that you leave a review because it would be greatly appreciated anywayz to the story then ron weasley had never attracted very much attention even with his radiant red hair and boisterous personality he was always considered second hand perhaps it was because everything he owned was second hand or perhaps it was because his best friend was the infamous harry potter he knew harry didntwant all the attention he got but ron couldnthelp but be a bit envious of him all the same now however ron put his jealously in the back of his head he was in his seventh year of hogwarts and the only person he really wanted attention from was the one person who hardly paid him any ron he whirled around robes flailing with him there she was in all her glory or rather fury at the time being with her eyes flaring dangerously what up mione ron questioned carelessly what up i ll tell you what up ron weasley what up is that you didntshow up for patrolling today hermione burst forth shooting dagers at him oh come on hermione give me a break i was working on an essay for charms ron chided and a grin spread across his face as he saw her anger grow sometimes he deliberately angered her just to see her reaction which ron now found endearing you know perfectly well that the essay was supposed to be finished for last week you were just too busy finishing up other late assignments to work on it hermione said sharply if you dontpick up your act you re going to fail your n e w t s of course i won t i ve got you to help me ron replied still grinning cheekily you know one day i wontbe there and you ll regret always relying on me hermione said dryly clearly not amused well as long as i donthave to regret it today i all good thanks ron said hermione moved a clump of bushy hair out of her face and glared at him without saying another word she began stomping down the hall ron pursued her you donthave to be so uptight you know ron tutted he had obviously said something offensive because hermione looked at him scandalized ron you are truly the most insufferable git that i ve ever laid my eyes on hermione said crossly hey that unfair ron said frowning what about draco malfoy at least draco malfoy made head boy hermione retorted eh so you re still not believing my theory about dumbledore being under the imperius curse when he made that descision ron asked playfully haha hermione said sarcastically what that do i detect of hint of humour in the head girl voice ron joked hermione pace quickened obviously she no longer wished to converse with him even though ron knew they would eventually make up he couldnthelp but feel the burn in his heart at her coldness aw i sorry hermione ron said easily catching up with her becoming captain of the quidditch team had done him good she gave him a testy look oh go on forgive the prat ron and hermione and both looked up to find harry standing there a smile playing on his lips oi mate what re you doing here ron questioned smiling at his best mate who also happened to be the biggest git aside from malfoy ron knew yes i should ask the same hermione said promptly you should be in your dormitory by now if a prefect caught you i would put on my invisibility cloak harry finished making hermione frown harry noticed this and added no need to get mad at me too herms hermione sighed how many times have i told the two of you to stop calling me herms it an utterly repulsive nickname harry and ron exchanged amused glances anyway harry said quickly changing the subject i ve just been to the restricted section of the library and it turns out that book on prophecies is signed out and i was shifting through madame pince desk his got him a rather accusatory glare from hermione oh come on hermione i had to i needed to find out who signed the book out well it turns out snape of all people has it ron eyes widened i telling you snape is a shoe in for becoming death eater of the month oh stop it ron he is not a death eater hermione said for the hundreth time got proof to back that up ron challenged is dumbledore trust not proof enough for you and he in the order hermione said counting off various reasons i ll just leave you two to your bickering then i going to bed harry said clapping ron on the back he threw on his invisibility cloak and was gone or at least it appeared to ron and hermione that he was hermione didntwaste any of her time standing there and commenced huffing down the hallway my god woman are you still angry ron asked rather alarmed of course i still angry we didntget our patrolling done and it all your fault hermione said practically growling well then what do you think we re doing now ron said if this isntpatrolling i dunno what is this only added wood to the flame sometimes you surprise me by how much stupider you get each time we meet hermione said in a disgusted tone hey that one stung a bit ron said good you ve become so cocky lately hermione said crossly becoming quidditch captain has definately gone to your head evidently you dontseem to realized that you only got the position because harry turned it down hermione immediately regretted what she just said ron i didntmean oh no i get it i second to harry is that it ron said hermione had taken a shot at ron pride and it seemed she hit bulls eye now it was ron turn to spin around the head off in the opposite direction he knew this was completely idiotic of course since gryffindor tower was in the way he was coming from he heard clacking on the stone floor as hermione ran to be able to keep pace beside him ron stop walking so fast ron come on ron hermione cried frustrated he stopped ears burning and turned around what he demanded sharply ron you know i didntmean it the way it came out hermione panted i think of you and harry as equals somehow that bothered ron even more he didntwant hermione to think of him and harry as equals he wanted her to think of him as something more romantically that is i ll only accept your apology if you accept mine ron said stating what he thought was a very fair deal accepted hermione said in a voice uncannily like professor mcgonagall s ron flashed her a smile which recently had become a rather handsome even if he did think so himself not that he was a lockhart or anything they had finally reached the portrait of the fat lady who was currently looking critically in the mirror at her own painted reflection when they arrived she placed the mirror in her lap and said password godric hollow ron said automatically not caring to pay attention to what he was saying the fat lady swung open and they both stepped inside the common room was rather empiter than usual no one dared to stay up to late these a days fear shrouded them all fear of lord voldemort and his death eaters ron sighed if any of them knew what one of their fellow student was going through he almost ached for harry when he thought about the prophecy of course they joked and laughed but there always remained the feeling of foreboding what would happen if they were never like this again never again just two best mates who were laughing over something completely innocent ron snorted okay well maybe not completely innocent sometimes ron felt lucky he wasntin harry position but other times he wished that he could be in harry place just so he could take the blow instead of his best friend good night ron hermione mumbled now looking drowsy night herms ron said and he smiled when he noticed her mutter darkly to herself upon hearing the nickname he watched her step upstairs to the girls dormitories and sunk into an armchair before the war was over just in case he wouldntlive he would have to tell hermione about how much he loved her but it could all wait till later it need not be tonight and tomorrow night was out of the question too but someday he would tell the woman he loved just how much he cared she was definately worth his time get up ron harry said trying to shake ron awake uh bluh ron moaned in protest harry retaliated by pulling his blanket from under him there was a loud thud as ron hit the ground what did you do that for ron said crossly you have got to wake up mate we have n e w t today and it fifteen minutes till breakfast ends harry said so unless you want to go into your n e w t without any food then i really doing you a favor what a load of dung ron retorted harry grinned grudgingly ron got up and staggered towards the bathroom ron harry hermione shrill voice in the morning made both boys jump if you lot dontget down here in exactly two minutes i off to breakfast because i unlike you am prepared better hurry up harry said seriously ron nodded no use in upsetting hermione on exams day after a quick escapade around their dorm harry and ron met hermione at the bottom of the staircase you two look like a tornado swept passed your room and hit you both along the way hermione said disapprovingly harry did you even comb your hair and ron you ve got a booger up your nose which is very noticable both boys fixed whatever problem they had with ron being extra cautious as hermione was making sure he didntfinish the bogey off in the quickest possible way are we okay now ron asked sighing well yes i suppose hermione said reluctantly i suppose we can go down to breakfast and beyond harry said dramatically ron laughed at this and hermione rolled her eyes will you two behave hermione said once ron had calmed down and they were walking down to the great hall yes mother ron chatisied hermione gave him her don t push me look i really dontknow how i put up with your constant idiocies hermione said watching annoyed as harry and ron were having a battle with their quills something to do with how much you love i believe harry suggested so seriously that ron snickered they finally reached the great hall which was full of students attempting to eat and have a last minute cram session the trio squeezed in between neville who was frantically reading over his herbology textbook and parvati patil who was checking her cup to see if she could see anything wotcher neville ron said pouring himself some pumpkin juice i what if i fail herbology neville whimpered you won t it your best subject harry said rather alarmed that neville might cry as long as you ve studied you have nothing to worry about hermione reassured him that such a hermione thing to say ron smirked ronald weasley you ve been harrying me all day hermione spat she stood from her spot at the table and rushed out of the great hall what got her books in a twist ron said sourly well she loves you and you ve hurt her feelings obviously came luna lovegood voice rather teasing she settled down at gryffindor table beside harry and placed a kiss on his cheek ron pouted you re wrong you know she doesntlove me uh yeah she does harry said puh leeze you re just agreeing with your girlfriend ron said no well harry said smiling as luna kissed his lips maybe but you love her luna said simply i do not ron said hoping that his red ears werentgiving him away do too neville said bearing in on the conversation neville you keep out of my sordid affairs ron exclaimed eyeing harry and luna ron had another reason to be jealous of harry he had found the girl of his dreams and they were two crazy fools literally in luna case madly in love luna may have been a tad weird but she was still cool harry luna and neville laughed at ron dismay the whole world is aspiring against me ron muttered ron and harry lay sprawled lazily on the sweeping green lawn it was a hot summer day and no one was indoors they had just finished their latest n e w t and were now talking over how bad they had done did you understand question 23 a harry asked which one was that again ron questioned you know the one with which charm do you use to reverse the fernanexsspell harry said ah that one no i didntget it at all ron said i wrote some rubbish about the flippendo spell where hermione she d know harry said scratching his ear no idea ron said and as if on cue hermione showed up her face was flushed a bright red instead of plopping down on the ground as usual she remained standing her face looked excited as if she had a juicy secret to tell sup mione harry said curiously noticing what ron had hermione face grew redder well if you must know seamus finnigan has just asked me out what ron exclaimed and he was so stunned that he rose immediately knocking both the contents of his and harry bookbags on the grass well you donthave to look so surprised hermione said hermione you and seamus i never would have thought harry said shock apparent on his face good on you hermione smiled at harry encouragement but ron glared at him hadntharry just said this morning that hermione loved ron but you two have nothing in common ron said still flabbergasted oh you d be surprised hermione said slyly hermione ron replied i think you re making a big mistake the smile on hermione face faded why do you always have to put down whatever i do hermione said suddenly and she looked wounded with viktor with s p e w with my work ethics and now with seamus why canti ever please you ron was suddenly silenced he didntknow what to say he always teased hermione but he didntever imagine he had been hurting her oh i glad you can shush up now hermione said tears filling up in those big brown eyes it pained him to see her upset she slowly got up and took her time to head up to hogwarts many times ron wanted to run up to her and tell her he was sorry and that he loved her he really did but something stopped him you prat why didntyou stop her harry said sounding genuinely angry i ll talk to her later i suppose ron said sighing still bewildered he had never seen hermione so upset he d be sure to concile her and maybe even buy her a new book to please her what ron wasntaware of though was that tonight would be the night when the final battle would be launched between harry and lord voldemort and the second war would end deciding the the fate of country author note r r please i hope you enjoyed it disclaimer sigh i think i have an identity crisis because i writing

birthdays thought i would have to choose one or the other but i getting a massive fluff request because no one likes to see poor ronniekins so distraught so voila this chapter has been born that what you got hermione after forgetting her birthday a sunshine gift bag arentthose things like cheaper than a box of bertie botts every flavor beans harry asked in a mock serious voice before falling into peels of laughter ron scowled at him as he rolled on his own rug it not my fault that seamus stole my gift ron grumbled crossing his arms over his chest in a childish manner he had been sulking all day and had annoyed the hell out of anyone who he met finally ending up in luna and harry apartment he waited until harry had fully finished laughing before glaring at him oh dontgive me that harry said i invented that ron didntanswer but just chose to glare at some other inanimite object in the apartment it was by far the most beautiful apartment ron had seen in all his wanderings it almost gave him the feeling of gryffindor common room with it red draperies and gold finishes entrancing and peculiar objects were constantly in movement around the room most were of course things luna had gathered together from all over the wide spread of five continents the only places that had missed out on a visit from her were north america and antarctica not that she wasntintrigued to go but there hadntbeen enough time maybe he d got it wrong this apartment was not so much the gryffindor common room as it was dumbledore office so when are you planning to go to the party anyways harry questioned ron snapped his head up so fast his neck gave a ear splitting crack both boys cringed and ron started to rub his neck how do you know i even going ron sniffed and stood up he wandered over to the bookshelf and pretended to skim through all the different titles written across the spine he knew that he had no reason to be so crude to his best mate but hadntharry done the same thing to ron most of their fifth sixth and seventh year ron harry called out ron kept staring at the spines of the book but was intently listening to harry at the same time now that your up can you get me something to eat ron shot harry a venemous look but as if on cue his own stomach let out a low grumble of hunger harry eyes flickered to ron stomach and back to his face with a slight smile looks like i not the only person that starving harry said grinning ron couldnthelp but return a sheepish grin back he stepped into the kitchen and opened many finely furnished cupboards after the other bread bagels apples parsley powdered unicorn horn yogurt tomatoes frosted gingersnaps and butterbeer chilli peppers wait frosted gingersnaps and butterbeer how about frosted gingersnaps and butterbeer ron voice rang out harry returned a bellow of approval and both boys sat down to a feast of sugary delight everybody was to meet at the burrow and leave together to arrive at hermione birthday party the house was filled with a more odder looking crowd that usual everyone was dressed in elegant muggle clothing and looked rather uncomfortable and funny but ron had to admit all the women did look spiffy my goodness is this outfit meant to be worn or meant to suffocate mrs weasley huffed waving a fan close to her face she was wearing a rather nice soft yellow suited top with a skirt she looked rather hassled though will you look at this blouse it practically pushing my bosoms out of it mrs weasley complained muggles and their fashion i will never quite understand it you look lovely molly dear like a real muggle mr weasley responded he was wearing something harry mentioned as a tux or something he was entirely black and white as were all the boys present it seemed muggle men only wore these colors where as women wore every hue of the rainbow ron yawned and slumped onto a couch he had put up quite the fight to not go and he had most of them convinced that he had seriously been thinking about skipping the celebration but had flashed him a stealthy glare which quickly ceased his pouting he reached up to the collar of his outfit and loosened it a bit he wondered why muggles wore their clothes so tight only harry managed to keep his twitching under control mum can i take off this what it called again harry a bow tie this bow tie fred asked mrs weasley whirled on him as if daring him to ask that again actually i all good fred said almost quivering under this mother glare arthur how exactly are we going to reach this bakers hall mrs weasley asked it a muggle banquet hall so i doubt you know where it is bakers hall i know where that is it a few minutes walk from the monument and tower hill underground stations harry explained the rest of the family stared at him just as throughly confused as before he gave his explaination harry sighed dontworry i ll make sure we get there all right but we should get a move on if we want to get there in time just as soon as the girls get down here clarified evidently she had enough patience to wait for four girls to get ready but she did not have the same courtesy of patience to talk to the boys kindly sooner or later the girls began descending the steps and ron was sure they would be the prettiest ones there their only true competition could be hermione fleur and penelope were wearing two red gowns that looked almost identical except perhaps fleur was cut higher up their blonde hair was complimented beautifully and penelope looked for once as if her beauty could actually rival that of fleur s ginny chose we wear a black gown that was simple but contrasted with ginny best feature her shoulders ron was grateful she wasntwearing anything red too much of a clash with her hair in her black gown though even ginny freckles looked ladylike and finally luna clomped down the stairs last of all in a silky blue dress with a sweater draped over it her blonde hair was combed nicely and actually looked golden for once the girls looked much more comfortable in their outfits that the boys did you all look like penguins luna said gleefully penguins harry said blinking yes all black and white penguins luna repeated happily do all muggle men dress like penguins harry looked as if he were about to say something important but ended up saying yes they do sweetheart ron smiled thoughtfully he was going to have that too someday the whole course of the party ron was sure to steer clear of hermione she was probably still angry at him and wouldntwant him around her the whole party angered ron anyways he grimaced as he thought of the gift opening he d have the cheapest gift of all ron ronald weasley ron turned around and came face to face with the most gifted women he d ever met mrs granger his women had actually given birth to a creature as precious as hermione good evening mrs granger ron responded how are you fine thank you mrs granger answered why look at you all neat and tidy you ve grown quite handsome she took his hand and stared at him proudly from top to bottom ron could feel his ears grow red thanks a bunch mrs granger ron mumbled erm you want to have a seat what a gentlemen mrs granger said smiling hermione smile they both took a seat at a vacant table suddenly a quiet washed over them and ron stared at couples on the dance floor swaying to a gentle beat he watched as bill and fleur passed them her head was tucked between his neck and shoulder and her hand was playing with the cringe of hair on the back of his neck his hands were carressing fleur back slowly and it struck ron that the only women with him now was a 45 year old who was married it made him feel oddly lonely like he had never felt before could it be that the invincible ron needed love hermione talks about you all the time mrs granger spoke suddenly frightening ron err she does ron said curiously yes she does says the most sweetest things about you mrs granger ron glanced at mrs granger to see if she was teasing him she didntlook like she was i glad you re taking care of her mrs granger went on she needs a man like you in her life mrs granger gave him an odd small smile before trailing off to the rest of bakers hall bakers hall was quite impressive by muggle standards and the waiters serving them were so fast that they were almost as good as the house elves the food was delicious and each dish was hermione favourite ron would know seeing as to how he was the one who d fed the information to seamus celestia warbeck hermione favourite singer had been hired ron knew this also because he was the one to tell seamus that too when the cake came out ron was surprised to see it wasntcheesecake since that was hermione favourite kind and he had told seamus so but instead a chocolate cake the size of colin with chocolate sauce practically dripping off it was served and the guests all clapped happily hermione face shone as seamus stood beside her occasionally kissing her on the cheek and when he felt right on the lips the crowd released sighs of contentment and ron felt his face grow hot with jealously when the birthday drawl had been sung the presents came out ron frowned when he noticed his was the smallest one hermione thin timid fingers began unwrapping them one by one each one got better than the one before it at last only ron and seamus gifts remained seamus probably wouldnthave wanted it any better way ron wouldnthave wanted it that way at all perhaps if his gift had been between the fifty and the last seventy hermione wouldnthave paid it much heed but now for the irony of it all she left ron as the last one and opened seamus first perhaps she believed the saying that the smallest packages contain the best gifts who this from hermione asked holding up an envelope that most likely contained a certificate of ownership over the star ron smiled slowly at how her best gift was smaller than ron s the worst gift it from me baby seamus replied wrapping his arms around hermione hips hermione smiled at him softly ron couldnthelp but notice how affectionate they were being today she carefully opened the envelope and she read the letter slowly when she was done she just sort of stared at it was she that amazed when she looked up it was at ron oddly enough her eyes stayed on him for barely five seconds before she let out a squeal of delight and jumped on seamus in a massive hug she planted a kiss on his cheek and after a while took to the next present a sunshine gift bag hermione smiled who this from then ron harry replied ron where is ron hermione asked looking around other people also turned and began searching it was to no avail though because ron was gone it was a cold autumn night and ron regretted not having brought a cloak to feel him warm the tower hill underground station was empty this time of night except for an old begger and his violin ron had searched his pockets for muggle money and had found a wad of it to give to the man money meant nothing anymore specially the muggle kind the dark almost drowned ron in sorrow he couldntbear to stay at the party and watch hermione open his gift he d barely been able to contain his frustration when she d thrown herself on seamus she probably sucking his face off right now ron thought darkly he stared down infront of him to the tunnel where the train came from he wondered what would happen if he binded himself to it what happened to wizards after they died anyways did they go to the same place as muggles if so was it heaven penny for your thoughts young man the old begger asked in his hoarse voice ron laughed sourly it alright sir i know you donthave a penny to spare the old man also managed to laugh heartily which surprised ron he was so poor and lowly yet he could still laugh why was it that ron couldntlaugh if he was so fortunate how about i tell you what up for free ron suggested well there this girl ah the old man commented smiling a toothy grin every good love story has a girl the girl yeah i suppose so well this girl definitely is the girl but she with this other guy ron continued and every good love story has the other guy the man said knowingly yeah well she with him i love her you catch my drift ron sighed and started to rub his forehead a long silence followed until it was broken by the old man this this girl does she have brown eyes the old man questioned ron looked up at him why yes and bushy brown hair the old man inquired with a slight smile playing on his face yeah yeah she does ron answered bewildered she got a warm peachy glow about her does she the old man asked yeah ron said his eyes widenining was this man a seer how do you know all this ron wanted to know because the girl is here the old man finished a massive grin sweeping his wrinkly face what ron thundered and whirled around hermione how much of that did you hear just this gentleman describing me hermione said gesturing towards the begger she lifted the bottom of her gorgeous white gown and came to sit beside ron on the dusty station bench you ll get your dress dirty ron murmured it doesntmatter hermione shrugged i missed you at the party today ron blushed did you i thought you hated me for forgetting your birthday i did hermione said simply but then as always i forgave you ron remained silent he was full aware that he hadntbeen so close to hermione for a long time how could i not hermione said after all you did get me that star ron stared at her incredulously um hermione sorry to burst your bubble but seamus got you that star hermione tinkling laugh rang through the air i know that you prat but i know full well he didntjust go to comos and astros inc on his own you took him there so either you or he could get the star for me ron let out small puffs of air that were visible in the cool night air yeah i guess sorry about the sunshine bag by the way s ok i know what you meant to do and it was very sweet hermione said leaning back on the bench and half of ron shoulder in a sudden surge of instinct he swung his arm around her shoulders and started to trace his fingers over her shoulder ron glanced at her strangely and realized she was shivering here have my erm thingy ron said taking his coat off hermione protested but he quickly wrapped her around it and she fell silent shit now he was freeezing but he was worth it to save hermione from a runny nose i glad you told seamus all that stuff about me hermione said softly and dontdeny it because i know i didnttell him all that stuff about my favourite food and music your welcome ron mumbled not quite sure what to say he felt his insides defrost under hermione appreciation you shouldnthave left the party hermione said gently i wanted a dance with you care to have one now ron suggested hermione smiled up at him and how will we do that she asked in mock innocence ron nodded towards the begger and his violin play it maestro the soft music of the violin weaved through the air as ron lended his arm to hermione she took it gingerly and they both strolled behind the bench where there was more space they blended well with the silvery notes of the begger as they got into position i ve been wanting a dance since the yule ball ron said quietly as they started to sway with poise me too hermione replied resting her head inbetween ron neck and shoulder he hadntfelt his heart ever thump so loudly he wondered if hermione could possibly hear it he started to stroke her hair with ease can you hear it ron questioned stupidly can i hear what hermione answered with a question as she held onto him snugly my heart ron supplied i dontthink so hermione said logically my heart beating too loudly for me to hear anything else ron felt his grip on her waist tighten somewhere the sudden ringing of bells sounded the official timing of three in the morning hermione pulled away it three she said unnecessarily keeping her eyes locked with his mmm ron nodded and slowly leaned his head in his forehead rested against hers and he turned it ever so slightly so that he could lean in close enough to kiss her her breathing grew harsh and the mist of her breath fell upon his own lips he reached a hand up to cup her chin and their eyes met in one intense moment which would seem like a millenium to them both he was close enough to smell the scent of chocolate cake on her breath her mouth opened slowly as if welcoming him in seamus is waiting she said abruptly pulling away from him before he got his kiss i have to go he stared at her blankly dontgo she was already at the steps and stopped when he spoke she turned at the same time the begger played a particularly beautiful note giving her the feel of an angel she walked back to him softly and took hold of his hand bringing it to her cheek you know you ve always had a hold on me ron hermione said breathlessly but i have to go she stood on tippy toes to place a faint kiss on his freckled cheek and released his hand ron watched her carry herself away from him and into the moonlight a rush of cold wind whipped through the underground station at her leave and all the warmth ron had felt drained away now he was a penguin without it coat author note sorry if i overdid the fluff but i really felt it there for a second i think at one point i might have been muttering the dialogue to myself lol insane i know i hope you like this chapter because i sure as hell did it was fun to write because it had more hermione ron passionate action than the rest of the chapters put together buuut enjoy the happiness while it lasts because you guys know me and the mushy

for reviews i actually surprised so many of you took the time to review and i love you for it because reviews make the world go round obviously well lack of homework and good tv shows led to this update lol not to mention the awesome reviews and my best friend ragging me to post the next chapter thanksgiving was quick on its way and everyone in the burrow was fearfully anticipating it every year jocelyn peasegood mrs weasley sister would drop in for dinner with her husband arnold and their four children ross sissy perry and lola the most horrible thing about this out of town family who lived in manchester was that every time they came they brought a whole mass of critical comments around with them mrs weasley was always stressed at thanksgiving striving to prove which prewett sister was truly the better of the two and worked her own family hard to prove it since they were older now mrs weasley allowed them to bring escorts to the big dinner in fact she forced it upon them to bring someone both beautiful and intelligent because after all shouldntjocelyn know that her children were in the market and always had a fine young suitor or suitress after them ron highly doubted that anyone would want to date the peasegood children seeing as to how insufferably annoying they all were there was ross the eldest of them all who only cared to eat and sleep especially with young pretty witches his head might ve fallen off if the hands of a higher power didntscrew it on perhaps dumbledore sissy was a complete other story like her mother in everyway she lived only to sneer over how much better she was then the weasley family which made them want to pick on her even more and perry the third child to be born was like sissy except he cared to disagree with only one member of the family in particular percy they both had ambitions to be minister for magic and both were working in the ministry side by side competing constantly and last but definitely not least was lola ginny was about two years her elder in her younger days lola had taken up the hobby of constantly cutting the heads off of ginny porcelain dolls and hexing her stuffed animals to fly about her room at night howling causing ginny to have the worst nightmares of her childhood she was also about the biggest fibber and tattle tale ron knew ron found himself with no fond memories of thanksgiving as something always went wrong no matter how hard mrs weasley tried and the whole family would get an earful of scolding afterwards he reminisced the time when fred and george had been five and mistakenly set sissy beautiful blonde head on fire or the time they d hexed a beehive onto perry big arrogant head he doubted all the yelling and arguing afterwards were worth the few good laughs it was in evident however that a dinner would continue to happen every year between the two families and it was in evident that talks about the evening they all dreaded would come up someday ok we all know what time of year it is mrs weasley said putting down her spoon at the dinner table one night thanksgiving an unwelcome groan swept through all the members sitting at the table the only people not to release groans were fleur and luna fleur out of sheer lack of knowledge never having been to one of the thanksgiving celebrations and luna out of simple courtesy vhat iz de problveme vith thanksgiving fleur asked slightly dumbfounded at all their moaning and groaning thanksgiving iz en vonderful oliday en france well you ve never met the peasegoods fred grumbled here here george said sounding downcast enough i will not have my children shaming their own family mrs weasley said sternly the peasegoods are your family and they love you very much ron snorted but mum ginny whined lola always dips my hair in the gravy it takes time to wash it out you know and perry has borrowed my encyclopedia of dragon breeds in britain and hasntreturned it for six years percy sniffed george scowled ross stole some of our valuable supplies for creating the mortal wounds potion last year and he ate it fred laughed yeah dumb ole ross he even ate that devil dung food cake we left in his chambers well it doesntmatter does it they re family mrs weasley said oddly keeping her voice level now listen year after year the peasegoods have shammed us embarrassed us and poked fun at us but this year shall be my everyone shot her an odd furtive look our year to shine and prove that we are one of the best families around a few of members seated at the table gave appreciative applause now time for the duties fleur is going out to buy new china and a tablecloth while penelope will be creating our centerpiece i will of course be cooking aided by ginny a distinct moan could be heard coming from the redhead and luna another distinct sound could be heard this time the excited clang of a butterbeer cork necklace as luna clapped her hands together happily fred fred raised his head no wait never mind bill you pick them up from the train station fred fred leaned forward into the table to hear his duty no actually harry ron you two make sure the house is clean fred fred looked up hopefully well no charlie you make sure the usual decorations are up and that ghoul is under control fred fred balled a fist into the air finally expecting to get a task no how about percy you make sure you greet them at the front entrance then fred fred perked up no no i meant arthur fred sighed and leaned back in his chair sorry can you make sure their are ministry cars able to pick them up with bill and finally fred fred perked up once again oh never mind i meant george make sure everyone has a place to sleep for the night alright mrs weasley said all in one breath did i miss anything yeah fred said in an over exaggerated tone me oh sorry fred dear i just donthave enough jobs for you to do one also mrs weasley said staring at him sympathetically but you re still a huge part of this family honey fred cursed darkly under his breath one twin is always more special and i feel the need to remind you no escort no dinner mrs weasley said thundering the last part everyone nodded a bit scared ron in particular since he d turned by the last four years with either no date or a flimsy one ron silently cursed in his mind how was he going to find a date he d hardly had any since he d seen hermione again which was most unlike him perhaps he ought to call back gina or becky even he was desperate thanksgiving dinner was always delicious and he d hate to miss out on what trouble they were likely to get in next anyways ron mrs weasley bellowed shaking him into reality yes ron inquired quivering under his mother glare i just wanted to know if you had a date yet seeing as to how thanksgiving is two days away and i ve been clueing at you to get one mrs weasley questioned sweetly although ron sensed the fire in her tone erm no ron mumbled well ronald you best remember no escort no dinner mrs weasley explained and she whipped out her wand and inscribed no escort no dinner on his forehead in bold red and purple pimples mum ron howled miserably i ll never get a date this way lesson of the day mrs weasley said calmly never wait till last minute and never anger your mother your mother just a doll hermione grinned do you think it ll come off i dunno ron frowned can you believe this i like eloise midgeon serves you right for teasing her so much hermione stated anyways what did you do to earn that ron gulped down some fire whisky and looked around the leaky cauldron for any date worthy witches none well in defense of sexy witches everywhere the leaky cauldron wasntexactly a major gold mine anytime i didntget an escort for thanksgiving dinner and my mum mad to show up her sister ron clarified sullenly he caught hermione eye and saw her staring at him thoughtfully and smiling quietly to herself i ll go with you hermione suggested ron gaped at her you cantbe my date and why not hermione asked indignantly seamus is why not ron replied wondering if hermione bumped her head on anything lately she seemed so dreamy and out of it almost like luna except it was weirder when hermione acted like it every time they had met this week her eyes were glazed over and she had a faraway look in her eyes as if she and seamus had gotten engaged or something but no seamus would ve needed more of his help if that were true and for some reason he seemed in no hurry to propose anytime soon ron feared that the engagement would be like the birthday party romantic affectionate perfect disgusting oh yes hermione spoke slowly as if trying to remember some faint memory seamus but she added it doesntmean i cantgo with you it a friends thing ron not love right not love ron said rather silently ok it settled then thank god i ve got an escort i best go tell mum so she can undo this damn spell he gestured to his forehead in an exaggerated manner ever since he d gotten the stark mark an unwelcome nickname given to the acne disaster on his forehead by fred george and harry witches had been veering clear of him apparently all of them were vain stuck up and shallow it was how most women were these days according to bill ron gave hermione his share of the bill payment and left her there in the leaky cauldron and headed out into the cold streets dead leaves were fluttering about in clutters all around the busy people buzzing about their business every time one of the thousands of witches and wizards in diagon alley took another step a mound of leaves with crunch under them causing an earthquake of crunching to echo through the alleys between all the buzzing of voices ron decided this particular day to take the muggle way home walking it was a refreshing break from the everyday dregs of magic and as he strolled onto the cobbled street outside that oh so familiar sound echoed through his ears crunch crunch crunch the evening that the peasegoods were expected to arrive at the burrow was a dreary one like its visitors rain had been pounding the windows and roof of the house all day and the ghoul in the attic was moaning uncontrollably charlie had spent the better half of the afternoon trying to get it to shut up everyone backs were aching as had given them no time to slack off ron regretted ever wanting to come but as soon as he rub his hand against his smooth forehead he decided it was all for the best the stark mark was finally off because ron was sure mrs weasley wouldntwant the peasegoods to think ron had any disease of any kind her children were perfect healthy angels ron get off the couch you re wrinkling my pillows ron glared shut up harry i spent two hours trying to make those pillows look beautiful and you will get off them harry said in a voice uncannily like his mothers he waved a feather duster in front of ron face causing him to cough insistently harry bounced onto the couch beside him laughing at his mate expense you two out of my living now thundered the real mrs weasley with her hands on her hips both boys immediately stopped their laughter and hurried to stand up after fluffing the ruined pillows they made for the doorway mrs weasley had taken away harry privileges for his eighth round of turkey at dinner because of his misuse of a feather duster ron was glad he hadnthad anything taken away rules were tightly bound around thanksgiving just as the two scurried out of the living room the doorbell rang mrs weasley harry and ron looked from one to the other in the foyer no one was expected at this time of day a storm of footsteps rang through the house as people came to see who had arrived from bedrooms the attic the kitchen and the den mum do you think it them ginny asked unnerved she was hanging off the staircase obviously in the middle of getting dressed seeing as to how only one of her eyes had eyeliner applied to it of course not mrs weasley said reasonably they re not expected for another two hours the doorbell rang again everyone looked at each other rather nervously finally mrs weasley sighed oh this is silly it cant be them i ll get it she swung open the door to reveal all six peasegoods standing there all ranged together with wicked smiles on their faces mrs weasley gasped and stepped back as if almost frightened to death of the early arrivals molly mrs peasegood cried holding out her arms in a hug position and letting herself in how wonderful to see you she wrapped her arms around mrs weasley who quickly pulled away jocelyn what are you doing here so early mrs weasley demanded early oh i didntknow we were early i told you we were coming at five molly dear mrs peasegood said in a syrupy voice no i believe i heard you say seven mrs weasley said stiffly mrs peasegood dropped the sweet act in about two seconds then you heard wrong she responded coldly it seemed that as fast as the sweet act went it came also charlie mrs peasegood exclaimed how lovely to see you i heard your dragon breeding ordeal didntgo down so well i suppose that why you left romania poor dear horrible to be a failure she smiled at him sympathetically actually charlie started but was quickly cut off bill mrs peasegood shrieked with delight i see you ve still got that haircut i find the haircut lovely mrs weasley commented angrily everyone stared at her obviously surprised they all knew mrs weasley was always ragging bill about his haircut mrs peasegood sniffed and george she said turning away from bill before he got a chance to speak it fred george is picking up his girlfriend fred said scowling making his face ugly and unbecoming whatever darling mrs peasegood said waving her hand she greeted the others in the same manner and ended up coming to ron ron dear give your aunt jocelyn a hug mrs peasegood said wrapping her arms around him and wafting him in a stench of perfume she pulled away and studied him carefully no date again honey i have a date ron said in his family defense she just not here yet since you are early mrs weasley beamed down on him and mrs peasegood sniffed under her large nostrils ron cuffed his collar proudly the four parents headed off to the dining table to continue their chat the rest of the peasegood children looked just as dull as ever they were wearing their usual garb girls in pink boys in blue perry and percy locked eyes and immediately stomped upstairs together never losing eye contact lola stayed back and watched to see what move ginny would make next ginny herself looked unsure and rather frightened sissy strolled through the house tutting at certain objects around the house if you want to inspect objects perhaps you should go to a museum harry said coolly sissy eyes flared at him ron knew harry was the one she disliked the most at first she d fancied him been turned down now hated him fred swung an arm around ross and led him upstairs saying how would you like to make joke shop history with a new experiment of mine ron idly watched them all and wished for what seemed like the millionth time that hermione was here with him everyone dates arrived soon enough ron was shocked to see ex team mate and gryffindor angelina johnson being escorted in with fred who looked rather smug he was even more shocked though to see becky who was charlie date for the night in his house once more she gave ron an odd smile which looked more like an irritable twitch and took her place at the table penelope fleur luna and hermione were the expected dates of percy bill harry and ron ginny had brought along neville and explained to ron that she wasntdating neville but couldntfind anyone last minute and was rather desperate but the one lady they were all anticipating the most had still not been seen in george girl his soul mate ron supposed she would be some beautiful witch who was just as playful as george i mean who else could qualify as his soul mate well since george isnthere yet i suppose we ll have to start without him mrs weasley said disapprovingly my babies have always been punctual mrs peasegood bragging with her mouth full at the very reaches of the table ross stuffed food into his mouth like there was no tomorrow with gravy sloping down his front unpleasantly they all stared at him open mouthed and revolted for about ten seconds well my babies have always been well mannered mrs weasley replied daintily cutting a slice of turkey for herself do they always do this hermione whispered in ron ear pretty much he whispered back shouldntsomeone do something about it i mean they are sisters hermione mumbled through her napkin nah we all just let them go at it it sort of their thing ron went on to explain hermione frowned at him ever so gracefully and followed it up with a casual shrug ron watched her eat her food slowly as if she were savoring each ounce and the way she portioned her food was just right she didntget tiny bites like the other girls and she didnttake big sloppy bites like him her bites were just right even to taste but not to overwhelm gosh the girl even did eating the best way possible halfway through dinner the front door could be heard thrashing open and there were loud footsteps in the hall outside the kitchen all the weasleys sat up straighter ron was one of the more excited ones in particular the rest may not know it but they were about to meet their future sister in law george rushed in and snatched the napkin that was tied around percy neck he began to dab at his forehead with it sorry i late mum dad auntie jo george said casually george percy said crossly that was my napkin put a cock in it perfect percy george said uh he shot a nervous look at them all sweetheart you can come in ron restrained from clapping his hands together in excitement once the door swung open he craned his neck as high up as possible good evening everyone everyone around him replied good evening in response but ron sat there mouth slightly opened he turned to hermione who was sitting beside him and noticed that she looked calm and all knowing she faced him and helped him out by shutting his mouth for him george soul mate wasntexactly who ron expected her to be author note da da da wowzers a surprise cliffhanger and i love it i was debating over if i should reveal the mystery girl in this chapter or not but then i decided nah lol i hope

i think it awesome you all reviewed thank you so much well enough blab more write eh daphne greengrass ron coughed up his pumpkin juice daphne greengrass she was standing there looking especially pale against all the red hair her blood red mouth was pulled into a smirk weasley she tutted close your mouth you know each other fred asked arching an eyebrow yes i interviewed him daphne said simply and took a seat between fred and george well how wonderful you re both already accquainted mrs weasley said smiling yes quite daphne said taking a sip from her glass of pumpkin juice and scowling as if it was something very untasteful george what is this anyways pumpkin juice george said poking at his turkey daphne didntcomment but ron never saw her drink out of that glass again so do you work with hermione harry questioned casually ron had told him about the vampire but he doubted harry knew that she was seated in front of his eyes daphne nodded slowly and she caught ron eyes they were teasing him daring him to speak up and exclaim to them all that she was a vampire ron suddenly felt that he wasnthungry anymore how could he be when his brother was with a vampire his soul mate that doesntmean a thing ron chatised himself the ministry could ve gotten it mixed up but he knew it couldntbe true the ministry didntjust mess things up how could they be meant for one another when daphne and george were complete opposites it was like mixing jelly and cheese it wasntright and he d know since he d ate a jelly and cheese sandwich himself then again he and hermione were opposites and he was crazy about her he almost wished he d never met daphne and never known she was a vampire how happy would he have been then to finally meet george soul mate he d have thought she was sort of pale and dark and strange looking but not that she was a vampire molly i see stains on the tablecloth and you know i really canteat on a tablecloth with stains on it mrs peasegood said with a sigh what do you suggest i do then jocelyn mrs weasley said through clenched teeth while mantaining a forced smile ron daphne said drawing attention away from the silent ongoing argument between his mother and his aunt who are you here with hermione ron said slowly he was going to be sure to be extra careful talking to daphne this time around no entrancing this time oh really daphne said in mock surprise i thought hermione was with seamus ron could feel his face burn up he realized how pathetic he must ve seemed to everyone today bringing someone else girlfriend to the dinner what was he thinking he shouldnthave said yes when hermione proposed the idea she is with seamus ron said flatly then why is she here with you daphne inquired getting thoroughly intrigued daph george began to speak but was interrupted when ron managed to respond she doing me a favor ron clarified with as much dignity as he could muster at the moment so you ve brought someone else girlfriend to the dinner sissy implored a smug grin hitching across her face i see no problem with it as long as he brought her plantonically mrs weasley sniffed coldly molly are you saying that you permit your boys to date young ladies who are currently dating other men that direct support of infidelity mrs peasegood demanded trying to come across as shocked instead she looked elated for nailing something on mrs weasley that not what she meant ginny huffed indignantly she seemed furious at mrs peasegood attempt to tarnish mrs weasley good natured reputation oh shut up ginny lola said with a slight eyeroll dontyou go telling my little sister to shut up you shut up fred yelped dont you tell my little sister to shut up ross piped up suddenly he surprised everyone by his little speech usually ross never spoke a word when there was food on his plate what do you plan to do about it fred retorted the anger and intesity level in the room seemed to be rising i ll punch your face out ross growled taking a bite of turkey between every other word i d like to see you try fred said a mischeavious smile ross eyes darted from his thanksgiving dinner to the superior expression on his face to the surprise of all in the room he chose pride over hunger and lunged at fred suddenly across the dinner table food fell every which way and ron saw cranberry sauce slide all over ross fat stomach he felt a warm wet sensation in his pants but not from hermione hand landing on his thigh and giving it a squeeze but from all the gravy that fell into his lap luckily his glass of pumpkin juice didntfall on him but fell to the floor and shattered harry who was covered in stuffing made a splendid catch of the turkey and charlie managed to duck the knife that was making for his forehead becky let out a stifled cry as the pitcher of pumpkin juice fell into her lap causing another one of her dress robes to be ruined at another weasley event fleur patted her back sympathetically and led her out of the kitchen to the bathroom fred and ross were rolling around the floor in the mess of their dinner arms and legs flailed wildly harry george and ron stood to cheer fred on as the rest of the onlookers shook their heads miserably in protest oh dear mr weasley said wearily fred ross get off each other this isntthe time but the shouts of fight fight fight drowned out his word of reason in the background mrs weasley and mrs peasegood began their own argument tell your boy to get off my baby mrs peasegood squealed her handbag swining like crazy at her side why donti tell your baby to shove come on fred you can take the pansy george cheered roars of triumph erupted when fred socked ross in the nose suddenly became aware of the current wrestling match in her kitchen and took immediate action fred ross she shouted over the rest of them do not continue to fight no alright that it expelliarmus fred and ross both flew apart to different parts of the room fred landed on the table and ross against a window which cracked under his mass pressure they got up soon enough and the silence that followed was almost frightening i cannot believe that my family would ever do such a such a mrs weasley broke off unable to speak any further it not our fault ron spoke suddenly it daphne s he pointed to her rather lamely and stupidly he didntknow why he was blaimg her but it was her fault she stared at him with raised eyebrows and for once ron thought she looked frightened of what he was about to say next she was afraid he would spill her secret and his family wouldntaccept her any longer ron knew they had a mutual silent agreement that he was not going to give away the secret but some promise were meant to be broken she did this because she thinks she can tempt be and i ll do nothing like i wontgive away that she a vampire ron exclaimed ron george and hermione gasped together a rush of guilt flooded him as he realized the horror of what he d done daphne shut her eyes and breathed out slowly everyone was silent aside from penelope and mrs peasegood who were screaming uncontrollably is this a joke mrs peasegood breathed molly you know full well i have a fear of vampires and ghosts before could speak the ghoul in the attic began howling again is is that a ghost mrs peasegood whimpered this is it molly we re leaving i dontsuspect we ll be back next time you invite us over for thanksgiving i always knew you were jealous mrs peasegood grabbed mr peasegood and dragged him out of the kitchen their children followed them with the rest of the household on their tail jocelyn wait mrs weasley called out mrs peasegood stopped in her steps yes molly mrs peasegood said hoping to get an apology you forgot your handbag mrs weasley replied calmly holding it out mrs peasegood gave a frustration hmph and snatched her bag away thank you molly and did you know your bra strap is showing mrs peasegood snarled ron stepped forward but mrs weasley arm stopped him in his tracks at least i wearing a bra mrs weasley said standing tall and proud a few people gave appreciative laughs and mrs peasegood let out an odd sort of whiny before stomping out the door bill shut it behind them and turned back to face them all they opened their mouths to apology to mrs weasley but nothing seem to come out what was their to say they d messed up badly the peasegoods were likely to never come back which seemed to ron a rather good thing but yet mrs weasley didntshout but said quietly living room now nervously they marched to the living room and stood there uncomfortably they were sure to get it now sit mrs weasley ordered they all sat in a chorus and glanced between each other with shifty eyes all of their eyes darted to mrs weasley however when she began to laugh hysterically that laughs was the giggles best thanksgiving more laughter ever mrs weasley said through peals of laughter she fell into a seat beside luna who stared at her wide eyed but mum you re not mad fred questioned unnerved mad no i ve been trying to think of a way to get rid of the dinner tradition for about fourteen years said sighing with contentment and the ghouls sounding like a ghost and the whole daphne being a vampire it was perfect i sorry daphne mumbled lowering her eyes her reaction made the atmosphere in the room gain seriousness i i think it cool that you re a vampire harry said anxiously you know cause i ve never met one a short silence preceded until ginny spoke up me me too yes but obviously ron doesntagree george hissed sounding mad for the first time in a long time ron winced he d made him that way george stood and huffed out of the room daphne shot him a dirty look and chased after george the family looked upon ron expectantly what do you you want me to fix this ron gruffed mum shot him a glare oh alright i ll go talk to him ron roamed through the house searching for george this was one of those situations he often didntfind himself in it usually took something incredibly terrible to upset george actually ron found he hadntseen him upset since his father was in st mungo when a death eater had hit him with seven stunners in a row that nearly killed him finally ron found george hunched on the same rock he d been on at ginny birthday party daphne was kneeling beside him and patting his back with her white hands her head was placed in his back and he stroked her smooth hair slowly ron didntknow if it was because it was awfully dark or maybe he was hallucinating but somehow underneath the starry sky they looked almost perfect for each other well perhaps not perfect right that was the word they looked right as if it was meant to be sometimes maybe opposites were put together so that they could balance out their strengths and weaknesses george ron whispered as quietly as possible george can i talk to you go away ronniekins george sulked but it seemed daphne wouldntlet him do so george talk to him daphne said in a tone ron never heard her use he may be an idiot but he is your brother and everything worked out didntit george stared at ron then nodded daphne gave an actual smile then stood i ll give you two some alone time daphne said passing ron thanks he said oddly nodding she nodded seriously before walking inside george i a prat ron breathed out george light hearted laughter floated through the air i know that i sorry too ron responded i know that too george admitted just dontdo it again alright or else next time i ll have to hex your face to swell like buttocks promise ron said giving an appreciative laugh george gestured for him to sit next to him and ron sat she pregnant george said she what ron said in surprise yeah i reacted the same way it lucky i love her george said rubbing his eyes sleepily sure is ron said and he gave a low whistle do you think i ll make a good father george questioned him ron pondered his for a moment before saying definitely you ll teach the kid how to play pranks on all it little friends and when they get to hogwarts you can tell them about all the secret passages and stuff your baby going to be a quidditch player and a good one at that because of the weasley genes george grinned you think so i know so ron said simply you ll make a great father too i bet george said thoughtfully but your kid wonthave as much fun as mine because it going to have hermione for a mother hermione ron said incredulously she isntever going to be with me au contraire george replied you ll end up together it obvious karma ron karma was it ron smiled warmly even if it wasntit was nice to hear a change from hearing about how her and seamus were perfect it was then that ron noticed something on george back and gave a gleeful laugh someone had hexed the back of his robes to glow the words hex me in bright red evident work of a girlfriend that was catching onto her boyfriend habits maybe just maybe daphne greengrass was george soul mate author note too busy to comment much hope you liked it please review couldntget

thanks for reviewing too wow wow wow all of you reviewers kick ass thank you so much for reviewing it means so much to me encourages me to go on each time the first snowfall of the year came a three days before christmas author note i know this one is celebrated in england and ron found himself roaming the streets of diagon alley aimlessly in search of christmas gifts for everyone he hadntgotten hardly anyone a gift yet because as usual he d waited till last minute to go christmas shopping the streets were filled mostly with men like himself who had also decided to be tardy this year ron rubbed his frost bitten nose with his frost bitten fingers and decided to warm up with a coffee from diagon alley cafe the cold winter winds played with his hair as he struggled to walk against the direction of the snowfall his hair was the brightest color in the whole of diagon alley his feet crunched the snow as he passed the mostly empty shops some were even closed this close to christmas they probably thought no one would be out this close to christmas either only pathetic losers like himself he wondered when he d become one of them a pathetic loser that is it seemed just a few months ago he d been completely content with his life just happy with being famous having thefamily everyone was envious of being friends with the types of people most would die to touch and dating witches any wizard would want but somehow ever since he d met hermione his perfect world didntseem so perfect anymore perfect didntseem right anymore either he wanted something more he wanted love he laughed at himself it was an unaturally high cold laugh coming from him icy cruel it didntsuit him it wouldnthave suited everyone and yet he found himself racking his brain over who it had one belonged to when it came to him it came so quickly he was almost frightened it was the high pitched laugh of lord voldemort he d just immitated a chill crept over him which was more overwhelming then the wintery breeze it shrouded him like a dark veil and he almost found it hard to breath his sudden adreneline rush caused his heart to start beating faster and he dared to shoot a look over his shoulder no one was there but it didntcalm him at all somehow no matter how crazy it sounded he d almost felt as if lord voldemort had been lurking behind him he tried to laugh at his own absurdity but ended up shoving his fist in his mouth to choke it out the cold laughter was about to come he d known it he picked up a mad dash to the diagon alley cafe and got curious stares from passers by who were all wondering where ron weasley was running off to ron vaguely picked up the chit chat of a father and son as he whizzed by in a hurry knocking some of their shopping over where does the bloody hell he think he going a father grumbled angrily commencing on stuffing his gifts back in his shopping bag it ron weasley dad a boy defended him valiantly he probably going to save someone with harry potter save someone right now the only person he felt he needed to save was hismelf after all wasnthe going insane thinking evil overlords who were supposed to be dead were creeping up on him he grateful when he reached the door to the diagon alley cafe the warm glow of the cafe washed over him and he let out a sigh of relief that was cut short when he noticed hermione and seamus in a corner of the coffee house they began waving him over he hesitated but somehow found himself sitting at their table anyways what are you doing out in this cold hermione asked him with an arched eyebrow she looked so warm and cozy in her red sweater as opposed to him i should be asking you two the same ron said not truly replying came out for a cuppa and you seamus explained forcing him to answer the question shopping for presents ron admitted holding the hot mug of coffee in his hands aaah the the feel of warmth ron you really need to learn not to wait last minute hermione said frowning you should ve made a shopping list of what to get everyone at least a month or two ago that what i do and it helps a whole lot hermione are you talking about exams or christmas shopping ron asked rolling his eyes hermione sniffed and shut up after glaring at ron for the period of a minute she got up and headed off to the bathroom did you buy anything yet seamus said sipping his own coffee erm i bought this pocket watch for my dad since he always late ron said pulling out the only gift he d bought in the two hours he d been here it was a beautiful silvery antique which he d paid a lot of galleons for so he was hoping it would help his father punctuality even in the slightest way mmm this says it three you d better set it to the right time seamus said it is set to the right time ron clarified i remember asking the store owner to do it because i was in a rush it three already damn it my watch must ve stopped it still says one thirty seamus cursed profusely i have to go tell hermione i ll meet her back at home around seven where are you going in such a buzz anyways ron inquired curiously still planning things for the big proposal seamus began i want it to be perfect you know i want it all finished up so i can propose in the new year ron merely nodded because there were too many thoughts fluttering through his mind at the moment it was too confusing to speak day by day the engagement just seemed to be dawning closer and he couldntstop it he thought forward to how this time next year hermione might even be married it was too vivid and scary a thought for ron so he quickly pushed it to the back of his head where seamus hermione asked sharply her voice cut through the air and practically made ron jump out of his skin don t do that ron scowled i could ve dropped my coffee you know god forbid that hermione said shaking her head now where did seamus go off to business meeting ron yawned hermione took her seat at the table and a dreaded silence followed something felt strangely different between them today as if they were almost shy and embarrassed to be sitting so closely knit ron cleared his throat so what are you doing for christmas well seamus has to go to ireland to visit his grandmother hermione started but i decided to skip that so your mother invited me to spend christmas at the burrow why did you skip spending time with seamus ron implored hoping he didntsound too eager well to tell you the truth i dontknow why hermione mused i guess i almost was hoping i would get asked to come to the burrow because i miss the way we all used to be you know before fifth year started i something strange keeps coming over me lately what would that be ron said dropping his voice lower i believe i tempted to do something horrible to someone i love dearly as a friend but only as a friend hermione said dropping her voice lower too ron pulled his face back and gave her a good long look she looked nervous and twitchy as if she didntknow what was to become of her what can be that tempting ron whispered he didntknow why he had suddenly accustomed to whispering but in a way the situation had him feel as if he should if only you knew hermione mumbled playing with her fingers but it one of those things you canthelp it s it there envy greed infidelity love would you be able to resist it depends on what i being tempted with ron said slightly breathlessly his face was awfully close to hers and if he accidently leaned foward just an inch or so he would ve plummeted mouth first into a deep kiss well this chat got surprisingly serious surprisingly fast hermione worded i should probably get going right ron said nodding sensibly i should be going too neither of them moved this is silly hermione finally pulling away a tad giggly i ll see you on christmas bye ron bid her farewell and felt the diagon alley cafe too after the warmth of what he d just felt inside the great winter weather seemed even more colder than usual he bitterly restarted his search of the perfect christmas gifts after five hours of vigourous work he d managed to all his presents but one it was hermione s he had no idea what to get her what would she want anyways she d gotten her star she d gotten her perfect little world he thought back to the diagon alley cafe all she d mentioned was she d wanted everything to be like it was before a blast from the past evidently but how was he supposed to get her that as if on cue he passed by a store named past photography oddly enough he d never noticed it before even though he d been past here many times before perhaps he d been in a rush all those times or there d been to many people around whatever the reason was the store had definitely caught his attention now he headed in and found the store barren and empty aside from a frail old wizard behind the counter ron made a beeline for him and waited for the man to acknowledge his presence two minutes later when he still hadntbeen noticed ron cleared his throat it promptly caught the old wizards attention anybody there he hacked out err yes my name ron weasley ron said and i uh want to know what exactly your services are here mr mr imago inigo imago the wizard puffed your eyes are blue then uh yeah yeah they are ron said utterly confused it was then that mr imago looked up into his eyes that he realized the old wizard was blind he had no iris only two aquamarine pupils shocked it doesntbother me actually it makes all the other senses sharper mr imago explained so back to business here at past photography we help people photograph their past by sending them back in time through a safe precedure but what if someone changes the course of history ron asked incredulously hmm maybe i misused my words when you are sent back in time you are sent time to your body your old form and you are given the time of half an hour within your former body to shoot a picture of whatever you want mr imago went on really so i could go back being a teenager for half an hour ron inquired excitedly precisely but you must sign a contract before you do so promising not to alter the sequence of events especially in your case mr weasley for it can alter not just your live but the history of the wizarding world mr imago said and ron thought for a second his pupils widened seriously alright alright i ll sign ron said carelessly he wanted to go back to where it all started before he d had the scars of fending off voldemort or losing hermione when there was just the trio and their friendship between them a time where sirius lupin and tonks were still alive a time when dumbledore lived in all of his might after signing the contract he was asked which time in his life he d actually wanted to go to he pondered over this for a moment before responding the summer before my fifth year number twelve grimmauld place at around seven when there was a party to celebrate hermione and i becoming prefects the particular day he chose wasntthe best day of his life nor was it the happiest or the most perfect but it was the only day he could think back to when they were all together all healthy all sane i ll need to get that particular time in a pensieve mr weasley mr imago stated holding out a rather dirty brown pensieve call me when you re ready ron nodded and thought hard in order to place a thought into a pensieve you needed to concentrate on that certain memory he thought hard back to the party the sign reading congratulations ron and hermione new prefects his new cleansweep and the delicious food he stuck his want to his hairline and an ooze of silvery memory came pouring out into the pensieve ready i see mr imago commented alright then take this and this and this mr imago thrust a time turner around his neck a self taking camera and handed him a potion now as the time turner begins to take you back you must sip his potion no matter how time sick you feel mr imago explained or there ll be two ron weasleys in the past and that could lead to great catastrophies ron nodded trying to take it all in now let see seeminly to coordinate with the memory you must turn the time turner around seven times mr imago said briefly ron responded with a gulp and began to turn it was nerve racking knowing that he was about to see everyone when they were five years less what they would be now quickly and ever so surely his surroundings began to grow into a blurr he popped the cork off the potion vial and forced the liquid to his mouth it washed down his throat easily enough although it had a queer taste a sudden feeling began to rise in him as if his soul was leaving his body but as easily as the feeling came it went also and soon ron found himself sitting at the dining table in number twelve grimmauld place reaching his hand out to a platter of brownies the camera was in his lap he sat there for a second barely taking it all in ron can you pass me some roast beef ginny asked him casually ron neck swung around and he faced his younger sister she was only fourteen in this time fold ron felt as if it were only yesterday that ginny had celebrated turning nineteen ron hello are you alright ginny said sounding worried uh i fine ron said finding his voice yet it wasntquite his it was the crackly young voice of fifteen year old ron he looked down upon himself and saw the gangly thin body of a ron who hadntbecome a quidditch player yet well are you passing me the roast beef or not ginny questioned getting irritable oh yeah right ron nodded and he handed her the roast beef after that he was done being hassled he stared around the room sirius and lupin were alive they chatting between themselves and ron found himself almost wishing he could tell everyone especially sirius what was to come by the end of their fifth school year he bit his tongue and kept quiet instead he looked around the rest of the room fred and george were in a corner with mundungus obviously making some kind of black deal harry was sitting at the table rather silently with only one scar he was sure to get many more in the span of the next five years mad eye and kingsley seemed the same and tonks was her usual bubbly self bill and charlie were a likeness of their future selves except here they looked older and more worried about what was to come mrs weasley was bustling around the room making sure everyone got something to eat in her usual fashion and mr weasley was looking more healthy than ron had seen him in years what are you thinking so hard about ron turned to his other side and saw hermione sitting there she was just as beautiful perhaps shorter he almost wanted to touch her to hold her but he knew that would alter history a great deal erm my new broom ron said lamely you boys and your quidditch hermione sighed all it does is get you worked up ron was about to back down but he knew his fifteen year old self wouldnthave taken that shot at quidditch sitting down it the same with you and books ron replied you re impossible hermione frowned i going to take that as a compliment ron said hoping he was keeping up his act well right hermione said with an eyeroll do you realize you re a prefect this year you cantgo messing off all the time you are a role model ugh ron scowled being a prefect isntabout being a role model it about giving slytherins detention whenever the bloody hell i feel like it ron you cannot undermine the prefect policy dumbledore made you prefect because he obviously thought you would ve made a good role model or else he would ve chosen seamus or something hermione said aimlessly seamus why are you talking about seamus do you like him or something ron said all in one breath could it be that her infatuation for him went back this far of course i dontlike seamus i just saying hermione sniffed why would it matter to you who i like it doesn t i just saying ron smirked hermione shook her head it practically seven thirty shouldntyou be arguing with someone else almost seven thirty he only had half an hour here and he was wasting it hey everyone ron called over the noise how about a group portrait there was a mumur of approval what a wonderful idea ron mrs weasley said elated alright all of you get ranged together ron grinned he was really going to get his picture i ll skip harry said gruffly aw come on mate ron moaned he should ve known harry would be complicated after all this was one of his most rage filled years no ron just you go at it leave me out harry retorted harry please ron begged do it for me harry glared daggers into him and eventually marched over to the group that was huddled together ron smiled at him and set up the camera he then joined the happy group and squeezed between harry and hermione he threw his hand around both of their shoulders causing them to give him odd looks but they also joined the procession and threw their arms around him too mrs weasley held out her wand and called portraito a blinding flash was ron last memory of the past as he felt his soul and body merge together he tripped over a trunk in past photography and crashed to the floor he brushed himself off and handed mr imago the camera did you get all you wanted mr imago questioned him in a whisper and more ron added the corner of mr imago mouth twitched as he took the time turner and potion vial from ron young sir can i suggest something of you mr imago said turning away fromh him and ripping the film out of the camera course ron shrugged following him have you been feeling dark presences lately mr imago continued dipping the film in a potion why yes yes i have ron said awestruck the presence of lord voldemort but how could mr imago know those presences are not of who you think they are the dark presence you feel comes from you yourself it comes from a black heart mr imago said thoughtfully you like every other strong man have your faults mr weasley but the greatest one is yourself your desire to hide your heart will eventually destroy it and therefore you will destroy your own being single handedly ron bit his lip are you done with that picture mr imago turned to face him hurriedly here ron took the envelope all his pictures were in and paid the man he commenced his leave but he felt a light hand on his shoulder you will listen to what i have worded to you mr weasley mr imago implored yes i will think it over ron responded heading outside once he was back in the cobbled street again he pushed mr imago advice to the far reaches of his mind and the dark presence he d felt returned once again author note that was almost a flash back chapter except not quite i hope you liked it it was a darker chapter i ll follow it up with a lighter one oh and i hope to hear from you all again love winky disclaimer oh i

for your mass support wow i wontwaste this space with chit chat here the chapter and it truly is dedicated to all you awesome reviewers out there siiilllent niiiight hooolly niiiight ron wished he could kill himself right here right now he thought about drowning himself in eggnog but decided against it after all hermione would soon be here and that was all that mattered he and hermione would be able to spend all today and tomorrow betterly known as christmas in each other presence he d also set up mistletoe stragedically among the burrow he put on over the doorway to the guest bedroom where he knew hermione d be spending the night mooother and chiiilld mrs weasley voice cracked yet she still continued to sing it was another weasley tradition which ron despised mrs weasley signing them all the usual christmas carols while percy played the piano it had all started when percy had bought the god damned piano the year after ron had gotten out of hogwarts now to most this wouldntseem so bad a predicament but then again most had never heard molly weasley singing voice it was like the moaning of a hundred evils like the sound of nails against a chalkboard like the relationship between hermione seamus it was just wrong alright mrs weasley said stopping to catch her breath i ve finished silent night any other requests i d like to request you to stop the squawking coming out of your mother fred grumbled under this breath causing ginny to snicker and luna to glare how about the twelve days of christmas luna suggested eagerly somehow luna actually enjoyed these retched carols mrs weasley mouth opened and just as the first note was out of her mouth the doorbell rang to the relief of one and all i ll get it ron said jumping at the oppurtunity to hopefully skip the first four days of christmas he opened the door and ushered a frozen george daphne and hermione into the house the weather pretty bad aintit ron frowned looking at the three of them they were soaked and most of them had chapped lips and snowflakes gracing their hair what ever gave you that idea george said dryly i heard witch fm making a broadcast today about how this was the worst snowfall in britain in over twenty years hermione explained witch fm probably wrong it always predicts the weather flimsy the best station to listen to for weather is floo forty eight ron clarified well actually witch fm was correct hermione said simply how do you know that ron implored incredulously well after i d heard it on the radio i would ve had to research it to make sure it was right wouldnti hermione said matter of factly ron looked at her terrified but george laughed only you hermione he took off his coat and then preceded to take off daphne s ron noticed her stomach had perturbed quite a bit since the last time they d met how long has it been ron asked gesturing towards her pregnant form three months and counting daphne said carelessly aww how sweet hermione commented and she reached out her hand possibly to give daphne stomach a jolly pat hermione if you even try to rub my belly again godspeed i will suck the fresh blood right out of you daphne said angrily hermione and ron looked rather frightened but george mouthed it the pregnancy talking apparently the pregnancy does all the talking ron whispered in hermione ear she laughed appreciatively ron beamed at her causing her to blush that was weird hermione didntusually blush because ron smiled at her they awkwardly made their way to the living room where everyone was chanting on the eighth day of christmas my true love gave to me most of christmas eve sped by uneventfully well as uneventfully as it gets with the weasleys around seven they d caught some wizarding paparatzzi trying to peep in through a window in the kitchen fred and george had gone to get rid of them but didntreturn until half an hour later they wouldntsay what they did but ron noticed george had a twig in his hair at ten harry and percy had been caught under the mistletoe at the same time and hadntgiven each other a kiss this caused a great debate to arise among the weasley family half of them ron fred and george had wanted harry and percy to kiss it was the rules of the mistletoe after all but for some reason neither harry nor percy looked forward to the propect so the other half of them defended harry and percy valiantly saying that you didnthave to kiss the person if it was someone of the same gender it almost seemed as if good would prevail over evil until ron had brought up the point of gays lesbians and bisexuals in the end a twist compromise was made and hermione had to kiss percy on the cheek on harry behalf ron thought sourly about how percy had gotten more lucky with hermione in the last three minutes than he had in the last three months at midnight when they majority of the household was asleep ron found he himself could not find slumber he tossed and turned in his old room charlie who was practically the only other bachelor in the house besides ron and fred slept soundly on the bed next to him ron watched as his brother chest fall up and down he sighed he could only hope to be as peaceful as that someday he threw this blanket off himself he felt sweaty even though it was a cold night he went to his window and stared out at the sky full moon it reminded him briefly of lupin but he quickly pushed that thought to the back of his mind it was no use dwelling on the dead he was almost frightened of where he d have to go tomorrow christmas as special as it was had it downsides he felt rather downcast and chose to cheer himself by checking in on hermione she probably looked adorable while she slept he urged himself to not making any creaking sounds on the wooden planks below him there were about fifteen different people he could accidently wake up if he so much as made a creak yet when he did make a creaking sound he sounded hismelf profusely but luckily enough no one awoke when at last he did make it to hermione room he was rather alarmed to see she was not there her bed was empty and her blanket thrown aside tousled bedsheets showed signs of an obvious restless sleeper suddenly someone grabbed him around the waist from behind and placed a hand over his mouth to stop him from screaming his first reaction was to panic and get away from the psycho holding him as fast he could it only me hermione voice whispered ron could practically feel his muscles begin to relax then tense again hermione was holding him she was pressed against him he felt her hand slide off his mouth and completely defied odds by wrapping itself around ron chest ron closed his eyes and tried not to think too hard about the fact that he could feel hermione chest pushed up against his back he felt her place her cheek bewteen his shoulder blades and left her sigh calmly what were you doing in my bedroom hermione said breaking the gentle silence and asking the question ron dreaded she would i i thought i heard a sound coming from this room ron replied shortly you re lying hermione snapped quickly he felt her grip his chest tightly and bit his tongue to stop himself from moaning yes ron shrugged silence well dontyou plan to tell me the real reason hermione inquired i ll let you go if you do ron guffaws shook them both she thought he wanted her to let go who says i want you to let go ron joked then wished he didn t it instantly caused her to release him he turned and noticed she was wearing a lilac dressing gown and her hair was even more out of control than usual mione i sorry that was stupid of me to say oh shut up hermione said slightling teasingly so are you going to tell me what you re doing in my bedroom or not technically it not your bedroom ron started ron hermione scolded ok ok i couldntget to sleep so i just decided to check up on you ron stated dumbly why me hermione asked arching an eyebrow erm well i dunno ron responded feeling his ears go red another quiet drifted through the room i glad you did hermione said shyly and ron noticed her face looked rather red too you are ron questioned in rush she nodded but i dunno why oh well right i guess i d better get going to bed you know ron supplied right hermione said sensibly right you go on ahead even though she didntneed to she walked him to the doorway of her room mistletoe ron said pointing above them not quite paying attention to what hermione was saying god bless mistletoe hermione looked up also and flushed she fumbled with her fingers for a second she looked twitchy and nervous her eyes were darting about his face studying it completely she turned away from him and stood there unsure of what to do next hermione ron asked weakly she turned quickly and gave him a swift kiss it wasnta kiss on the cheek either a real kiss on his mouth and he wasntdreaming even though it was too quick to taste any of it it was enough for ron to savor for a long time to come goodnight ron hermione said curtly night herms ron said in return using a nickname he hadntused on her in a long time she frowned thoroughly will you stop calling me that for most christmas morning is the most magical time of year presents underneath the beautifully decorated tree stockings stuffed to the brim the smell of gingerbread men baking in the oven the propect of another fresh blanket of snow outside and lastly the though of being able to celebrate it all with all those you love it was the same with the weasleys at one time but ever since the second war a newer darker tradition had began after the usual celebrating of christmas morning every single member of the family including harry luna hermione fleur daphne and penelope of course were suited up in robes of pitch black they looked ready to attend a funeral yet that was not where they were going to go everyone wore solemn expressions it was their duty to go pay respects to this man this great wizard he had saved them all at least once from the clutches of death in the days when his sanity was perfectly fine ginny was sniffling slightly and ron could understand why when they actually arrived at s the hospital staff seemed to already know who they were and what the gloomy occasion was seeing as to how they d been here in this fashion time and time again ron hermione said quietly i scared to see him me too ron murmured he patted her arm supportively as a nurse led their way to the section where the permanent hospital residents resided although she need not have most of the group gather round came to see him in the same room at least three times in an average and christmas was a must ron could sympathize with hermione though because she had never seen this once strong wizard locked in a cage of insanity she d only seen him portrayed in one way and for her to suddenly seem him portrayed in something completely opposite was quite something they were all led to the final door and when it was opened hermione faltered a few steps and had to lean on ron for support ginny luna mrs weasley daphne fleur and penelope all shielded their eyes with their hands oh dear god author note da da da wondering why hermione didntcomment on ron present or who they re visiting or anything else well i not telling and none of you will find a single thing out until after two months or maybe earlier seeing as to how generous i feel wow this is it i winkywink am

underpants and was peeing on his own hospital bed his thingy was hanging out for everyone to see oh dear he does this a lot you see the nurse said worriedly she rushed over to him and managed to pull his woolly undergarments back up noo dumbledore said in a defiant tone everyone flinched even in his insanity he still hadntlost his commanding powerful voice except this time it was used in a more childish manner albus get down the nurse said wretching at dumbledore spindly arm see all the nice people here to visit you they look like a bunch of albus the nurse shrieked to me dumbledore finished and you re a party pooper the nurse sighed and ron felt hermione breath roughly beside him her face had turned pale and her expression was that of disbelief this she started is dumbledore the one and only ron chorused sadly i cantbelieve it hermione said sternly shaking her head i just cantbelieve it well you sort of have to ron said defensively he the only piece of dumbledore we have left hermione looked as if she was about to say something but only fell silent as she studied dumbledore braiding his beard scourgify there now you can all sit here and have a nice chat i ll be in my office if you need me the nurse said quickly before hurrying off to another room the large group gathered round dumbledore and shifted beside each other uneasily finally harry mustered the courage to speak up hello professor i i brought you something harry said quietly a present for me dumbledore said eagerly gimme gimme gimme from the depths of his pocket harry pulled out a pair of socks every single year since dumbledore had gone mad harry had given him a pair of socks ron noticed his hand was shaky as harry placed the pair of socks into dumbledore wrinkled old hand dumbledore took them gingerly and stroked them over and over again they re black he stated dumbly yeah yeah they are harry replied equally uselessly can can i make sock puppets with them dumbledore questioned sure whatever you like harry said with a shrug dumbledore set forth right away in making his new sock puppets the rest of the family sat around him and watched him peacefully i cantbelieve this is what dumbledore become ginny said biting her lower lip i would ve till i saw it george said in agreement it scary when you think about it isntit luna piped up if they could take down dumbledore during the second war they could ve taken down any of us daphne laughed softly and ron felt the hairs on the scruff of his neck stand up why are you laughing ron barked crossly well daphne said with a final snort i always hated dumbledore and he hated me now look at the two of us sitting in the same room all friendly dumbledore never hated anyone but voldemort harry said sourly and slytherins daphne added well duh ron said who doesnthate slytherins he laughed at his own witty joke i was a slytherin weasley daphne hissed in your own year as a matter of fact you were ron coughed up rather surprised i didntthink hogwarts took in v i mean people of your grandeur save it weasley daphne said waving her hand and yes hogwarts does take in vampires huh that fascinating ron mumbled alright all it time to head home mr weasley proclaimed everyone said bye to albus now murmurs of bye albus echoed throughout the hospital room as everyone filed out dumbledore waved at them all merrily and returned to his sock puppet art ron and hermione were last in the procession and ron kept their pace slow enough so that they would fall pretty far behind the rest hermione you never said anything about my present did you like it ron asked earnestly well actually ron hermione began it brought back some unpleasant memories what ron exclaimed i thought you missed the way things were then i did hermione explained but i dontanymore i didntthink you d take what i said too seriously well i did ron huffed how can you not miss the way things were everyone alive we re all the best of mates and dumbledore not insane about that hermione said totally going off topic there something not quite right about that man we just visited no really ron said sarcastically i wonder what that could be maybe his insanity dontstart acting up as a prat with me ron weasley hermione scolded that not what i meant ron heaved a huge sigh do i want to know this do you hermione implored with an arched eyebrow ron clenched his fists and gritted his teeth oh alright yes i do well that man we just visited looks like dumbledore but he doesnt smell like dumbledore or at least not albus dumbledore hermione clarified who cares what he smells like hermione dumbledore isntalways going to smell the same i mean maybe it just the strong urine smell in your nose or something ron suggested not quite comprehending what hermione was getting at the man smells like goats ron hermione said exasperated so ron said exaggerating his one word so i saying i think he not dumbledore hermione ended what that crazy who else would look exactly like dumbledore but smell like goats ron inquired dumbstruck as soon as he asked the question the answer came to mind aberforth dumbledore author note why do i do this children why do i leave you on cliffhangers and not tell you when i might possibly update 1 day 1 week 1 month it all very very unclear but suffice with this for now xoxo winky disclaimer this story the characters etc are not oh what the hell i back lol i can finally let out the breath i ve been holding wondering if you guys would actually like my last suddenly crazy chapter i have no clue how or why i made it aberforth dumbledore brother who known to smell like goats for those who were a tad confused i needed something a bit dramatic to develop ron and hermione relationship in certain ways you ll get it later lol i happy to hear you guys enjoyed it and i hope you like my encore chappie while writing the last chapter i was debating over how it should go there was a scenario where it was really albus where it was aberforth and where it was even wormtail then when the aberforth idea came to mind half me was saying oh no you don t it crazy winky crazy i say but the other half was like do it do it do it so you know what i went with lol you know it damn cold where i live right now i freezing and i miss asia you know i was having pizza yesterday and thought where is the rice anywho enough of my

mouth to cut across hermione response because he d already figured it out himself but it was too late for goodness sake ron it aberforth dumbledore dontyou listen hermione chatised ron could ve bitten his own tongue for letting hermione slip one under him i do too listen ron said in his own defence he had wanted to sound offended but it came out childishly anyway it cantbe aberforth you re just crazy hermione narrowed her eyes in an almost perfect imitation of his own mother ron was sure he must have faltered back a few steps for hermione raised a quizzal eyebrow you know perfectly well i not crazy hermione sniffed and may i ask why cantit be aberforth well cause it s not ron explained lamely the painting of dilys derwent on the wall opposite them frowned deeply and then quickly disappeared through her right side ron had a fleeting feeling in his stomach that she was going to tattle to mcgonagall but it quickly faded away when he realized that mcgonagall didntcontrol him or at least not anymore he thought remembering his school days when mcgonagall meant boss i dontget you sometimes hermione sighed shaking her head what not to get i a simple creature to understand like a like a cat if you will ron blabbered as he and hermione walked through the hospital halls trying to catch up with the rest of the gang hermione snorted i dontthink i would ve chosen to describe you as a cat ron frowned why not i very cat ish you re more of a dog hermione said more to herself than to him ron twitched his nose in disagreement a dog then again sirius had been a dog what in the world are you two talking about fred inquired incredulously dogs hermione responded and cats ron added fred blanched completely both of them stared at fred innocently for a while until he left he kept glancing back at them over his shoulder as if he suspected them of doing something fishy they waited until he was out of listening distance until they began to talk again listen ron i didnttell you that the man in that hospital room today was aberforth dumbledore so that we could debate whether it was true or not i told you because what going through my head is where is albus dumbledore hermione said in a tone of voice he had rarely heard her use it had a frightened excited and almost desperate urgency to it so what do you expect us to do ron asked tilting his head closer to hers so that she could hear his soft whisper but to his dismay she pulled back abruptly as if she d been struck by a bolt of lightning ron pretended not to act hurt it not as if he stunk of skunk we donthave to do anything hermione replied smugly ron was just about to call her a total nutcase when mr weasley miss granger you have someone here to see you through the floo an elderly nurse said nearing scaring ron and hermione out of their skins the nurse had a certain soft spoken spooky quality to her voice erm i think you ve got the wrong people i ronald weasley i visiting the hospital ron explained the nurse pursed her lips as if she had been greatly offended i know very well who you are young man the nurse answered keeping a stout lip do not be careless to think that age has numbed the senses and anyways this is st mungo and we pride ourself on good health good magic and good staff listen here ron looked at the name tag pinned to the nurse white robes edna i dontmean to disappoint you or anything but nobody going to be visiting us in a hospital we re visiting ourselves ron said as gently as he possibly could he looked at hermione hoping to share an amusing glance between them both but instead he saw hermione starting to get eager and fascinated by the arrival of edna actually what ron meant to say was that we d love to see whoever come to visit us where shall we go can you show us the way hermione suggested huh ron managed to get out of his mouth right down here edna smiled and started leading them down a more quiet side hall it was all very white and very clean wizards and witches witches with certain illnesses were stumbling along the hall out on a daily walk ron could feel his gut twist as he became tinged with pity for them particularly the permanent residents yet somehow hermione seemed not to notice them and kept staring intently at edna receding back she was twisting her hands as she walked along as if she couldntwait to meet their visitor ron could hardly believe she d agreed to meet this visitor did she think it was seamus ugh seamus why did i have to think of him ron wondered in disgust hermione do you think your visitors seamus ron inquired wistfully he wasntsure if he wanted to know the answer hermione blinked in confusion for five seconds before saying god no ron let out a long warm breath and took to enjoying the mystery of meeting their visitor he also managed to study the detail of the surrounding hall more paintings were lined amongst them but mostly it was plain white wall it was some kind of eternal white wonderland to him why do you ask hermione piped up eh ron said realizing hermione had been addressing him why did you ask if i was thinking if the visitor was seamus or not hermione said tipping her head to one side in a girlish manner this was rather uncharacteristic of her just curious is all ron responded staring up at the ceiling so hermione wouldntsee his cheeks growing red canti ask a friend some innocent questions anymore without getting harried sure you can hermione laughed softly ron looked down noticed her face was pointed forward and a hint of a smile played on her face but i doubt any questions you ask have an innocent intention so you think i that conniving ron implored no i just think you want something hermione responded simply ron was sure his face was getting very very hot at this point what gave you that idea hermione shrugged i dontknow i donteven know what you want peace of he mind ron said in a detached sort of way he had almost said peace of heart hermione arched an eyebrow at him just as the nurse announced they had reached their destination a dark room with a fireplace in the center ron had to blink a few times before he could get the green dots out from in front of his eyes now that he could see the room he noticed it had two fire torches and all the furniture in the place was maghony there was also brooms and mops and buckets and cleaning detergents all over the place a sign over the door read the janitor closet three guesses who this room used to belong to ron muttered behind them a loud crash trumpeted ron jumped about a foot in the air and hermione gripped his hand tightly they both spun around dramatically to witness edna knock into a broom and a bucket she was also tangled up in what looked to be an age old fishing net hermione gave a sigh of relief and went to help her out of her muck this room a dump i saw st mungo floo room once and this isntit ron huffed well mr weasley wasntit good well most people visitors floo them through our main floo room but yours was a special case edna clarified ron and hermione shared significant looks ron look hermione breathed well obviously ron looked and noticed that a stern now slightly wrinkly face now in the fire was none other than minerva mcgonagall ron stomach twisted over three times in close sequence the way mcgonagall was eyeing them it was not a good sign if looks could kill ron would be dead right here right now professor mcgonagall i swear whatever that painting told you i didntdo because ron started but was cut off can it weasley i see in our older age you still have sucumbed any sense mcgonagall said in an almost pitying voice good evening professor hermione greeted professor mcgonagall shot hermione a pleasant smile that ron would have been shocked to see had it been directed at anyone other than hermione same to you professor mcgonagall replied i suppose you know why you re here yes professor hermione answered obidiently what ron asked baffled you do of course i do hermione said shooting him a glare care to fill me in ron said sarcastically you ll find out soon enough weasley now you see that other fireplace over there ron turned his head in spite of himself and noticed a dusty dank old fireplace near the one mcgonagall was at it had cobwebs around it step into it using the floo powder edna will provide and floo to hogwarts you understand me mcgonagall finished firmly but step into the fireplace weasley for heaven sakes haventyou learned to follow direction when they are given to you mcgonagall scolded ron hung his head and gradually went to the fireplace professor i not sure this is a good idea ron started weasley your testing my patience mcgonagall scoffed hermione ron said almost pleading where are we going ron just do what good for you hermione sighed ron didntknow why he was being such a drip about doing what mcgonagall was telling him but why was everyone picking on him how come everyone seemed to suddenly know more than him it happened with harry with hermione his family his teachers everyone one day he wanted to be the one in the know and have everyone else out in the cold he felt like moping around and complaining that hermione and mcgonagall and edna were bullying him instead he stepped into the fire and quailed under the stares he was getting from mcgonagall and hermione two of the woman he revered most he tried to give them a tragic look but all he got in return was narrowing of eyes what about mum and dad and the rest of the family they ll be pretty upset if i m not with them on christmas i mean tis the season to be jolly really and we should be with family ron added ronald weasley in all my years mcgonagall cried fine i going i going ron said in a heavy tone he had tried the rebellion and it hadntworked out so well for him perhaps this adventure would be a fun one at least it had a no seamus guarantee he heaved his eyes shut and with one simple hogwarts he was gone author note today was such a bumpy day if you know what i mean i felt happy kind of saddish ok really upset then really happy and now i just confused lol anywhoo i hope you enjoyed this chapter and i cantwait to hear from you guys again i

wrong anyways thanks so much for the review and compliments and stuff note by the way there comes a confusing part in the middle ish of the story when everyone talking over each other so here a legend so you ll know who talking when hermione ron mcgonagall the first thing ron saw when his feet hit hogwarts was professor mcgonagall sitting behind dumbledore old desk or he supposed it must belong to her now it didntmatter either way from the piercing look she was giving him he gulped mcgonagall looking at him the way she did when she caught him and megan jones a very cute blonde hufflepuff in the restricted section of the library after hours doing well what young angsty teenagers do was not the first thing he d wanted to see upon his return at his former school luckily ron was avoided the trouble of having to make chit chat by hermione arrival in the fire after him she was a tad sooty floo travel had never been her cup of tea ron on the other hand didntmind it so much it had it ups and downs yet it was a part of everyday wizard life just like publick tramportion was to muggles as hermione got up ron noticed she looked rather dazed she stumbled over beside ron and they both stared at mcgonagall expectantly although ron had no idea what he was expecting miss granger mr weasley i welcome you back to hogwarts professor mcgonagall said in a voice that lightly suggested she was glad to see them again after all their time apart perhaps mcgonagall considered them her children almost afterall she had been a major parent figure to them at their time here in hogwarts and the war had only drewn harry ron and hermione closer to the staff at hogwarts because of their close relations to dumbledore and it wonderful to be back hermione chimed they both looks towards ron in waiting erm yeah great to be back ron mumbled and trailed off to tell the truth great wasntexactly the word he d use to explain what it was like being back at hogwarts it almost hurt to be back in a way an aching arose within him at an alarming rate so many memories even in this office he remembered coming here near the end of his second year with harry and ginny and he could almost remember what it had felt that night being frightened excited overjoyed they had saved his baby sister stepping through his castle would be like walking through a place filled with ghostly memories the first time he and harry had played chess the first time he d shared a civil conversation with hermione the first time almost everything had happened for him had been here he missed the school sorely and being back here made him miss it ever more it was still standing yet he couldnteven be here he remembered the night of the final battle voldemort had come those words were ringing through the school voldemort has come to hogwarts he remembered himself and hermione standing just so beside harry prepared to die if they had to and back then he almost choked up as he thought of it back then everyone had been alive no no no ron shook his head slightly and tried to stop thinking about it thinking too much about what happed what was now in the past only made him feel terrible for being alive he knew he shouldnthave come to hogwarts today well we best get to business now hadntwe mcgonagall suggested ron look the sorting hat hermione piped up excitedly the sorting hat was there indeed it looked even more ripped and aged now then it had when he d attended hogwarts actually the room looked almost the same as it had when dumbledore had been here it was almost as if dumbledore still came and went here all the silver instruments whizzed around and even fawkes cage was there ron noticed a painting labeled dumbledore but it was empty at the time being he and hermione spent a while gaping over various things they remembered from childhood miss granger mr weasley are you two done because if you dontmind i have a school to run mcgonagall snapped hermione stopped in her tracks and stood totally errect ron followed suit only to content the new headmistress very well now i suppose we do need explain to mr weasley what is going on do we not oh for goodness sakes who is owling me now mcgonagall sighed rushing over to the window where something was pecking and to her surprise and ron and hermione it was no owl awaiting permission inside fawkes ron gasped fawkes soared in impressing ron and hermione with his flight skills and foliage hermione almost stepped forward to stroke the phoenix gently but then stopped as if it would be commiting a great act of profanity you couldntjust pet fawkes professor mcgonagall however wasntdistracted by the wonderment and beauty of the bird and noticed the note that was attached to his leg it was small very small barely visible beside the great creature that had carried it here she unrolled the note and read it silently to herself to the great annoyance of ron and hermione her eyes darted quickly from once end of the page to the other after she had finished reading it mcgonagall blasted it on fire and soon only the ashen remnants of the note lay on her otherwise neat desk well professor dumbledore has surprisingly requested to speak to you himself mcgonagall explained you two are to meet him in dumbledore ron blurted out the real dumbledore albus if that what you mean mcgonagall sniffed although i see nothing less dumbledore esque about aberforth stolen from what fawkes forever said hehehe ron noticed that mcgonagall nostrils flared as she defended aberforth with a strange sense of pride yes well where did he want us to meet him hermione inquired speaking delicately as if she too noticed mcgonagall had gotten over upset over aberforth douglas cafe and coffee house mcgonagall said saying the name disdainfully in kent i suppose it muggle she wrinkled her nose slightly how will we know who dumbledore how will he know us how leave it to dumbledore to take care of that miss granger mcgonagall answered silence then well we dumbledore alive why didntanyone tell me this best be going it unfair the way you all leave me out as if i were some kind of thank you for your time professor child well i not a child i 20 now and i ll be mcgonagall i really hope we werentmuch trouble and ignore ron rants you watch yourselves too do not tell anyone where 21 and i work in the department of mysteries are you two because he a childish prat ron will you stop you were and also i d like to listening to me hermione will you stop interrupting me interrupting me mention a school reunion school reunion ron and hermione trumpeted in chorus you two must stop talking over each other mcgonagall tutted yes professor they said obidently mcgonagall rolled her eyes with impatience your invitations will arrive soon mcgonagall explained now we ve wasted enough time you two need to be off you re welcome to use my fireplace to floo to the wizard headquarters in kent you ll surely find directions to douglas cafe and coffee house there yes thank you professor hermione prompted and good bye yeah er see you around this was a nice visit ron added uncomfortably he wasntused to formal and cordial good byes with his ex professor professor mcgonagall glared sternly at them for a second but gradually her face softened and she gave them a brief but sincere smile on behalf of hogwarts i proud to have such prestigious students come visit me mcgonagall replied ron guessed that was her way of saying she was happy to see them too i dontknow how you could stand her hermione huffed the pair were currently in kent and they were lost they had gotten out of the kent wizard customs headquarters alright but their directions to douglas had been faulty or according to hermione it had been his fault they had been waiting at something called a bus stop when ron had noticed who else but megan jones the cute hufflepuff from his sixth year he and megan had gotten into a hefty conversation and well one thing led to another and instead of taking the bus to crescent drive the street douglas cafe and coffee house was on ron had instead taken hermione to megan flat half way across town to glimpse her new racing broom the firebolt 7 in her current fury hermione was walking about ten paces ahead of ron and anybody watching her wouldnthave even begun to guess she was talking to him of all people hermione wait ron called jogging up beside her and grabbing her arm for her to stop she wretched it away from him and glowered at him her face flushed red in the winter cold or maybe it was because she was so darn mad at him listen i have to tell you something ron started what is it is it an apology an explaination why for cripes sake why you dragged me across town to that wench flat or is it that you did it for that stupid date you got hermione shouted causing every muggle around them to stare no it just that we re standing outside douglas cafe and coffee house ron responded just thought you ought to know whao that was quirrell ish hermione harsh breathing dragged throughout the now evening air i cold hermione said with a slight whimper i ll buy you coffee then ron suggested sensibly and draped a friendly arm over her shoulder to steer her inside they took a table near the front hoping that dumbledore would notice them if they were more visible hermione slumped down and ron beside her they left the other more larger chair for dumbledore himself after a waiter more like a pimply muggle wearing an apron had served ron and hermione their coffees ron brought up a subject he would find rather amusing so why dontyou want me going out with megan jones ron questioned with amusement hermione looked up at him in shock i never said i dontwant you going out with megan jones hermione replied tersely well it seemed an awful lot like it what i dontunderstand is why who i do or dontdate matters so much to you ron said offhandedly he grinned as he saw her try to think of a response oh how he loved putting her on the spot you know what hermione mumbled what if dumbledore already came around here and left when he saw we werenthere ron was utterly disappointed at how well she could change the subject hermione ron began that not fair and what may i ask is not fair hermione asked she wasnteven looking at him but eyeing her nails in usual hermione style they were clean polished and practically gleamed you changing the subject ron said simply if you looked at hermione nails long enough they were rather hypnotizing what i didntchange the subject i dontknow what you re talking about hermione responded it came out calm but ron knew their was a certain defensive tone behind it fine if we re not changing subjects then you answer my question why do you care who i date or better hate why do you hate people i date even while we were at hogwarts and you proved that you still hate the woman i date ron almost stopped mid way through to pronounce that he had rhymed but swallowed up the urge and continued instead with that horrible becky incident at the port key to paradise ron finished oh and by the way did you notice how i rhymed back there with the hate and date he couldnthelp but add it afterall he didntjust rhyme any old day hermione sighed and then seemed to suddenly get quite angry you of all people are asking me this after what you did to me in seventh year ron was about to retort when he noticed hermione face she had never looked more scary and it wasntthe usual mcgonagall scary either it was the kind of look he would ve suspected hermione to give him if he d told her he d killed her mother speaking of killing if looks could kill ron was sure he d be pushing the daisies right about now ron mind paced quickly thinking of what to say geez mione relax will you no not that she would actually kill him if she heard that i sorry hermione he had a certain sense of pride you know very well what i did to you in seventh year what that didnteven make sense somehow or the other the only word that popped out of ron mouth was erm to his great relief the waiter came back to collect their mugs and give them the bill ron drew out some muggle money he had remaining from his trip to muggle town last month i hope this is enough ron muttered throwing around sixty seven pounds on the table the pimple faced waiter mouth dropped he quickly gulped his shock and asked the strange red haired man to sign the store copy of the hand written receipts they made ron hurried signing it a bit disappointed dumbledore still hadntarrived he had run out of ordering options because he was out of muggle money he couldntvery well sit here with a mad hermione forever without ordering why did the damn muggle coffee have to cost so much the waiter checked the name on the receipt and his eyes widened mister are you ron weasley the waiter questioned and you miss granger the pair nodded slighty dumbfounded could this be a wizard possibly with links to dumbledore douglas wants you in the back he explained the old bloke has been waiting for you two all day come on back ron and hermione exchanged glances hermione nodded and ron said take us to douglas douglas must be dumbledore friend of some sort ron and hermione scurried behind the counter with the teenager who walked with an odd sense of confidence and comfort when he was here ron passed a room with drowsy waiters and waitresses sitting around having lunch pale salads ugh finally they were led to a back room with a slightly more posh feel to it it had a nice homely oak finishing and ron noticed peculiar instruments silver peculiar instruments and they were moving dumbledore wasnttoo far away i ll leave you to it then the waiter said in a rush as if he was afraid of being in this room it made ron a tad nervous after the teenager waiter had left shutting the door behind him ron and hermione stood there awkwardly miss granger mr weasley ron swung around so fast that he knocked a lamp over he instantly knelt down to pick it up as he arose he saw the slender seemingly strong form of albus dumbledore in the doorway except in this case he was wearing a douglas cafe and coffee house uniform with the name tag douglas pinned to his shirt his beard and hair had been tragically cut so that they were barely half the length that they were before his white beard wasntso white at the moment and his half moon glasses were a bit foggy professor hermione breathed ron fought the urge to bow without another word dumbledore closed the door behind him and switched on the lamp ron had knocked over previously ron didnttake care to notice that the thing wasnteven plugged in sit please dumbledore said ushering them to two comfy parker loungers hermione looked like she was trembling with excitement what was about to come ron just remembered that he still didntknow professor dumbledore please tell us everything hermione said quietly and ron was shocked to find her eyes were filling up with tears it was then that ron realized his eyes were getting teary at the sight of his old headmaster dumbledore eyes gave the two their old twinkle i will tell you everything you wish to know but all in good time for now though would you care for a cookie author note thank you so much to everyone who read this story and i really hope you reviewed it would be really appreciated oh and sorry to those of you who waited a while to read this chapter homework kept pushing me off track sorry so much loooooooove winky disclaimer i dontowe harry and co duh good morning afternoon or evening depends on where you live anyways welcome to chapter 19 anyways for those of you asking what the deal was with the thing that happened in seventh year it was in the first chapter as ron says fine if we re not changing subjects then you answer my question why do you care who i date or better hate why do you hate people i date and of course hermione gets mad and says you of all people are asking me this after what you did to me in seventh year and the thing that happened in seventh year was past photography moment about to occur here peoples well if you must know seamus finnigan has just asked me out hermione i think you re making a big mistake why do you always have to put down whatever i do with viktor with s p e w with my work ethics and now with seamus those are just a few lines but i think you get the picture it all in the prologue pretty much ron put down the idea of hermion ever dating seamus and now that she kind of doing it to him he reacted and she just used her situation as a revenge sort of thing anywhooo to the thank yous chrismukkah hunnie i never would ve pictured dumbledore as a cafe owner either hmmmm maybe does an anteater have a trunk like thing lol anyways thanks for reviewing chuckie davis yes that the quirrell quote i was thinking of i know i do the same rhyme thing too i put in something that i think normal people might do in the story because dontwe love it read about people doing the things we do in everyday life oh and thanks a bunch for the review ellen2321 yes ron love life i think i might have gotten side tracked by dumbledore but after this chapter it coming back to the romance of course ron couldntresist himself he a single guy and isntplanning on telling hermione he loves anytime soon or so he thinks muahahah lol j ks haha drag it out i actually have badish news for that i already past the first half of the story the second half is sure to be juicier but it also going to wind the story down but have no fear it ll take me a while to tie up all the loose ends i

though the answers are all here in this chapter haha and thank you a lot for your awesome reviews jesse thanks all around ron impatiently stuffed two or three cookies into this mouth as he would ve done with his usual cashews with firewhisky he did not feel like eating cookies not even the yummy soft freshly baked chocolate chip ones dumbledore had offered them yet to his great shock he noticed that hermione actually seemed to be eating the cookies slower as if trying to waste time now why in the world would she do that wasntshe curious to know what was going on with dumbledore dumbledore stared thoughtfully at the two of them for a long time and after a while finally lowered his half moon spectacles you two have grown up to be quite the adults dumbledore pronounced happily not only have i heard from professor mcgonagall read it in the daily prophet but now i believe i am witnessing it true greatness for only true greatness could have returned you two to me ron didntfeel true greatness had anything to do with it luck luck was more like it and spying paintings professor if you please i d like to ask why have you come here hermione asked frowning why did you leave the wizarding world ron had just stood up to reach over the table to grab more cookies but stopped in his tracks at hermione words dumbledore who had casually been polishing his glasses with his own fingers then lowered his hands mr weasley if you could please take a seat dumbledore requested it is time for me you tell you everything ron sat abruptly and felt hermione tense up in preparation beside him dumbledore gazed out his dusty window for a long moment in fact it was so long that it felt like he had forgotten he had just been about to start giving them an explanation yet before ron or hermione could remind him he began still looking out the window you both know as well as i do the events that occured on the night of the final battle dumbledore commenced how hagrid had been sent to the hog head to find out if the rumor that lord voldemort and his death eaters had reached hogsmeade was even true how he was murdered how i wasnteven at the castle when voldemort attacked how i was by hagrid side as he passed away then i left the position of hiding his body to my brother who i thought had at least some sense as soon as i got to school the only person i found in the great hall was sybill trelawney you can imagine how disturbing this was she seemed to be having one of her reliable premonisions this one spoke of the wise wizard who thought good was soon to become the destruct of others i disregarded this because i hadntquite comprehended it ron snorted you well know i soon came into the chamber of ed n to aide harry in his battle at this time when i entered most of the death eaters were dead we all rejoiced voldemort defeat but the first person to leave the chamber afterwards was me i walked in on lucius malfoy torturing my brother aberforth the poor man had only come to ask me where to put the cadaver of our beloved hagrid once lucius saw me he almost looked surprised i suppose he thought aberforth had been me however it was then that i realized that i was the wise wizard and would become a harm to others why then hermione questioned dumbledore smiled i cannot say for i do not know myself isntlife like that sometimes you never know when you ll put together the various pieces well for me it was then looking into lucius eyes that i realized i might become a hazard because even after voldemort defeat his death eaters would still be at large i could endanger not only all of you but even my own wife and daughter you re married with a kid ron blurted out incredulously he had no idea that he would never have imagined that his ex headmaster had ever dumbledore studied ron rather carefully it made his ears go red with embarrassment and discomfort his previous question now sounded rather stupid he definately needed to learn to think before he spoke hermione glared at him upset that he had interrupted dumbledore in his story sometimes even the strongest most powerful men crave simple things things that you do not need money nor strength nor power to receive a thing you can only receive by loving dumbledore said then paused as the corners of his mouth twitched but affection is not enough if you keep your love hidden ron ears turned so red that some of the blood rushed to his cheeks too he felt pinpricks on the back of his neck what did dumbledore know how did he know hermione looked rather confused but didntspeak of it and when she spoke it wasnton the matter of love at all professor could you please dumbledore bowed his head up and down why of course i ll continue the story miss granger i was worried about everyone around me so i left the scene where my brother reached the climax of his insanity and soon packed my bags and moved here with my family after a while i came to own this coffee shop and opened it under the name douglas luckily when you caught lucius torturing who you thought was me he was immediately killed the only sane witness was dead all deathe eaters would be left to believe i was off my rocker and that was closure enough for most of them but why ron began would they want you and not harry he the one who really defeated v ron paused saying the dark lord name in front dumbledore was almost scary the dark lord actually harry was quite safe as safe as any of you in fact after voldemort fall his death eaters just would not except the fact that a teenage boy of seventeen had won against him their only other answer was me dumbledore clarified immediately pictures of what really happened began to form in ron mind it almost made perfect sense he knew how stubborn those death eaters could be it as simple as that ron inquired because the question had been on the tip of his tongue it as simple as that dumbledore finished now truly smiling hermione face however was still screwed up in thought and frustration her hair was all over the place because of the wind it had endured outside and her petite little nose was wrinkled comically adorably so many things seemed to be running through her head that she couldnteven fit them all in sometimes she opened her mouth silently formed a word then closed it again as if trying to clear her mind forming the proper sentence seemed a difficult task why haventyou returned to the wizarding world hermione implored finally all the death eaters or at least the major ones are locked up in azkaban now they pose no more threat anymore so why not come back you always were one to delve deeper miss granger for i believe i have never been asked that my anyone who knows of my being here dumbledore said in a kindly voice yet the answer you will get in return is only sub par there are laws in the wizarding world any wizard who fakes an identity is considered a criminal and faces charges upon return that troubles both me and my brother and it just isnt healthy imagine how everyone would react if i had returned they d be jolly good that what they d be ron replied in earnest yes perhaps but it isntright imagine waking up one day and finding some like oh i dontknow your dead mother there beside you you might be happy joyous but it wouldntteach you anything we all need to learn the lesson of loss and life some day i really will go and i dontwant to press the burden of losing me twice upon any of you loss is a part of us all we all lose something whether through death or not dumbledore answered nothing stays around forever but we must learn to grasp it while it is still here ron looked wistfully at hermione and felt the dread of her upcoming proposal wash over him speaking of loss you two had best be off ron eyes widened we re not leaving without you ron hermione sighed quietly let go she stood and stared at ron to follow her hermione ron exclaimed are you mad no ron i sensible now get a hold of yourself hermione scolded gently ron felt struck with a sudden sadness he would never see his old headmaster again and that he knew for sure ron glanced at him and noticed that his blue eyes were getting watery ron felt his own two eyes tear up too good bye professor hermione breathed ron just nodded speaking right now would be all too much dumbledore smiled up at the two of them you have done me proud miss granger watch over mr potter and mr weasley for me will you and mr weasley do not hesitate to say the words which are written all over your face before it is too late hermione looked at ron quizzically but he brushed her off partly because he didntwant to see her cry he tried to hold it in as much as possible but somehow two or three tears squeezed out damn damn damn it ron cursed under his breath as the two paced out of the room they were out of douglas soon and back in the cold snowy i tell you something hermione started softly but you have to promise not to get mad you said yes to seamus ron asked dumbstruck was she really getting married no i just wanted to say i was hungry hermione said suspicously but what all this about seamus nothing ron murmured ok hermione commented still seemingly suspicous where do you want to eat ron looked up and down the street it was packed with restaurants most of them had colorful signs finally he chose one that looked like it was really the best place because it was way busier than the others how about the place with the two golden arches ron said pointing across the street it really was packed mcdonald s hermione asked in a dazed sort of voice yeah it filled with muggles ron explained there has to be something good about it not in particular hermione shrugged and anyways i am not eating at mcdonald s it has enough customers let give the little restaurants a bit of a chance in the end ron found himself inside an odd restaurant by the name of fisherman frenzy the two of them sat at a blue and white checkered table with a lobster and prawns between them it tasted rather good with the oyster sauce ron had to admitt that sometimes muggle cooked pretty well cheesy music played in the background ron could almost laugh he could also admitt muggle had the strangest music why are you laughing hermione questioned him with a slight smile this song ron laughed it ridiculous it elton john hermione responded oh shush it over and i like this next song i dontknow what it is that makes me love you so i only know i never want to let you go cause you started something oh cantyou see ever since we met you ve had a hold on me its crazy but its true i only want to be with you the song not bad ron commented i actually quite like it who sings this stuff bay city rollers hermione said automatically as if she d read it out of a book as the song continued ron almost felt as if it was speaking what he felt for hermione if he ever told her or kissed or held her he d want this song in the background it was catchy it doesntmatter where you go or what you do i want to spend each moment of the day with you look what has happened with just one kiss i never knew that i could be in love like this after a while ron pulled a quill out of his pocket and began scribbling the lyrics he d want to remember this song later on it almost soothed him at least he knew some other person was just as crazy in love as he was there were probably plenty of people under this same predicament you stopped you smiled at me and asked me if i cared to dance i fell into your open arms i didntstand a chance now listen honey i just want to be beside you everywhere as long as we re together honey i dontcare hermione sang cheerfully ron joined because he knew the next part its crazy but its true i only want be with you he and hermione broke into grins which soon turned into the giggles softly they started the singing up again this time in tune with each other you stopped you smiled at me and asked me if i cared to dance i fell into your open arms i didntstand a chance they broke off as ron voice cracked involuntarily hermione laughed appreciatively and ron fought the urge to grab her hand no matter what you do i only want to be with you hermione laughter continued and showered a feeling of a true christmas over ron almost as if he was only a hogwart boy again he leant forward and pushed his lips up against hers ever so slightly its crazy but its true i only want to be with you author note some warm fuzzies for christmas it kinda a songfic chapter not really though look no cliffhanger yayness gayness as in the happy kind you perv winkyness highness yes yes i love you all and i must say slowly my life is coming into focus and becoming undercontrol oh and please r r xoxo winkywink disclaimer jkr is the luckiest person ever anywho now that i have so much darn time on my hands i decided to write the second chapter of this story but it is two weeks till dooms day a k a the day winky returns to school alas then i will not have all the lazy time i have now oh and i wanted to thank the people who reviewed the story so far silver ice thanks for your enthusiasm but i must say i not about to write in detail about the harry and voldy war in this chapter it kinda setted after hogwarts now so it much more romance than anything else i have a slight tendency to steer off romance and into angst in a lot of my writing hogwartzboizrhottiez thanks for your review and you re about to find out who hermione boyfriend is in this chapter for him life after hogwarts was good great even he was a very well known unspeakable in the department of mysteries had great friends and one heck of a family so maybe he didnthave a girlfriend but what did it matter he was young and handsome and had a date every other day with some good looking witch or the other he never planned to be in a serious marriage worthy relationship by the time he was twenty anyways who really cared about love when he was practically as famous as harry potter for aiding him in putting a stopper in the dark lord evil plots through his eyes the world was divided into two types of people those who were liked by him and those who weren t the world was spinning and he just kept on winning ron weasley had every reason to smirk mr weasley ron awoke from his current stupor when he noticed a little boy standing in front of him uh hello ron said rather perplexed at what a little boy would want with him mr weasley do you do you think i could get an autograph the little boy spoke up ron beamed down at him of course ron could never turn down signing autographs unlike harry he actually liked it when people asked him for them harry would always grumble afterwards claiming it was irritating always getting asked to sign things it seemed everything had harry face on them these days who am i making this out to ron asked looking up at the boy flushed face sherman macmillan he said breathlessly my father says he knew you and harry potter while you were at hogwarts is is true ron studied and boy face and began to recognize some of his former classmate features yes it is true ron replied your father was a good prefect sherman face broke into a smile ron smiled back weakly he had never been fond of ernie actually ron had always thought him a rather pompous git sir are you going off somewhere to meet harry potter sherman squeaked walking alongside ron well yes actually i am ron said and immediately regretted doing so harry wouldntlike it if ron brought along a fan with him to the leaky cauldron but ron added he ll be extremely grumpy today had to fight off dark wizards you know being a well known auror and all so it probably best you dontask him for an autograph today unless you want to displease the boy who lived ron knew he had hit the jackpot as sherman face screwed up in terror no no i dontwant to upset him well i suppose i had best be going bye mr weasley sherman called scurring off ron watched him run over to a bunch of his mates and show off his newly signed piece of parchment ron decided he had better make a beeline for the leaky cauldron unless he wanted all those boys harrassing him for an autograph once inside he headed off towards the counter after giving a couple of people who were already inside slight nods why ello mr weasley tom called happily gesturing ron over to the counter what will it be today ron had barely opened his mouth to speak when someone cut across him one firewhiskey with a bunch of cashews ron suddenly became rigid only a select few knew what he always ordered and that voice so oddly familiar but he didntdare to believe who it was it was a rather bossy sounding voice that he hadntheard in about three years he turned to face a bushy haired someone who was now wearing an amused expression hiya herms ron said casually as if nothing had ever changed as if he still saw her everyday like he used to at hogwarts as if she had written and answered all the letters he and harry had written her after the war as if she had attempted to keep in touch with them as if she hadntever broken up the invincible trio hermione frowned instantly at the nickname which as always had that negative affect on her hiya herms after three years apart that all you have to say she sighed i see you re still as senseless as ever i senseless why dontyou think over who kept us apart for three years ron questioned more coldly than he meant hemione faltered a bit then said why dontyou come join us at our table since you re alone actually i was waiting for harry and luna but i guess i could wait for them over there ron said cocking his head who exactly are us come and see hermione said playfully ron grabbed his firewhiskey and cashews and followed her as she headed towards a table near the back of the room ron was almost shocked to see seamus he hadntrealized hermione was still with him then again why wouldntshe be during the famous battle with harry and you know who when hermione had fallen and been mortally wounded ron had rushed to her side only to find seamus already there cradling her in his arms it had infuriated him but he couldntdo anything about it i suppose you ll remember seamus hermione said sitting down why of course ron said a bit too politely squeezing seamus hand rather threateningly during their handshake he took a chair always nice to run into a fellow gryffindor seamus said grinning completely oblivious to ron threat ron smiled heartily and looked back at hermione i didntknow you two crazy dogs were still together ron said as nicely as he could muster we ve been together since hogwarts hermione said cheerfully causing ron to twitch his head irritably ah ron said delicately i see so you with anyone right now weasley seamus inquired nope ron said happily i think being in a relationship when you re young is a bother really oh i completely disagree hermione started love at anytime in your life is wonderful i have to agree with my girlfriend on that one seamus said nodding underneath the table ron clenched his fist she must have you whipped then ron retorted smugly even if she did i wouldnthave minded she the best thing to happen to me my whole life seamus said staring at hermione affectionately and she looked back at him the same way ron didntopen his mouth he feared that if he did he would need to vomit violently so ron hermione said finally breaking the blissful gaze with seamus you re quite the man of the moment arentyou ron flicked his wand around carelessly i dontknow about man of the moment but yes i am doing quite well oh please that an understatement you and harry practically make headlines every other day with the wonderful things you two do at the ministry hermione said and i should know i editor of the daily prophet well well well not so bad off yourself eh ron said and what do you do seamus he owns a quidditch shop hermione said answering for him not bad ron said appreciatively so luna and harry still together then hermione asked yeah as always they are perfectly perfect and it sickens me ron said disgustedly deep down though he was rather happy for them both over the past three years luna had practically become one of ron best mates weirdly enough anyway their relationships is always all over witch weekly ron continued and luna gets a hefty amount of money for writing columns in there and the quibbler yeah she becoming quite an icon herself hermione said thoughtfully getting lots of respect for being with harry and all those civil rights laws she wants pushed through not counting the fact that we had a field day when she declared she might consider becoming an auror to spend more time with harry mmm ron nodded he had never paid much attention to luna when she got to rambling about civil rights for various magical species she was almost as bad as hermione and s p e w hermione it two seamus said suddenly oh we should be going sorry to leave so abruptly ron hermione said no biggie ron said i ll perhaps owl you sometime hermione suggested nervously uh yeah sure this was nice ron said truthfully yes and tell harry and luna we said hi hermione said before trailing after seamus ron watched her go and tried to stop the sinking feeling in his stomach why was it that just when he thought he was over hermione she had to walk into his life again and make him fall in love with her all over again she always made him feel like a silly school boy still fighting off acene and trying to seem cool hermione always brought back memories of the past and he had tried to shove her into the back of his mind just a blurred memory he tried to get the perfect picture of her out of his mind and sometimes he barely succeeded in making it hazy how many times of heartbreak would it take for him to realized that hermione hadntcared enough to write to him after the war and wanted nothing to do with him she d moved on and he had to too by george luna i think he actually thinking for a change harry voice rang out ron looked up a bit dazed but quickly shook out of it shut your face ron said oooh is someone angry harry questioned nah just forget about it ron said what up luna she yawned and harry looked at her rather concerned she been up all night working on some report harry said rubbing the back of her hand even though i told her to come to bed so she could rest or so you could shag he r ron said cheekily you watch your mouth harry said grinning harry could you go get me some gillywater please luna requested harry nodded and stood leaving ron alone with luna she wasnther same old self the war had changed her worrying about harry and then helping them all fight off the dark lord had shook her into reality although sometimes ron had to admit she was still as crazy as ever she was still looking for that crumple horned whatever sometimes she even took harry and ron along with her to search for it you ve been working yourself too hard ron observed so have you luna responded and how many times have i told you to get yourself a girlfriend ron grimaced i dontneed a girlfriend sure you do luna said you cantlet one person hold you back from love ron ron stiffed luna was always nagging him to find a girl and always telling him that he shouldntexpect hermione to suddenly come back to him i know he said quietly taking a sip of firewhiskey harry returned holding a gillywater cocktail and a butterbeer for himself the gillywater seemed to wake luna up rather effectively from her drowsiness so what the latest ron asked staring at the two of them they immediately sat straighter and looked at each other smiling like idiots well harry said smiling wider than ron had ever seen him smiling before last night i asked luna to marry me ron choked on his firewhiskey and had to duck his head under the table to spit some of it out when he came back up his face looked elated and we re all smiling because luna was smart enough to say no right ron joked no you git harry said still smiling she said yes really ron said well that even better that not all ron luna said we want you to be best man why i in the shock of my life me ron weasley best man at harry potter wedding who would ve thought i always imagined it d be draco malfoy ron said grinning he couldnthave been happier really it was about time the two closest people to him got hitched good for you both ron added more seriously i happy for you two thanks mate harry said reaching up to shake hands with him although ron said thoughtfully although luna asked although i would ve thought that if luna and i were to be married our kids would ve been a lot more good looking ron ended luna laughed at this and harry glared a bit before returning to his smiling state so luna who the maid of honor ron asked well luna began i was thinking ginny but then i thought it would be rather weird if you had to walk her down the aisle as a date type thing and well i not completely sure now ron realized that if hermione had been with them luna would ve chosen her in a heartbeat i sure you ll find someone ron said supportively yeah i wonder if i can ask an old friend from hogwarts or something luna said thinking of who out of the few friends she d had would be suitable as a maid of honor speaking of old friends from hogwarts ron started darkly guess who i bumped into today hermione the mood at the table changed from joyful to rather grim what did she want harry asked harry luna tutted his defensive tone she was the only one that hadntheld a grudge against hermione for not keeping in touch nothing much ron answered she editor of the daily prophet and still dating seamus luna snorted they re a horrible couple why do you say harry asked well they re not soul mates are they luna said taking a big gulp of her gillywater harry and ron exchanged looks of utter confusion it was times like these where luna really did seem loony are we soul mates harry said arching an eyebrow of course luna said or else we wouldnthave made it this far harry grinned at her and leaned down for a kiss ron wrinkled his nose it was annoying when they three would be talking and out of the blue harry and luna would begin a kissing fest it kind of made ron yearn for a relationship like theirs oh stop it you two ron said you can do that when you get home what did i tell you about our talks being sacred no kissing while we talk it degrading and disgusting they pulled apart and grinned up at him obviously talking to hermione has enraged you luna stated calmly nuh uh ron said sounding like a child luna eyes bulged and she simply said yeah huh before falling into a kiss with harry again sickening ron grumbled whilst stuffing a few more cashews into his mouth he fell into thought once again would hermione owl him like she said she would and if so did that mean they were friends again would they always be destined to be friends and would ron always have to stand on the sidelines while seamus got her all to himself or were they like luna said not soul mates ron scolded himself for believing such outrageous stuff and settle back to just picturing how she d looked today hair bushy as ever wearing pale green robes with a silver clasp big brown eyes intact and looking as beautiful as ever he wanted to savor the moment he d had with her as long as he could before he felt he would need to wash it out of his mind author note not much of the general plot yet i hoping to add that to the next chapter anyways i hope you enjoyed this chapter r r please disclaimer on the first day of

reminder of how much you guys rock thanks for making me the lucky author of a story with 300 reviews surprise surprise hermione pulled away first ron wiped the corner of his mouth and stared up at her expecting to get quite a scolding and she looked very capable of giving it too her face concorted with a red fury but somehow settled hermione managed to calm her face so that it was wrinkle free and rather tranquil in a way that was even scarier than anger this could only mean the worse was yet to come ron preoccupied himself by staring around at christmas decorations around the room and up on the ceiling above them ronald hermione began using his first name so as to make him cringe first names were never good what ever was that for her forced calm was only given away by the rage that flooded her eyes her bushy hair resembled the tentacles of an octapus and seemed to be able to reach out and choke him at any given moment erm ron mumbled there wasntmuch to say hermione i crazy about you hermione you re all i ever think about hermione i love you none of those topics seemed particularly appealing and yet as ron noticed something spectacular even his own genius surprised him see that miseltoe above us hermione stiffed and regretfully looked up what about it just paying you back from that kiss you gave me under the miseltoe at the burrow ron replied rather smugly hermione stared up at it and back at him then calmed and slouched in relief oh alright ron nodded with a grin but couldnthelp but be disappointed it almost looked as if hermione was slight disappointed over what ron we should really get going you know back to the burrow everyone ll be waiting for us and it almost dinnertime hermione suggested yeah yeah ron shrugged starting to get up but hermione placed a hand on his shoulder you know what she said sounding hesitant what ron questioned bewildered i think i like that picture you got me afterall hermione said with a slight smile and tell you why you two just suddenly decided to take the muggle way back to the burrow harry interrogated rather well he was an auror afterall but ron and hermione lips remained sealed and why not luna piped up vouching for them i do it sometimes harry was caught between them he knew perfectly well luna was a special case in these circumstances but would never say so aloud number one because he didntwant to risk hurting her feelings and number two he found there was no point in raising the topic it was rather endearing well just harry said in a choppy tone nevermind luna smiled in triumph and ron and hermione shared looks of glee afterwards mrs weasley came round with candycanes and gingerbread men and eggnog too ron greedily ate all he could get his hands on it wasnteveryday he ate homemade treats some days all he had was whisky and cashews it was a basicly wonderful evening and completely uneventful mid way through though mrs weasley called harry out of the room claiming there was someone for him at the fireplace ron had a feeling there was more to it then that because when harry re entered the room he looked as pale as a ghost anything wrong harry luna inquired gently as he plomped down beside her softly no nothing harry said and ron knew he was lying he had a feeling luna did too but she did not press upon it the wedding was not too far away in february time for some supper mrs weasley called out to them she bustled into the room and ushered them all into the kitchen where they were to eat she was very much in her element cooking serving keeping perfect red curls all in the joyous time of the season her voice seemed higher if not happier ron was just grateful she wasntcarrolling at the moment just as the whole hang had settled to dinner the doorbell rang throughout the house everyone looked up from their plates stimutaneously almost remorefully ron stared hungrily at the food why did there have to be visitors now i wonder who that could be mrs weasley pondered out loud george dear can you go check it out i fred fred chiruped and why is it me tell ron to get it no tell ginny to ron complained no way tell george not happening ask bill me i the eldest i ve earned the priveledge not to do it tell charlie if it going to be anybody it ll be percy fred go now mrs weasley shouted wagging a finger fred did not go quietly he managed to pout and sulk and kick percy off his chair on his way ron did not particularly care who it was he wanted some of the roast chicken hermione on the other hand seemed to have lost all thought of food and waited in anticipation as fred came back and announced who their dinnertime visitor was ron was surprised and upset to see seamus step inside after fred his stomach gave a huge lurch and this time it was not on account of the food he hadnttalked to seamus in what felt like a good many years and now suddenly he was there standing in the burrow with mrs weasley inviting him to sit down the time they had spent apart seemed such a long weary period and to see him suddenly made ron wonder is he still alive of course seamus seemed very much alive as he took the other seat to hermione left and pecked her on the cheek a soft heat crept up her face that was evident to all and she shot ron a rather goofy nervous smile ron smiled back trying to seem aloof even though he felt horrible it felt as if seamus was the head of gryffindor and had just caught them having an after hours quidditch victory celebration so how ve you all been seamus asked politely as mrs weasley scooped mounds of mashed potatos onto his plate good jolly and now hungry george spoke up he grabbed the largest piece of chicken and began munching away at it like crazy daphne gave him a detesting look and only took sips from her wine glass all night and what about you ron seamus questioned facing him eh ron shrugged no girls then seamus joked smiling handsomely no of course not hermione replied rather quickly before ron even got a chance to get out a word all eyes turned on her very suspicously finally it was fred who broke the silence see that ron even hermione knows you re not a lady man that not what i meant hermione protested blushing furiously oh dontworry about it mione you wouldntbe the first witch to sound appalled at the idea of ron and a girl george said mischeviously shut up the both of you ron hissed and then added what hermione means is that i just at a bit of a dry spell right now what ever happened to that lovely becky girl mrs weasley inquired innocently but ron knew she saw this as a chance to intrude on her son love life nothing mum ron responded simply what do you mean nothing mrs wealey pried can we not talk about becky harry suggested unnerved luna glanced at him and ron noticed a glint of worry in her eyes why should you care what does or does not happen with becky luna questioned i dontcare it just a bad topic for ron harry said loudly what why it a bad topic ronald mrs weasley implored sounding slightly annoyed that she wasntgetting anything out of him it not ron yelled shooting daggers into harry with his eyes oh molly just let it go mr weasley said gently soothing her now seamus didntyou mention your dad was a muggle er yeah seamus said well then what is it like being a wizard who also has to cope with pure bred muggles in the family mr weasley asked sounding fascinated da ad ginny snapped dontfrighten the guests supper passed in a mess of chatter and ron sighed almost wishing everyone would just go away for once he immediately scolded himself for this thought without everyone around him he would be a very sad little wizard yet sometimes he wished he could be another person just once like seamus ron thought watching him and hermione clasp hands she seemed to have forgotten him totally now that her boyfriend had returned ron was so emotionally out of control right now he felt as if he could almost tell hermione he adored her it was as if ron the hero had left and in his place remained a huge bloody throbing heart a bit too descriptive dontyou think daphne smirked huh what are you talking about ron gulped he thought he already knew you know what i talking about daphne teased did you read my mind or something ron asked dumbfounded if that was true he d have to be selective of his thoughts in her prescence of course daphne didntrespond but just gave him a piercing stare as if to answer she stood declaring the end of dinner and ron gasped her stomach was two times bigger than it had been yesterday when she d arrived but how problems weasley daphne demanded staring from her pregnant stomach to the shocked expression on ron face you should know since you can read minds ron retorted but if you ask then well not to be rude or anything but how come you ve gotten to much bigger in two days i a vampire daphne said in exasperation my pregnancy moves along at a faster rate than a human s i know it been two months to you to a human i d be in the first trimester but to a vampire i already in my third actually the baby due in february the thirteenth to be exact ron nodded still feeling winded george a dad in less than two months no way no way no way way an irritating voice in his head countered ron frowned february was going to be one heck of a busy month a wedding and a baby what next hermione engagement ron shivered hopefully not ron could i get a word seamus implored after they had all progressed to the sitting area sure ron nodded and led seamus out into the hall again so they could have some privacy they stood uncomfortably for a bit before seamus coughed so what do you want ron said as courteously you could say so what do you want erm you know about the whole engagement thing seamus started yes ron said his eyes widening was seamus could it be possible he would was he cancelling the engagement altogether well i ve decided not to do it seamus finished or so ron thought he cheered loudly and clapped seamus on the back good on you mate ron hollered i tell you you re making the right decision what are you talking about i haventeven ended my sentence and you go mad with glee seamus said looking at him as if he were crazy ron face fell oh go on what i meant is i ve decided not to do it yet but there is good news seamus added really ron said weakly and what that i have set the date for it seamus grinned february eleventh what ron exclaimed why the eleventh to that day four years ago is when i realized i had a crush on hermione seamus said eyes glazing over ron swallowed a huge tangle of sorrow in his throat an exact date an exact date was not good for him it meant that an engagement was secure he did not want that happening are you sure seamus ron asked even though it was more of a beg yes i sure seamus replied unable to wipe the smile off his face wait till you hear what i ve got planned for that day ron began heading back into the dining room with his ears rining with seamus fabulous plans for the proposal he had rented a park for the day an entire park it was to be smouldered with romantic candles and white roses hermione favourite and the best or worst part was that everyone was invited her family his family ron family ron himself ron didntknow if he could bear to be with hermione on the night she gave herself over to another man forever and ever as soon as he entered the sitting room more good news met him actually this time it was a rather happy announcement harry and luna had kicked up the date of their wedding to february seventeenth ten days earlier than planned evidently it had been harry idea he had his arm around his fiance and looked perfectly happy but ron could tell something was up he was scared something might happen what it was exactly ron wasntsure harry d come

walk to remember by sultrie notes abound by shadow phantom the dark lord who stole christmas by michelle 31a or luna year by michelle 31a well that was quite a lot anyways hmm your plot idea is tempting but nah lol and thanks for reviewing hermione will you marry me seamus asked solemnly bending down on one knee he extended a ring from his pocket it was that beautiful diamond clustered ring author note if you re curious hermione ring looks a bit like this everyone fell into a slight awe the tension was unmountable ron stood above them on a parapet of white stone extending over a pale gray waterfall it was a beautiful view from up here but ron couldntconcentrate on it what would hermione say her reply was however interrupted by a sudden violent shimmer that ran through the whole park a real live muggle earthquake ron gripped the side of the parapet it was swaying ron get off that thing it going to crash ginny cried fearfully ron cursed himself privately for forgetting his wand at home he had to risk a jump with all the courage he could manage to muster he took the leap as if commanded by a higher power ron landed on all fours like a cat just as the parapet was about to collaspe the only problem seemed to be the rising threat of it crushing hermione in the proccess somebody help somebody do something hermione screamed oh wontsomeone rescue me ron took it upon himself to save her afterall he did love her using all of his training as a quidditch captain he began running towards her there was a 50 50 chance of him saving her and another of him being crushed along with her he was willing to take that chance the last few moments before the parapet fell seemed to pass in slow motion for ron in a sudden rush he grabbed hermione up by the waist and rolled out of the way of danger but the only problem was seamus wasntquite so fast actually the only part of him sticking up out of parapet were his feet slowly but surely however they shriveled away now where have i seen that before ron pondered aloud perhaps it was at hermione house one summer while watching some absurd movie about wizards what does it matter hermione laughed he dead and now i donthave to marry him infact i can go out with any guy i like and i choose you ron because you are so very sexy i know right ron said with a smile and procceeded to receive compliments from her with an air of graciousness and with that she began rubbing his chest awfully seductively he grinned widely let this be know as the day the great ron weasley defeated seamus finnigan harry trumpeted with a fist in the air yes yes everyone cried out in chorus now let us sing george suggested with a shout and so it started hogwarts hogwarts hoggy warty hogwarts teach us something please whether we be old and bald or young with scabby knees our heads could do with filling with some interesting stuff for now they re bare and full of air dead flies and bits of fluff so teach us things worth knowing bring back what we ve forgot just do your best we ll do the rest and learn until our brains all rot the whole crew broke out into gleeful celebration even seamus family the weasley s luna harry fleur and daphne were all smiles of course wait daphne smile ron awoke to the sound of hedwig pecking at his window he got up from bed and opened the window allowing the owl entry into his flat hedwig swooped in and settled herself on ron bedside table ron plomped onto his bed and took his breakfast from the owl mouth toast and marmalade and as usual it was still warm brilliant he turned to hedwig and fed her one of his slices of toast he didntfeel too hungry at the moment hedwig however looked at ron questioningly as if to ask where zeus was it was strange how animals seemed so adapt to communicating with humans he in his room ron said in a tired tone after hedwig fluttered off he chose not to pick himself up and head to the bathroom for a good washing instead he swung his legs back onto his bed and sat there staring at the white wall across from him he remembered painting it the previous year sometimes if he looked closely enough he could almost see shapes in his uneven strokes a face a unicorn maybe even an eagle ron yawned widely what did it matter he d been a mess since seamus had told him the date he d set for the engagement february eleventh it rang through his head like a bad song he d gotten stuck in his head ever since then ron had been having odd dreams all of which ended with hermione in his arms and seamus dead now what could that mean he smiled lazily to himself he knew perfectly well what it meant once again his thoughts were interrupted by the sound of another owl pecking at his window now this one he didntrecognize probably an owl from the daily prophet it turned out he was quite correct the barn owl was from the daily prophet ron paid out the usual sum and tipped a bit extra to the owl it felt good to tip out extra extra money was something his family was not used to having but now that he had almost endless money ron found it wasntquite so appealing what mattered more now seemed to be hermione herself a third pecking woke him from the stupor he d fallen into another unrecognizable owl perhaps it was another daily prophet owl they could ve mistakenly sent him two papers instead of one but ron thought back to it editor in chief and decided she wouldnthave tolerated any mistakes from her employees nevertheless he opened the window a third time now from the window opening and closing so many times the cold air from outside was chilling his room the particular owl not entering was a grayish brownish eagle owl and it stuck it leg out as if in a rush to be off ron untied the letter and before he even opened it the owl flew off where are you going in such a rush ron called out as it disappeared in the distance he shut the window roughly and took a seat on his bed he checked the return address and before he d even read it he knew where it was from emerald green writing colored each letter of the address hogwarts ron whispered delightfully he almost missed getting these letters he opened the letter with a black and chrome letter opener mrs weasley had given him the first day he d started work at the ministry of course he never used it and it just lay on his bedside table unpurposefully but now that he wanted to actually open a letter with care it came in handy dear mr weasley we the hogwarts alumni are pleased to invite you to the hogwarts reunion of the class of 1991 1998 the reunion will be held at hogwarts school of

although you should like to expect you to pay attributes to your school and class by attending this spectacular event sincerely lisa turpin chairman of the hogwarts alumni class of 1991 1998 ron resisted from celebrating to grandly he would be going back to hogwarts and this time it wasntfor a dull meeting with professor mcgonagall he d actually be seeing his old friends again perhaps even his old enemies like draco malfoy who would ve thought that in a few years he d actually despise seamus more than malfoy not him that for sure once again he was disrupted in his train of thought but his doorbell ringing wildly ron set the letter aside and rushed to get the door most people might feel self conscious about getting the door in their boxer shorts and a white shirt with a large plum colored stain on it his hair was also in disaray and if hermione had seen it she would ve scolded him profusely ron rubbed some sleepies out of his eyes and opened the door it was only harry he completely seemed to not notice ron messy appearance hey mate harry greeted casually before inviting himself in he took a seat on ron couch and ran his fingers out his hair afterwards he cringed inwardly for doing so it was a strange habit everytime he ran his hands through his hair making it even messier he would cringe ron had no clue why running your hand through your hand was such a horrible thing to do and perhaps he never would hello ron responded in fake politeness he was feeling rather cool towards harry after christmas day he had a feeling harry was hiding something from everyone about him and becky there were so many things wrong with this first of all ron was hurt he hadntbeen let in on harry secret when he scarcely hid anything from him secondly whatever it was had to do with fidelity and ron wasntprepared to forgive him for disrespecting luna in such a manner afterall didnthe love how could he ron i i have to tell you something harry said his voice cracking unfamiliarly was he about to tell him ron hoped so no matter how mad he got he d help get past his becky phase afterall becky was only temporary luna was for life oh ron said offhandedly he commenced reading today issue of the prophet and waited for harry to step in at anytime it s well it about becky ron finished so quickly if almost confused harry what no no of course not why would i talk about becky harry exclaimed he was starting to look nervous i dontknow ron began why would you talk about becky i not talking about becky harry sighed i just came to talk about my bachelor party what about it ron asked unsatisfied with his answer he just knew harry had been about to spill on the beans on the becky situation his best mate couldntlie to him so easily well the wedding on the seventeenth and well i going away on the seventh and i ll be back on the sixteenth so i need to have my bachelor before the seventh of february harry explained i was thinking the fifth whatever best for you harry ron replied with a shrug harry frowned he was starting to sense his coldness yeah harry trailed off he was unable to think of something to talk about now that ron was so obviously angry at him for some reason so tell me ron question where are you going france on an auror mission harry responded awfully bad time to go i think you should have declined ron prompted this was bad harry in france he was going to be working with french aurors becky was a french auror i couldn t all the other aurors are already away on tasks harry clarified you re dropping too much on luna ron said not realising his voice level had risen two twinks she can handle it harry said loudly his temper was acting up again harry whatever you re about to do dontdo it ron begged him it not worth it you ll only hurt luna what the hell are you talking about harry shouted angrily i would never hurt anyone especially not luna ron jumped up and stood over harry menacingly he retaliated but standing also for two tense minutes the two friends glared at each other ron took it upon himself to turn away he opened the front door and hoped harry would leave when he didn t ron struck up conversation once again you are coming back arentyou ron inquired turning away from the door oh ron of course i am harry sighed with frustration dontworry about me ron smiled right what that supposed to mean harry questioned well if you dontknow there not bloody point in telling you is there ron breathed well well well look at the two of you argue like an old married couple ron and harry both nearly jumped out of their skins and whirled around to face hermione in the doorway she was standing there with a rather smug yet amused smile playing on her lips at catching both her mates arguing in such a manner you can really scare people sometimes you know that ron gasped regaining his breath yes i know that very well and it gives me a tremendous amount of pride hermione smirked she stepped inside and brushed her shoes on the mat ron had placed at the door what were you arguing about anyway hermione asked with an even amount of curiousity quidditch ron blurted out harry looked at him as if he were some kind of prodegy for thinking up such a fabulous excuse ron smiled wryly the real prodegy in the room was harry yeah ron thinks the chudley canons are a shoe in for the next quidditch world cup harry continued but i think the montrose magpies they win every year that is so not happening ron retorted is too the chudley canons have horrible beaters and their seeker is just about as bad as draco malfoy in sixth year harry responded ron clutched his chest as if expecting to have a heart attack from all the profanity harry had spoken oh you two hermione sighed with a shake of her head always quidditch quidditch always author note from the milk commercial yeah well if you didntcome to listen to us ramble about quidditch what did you come here to do anyways ron asked scratching his nose i came to remind harry that it twelve thirty hermione said pointedly that nice of you harry said sounding confused we had a lunch date today potter hermione huffed for twelve oh oops harry said remembering the promise he d made i forgot typical hermione frowned so that why i brought some lunch along with me for all three of us ron now noticed the bulging bag hermione was holding in her hand if he had known it was bulging with take out he would ve devoured it by now he was hungry only a slice of toast since he d woken up hermione settled herself on the floor and brought out the various items she d bought each one more appetizing than the next soon the trio was pinicking on ron living floor and even enjoying each other company you know what since you two are so disorganized how about i make you a day planner hermione suggested sounding eager herms harry groaned hermione immediately threw a pillow at him what did i tell you two about that nickname hermione questioned that you find it lovely and just adore the fact that we love you enough to give you a petname ron answered oh you guys hermione said lost between sighing and laughing oh hey you know what i just remembered the reunion thingy are you all going harry implored course ron replied and hermione nodded i suppose we ll run into snape and malfoy and the slytherins harry said sourly it all too bad that they haventbeen turned into the slugs they really are hermione said in mock depression no talks about slugs please ron scolded ever since the incident in second year ron was rather hesitant to mention slugs especially while eating catching onto his harry and hermione laughed merrily would you prefer spiders then harry offered teasingly if you dontshut your mouth ron started now ronniekins ease up on your temper a bit hermione joked munching away happily at her lunch ronniekins ron grimaced i thought we were giving nicknames to people we love hermione said with an arched eyebrow harry laughed but ron just grinned rather slopily after a while he released a long string of breath i cantbelieve you two are getting married yeah harry continued it going to be so different what do you mean by the two of us hermione demanded now suddenly suspicous harry and ron panicked my bad ron said keeping his voice cool and smooth i meant i can believe you too as in t o o are getting married hermione gave him a sideways look but that doesntmake sense we re not all as smart as you now are we ron smiled no hermione agreed watching harry trying to slurp his spaghetti up through a straw no we aren t author note this was a totally useless chapter in many ways but fear not next chapter is crazy you shall seee the drama is drawing near and i must say we are well past the second part of this story so i must say i am seriously

you enjoy this chapter too carabeara thanks balewilyiel yes twas very interesting thanks for your review too ron had once heard that girl night out was a muggle phrase for a night that came very seldom throughout a year for a woman it was the time for her to go all out with her girlfriends and have some fun dance the night away get drunk perhaps and if any bloke was lucky she d sleep with him well to hell with that because tonight ron harry and a few of the guys were going to have a night so spontaneous it would put girl night out to shame for harry bachelor partythey had rented out a large room in night black the busiest wizard nightclub in london of course it wasntquite so hard as you might expect night black was honored to be the host for harry potter bachelor party after this information had gotten out witch weekly had kicked night black up to number one on it top ten list of nightclubs it had beated out a very furious and insulted pointy hat conection even though the party was set to start at nine harry and ron had arrived five to make sure everything was going according to plan you may wonder what ron was doing being so buddy buddy with harry once again ron decided to give harry his bachelor party a day to go wild and he wasntgoing to wreck it by being sulky no mention of becky for now mr potter this is our alcohol menu please select whatever type of drink you would like us to serve at your party tonight the manager of night black offered harry took the velvety menu gingerly but before he could open it ron snapped it out of his hand and handed it back to the manager listen mr gafir mr weasley the manager responded looking mildly surprised yeah well who are you kidding here you think we want one of your alcohol items ron said in an accusatary tones why why yes mr weasley we offer the best in world quality wines and liquor we select beverages from only the best wineries ron rolled his eyes i dontcare about that what i trying to say is we dontwant one of your alcoholic beverages we want them all the manager looked from harry to ron indignantly and replied the cost will be very high sir we can handle it ron responded turning towards harry in a manner of dismissing the manager from their prescense he stuck up his nose and strolled away all types of drinks that a brilliant idea mate harry grinned yes it is one of my more better ideas even if i do say so myself ron said smugly so about tonight who ve you invited harry scrunched up his face in thought erm your brothers neville dean some guys from work seamus seamus ron commented quickly yeah you dontmind do you mate cause i wasnthyped up to do it luna sort of made me a gesture of politeness or whatever harry clarified mind me no no ron fibbed i mean it ll be great all us all dorm mates back together again sure will harry trailed off listen could you apparate to rosamerlicks and check in on luna and how she getting along with her party ok ron answered getting that odd he s hiding something from me feeling but why dontyou go do it well i was planning to go see if they re setting up the security properly especially with all those damn reporters trying to get in harry explained it wontbe a problem will it nah ron muttered i might as well go now see you around he got up from the table he had seated himself at and with a pop apparated to rosamerlicks harry and luna flat a bit off diagon alley within a good few seconds he appeared in their living room ron had always thought his flat rather big better than what most had but compared to harry and luna apartment it was a dump the flat itself was had a pleasant light and airy feeling and the sunlight that wafted in through the large bay window only added to the effect luna had filled it with interesting artifacts she had come across over the course of her life it had many silver instruments that gave off the feeling of dumbledore office and of course harry personality wasntto be dulled by his girlfriend exuberant one his broomstick collection was displayed in glass caskets and ron noticed his most precious one the firebolt harry also had his old gryffindor quidditch uniform on display along with a uniform the england national quidditch had awarded him for playing one charity match ron had been green with jealously when he d gotten it ron luna questioned coming out of the kitchen what are you doing here ron faced her came to see how the party plans were coming along oh well you neednthave come since i already invited hermione and ginny to come help luna replied and headed back into the kitchen ron followed her and the smell of burning marshmellows met his nostrils he coughed involuntarily luna something burning i know she said and sat down on a high stool and began reading the quibbler arentyou going to stop burning it ron asked wearily he was sure to get some crazy response from the blonde no luna said simply and kept on reading her magazine ron sighed why not luna finally put down her copy of the quibbler i want to give the marshmellows a nice burnt feeling like when you roast them in a fire at one point in his life getting that kind of answer would ve made ron want to shake her senseless but now he could only smile of course you re right i dontknow what i was thinking i suppose i ll eat them now they burned long enough luna said flicking out her wand and taking the marshmellows out of the oven ron had heard muggles had ovens that ran on elicktercity wizards used magic care for one luna implored offering him some he shook his head so where are you girls going tonight sensasso luna said without any smugness at mentioned the name of the hottest women escapade club in england if girl wanted a night out sensasso was the place to go ron heard they had men there that would ve put gilderoy lockhart out of business that is to say if he hadntgone insane first and you mentioned hermiome coming over ron asked ruefully he didntlike the thought of hermione at sensasso with all those hired men yes i did ronald luna said through a mouthful of marshmellow she was the only one who could call him ronald without him being pestered by it you know it not too late for you to make your move luna commented licking a marshmellow glop off her fingers i think it is luna ron said in exasperation well it definately is if you give up all hope like you ve obviously done luna replied love isntalways easy luna it isntalways perfect like you and harry make it seem ron burst forth ron regretted what he said because luna face darkened considerably she recovered however and gave him a bitter sweet smile all isntwell in paradise at the moment luna said shortly but those words vibrated a thousand more you mean becky dontyou ron inquired he was feeling worse by the second so luna knew what was going on yes luna replied vaguely i think so at least as far as i know harry hiding something from me ron placed a comforting arm around her have you asked him about it i d rather he told me luna answered and continued to eat her marshmellows as if nothing had happened then she suddenly frightened him by speaking again i invited her to the bachelorette party tonight i want to have a chat with her find out what really going on ron doubted it was a good idea was would rather choke himself with one of the burnt marshmellows then say so to her ron watched in earnest as fred and george made harry drink his tenth glass of the most bloody expensive champagne ron had heard of while the other guests shouted chug chug chug ron wasntreally in the bachelor party mood he was upset over the harry and luna situation if they didntwork out how could ron ever hope he and hermione might and he was mad and it wasntbecause he was drunk cause he wasn t he wasntdrunk ron gulped down another glass of whisky and headed over to the catwalk night black had provided beautiful witch after beautiful witch strutted onto the stage and took off most of what they were wearing ron couldntfind it very appealing at the moment he wasntsure why he would ve loved this before it was hermione always hermione she was his conscience now and wouldntlet him enjoy the sexy witches before him ron was interrupted in his thoughts by one of the witch strippers sitting down on his lap he was so shocked by this that he was about to jump up but he fought the urge he was well known in the club scene to be a creature of the night and it could be very unlike him to suddenly act so stiff they tell me that you re a big roller here in this city the witch inquired tracing his lips with her fingers she didnthave a british accent so ron suspected her to be an import really and what what else did they say about me ron questioned trying to speak in his old sleek tones he was failing horribly the girls mentioned you ve slept with half the town the delicious half the witch continued and shifted in his lap he bit his tongue to stop the moan from coming out they flatter me ron replied trying to ease into the moment he couldn t why couldnthe you know what i dontusually do this but you re so yummy that i just going to have to say it i want you the witch finished her voice almost caressing him ron choked not as in unable to say something but literally choked an olive in his drink had gotten lodged in his throat he made rather revolting hacking noises the witch backed away in disgust that what she did when people started to choke after he managed to cough it back up he slumped over to get another drink however in an instance all thought of getting a drink left him as he saw two guards fighting with someone trying to enter the party it was a woman a blonde woman we re sorry miss but we cantlet you enter if your name isnton the list a guard protested holding her back easily harry the witch shrieked harry thinking it was luna ron roughly pushed a few people out of the way to rush to her aid you two gits let go of her right now god let her in let her in you can imagine his displeasure in realizing becky was the one to enter she looked the same as ever although at the moment rather frazzled by fighting with the two guards you ron murmured what are you doing here i aventcum to luk vat you becky retorted vhere iz arry you think i going to let you ruin his life there is no way i letting you see him ron exclaimed perhaps it was the wrong move to raise his voice because it captured everyone attention harry rose from the table most of the guests were looking at each other in wonderment what re you doing here harry implored quietly almost calmly arry i ve cum to tell you bevore you get marri ed vith tat othere gurl i love you becky said softly she reached out for harry hand but he pulled away and looked at her awestruck why didntyou tell me before harry questioned still shocked ron felt his anger rising why wasntharry asking her to leave i vas frightened becky responded in a choppy manner well i cantlove you back i love luna harry said in a weak attempt to explain becky looked almost surprised he had rejected her no one had probably had ever rejected that beautiful face donne moi one chance arry and you shall view my love becky begged no harry repeated solidly just no he stumbled away from her but she grabbed his arm and snatched him up in a last shot kiss ron gave a sharp intake of breath harry pulled away and ron noticed another blonde staring at him blankly she had just arrived with hermione and ginny by her side harry ginny gasped hermione didntspeak just looked to ron as if to say why didntyou stop this from happening harry luna breathed she looked so small amongst them all at the moment and ron was scared to say that her eyes looked dead they watered and tears welled out ron felt sick with harry and becky and even himself luna was crying after all she had endured she chose now to cry it marked how big of a deal this was to her very few things were big deals to her ron didntknow how to anybody could make it up to her how could she trust any of them again luna it not what you think harry started wiping his mouth with the back of his hand i can explain he of course never got to finish his sentence because ron punched him in the jaw he heard a crack and was pretty sure he had broken it harry fell to the floor clutching his jaw luna rushed not to his aid but out the door ginny immediately pursued her hermione on the other hand ran to help harry ron couldntbelieve it he had taken luna side instead of harry s he had chosen to help his fiance rather than him he had punched his best mate in the jaw and strangest of all he didntfeel the least bit sorry for it author note dun dun dun yes i know rather dramatic chapter and yes rather hermione less dontworry though because what comes next is even better harry luna arguementsron hermione arguementsron hermione moments hugs and kisses winkywink disclaimer erm cantthink of anything witty or cool so just read last chapters poem

anywhooo to the story ron bought some coffee from the three broomsticks to keep him awake and sober leaves story for two minutes to go to for a little stroll around the house to get stupid britney spears song out of head returns to horror discovers song is still in head desperately searches internet for it to sooth the insistent urge to listen to to horror listening urge only he gulped the bitter drink down in one string he blinked blankly at the sudden rush of sleep leaving him he knew it wasntthe healthiest thing to be roaming around the wizarding world at three in the morning but he was desperately trying to find luna ginny hermione anybody after the now infamous punch he d socked harry with he d rushed off to catch up with luna and ginny they however were long gone he d searched for them all throughout diagon alley and it was all to no prevail afterwards rather pouty and angry he d returned to night black only to find everyone had left there too now he had positively no clue where anyone was he d checked luna flat hogsmeade the burrow most of diagon alley and side alleys and yet there was no sign of them ron suspected the weasleys were likely to be at st mungo with harry since he needed to get his jaw healed he didntdare go there for obivous reasons ron dear you know i appreciate the business but i have to close down now madame rosemerta said tenderly i ve already been open way past hours yeah yeah i suppose i ll go now ron mumbled heading out the door he might as well throw in the shovel for tonight he was barely out the door before he apparated to his own flat it was i can barely see my hand in front me dark as a lonely flat should be but it certainly wasntquiet like a lonely flat ron could hear a distinct choking sound well not so much choking as sobbing he heard a hardly audible voice speaking in a soothing voice ron ears got quite red here he was searching half the country for those two and they were here in his flat all along he flicked on a light revealing them to be in his living room luna was on the floor resting her head on his couch ginny was beside her stroking her arm comfortingly they both looked horribly tired there were bags under their eyes or no wait perhaps it was just smudged eyeliner ron couldnttell ginny glanced at him but said nothing she gave him a weak smile at his appearance luna however did not acknowledge his appearance instead she bit her lip and stared solidly at the velvety fabric of the couch ron motioned ginny to shift a little so he could squeeze in close enough to luna for her to hear him somehow he felt if he spoke to her from a distance farther than a meter she wouldnthear him hi luna ron greeted in a voice so soft it surprised even him erm how re you holding up ginny gave him a disgusted look i mean um do y need anything a dragged out silence followed ron and ginny glanced back and forth in anticipation he expected her to say no or just not to reply at all but reply she did i she took in a deep shaky breath i suppose a nice cup of tea would do some good to the excruciating headache i having luna said in a stronger more louder voice than ron and ginny thought her capable of at a time like this i ll go make a cup ginny suggested getting up and heading off to the kitchen ron was left alone to make conversation with luna he stared at his nails and pretended to be cleaning them out what do you say to a person in this kind of situation should he make a joke or did she want to talk about serious things like harry and if so who would bring the topic up him or her did you hurt your hand luna asked straightening up a bit and looking at him wha oh no no actually i think i might ve hurt harry ron replied speaking his name aloud luna eyes widened slightly and then she started laughing i dontthink he deserved that but it nice to know he might if crying a bit right now if that not to harsh to say course not ron trumpeted smiling i just wish becky was a bloke then i would ve given her a piece of my mind or fist if becky was a man i d have even more relationship problems luna said thoughtfully yeah i guess so but but you are feeling better a bit arentyou ron inquired cocking his head slightly good as i can feel right now actually i d rather not speak of it or think of it what happens will happen luna rambled and maybe harry and i arentsoul mates her eyes watered soul mates dontbreak other soul mates hearts ron tried to remember back to that day he had been in the destiny chamber the soul mate area in particular he desperately tried to remember what color luna and harry vials had been hmm he remembered seeing their names on vials but of what color he wasntsure but you are soul mates ron blurted out losing control of his tongue he didnthave any clue if they were or not the vials never lie luna smiled slightly are you sure definitely ron answered he didntget it why was he defending harry luna fell into thought once more just as ginny came out of the kitchen with three streaming cups of tea they were all just comfortably sitting and sipping their tea when someone appeared in ron fireplace hermione she stepped out gracefully and brushed the soot off her robes you really ought to clean that fireplace once in a while ron ron shrugged bout time you got here i was at the hospital with your family and if any of you are curious harry is alright and will be out of the hospital tomorrow morning hermione clarified that nice but none of us care ron exclaimed he didntwant to hear of harry wellfare i care luna piped up hermione smiled smugly there you go ronald hermione smirked anyways luna how are you feeling ron was shocked at how she could go from smirking to looking concerned about her friend a lot better ron and ginny have been wonderful luna responded gently she almost looked concerned for hermione because she was so concerned for her ron shook his head in bewilderment that great but luna we must talk i have so much to tell you what we saw isntwhat we think we saw hermione explained harry fred george bill charlie even percy gave me their recount of what really happened luna face brightened considerably really ron felt the heat flood to his face oh really and what crackpot response did they give you hermione face blanched but she quickly recovered it is not a crackpot response ron it just as true as any recount you d have to give well then tell me why that bitch he cringed as rings of ron rang throughout the room at his foul language well she is it doesntmatter either way because why was becky acting as if she and harry had met before ron demanded well because they had of course hermione cried in frustration aha ron shouted check mate dontbe stupid ron you donthave anything to aha over harry explained everything very truthfully and if you want to be irrational as always we can drug him with veritaserum and see if that works hermione said her voice rising also what irrational is the last word anybody would use to describe me ron exclaimed why do you always poke and prod insults at me i don t hermione mustered excuse me ginny cut through i thought this was about harry and luna not you two ron and hermione turned up their noses and turned away arms crossed hermione ginny started please tell us your explaination only if ron promises not to interrupt hermione replied ron ginny implored turning towards him agreed i ll hear this without saying a thing just so i can hear the whole story and have a good laugh at how well everybody can lie ron retorted ron ginny said in a warning tone ok fine i ll be good ron muttered ginny smiled and turned to hermione to begin the explaination well i ve been told that when becky left our bachelorette party she went straight to night black she fought off guards and ron let her in i thought she was luna ron said in his defence ron no talking ginny scolded ron silenced himself and hermione continued anyways she argued with ron until catching the attention of not only harry but everyone else harry admitted that instead of asking her to leave he asked her what she was doing at the party becky responded by saying she wanted to tell him she loved him then harry said why didntyou tell me before which i sure sounded suspicous to most especially ron i mean when i first heard i thought before where harry continued to explain she had been friends with him quite some time now this was easy for her since she knew where he lived through weasley connections and she had a temporary position at the ministry where harry himself works he says that he didntsuspect her of loving him and he hung out with her a lot at the ministry since she was new and had few other friends but slowly he drew away from her which is when she started contacting him outside of work he suspected she might have romantic feelings for him but love was still out of the question he says he never loved her and when she told him she loved him he rejected her didnthe ron yes ron responded ruefully he had rejected her and ron found himself suddenly feeling a twinge of guilt for punching harry and for accusing him of infidelity all this time after he rejected her what was it twice i believe she kissed him he pulled away and that when we walked in hermione finished she looked expectantly at luna it makes sense luna murmured yeah it does ginny ended giggling thank god we avoided a major problem take me take me to st mungo s luna said standing up i want to see him but luna it after hours hermione tried to explain your point luna questioned before stepping into the fireplace and flooing off ginny pursued her ron hesitated coming ron hermione asked him gently i dontthink so ron smiled sourly harry probably hates me right now hermione laughed no actually he thinks you hate him right now i did until about a second ago when i realized i was the hugest git in the world for doubting his integrity ron sighed rubbing his eyes well i think harry would be pleased to see you and know that you dontthink he a git hermione said kindly ron grinned yeah i just wish i hadntpunched him but why is it that i always have to act before i think i think it annoying at times but at others it rather endearing hermione commented quaintly you do ron asked dumbfounded why yes hermione nodded and smiled wow perhaps i should start punching all my best mates then i ll get to hear you call me endearing some more ron joked teasingly hermione grinned in turn i think you possess many endearing traits same to you ron responded surprised thanks hermione finished the two smiled at each other for a bit before falling silent well i suppose we should get to the hospital hermione suggested earnestly right ron said and then bowed and offered her his hand if you please miss granger oh really hermione said waving a hand and she blushed lightly the pleasure all mine ron and hermione passed through the sea of weasleys and managed to stare through the glass window which looked into harry hospital room mrs weasley had given ron the biggest scolding of his life for laying a hand on harry and that if he ever used violence on another family member or friend again she would scallop him with her large red hand bag she was also upset that he arrived so late to see harry what do you think they re talking about charlie questioned gesturing across the glass to harry and luna harry was sitting up in his bed and luna was sitting on the edge they seemed to be talking about something agreeable because they were both smiling and luna was even patting his hand comfortingly how much they love each other ginny offered dreamily are you talking about them or a girly fantasy of yours fred implored with a slopy grin shut up ginny snapped ginerva weasley you will not sniper rudely mrs weasley tutted hermione is that a muggle book in your bag mr weasley inquired suddenly with interest he had only just noticed it yes mr weasley would you care to borrow it hermione answered with a questioned do you even have to ask george muttered grabbing the book from hermione and thrusting it into his father arms ouch george you poked my eye percy exclaimed oh sorry percykins george replied reaching his hand out to help but poking his eye again in the process that was on purpose percy cried holding his hand over his eye protectively however did you guess george asked innocently enough mrs weasley said silencing them all luna looked out of the window of the hospital room and noticed ron she gestured for him to come in with such enthusiasm that ron couldntignore it he sullenly headed in with his head hung he would have to face harry eventually harry looked at him while he entered almost intently luna skipped over towards him and pulled him by the wrist over harry bed she ushered him to sit down beside him and then she left the room ron stared after her mouth slightly open three guesses what she wants us to do harry joked he looked like it hurt him to talk since there was a bandage wrapped around his chin let me see make up and become best mates again ron replied harry smiled well as much as he could smile it was more like twitching the corners of his mouth up a bit so how are you ron asked seriously not bad the healers said i ll be perfect tomorrow morning just a bit smashed up that a good punch you ve got there harry teased yeah i just used it on the wrong person ron sighed listen mate i going to get down to it i sorry well if we re apologizing then i sorry for not telling you about what was going on i just thought you d jump to conclusions and think i was cheating on luna but as it turned out you jumped to that conclusion without me saying a thing harry said bitterly i never should ve doubted you ron apologized it doesntmatter best mates harry implored as usual ron responded so what did luna say harry voice got a bit hazy and dull she says she forgives me she still loves me she still going to marry me why the glum tones ron asked everything right once again i just feel guilty like i ought to make it up to her harry explained but i dontknow how ron fell into thought something romantic ought to do something sweet and extra special yet not extravagant special luna wouldntlike that no it needed to be something sweet and simple and just how about you right her a song ron suggested a song harry questioned with arched eyebrows yeah a love song ron continued and then you could sing it to her and tell her how much you love her and all that load of dung you know i dontsing harry replied that doesntmean you can t i ve heard you a fair few times and you re tolerable pretty nice actually for the average wizard ron said thoughtfully better than you at least harry said hey i trying to help you and all you can do is insult me ron joked ok ok but i dontwant to sing luna knows i hate singing harry responded that the best part ron went on she knows you hate it but you still did it out of love for her isntthat the impression you want to give yeah yeah ok i ll go along with it but how am i supposed to write a song harry said incredulously ron got pensieve he reached into his pocket to retrieve a quill and parchment he looked out a ragged one that had already been written on it was the i only want to be with you song he looked from the parchment to harry desperate face use this ron said handing it over to him it s erm a song that i he couldntvery well say where he got it from and cover up for dumbledore wrote it yeah i wrote it in my free time harry looked doubtful you write song lyrics duh ron replied read it it some good stuff harry eyes darted across the page after reading it he looked up at ron as if seeing him in a whole new light this is bloody fabulous mate and you re sure you wrote it harry inquired are you doubting me ron questioned trying to appear offended no it just that i heard something like this before once when i lived with the dursleys kind of like a muggle song harry explained damn muggles always stealing our pieces of art ron grumbled perhaps it wasntthe same song so you sure i can use your stuff to serenade luna harry asked yeah yeah i ve got plently more where that came from ron lied flatly luna harry said gently grabbing hold of her hand to stop her i have something to give you ron smiled here it came they had all just arrived in the burrow and were yet to leave the front foyer i wrote a song and i wanted to know if you wanted to hear it harry asked nervously luna eyes bulged and she nodded smiling hermione looked to ron questioningly i dontknow what it is that makes me love you so i only know i never want to let you go cause you started something oh cantyou see ever since we met you ve had a hold on me its crazy but its true i only want to be with you harry started softly and slowly grew louder hermione raised her eyebrows and looked at ron in amusement she mouthed the words wrote it himself eh ron mouthed back shut up its crazy but its true i only want to be with you harry sang wrapping up the song he looked utterly embarassed but when luna leaped into him hugging him and crying happily slightly he couldnthelp but be happy himself from behind luna back he gave ron the thumbs up he pulled away from her just in time to say and i declined going to france i want to stay here with you so that we can plan the final details of our wedding together that how love should be hermione sighed shifting beside ron he agreed that was nice of you you know getting harry and luna through the final steps of their problem with a stolen song hermione commented i proud of you thanks herms ron responded she looked at him darkly but then smiled softly i going to let that go this time since you ve done a good deed i wish you would practice doing good deeds more yeah well good deeds suck sometimes you never get any rewards ron replied grinning hermione faced him then leaned in and gave him a kiss on the cheek ron ears burned up i hope that encourages you to do more good deeds hermione whispered before trailing off just as luna came and joined him nice kiss she said simply er thanks ron muttered placing a hand to the holy cheek that had been kissed three times by hermione now i also wanted to thank you for bringing me and harry together again luna went on if it hadntbeen for you mentioning we were soul mates i wouldnthave been as cooperative to work things out your welcome ron murmured suddenly very thoughtful he hadnteven been sure when he d said that it made him feel guilty that perhaps he had brought together two of the wrong people what if the becky incident was to split to wrong people apart so that they could meet their actual soul mates as he thought of this he barely noticed luna giving him another kiss on the cheek before skipping off ron closed the door of the ancient astrology room with the creepy centaur and entered the soul mate area the vials were all stacked neatly and ron stepped towards them gingerly it was a typical day at work except for the fact that today at lunch instead of eating with harry he d decided to spend his free time in the soul mate area discovering if harry and luna were soul mates or if he had led them on in false pretences it was the first time he d been in the soul mate area since he d had to reorganize the various viles hmm harry potter luna lovegood where are you ron pondered as he trailed through the various vials suddenly he caught site of a silver vile with the most perculiar name on it ron weasley he was a silver now but silver meant soul other half had arrived and they two were intermingled who was he intermingled with how had he gone from no soul mate gray to you re almost there silver he noticed another vile three stacks down from it hermione vial was a silverish gray which meant she was stuck between two of the stages beside hers was seamus which was still just as gray as ever could this be a sign he was rather interested to know in his state of thought and stupor and he knocked over two golden viles oh bloody hell ron groaned and kneeled down to pick them up it was lucky they hadntbroken or anything then he d be in real trouble however his grimace quickly faded when he noticed the two names on the vials harry potter and luna lovegood author note an interesting and pretty long chapter thank god we got all the problems patched up for now but more problems are to come the last scene gave a hint of possible goods and bads to come upon ron and hermione and on hermione list hard choices anywhooo i think this might be my last update till christmas

note still loving the bumps thanks for them there is no way i escorting you to the hogwarts reunion ron prompted and you can stop asking ginny but ro on i need to show that pouty michael corner what he missed out on ginny pleaded and you cantgo stag ron rolled his eyes it was a very uncharacteristic trait for him he did not often get to shake his head or roll his eyes at other people immaturity but ginny was over the top just because ron didnthave anyone to take to the hogwarts reunion didntmean he d take his baby sister that was worse than going stag yet even up to this evening the night of the actual reunion ginny wouldntbuzz off she had dated so many guys in his year and broke up with so many of them that she wanted to show them all up by treating them to a taste of the so called woman she was now she d gone so far as to show up at hermione flat where harry luna ron seamus and hermione had decided to leave from all dressed up in jade green dress robes her hair was softly curled and ron thought that she had dyed her usual angry red hair to a more lighter strawberry blonde shade ron frowned no one changed the weasley hair oh ron just let her go hermione scoffed she already dressed nuh uh she can get someone else to take her ron protested hermione was still roaming around the room checking her make up and patting her sleek newly straightened hair ron didntunderstand why she was trying so hard to look beautiful she d amaze them without all the glamour although it did add to her glory ron and seamus sat stiffly on the couchs claid in neat dress robes seamus were dankly gray ron were black and pale violet it sort of matched with hermione lavender robes ron thought wistfully to himself seamus didntmatch hermione who cares ron pondered quietly it not like matching clothes means love ok boys erm men which necklace the silver one or the pearls hermione questioned she didntget quite the responses she had been expecting uhh seamus began then smiled i like both when are harry and luna getting here ron asked absentmindedly totally avoiding the question the silver one then hermione finished just as ginny opened her mouth to beg her brother to let her be his guest harry and luna apparated into the room harry wore navy blue robes and luna wore silky almost asian style red robes luna hair looked tamer than usual but harry untidy hair was well untidy silver i always liked the pearls luna commented noticing hermione choice of necklace i know me too i ll change it was their here she gestured towards ron and seamus idea for silver hermione explained opting for a change ron chose not to comment nice robes luna ginny said getting up the joinging the two luna smiled slightly dreamily you too of course and you hermione the three broke out into waves of good gestures my god it like they re having a contest to see who can give the other the most compliments ron muttered making seamus laugh ok ok we all look great can we go harry suggested rather hesitantly the three witches nodded let do it seamus said happy to get going here the port key that they sent us along with our invites everybody hold on ginny and where do you think you re exactly going ron interrogated oh ron come on ginny begged um let me see no ron retorted but row ginny cried out and tried a last minute trick it was a dirty trick it was she d called him row you may ask what the hell is row well to ron it was the most adorable sound ever coming from ginny when she d been little she d had difficultly pronouncing her n s and ron was out of the question so the closest she d got to saying ron was by saying row and no one could say row cuter than ginny her baby voice had been lightly airy bubbly and cuddly woodly mushy wushy baby waby well you get the point the nickname row made ron heart melt even today although he d rather kiss a slytherin than admitt it ginny ron started tersely oh oh fine you can come but if anybody asks you re not my date course ginny grinned she knew row would never fail her the hogwarts reunion was to be held outside on the school grounds the sloping lawn by the lakeside had been enchanted so that whilst the surrounding scenery portrayed cold february weather the actual area felt like summer in july the trees had magically regrown their leaves and were decorated with lights which on closer inspection were actually small moth sized fairies the dance floor was filled with ex students and the food table had to keep refilling itself because crabbe and goyle kept eating all it goods some of the food they even stuffed into their dress robes for later consumption draco malfoy was with them and was the same old snoot he didnthave his family fortune anymore because he d been robbed of that when his father was arrested as a death eater but that didntmean he wasntrich he sold and traded many goods and was just as wealthy as ever currently his eyes were roaming the dance floor for a dance partner prey ron was sitting at the table with hermione and seamus boredom taking over harry and luna had left long ago to dance but had not yet returned ron had noticed them sneaking off to hogwarts castle for god knows what reason ginny was chatting up every ex boyfriend in sight ron had to admitt she d inherited his merit of being a flirt although slowly the skill was dwindling away from him and all on the account of hermione she was slipping her wine and keeping quiet she spoke neither to seamus nor ron and the only conversation that the three of them shared was mumbles from ron and seamus ron just didntknow how to keep up comfortable conversation with seamus any longer and it was even harder in front of hermione seamus hermione said suddenly would you care to dance dancing not our thing mione you know that seamus replied softly placing his hand on hermione s her complexion however darkened considerably seamus didntseem to notice and mumbled something to the two of them about getting a drink before striding off to the food table i love dancing hermione said in a barely audible voice ron had a feeling she was speaking to seamus but he knew seamus couldnthear from that distance she said it almost defensively ron didntknow why she just hadnttold seamus earlier if you love dancing so much then i ll dance with you ron offered it came out before ron had a chance to take it back but then after thinking about it he decided it was a pretty nifty idea hermione smiled why thank you ron i d love to they both stood and ron offered her his arm she took it gingerly and he led them both to the dance floor soft tinkling music was playing in the background and ron noticed instruments up on a stage they played on their own ron placed his hands carefully on hermione hips and could feel tension there actually he could feel tension all over her body she was compact and concentrated so tensely that it surprised him he rubbed her slightly and felt her ease up a bit you re tense ron said as she wrapped her arms about his shoulders they started to sway gently to the music no no wait you re right i am tense hermione sighed shaking why so ron inquired beginning to worry well it complicated hermione said in a choppy manner what is ron questioned leading their dance oh ron it not something i exactly to talk to a guy about especially not anyone like you or harry hermione tried to explain what do you mean by not anyone like my and harry ron said in mock offense i mean you guys are such guys i need more of a woman opinion hermion clarified excuse me sister but i can be very feminine ron said in his own girlish defence hermione laughed nice try but no come on try me ron responded i dontknow hermione murmured of course you dontand you wontuntil you tell me ron replied with a shake of his head hermione laughed again he loved making her laugh alright alright i see your point who knows you could be my best advice giver yet ron nodded to all this and waited for hermione to take on a more which she did soon well my problem is with seamus you see dontget me wrong he a wonderful guy but when i with him i not myself huh say that again ron requested confused ron see i knew you wouldntundserstand hermione cried in anguish ok ok calm down herms she flinched i ll listen now what exactly do you mean by you re not yourself when you re with him ron asked trying his best to keep a straight face hermione gave him a long doubting look before continuing i act different more more like him and at one time i thought that was who i really was but recently while spending time with you harry luna and the rest of the weasleys and going back to my roots i realized it not at all who i am i been living the life of another person of course i starting to fix that but then i realize something would the real me date seamus finnigan uh huh you know i once told you my opinion on that ron said silently hermione blinked hardly believing he d bring up that incident at the end of seventh year i remember it perfectly and at the time i was stubborn but now i almost see what you mean hermione said stiffly i like him and he likes me but i dontthink the love is there and if we re going to get married the love needs to be there what do you mean getting married ron demanded in panicky tones the proposal hadnthappened yet or had it well i know he going to propose sooner or later you told me yourself hermione explained what ron yelped when did i do that that time at your flat you said the two of us as in harry and i are getting married or not wait you said the t o o of us eh hermione teased hey that was a sudden slip up and i couldntthink of a cover donttell seamus i let that loose ron said i won t anyways i glad you let it slip it gave me time to think and anyways i dontthink he loves me isnta big mistake proposing to someone you dontlove hermione ranted and if my own boyfriend of three years doesntlove me then no one must love me she ended this sullenly and almost bitterly that not true ron piped up he wanted to make her feel better he didntwant her to be hurt and think no one loved her i love you the music screeched to a stop the dancers all stopped moving the earth exploded well actually no none of this happened but hermione blanched and looked up at ron the three words he d thought make her feel better only seemed to have hurt her more she pulled away from him and stared at him like he was the basilisk well no i actually meant i i what did he actually mean aw look who it is the weasel with his guuurrlfriend malfoy cooed as usual crabbe and goyle were standing behind him menacingly shut your face malfoy ron retorted automatically telling malfoy to close his trap just came naturally to him oooh looks like weasley developped a temper over the years malfoy crooned how about crabbe and goyle teach you a little lesson about managing your anger crabbe and goyle grinned idiotically and stepped forward of course they wouldntbe crabbe and goyle if they didntaccidentally bonk heads in the proccess of stepping two feet forward hermione moved back still starting dully at ron she looked as if a slight numbing sensation was overtaking her perhaps it was the same one overtaking him right now she bumped into malfoy in her daze move out of my way mudblood malfoy snarled gladly hermione replied her eyes welling up as she ran off ron wanted to follow her but instead he ran off in the opposite direction where are you going you coward malfoy shouted after him ron for once in his life ignored his pride and let his grief and love take control he ran past the forbidden forest ran past the entrance hall ran past the great hall ran down the stairs and in search for empty classrooms he had a feeling the potions classroom would be empty what student would want to go there at night snape would be in his office by now it ironic how he was seeking refuge in a room he once despised entering he opened the door and fortunately it was open he didntbother turning on the lights but just sank into the nearest desk and cried he felt ashamed to do it he wasnta crying person not to say he didntcry but he didntcry like this not sobbing hysterically like a woman he d told hermione he d loved her and the idea was so repulsive to her she cried for goodness sake was he that horrible a person that she d cry he knew he d wrecked their friendship he d lost one of this best friends he just knew it and that was worse than anything possibly imaginable more so since his particular best friend was also the love of his life god he hoped no one heard him yet someone did happen to over hear the glum spill of tears that someone was in the room ron hadntnoticed anyone in the dark but not that particular wizard and flicked the lights on it was snape ron sat up straight in his desk and wiped his tears away in a fury of speed this was a most humiliating situation but the embarassement reached both sides snape sat at his desk just as gangly as ever he was the same bastard ron remembered from school except that his hair was graying slightly in this hands he held what he had obviously been reading in dark in the moonlight witch weekly both wizards stood up and met halfway both were flushing soft pink and ron ears were hot red were were you crying weasley snape questioned surprised were you reading witch weekly sir ron asked incredulously silence in all the silences in their lives this was the most awkward of them all for the two men we shall never speak of this moment again weasley is that clear snape said finally crystal ron replied they both sounded edgy nervous well i snape blushed i would like to continue my night time reading if you dontmind weasley snape said right ron said then understood what snape meant riiigghhtt ok bye professor snape twitched his mouth into what he might consider a smile it still looked like a smirk to ron ron left and was barely outside of the room when he began shaking with tears again author note i know

reviewing love you guys and here the story numb that what ron weasley felt numb he d gone home that night and cried himself to sleep when he d woke up in the morning he d cried some more and when he d got ready to go to work well what do you think he did he d cried so he d called in sick today and slumped on his couch and read quidditch through the ages whilst not truly concentrating how could he after what had happened last night i love you and she d cried what kind of person cries when someone tells them they love them and what kind of person makes a person cry just by telling them they love them ron shook his head in frustration he was confusing himself he summoned a sandwich from the kitchen and ate his three hour late lunch as he bit into it some mustard squirted out and stained his shirt he groaned angrily normally a simple stain on his shirt was not a thing to annoy him but could his day get any worse his life was a bit like his sandwich messy layer upon layer of condiments but when you peeled all those off one by one all that was left was a soggy piece of bread it struck him he was the soggy piece of bread argh ron moaned he threw his sandwich away from him and crossed his arms it was not a smart thing to do on several levels the sandwich hit the floor and sent lettuce and tomatoes and ham flying everywhere ron even got mayonnaise on his arm he pouted and pretended nothing happened he didnt want to make a mistake so he hadn t if he didntadmitt to it than it hadntreally happened had it that an ugly vase ron muttered staring at a crystal vase with mermaids and hippogriffs carved into it he d saw it about a year ago at an old antiques shop in diagon alley and had fallen in love with it immediately but now suddenly it seemed rather ugly hideous even why had he ever bought it why had he ever loved it piece of shit ron screamed surprising himself he picked it up and threw it to the ground with as much raw force has he could muster he thought breaking the vase he d once loved would satisfy him but it didn t it only made him feel worse god what is wrong with me he sighed before throwing himself on the couch once again his living room was a mess food and shards of glass littered the floor ron a quiet voice piped up ron looked up and saw harry letting himself in and shutting the door had he witnessed his little temper tantrum ron mate this place is a mess harry said with a low whistle he stepped over the glass carefully and sat down beside ron on the couch yeah well what re you doing here ron questioned bitterly he didntfeel in the mood to talk right now well you werentat work today and you felt the reunion in a rush last night i just wanted to know if you were alright guess not though seeing as to how i just saw you hurl a helpless vase to the ground harry said staring at ron with his head cocked to one side ron could only sigh and cover his face with his hands he could feel those oh so annoying tears fighting their way to the surface again he could ve yelled at harry right now but what was the point instead he opened up it hermione ron replied in a croaky voice hermione harry said eyebrows arched yes i told her i loved her last night ron explained sullenly he could see harry getting uncomfortable oh i guessing it didntgo well harry asked gently no it went horribly ron said leaning back on the couch so she said she didntlove you harry murmured skeptically she didntdo that but it was just as bad she cried ron responded she bloody cried listen mate maybe she did cry but perhaps it was for reasons beyond what you and me can understand right now harry said trying to soothe him oh really like what ron muttered like perhaps it didntmean she didntlove you but maybe it cause she so overwhelmed i mean she does have a boyfriend already harry started and when he noticed he d caught ron attention he hurriedly continued and he been her boyfriend for three years he someone she knows through and through but here you come and offer something new and exciting and beautiful that she probably never exprienced before and it scared her she probably didntknow anyone could feel that way didntknow she could feel that way you know ron stared at harry in shock where the bloody hell did you get so good at saying that kind of stuff from harry grinned i ve had a girlfriend for four years i getting married i d know ron perked up slightly you think that really what she going through probably harry replied sensibly he didntwant to get ron hopes up thanks harry but i suppose this still means she d have to choose wouldntshe ron began silently harry nodded shiftily they both sat in silence lost in their thoughts for a while however they were interrupted when luna head appeared in the fireplace even though her head was in fireplace ron could tell her face was tense worried her hair was a mess as if she d rushed to brush it and she wasnteven wearing her butterbeer cork necklace harry seemed to notice all these signs of trouble too because he said luna what wrong it daphne she in labor luna said in rushed tones but they re having problems they re even saying luna choked up slightly that perhaps the baby or she might not make it ron paled daphne wasnthis favourite person but he didntwant her to die and he sure as hell didntwant to lose his first nephew or niece we ll be there in 2 seconds harry said ron was surprised he hadntlost his voice as he had luna nodded and disappeared come on ron let go harry said quickly standing up and ready to apparate ron got his voice back i cantwear this he gestured downwards towards his dirty shirt and trousers harry groaned in exasperation what are you waiting for go get changed harry scolded ron flinched and ran off of course he couldntdo it without slipping on a tomato in the process erm sorry tomato ron mumbled harry shook his head ron bounded back to his bedroom yelling harry was frightening ron hadntbeen so afraid of him shouting so much before but ever since fifth year he d learned the hard way that getting harry angry enough to raise his voice was not a good thing he threw on a pair of dark robes and sprinted back out in record time bout time harry said loudly and quickly apparated ron followed suit a nurse led them to ward for expectants it unlike the rest of the hospital had moving illustrations of hearts and daisies and ducklings on the walls ron grimaced that was enough to terrify the baby back into it mother womb when they finally reached a room in a corner ron could see enough redheads to dicifer it was his family they both sat there in anxiety and mrs weasley was crying hysterically mr weasley was trying to comfort her but was failing to do so luna jumped up when he and harry and arrived i so glad you re here luna cried and ron noticed her eyes were red so she d been crying harry and luna quickly got caught up with each other ron noticed fleur and penelope were also present and were looking horrified they were probably thinking of how this could just as easily be them ron ginny shouted ron he rushed over to her and wrapped her in a hug he stroked her hair affectionately and pulled back ginny what happened ron asked the baby was expected on the fourteenth but came today four days early it premature ginny sobbed but four days is enough that they can handle isntit why should there be a risk of life or death ron questioned in worry oh ron she a vampire their pregnancy is over with quickly but if their baby is even a day premature the results are usually death ginny explained still teary eyed the only thing that keeping her and the baby alive is that fact that it half human or else daphne should ve been dead by now ron rubbed his eyes what have the healers said ginny lower lip trembled always a bad sign they say it doesntlook good the half human trait can only suffice one of them so neither can live while the other survives author note jkr and prophecy moment or better yet stolen quote moment ron mind felt dizzy where george he with the healers at the moment ginny replied oh ron i need to sit she looked woozy ron made sure she was alright before checking in on the rest of the family soon george stepped out of the room where daphne was looking so un george esque that just the sight of him made ron want to cry he looked so old his face was ghostly white and there were hauntingly dark bags under his eyes his usually neat hair was resembling ron and he was wearing his robe inside out he almost resembled during the second war always tired upset but forcing himself to be happy for the sake of his family he put on fake smile on his face when he noticed ron and harry had arrived hey guys how it going ron gave him a hug instead of a response george seemed momentarily surprised but his brother spurt of love but accepted it for the moment normally he would ve yelled rape how is she ron inquired seriously meh i d let you see for yourself but no one allowed in except me right now george said in a flat voice george i so sorry but i sure it ll all be fine we re all here and we love ron started but was cut off speaking of love look who here george said in an almost teasing voice ron spun around and was shocked to see hermione and seamus walk in led by the same nurse that had escorted ron and harry here they both looked casual ron imagined that if he d ever see hermione and seamus again the former would cry and the latter would punch him however seamus greeted him just as he usually would ron noticed harry watching to see how hermione would react to him being there but she didntreact at all in fact it seemed she was pretending he wasnteven there he didntcare just treated her the same hermione started conversation with george and they both started to walk along a corridor while ron drifted away and sat in a corner seamus stood centerwise and greeted everyone once they had all turned their attention upon them he said i just wanted to know if you all were still coming to the proposal ceremony i have for hermione tomorrow and if not i d like to cancel it ron raised his head in sheer delight cancel it cancel it cancel it no of course not seamus mrs weasley piped up after all you ve done to make that night perfect if things dontgo smoothly with the pregnancy then we all cantgo but i ll send the kids they all opened their mouths to protest they didntwant to abandon george and daphne no you ll go either way you re not helping them and george would be devasted if he wrecked your fun and most of all hermione needs you all there no more protests broke out to ron great displeasure seamus grinned splendid then it on he sat contentedly beside ron who shifted uncomfortably hey ron seamus said how re you holding up ron gave him a wistful smile not to well seamus frowned that the same look and reply hermione gave me this morning and none of her family members are in mortal danger oh ron said trying to sound offhand why what wrong nothing or at least it shouldntbe nothing very exciting has happened lately seamus said simply ron blanched why hadnthermione told seamus what happened last night seamus did hermione er act weird last night ron asked seemingly cool nope just her usual self seamus responded in a casual tone hadnthe seen her cry ron wanted to explore further but hermione and george had just come around the bend and were sitting themselves nearby conversation drifted between the four as it usually would although neither ron nor hermione directed anything to the other she was sitting stiffly and was awfully uptight and cold couldntgeorge and seamus feel it i wish i had some exploding snaps to keep me busy george sighed i have exploding snaps at home seamus said and his eyes lit up hermione ron why dontyou two go get them for george erm ron tried to smile no hermione said feigning politeness why not go on seamus said ushering them both to stand up ron could see hermione whispering harshly in seamus ear she obviously didntwant to be anywhere alone with him hermione can you actually deprive george of a little bit of sunshine seamus prodded fine i ll go hermione gave up but must ron come with me yeah must i ron implored weakly yes ron you must seamus said and added in a mumble keep her busy for a bit i ve got something planned i want to say without her overhearing why me ron whispered back seamus laughed you say the darnest things now get going you too ron and hermione had no choice but to actually leave together and go an empty flat all alone if seamus had known what ron had said to her last night he wouldnthave been quite so cheery about it it was like letting a pick pocket look at your wallet luckily for seamus this pick pocket was a decent one they apparated in seamus and hermione flat and even before ron had regained his balance hermione had started for her bedroom without a word ron resisted the urge to roll his eyes and followed her their flat was nicely lit with sunlight and ron noticed that the flat in general had three bedrooms but only one contained hermione and seamus clothes so they slept in the same bed it was to be expected they had dated for three years yet just the thought of seamus holding hermione in his arms at night was enough to make ron grow green with jealousy hermione reached out for a dresser door and pulled out a few sets of exploding snaps and tossed them to ron here give these to george ron took them gingerly and just as he was about to head out the door he remembered what seamus had said about him keeping hermione busy for a bit how was he going to do that so far he d only taken up about a minute hermione ron began unsure in which direction this conversation was going erm are you alright hermione looked up at him there was a bed between them but ron could feel all the emotion no i not alright hermione replied coldly hermione i sorry i a thousand times sorry ron cried why cantwe forget about it it a teensy bit hard to forget that one of your best mates is in love with you ronald hermione shouted angrily well what do you want me to do lie and say i dontlove you ron yelled in pure confusion no no i dontwant you to say that hermione responded suddenly very quietly well what do you want ron implored also in gentle tones it too late for what i want i wanted you to tell before why didntyou tell me you loved me before i started dating seamus hermione asked and her face looked like it was wishing it had happened i was scared that you wouldntlove me back ron murmured hermione eyes widened i ve loved you since third year but you re a coward ron weasley a big fat coward how you ever got into gryffindor is beyond me ron opened his mouth a few times and closed it again but you cantlove me after we graduated from hogwarts i sent you a letter you burned it you burned them all ron that was because it hurt to talk to you waking up each day and knowing that you didntlove me was like having my heartbroken all the time so i thought it would be best if we went our separate ways i didntcontact harry either i didntwant to be reminded of you at all hermione said her voice getting high and soft but what does this mean you love me too ron inquired hardly daring to believe it yes i love you too you prat hermione shouted and tears swelled up in her eyes ron bounced across the bed and wrapped her in a hug she let him and buried her face in his chest they pulled apart but ron leaned in he so wanted to kiss her so wanted to feel the warmth of her love for him he loved her too yet hermione covered his mouth with her hand when it was an inch from her own and shook her head ron i love you and you dontknow how amazing it feels to know you love me too but i just cantdo this i canthurt seamus ron took her hand off his mouth and held it lightly so what are you saying i saying i know he going to ask me to marry him tomorrow and i ve promised myself to say yes hermione said her voice cracking and becoming shaky ron dropped her hand why it too late for us ron i cantbreak up with him the night before he asks me to marry him and certainly not afterwards i sorry hermione said reaching up to stroke his cheek but he turned away right well you do what you want let go back to s they ll be waiting for us ron said solidly his tone was void of emotion hermione agreed and they were off ron get in here and meet your new nephew george yelled happily once they d apparated into s he snatched him and hermione up in a gigantic bear hug are they both alive ron asked incredulously yeah they say it a medical miracle george said still spinning hermione around he set her on the ground and practically pushed them into the hospital room daphne sat on a crisp white bed her black hair matted to her forehead with the whole gang surrounding her ron noticed a small lump of blanket in her arms and felt his stomach squirm his first nephew there someone here to see you weasley daphne smirked but ron noticed how happy she really was he squeezed through the sea of red and gasped in joy a small redhaired pale saphire eyed and widely freckled baby lay asleep in daphne arms he s perfect ron whispered awestruck he william daphne said he got a lot of middle names too bill charlie percy fred and ron then again you just had to have lots of brothers ron grinned and george said you want to hold him both ron and daphne panicked oh come on ron responsible enough george said easily and took the baby out of daphne arms and lifted it into ron s just dontdrop my baby boy on his head or i ll literally suck you dry daphne warned ron however wasntpaying attention hey little willy i your uncle ron i better than the rest of them because i can already tell i love you william yawned and opened his eyes they were like ron

nymphomaniac well i thought about it and i decided i dontthink bill full name is william i think it billiard cause everyone thought ginny was virginia but then she turned out to be ginerva so since

seekerpeeker firstly thanks for the advice i like to get wake up calls for all the usually pleasant reviews so thanks i sure i do have grammar mistakes and i ll try harder to prevent them for the william bill thing i ll tell you what i said to nymphomaniac well i thought about it and i decided i dontthink bill full name is william i think it billiard cause everyone thought ginny was virginia but then she turned out to be ginerva so since william has a middle name of bill it more like it billiard jkr gives unique names so i think the origin of bill is one i glad you are enjoying the characters and think i have actual feeling in my writing i not sure if pansy can really fit into the last chapters of the story but anyways thanks for your review balewilyiel hah yeah he cute thanks for the birthday wishes and your review tristic hah that was cute thankss i glad the chapters were appealing to youu yes i think it a mixture of both babies are cuties thanks so much for reviewing jnx thanks yeah baby have a certain glow yeah the last part was pretty adorable anywhoo thanks so much for the review legofiance wow thanks for the enthuasiasm not to mention the review seamus death is sadly not going to happen in real life but all the other things are yet stable you never know what i ll write lol noww i just wanna say yay cause last night canada that right the place i live in just won the world juniors last night in north dakota woo like the guy from tsn said canada on top of the hockey world hehe but all the other teams played tough games so congrats to them anywhoo enough of the babble to the story harry why is this thing so tight ginny asked gasping slightly she was wearing what looked to be a grey tube that was choking her along with that she was wearing a muggle skirt all ashy and fluttery oh god ginny that a corset you have to be careful how tight you make those harry explained in frustration and and cover up a bit will you ron scowled throwing a knitter cardigan at her she frowned and stuck her tongue out at him ron chose not to react he was in a horribly grumpy mood they were all at the burrow getting ready to go to the park for the big engagement since it was a muggle park somewhere halfway across the world in a tropical country they were all decked in muggle attire ginny and luna had even gone out and bought new clothes from an actual muggle shoppe for the occasion ron was wearing his usual penguin like muggle suit harry was the same ron heard a tearing sound from bedroom and a horrified screech that sounded like ginny he could hear followed murmuring and penelope saying it ok ginny reparo ron watched harry smooth out his tie or at leas that what he called it fred and george had taken their ties and were going around whipping each other with them fred fell into the armchair percy was reading in and caused percy to call out dad will you look at what he doing fred come on now muggle wear the tie around their necks it not meant to be a weapon said with a sigh pity it would ve made such a fine weapon george said teasingly just at the moment daphne walked in with new baby william still in her hands it caused a mass transformation within the room instead of continuing on in their usual irresponsible manner everyone stood and walked towards the baby murmuring hey willy how the baby wabey oi stop pinching his cheek george said trying to look at his own son over the heads of everybody else the baby was still new and innocent and no one had grown tired of him they loved the little one to death and took every chance to play with him and just oogle over him ron reached out to hold his hand but george slapped it away what do you think you re doing eh he questioned suspicously george had growned increasingly annoying in just his two days of having a son every move made near the baby was a plan of attack to him apparently and he was overly protective then again ron supposed he might ve been that way too if he had had a child slowly the group dispersed and continued to prepare for the engagement party harry went over to a mirror and continually smoothed out his tie ron stared at his it was limply hanging around his neck not yet tie d hey harry how do you get these things on ron inquired walking over to him and holding out an end of the time harry smiled took his own tie off and tied it while explaining the various steps ron watched carefully and attempted to follow the steps himself he moved to the front of the mirror as harry fell to one side and smoothed out his own tie he noticed harry watching him with his head cocked to one side slightly ron breathed in deeply and waited for harry to ask him something he obviously didntwant to talk about ron right on cue ron thought are you ok with all this harry implored i mean yesterday you tell me you told hermione you love her and then you guys go to her flat alone well if you must know she told me she loved me ron answered dully harry eyes widened considerably wow ron that a big deal so she doesntlove seamus nope ron replied knowing that harry would soon not be so happy and more confused that great mate harry grinned so what do you think she ll do when he asks her to marry her i know what she ll do ron continued cause she told me oh what that harry said his voice losing it older enthusiasm it seemed he was beginning to realize something was obviously not right in this situation she going to say yes ron muttered what harry questioned in shock why does she love seamus no but she said she still canthurt him ron responded trying to keep his voice level he thought he was over the moment now but when he wondered hard enough the lump formed in his throat and the tears stung his eyes that crazy what are you planning to do about it mate harry asked hopefully nothing ron sniffed ron you cantbe serious harry mumbled you cantjust give up on her now after all these years harry ron what are you two doing standing there first we come down and you donteven compliment us and now we re leaving and you re still blabbling come come now we must go mrs weasley huffed losing breath fast i never go back on my word ron said promptly before leading the way for a muggle park it was large and beautiful and rather ethereal ron felt himself sweating slightly in the hot penguin outfit since they were obviously somewhere tropical palm trees swayed lightly and he could even see a blue green ocean in the distance the ground seemed to shake beneath them as all of hermione and seamus family both magical and not danced in a large group most of his family had abandoned him and were dancing or in daphne and george case chatting with other new parents ron strolled around the place occasionally starting up conversation but in general looking rather haughty and bored he hadntseen seamus or hermione all night and he wasntsure whether this was a good thing or a bad one his attention was quickly caught over by large amounts of people going off into a palm tree underbrush curiousity and boredom got the best of him and he dropped the glum act to check out what was going on it may seem horrible of him to do so but sometimes being mad or sad was just so tiring and ron hated having the same mood for too long he broke out of it long enough to find out everyone was going to the side of a pond ron took a seat gingerly on a stone bench close to it and observed what people exactly came here to do it was then that it struck him that most of these people were kids teenagers and there was only one thing teenagers came to do to a secluded area like this everyone was kissing someone else silly ron grimaced prepared to leave when a group of lone girls caught his eye they were pointing at him and giggling how humiluating that was it he wasntlosing his true love and getting shammed in one night but apparently he d struck an interest in the girls because one of them still laughing her head off slantered over to him ron noticed something hermione esque about her she had big bushy hair and that adorable petite nose but when she opened her mouth aaah metallic wires were stuck to her teeth and ron flinched a piece of food was stuck in one of them hey giggles mister the girl said sounding slightly hysterical can i ask what your name is erm ron weasley ron replied getting nervous what yours gwyn granger the girl answered now her voice had taken on a shy quality that pretty ron said trying to smile omigosh thanks she said in a voice so high it was unaudible she started laughing crazily listen can i tell you something ron nodded uncertainly my friend over there here she pointed to a black haired girl in the group of friends thinks you re totally hot she ended laughing okk ron trailed off is this what muggle girls did gywndolene whatever are you doing ron and gywn both looked up and faced mrs granger she stood taller than both of them particularly because her shoes had extraordinary heels aunt constance gywn squeaked and fleed away mrs granger smiled at her and shook her head was she bothering you darling ron shook his head quickly well i just came to see if the youngsters got carried away or not good thing or else she d have devoured you mrs granger said amiably come would you care for a walk ron agreed to the walk and jumped up and followed mrs granger thank god he got out of that uncomfortable pond area how re you ron mrs granger asked politely as she led him back to the party not bad ron fibbed how re you well unlike you i shall choose not to speak falsehood i am terribly worried about my daughter mrs granger started hermione why what wrong with her ron questioned what wrong with her you know that just as well as i do she told me what happened yesterday and at the reunion mrs granger clarified oh she did ron murmured yes and that why i came to see you i want to ask you not to be angry with her mrs granger went on this is hurting her as deeply as it is you then ron who had never shouted in mrs granger precense let his frustration out how can i not be angry with her ron cried out in anguish she doesntwant to make him unhappy she just wants everyone to be pleased mrs granger explained she isntused to disappointing anyone not even for herself i not pleased now ron exclaimed his head suddenly giving him a sharp pain but you re not part of the world to her you re ron her best friend her love she believes that you can sacrifice yourself for her so that she can do what she needs to do please others mrs granger finished well the world wontalways be jolly good with everything she does ron shouted still confused she hasntlearned that she needs to learn it mrs granger said quietly i ve given her my point of view on the topic and hopefully she ll follow it hopefully she ll learn the lesson where is she anyways ron asked sullenly she should be here any moment oh no look she already arrived the proposal will be happening slowly i hope you ll watch it to see if my baby girl does learn her lesson or not mrs granger said walking off to join hermione she has wearing a wavy dress that came up around her calves it was white but pale shades of the rainbow that seemed to have been washed onto the dress from other outfits seemed to have made out remaining colors on the gown she d clipped her hair back but seemed not to know hot to control it completely it came out in snippets and ron noticed large bags under her eyes yet she had the courage to smile ron bit his lip and felt the blood gush forth she was brave enough to smile even today even now that they each knew the love they had for each other extended both ways that made her stronger more courageous than him he d gone around haughty and pouty and she could actually grin through the pain everybody everybody as you all know i have a special announcement seamus said winking hermione pretended to look surprised everyone roamed closer around hermione and seamus harry and ron fell into rhythm together and ron could feel harry watch him tensely almost begging him to do something but he knew it couldn t he couldntbe the one to stop her that would have to be hermione herself but before i do there a person i need to thank for being my partner in crime and for helping me through all this seamus said still grinning ron weasley ron could ve died right then and there he hadntreally helped seamus since they had bought the ring maybe here and there with some extra planning but otherwise he d stayed away from it yet here was seamus gesturing for him to come up wildly hermione stared at him in surprise this was one thing she hadntknown before hand seamus clapped ron back thanks ron you really made this all possible have you got anything to say seamus questioned err seamus gives me way too much credit for all this it was mostly him and um ron tralied off he so wanted to tell hermione to stop the madness he wanted her to think about the big mistake that was about to be made but no it was her own decision that would decide it in the end i want to wish hermione my best mate and the most important person in my life the best of luck in her life hermione still looked at him slightly shocked slightly hurt but quickly turned it into a smile ron went back into the crowd of people and stood between luna and fleur and waited hermione seamus started suddenly getting serious and bending down on one knee will you marry me he pulled the ring out of his pocket and the crowd ooo ed and aww ed ron felt luna take his hand and give it a slight squeeze before releasing it again ron held his breath hermione looked at the ring breathlessly and then spun around and looked at ron pleadingly she started jumping up and down looking from ron to the ring a few people suspicously followed her gaze ron couldntbelieve it she couldntchoose she couldntchoose his love he turned around and pushed through the crowd of people and hurried away before he heard her answer but the air remained silent and he left without the wound of hearing her say yes he rushed to the only place he knew would be mildly empty he rushed to the pond and took a seat at the stone bench once again the anxiety rose and he felt sick to the stomach he stood and kneeled by the pond and through a huge rock into it middle a big splash erupted and even after it was over tiny ripples vibrated through on the pond until it reached the very tips of it his love for hermione was like that when he d first realized it it was the big splash but then slowly the love grew like the little ripples and soon he was nothing but little ripples nothing but love for hermione he dare not cry he only stood from the pond side and seated himself at the stone bench it was cold soothing on this night he stared at the two brown smudges on the knees of his only clean muggle penguin outfit suddenly someone ran around the corner of the path and came up to a stone bench in such a manner that it frightened him for a second that was until he realized it was hermione he scowled how did she have the nerve to come see him after she d chosen another she grasped onto the bench and clutched her stomach to regain her breath ron ron look at me hermione scolded grabbing his chin and swerving him around ron frowned you donthave any right to yell at me he retorted still sitting she leaned over him keeping her grasp on his chin will you not be a prat for once and listen to me ron grunted i said no i here i always going to be here hermione explained in a rush before ron could interrupt her again what ron gasped hardly daring to believe it yeah hermione said breathlessly and started to laugh shakily i love you ron she pulled his chin closer to her and kissed him after pulling apart she asked you still love me dontyou even after what i said about marrying seamus even though i didntlove him six years of love doesntfade that quickly ron said still dazed he stood and took both her hands in his and leaned in to kiss her again he could kiss her now anytime he wanted and he wouldnthave to worry about anybody saying a single thing she was his his however she pulled away after a while it didntseem like a while to ron though it seemed like not time had elapsed at all what do you mean six hermione questioned that would mean only since fourth year and i ve loved you since third so ron began so are you saying you didntlove me in third year hermione snapped dangerously yeah that cause you were annoying ron responded ron hermione exclaimed just kidding eesh ron said laughing hermione pursed her lips you better have been i love you now ron said and i love you hermione said digging her face into his chest and crying softly ron wrapped his arms around her and placed his chin on her top and kissed it suddenly ron could hear uncontrollable sobbing hermione calm down hermione lifted her face up i not the one crying that when ron noticed the bushes rustling ron and hermione bent over it and moved it aside gywn was crying like a mad woman and with her was a teenage boy looking rather bored he had obviously been getting some before but was definitely not now oh gosh gywn why are you crying hermione asked her in concern it was just so so b b eau tiful gwyn said shaking with tears you and him getting reunited after six or seven or whatever years of loving each other hermione smiled and took ron hand yeah i suppose it was and then he was holding you and you guys got to kiss and it was just like in the movies gywn sobbed loudly bo ring the guy yawned why dontyou ever tell me you love me anymore huh gywn said hitting the poor boy with her hand bag ow he cried listen hermione pulled ron away from the bushes that my cousin gywn we ve met ron replied hey do you wanna go home home hermione asked seemingly amused well my flat unless you dontwant to move in ron questioned in hesitation of course i want to move in hermione grinned ok let go home right well let me tell harry and luna i leaving they can tell the rest ron stated sure but ron hermione

throwing open this door and leading hermione in i ve already been here ron hermione said from behind a large box and would you mind helping me carry some of my stuff in sure erm pumpkin ron replied slightly nervously a short quiet wafted through the room and ron was glad a box was blocking ron from seeing hermione face and her his suddenly the silence was broken by hermione wild uncontrollable laughter she dropped the box and clutched her side and fell onto the couch herself her laughing was so hard she could scarcely breath ron frowned and what may i ask is so funny ron questioned indignantly oh come on you cantexpect to call me here she giggled incenstantly pumpkin and have me not laugh hermione asked teasingly why it so funny ron said with as much composure as he could offer yet he felt his ears turn beet red ron we dontdo that we argue and make up and be all cute in our own way but we dontpurposely call each other nicknames like kissy wissy or snuggly wuggly bear or stop ron moaned you ll make me sick in my own mouth hermione grinned see what i mean yeah i suppose so you d rather i call you herms is that it ron asked in a joking tone hermione scowled i despise that however her face brightened but i suppose it exactly what i mean lovely ron said so how many boxes of stuff do you have exactly sixteen hermione replied casually what ron yelped then lowered his voice i mean what where are we going to fit all that stuff we ll manage hermione said standing up and carrying another box in ron followed suit and soon they were both carrying box after box of hermione stuff in it had been two days since the grand proposal and yet ron still had some unanswered questions on his mind like how exactly had seamus taken it and even today when hermione had gone to get her stuff from her old flat she hadntmentioned seamus ron was almost afraid to ask like voicing it would break the magical spell that had weaved a perfect ending for them both he coughed uh hermione did you happen to erm bump into seamus at your old flat today hermione looked up seemingly not phased nope he was at work i packed all my stuff and left the key there oh ron said disappointedly he had hoped raising the topic of seamus would give him some answers apparently not ron continued to carry in the last box and set it on the ground when he noticed hermione spying him with a lopsided smile what re you grinning at ron demanded trying to sound solid but smiling in the process how about you tell me what your all huffed up about hermione answered with a question not that i complaining you re adorable when you re worried you know that she closed the gap between them and ron couldnthelp but gasp slightly even after two days it still took his breath away when she kissed him to his dismay she pulled away and took a seat on top of a box so what wrong hermione inquired putting on her serious face i just wanted to know if it not too weird what happened with you and seamus at the park how d you say no how d he take it does he know about me ron started but hermione shushed him gosh ron you ask questions like a girl hermione joked but if you really want to know i ll tell you hermione seamus started suddenly getting serious and bending down on one knee will you marry me the typicals ooo and awe echoed throughout hermione remained silent and bit the inside of her cheek in frustration she looked down at the ring she had promised herself she d wear it was beautiful and she was surprised she had actually fallen in love with a ring that seamus had chosen usually they were rather diverse from one another yet love for a ring and not a person was no reason to get married was it she could feel the eyes of the crowd bore into her waiting for her to say yes she eyed her mother and father they were both snuggled together and looked at her smilingly hermione wondered if she and seamus could ever be that way if they got married then then she looked at him he was standing there wearing a face that was almost expressionless ron like every other person was waiting for her answer she knew it meant more to him then anyone else in the crowd more than seamus possibly it would be life altering for the both of them somehow every time she turned to say yes she couldnthelp but look back one last time at what she could ve had she started getting jittery and jumping up and down how humiluating by now some other people were watching her gaze very closely hermione noticed seamus face getting red she was shaming him too and ron was leaving she bit her tongue to stop herself from calling out to him almost immediately she decided she couldntcontinue this charade any longer she couldntkeep embarrassing seamus and herself so hermione did the only thing she could think of and fake fainted people gasped and lunged forward hermione felt seamus bend over her and fluttered her eyes dramatically hermione are you alright seamus questioned yes it was just so shocking hermione breathed everyone closed in closer ok this wasntvery much better she needed to be alone with seamus seamus i know this may seem a ridiculus request at the moment but may i may i talk to you alone hermione asked as quietly as possible she leaned close to his ear and avoided moving his lips as little as she could uhh well is it really that important seamus questioned then laughed i mean canti get an answer yet please it very important hermione urged seamus drew in a deep breath ok but let make it fast to the great surprise of the whole group the couple stood and swiftly made their way to a spot under a large tree the finnigans were beginning to become rather flustered and annoyed the grangers on the other hand were just thoughtful about what the twosome were talking about seamus you wanted this to be fast so i ll just come out with it hermione began i cantmarry you seamus blinked dumbfounded what why i dontlove you hermione murmured and i cantmarry someone i dontlove but hermione i love you seamus replied pleadingly no you don t you only think you do hermione explained desperately how can you say that seamus asked softly hermione sighed this was harder than she thought seamus what the name of my charity seamus blanched what what the name of my charity if you love me you should know hermione clarified erm uhh i know this it something with an s er spow seamus tried pathetically hermione teared up slightly and shook her head no it s p e w but i was so sure seamus whispered i dontlove you no and i dontlove you hermione responded sadly i love someone else who seamus questioned raising his eyebrows if you dontknow then you dontknow me at all we cantget married hermione breathed right but what am i going to tell everybody seamus asked trying to smile but failing i dontknow get creative hermione replied breathlessly i have to go find him she turned but he called her once again she faced him again and let him the person that had had all the time in the world with her for the last three years occupy just a minute more this guy is it ron seamus implored hermione grew expressionless perhaps you know me better than i thought ron hummed along to the hymn of here comes the bride and watched luna niece throw handfuls of flower petals into the air he was at the very back of the procession waiting for his moment to come the moment when he d escort hermione down the aisle as best man and maid of honor of course the ring bearer who was daphne escorting william strutted down the aisle george gave an involuntary whoop whoop that caused several people in the audience to give him a disdainful grimace ron left a wind play with his air on at the outdoor wedding ceremony and smiled as his turn drew closer ginny was the first bride maid and was escorted by neville she had found a date but he looked too dumb to function so harry and luna had thrown in neville instead following them was fleur and bill then penelope and percy and then finally ron and hermione he offered her his arm and she took it trying not to laugh she looked fairy like in robes of glowing lavender and a light champagne ish color her hair was out yet not bushy for once it fell down in long waves and curled around her face affectionately someone looks beautiful today ron complimented thanks same to you hermione smiled as they kept in step with the music so nice day for a wedding huh ron commented blinking to keep the sun out of his eyes definitely we should have an outdoor wedding hermione said sensibly ron started choking on his own spit of course he kept walking because he didntwant to disrupt the wedding ceremony he noticed people staring at him as his hacking noises continued hermione thumped his back roughly and he quickly recovered thanks ron muttered anytime hermione replied does marrying me sound that scary no it just far away right ron asked half afraid of the answer goodness gracious of course it is hermione sighed rolling her eyes ron smiled reassured they had finally reached the podium and seperated although ron hated to do it suddenly the music became more dramatic and ron knew it was time for luna to come up harry stood taller beside him and ron noticed his hand curl and unfurl into a fist ready for this mate ron questioned harry blinked and nodded luna appeared under the first arch in a long white gown a wedding ceremony was the only time where a muggle bride and a wizard bride wore the same clothes and luna looked absolutely stunning like a creature not quite of this world even though she usually had this feature to her appearance it was brought out in an even more angelic way today it was a long and silky at the bottom although it was long sleeved her shoulders were bare and as plain as the bottom was the top was embroided with lace and beads that gave it a traditional feel ron suspected it to have been her mothers like hermione luna hair was done and she was wearing two silver earrings that were so small it looked as if someone had just stuck a small speck of glitter onto her earlobe she was smiling with all her teeth out which she did not usually do the ceremony went by smoothly with the usual i do s claps or rowdy cheers on the weasley boys part and much crying from part afterwards they all retired indoors for a wedding reception this time ron could actually enjoy the party and danced with hermione around midnight ron found himself and hermione still dancing her head resting on his shoulder he could feel her breathing deeply and felt himself take in bigger breaths it still felt tingly and new being this close to hermione the weasleys harry and luna had all noticed a new relationship spring between the two but didntpress the matter much to ron relief harry and luna were unsuprisingly supportive and kept grinning at the new couple and whispering knowingly from a veteran couple to a newly made one ron hoped that meant something good however he found he couldntsee anything wrong with the world and just felt snug caught up in hermione arms he twidled her fingers a bit before resting his head agaisnt hers she didntsquirm and ron realized something she was truly his and she would always be his not that he was saying she was a piece of property that could easily be dealt off to any one man but sometimes when you loved someone enough maybe a piece of them became yours even if you seperated and they changed their former self would always remain with you would always be yours perhaps that was the way it was with him and his girl ron hermione spoke softly

the morning sun leaked through the curtained window of ron flat causing him to flutter his eyelids the warmth was welcomed on his skin and he snuggled closer to his pillow he could distinctly hear the buzz of traffic already apparent in the london air he blinked and rubbed the sides of his head a heavy headache seemed to be returning to his throbbing head he attempted to stretch his legs under the covers when they banged against someone else legs his eyes widened for a second before he calmed down he turned and came face to face with a rather pretty dark haired lady she was still asleep and was breathing slowly ron yawned finding a good looking witch in his bed was no reason to be alarmed ron considered what hermione would think if she knew he was here right now with an impossibly sexy witch she d be indifferent to it ron thought darkly to himself he sat up and crunched over his knees he was wondering who this particular witch was he looked over his shoulder and crooked his head she could possibly be a co worker she was reminding him of that witch from the department of magical games and sports before he had the chance to really determine who the raven haired beauty was though she shifted in her sleep and awoke morning ron she said softly uh morning ron said a bit anxiously it would be rather embarrassing if he didntremember her name soon the witch sat up and stretched two seductive arms around ron bare chest and began to kiss the brim of his neck mercilessly ron tried to relax into the mood but hermione kept bothering his thoughts her face looked oddly disapproving argh why couldntshe just get up and leave his thoughts frustrated he pulled away from the pretty witch who had moved onto nibbling his ear erm ron desperately tried to think of some common name she was sure to have amy i ll be in the shower my name gina gina phelps i work with you gina snapped yes quite right ron continued well the shower calls and with that ron rushed off towards the loo once inside he locked the door and quickly pulled off his boxers gina phelps he should ve known well it was all hermione fault anyways she was always wrecking things for him he stepped into the cool shower and let the water slink down his body it was so refreshing on a hot day like this streaking moist buds of water rolling down his skin was oddly therapeutic after waiting an extended period of time ron left the bathroom a towel wrapped neatly around his waist beads of water were still in his hair he was disappointed when he noticed gina was still there what took you so long gina asked she had dressed now although it was rather scantily her tousled blouse revealed a bit too much breast ron didntlike it very much when girls gave away all the juicy goods by under dressing eh i slow in the mornings ron answered truthfully well at least you re here now gina said smiling she flung her arms around his neck and pressed his lips against hers ron could feel her hand loosening the knot in his towel he pulled away last night was amazing gina added happily err yeah ron lied flatly he didnteven remember last night then again he hardly remember everybody birthday listen gina ron went on i have to get to work you know i on the early shift and all so oh i dontmind waiting here for you i have the day off gina said no i meant how about you leave just for the time being ron said and he quickly added after looking at the angry look at gina face you wouldntwant to stay here in a man flat now would you here you should go shopping get all gussied up for our date tonight alright gina grinned you are demanding arentyou ron made an odd sound which gina obviously took for a laugh well then i had best go pick out an outfit from madame malkin s pick me up at eight gina said shortly and she apparated thank god ron gasped glad to be rid of her he went over to his cupboard picked out a box of cereal and sat down to breakfast he didntreally have work today but he was willing to say anything to get away from that vixen for a couple of hours maybe he could cancel the date for this evening just as he was spooning the first mouthful of cereal he noticed a white owl at his window he streaked over to the window and opened the window cheerfully hey hedwig what have you got for me today ron questioned hedwig held out a leg which had a letter tied to it along with a bag he opened it and gratefully sniffed it warm toast and marmalade how luna always managed to send him toast and marmalade across london while keeping it warm was beyond him he stuffed a piece of toast in his mouth and held it there between his teeth he unfurled the letter while feeding hedwig bits of his other few pieces of toast dear ron hope you enjoy breakfast once again have you gotten a present for ginny birthday party yet make sure you keep her out of the house from five to seven alright take care yours luna ron rolled it up again and munched on his toast before placing it on a plate and heading off to grab a quill and parchment he quickly scribbled back a reply and tied it to hedwig leg she gave a gentle hoot before flying off unlike everything else in his life hedwig had never changed she was just as swift sleek and beautiful in flight well one good thing had come from today letter and it wasntjust the fact that he d been reminded of his sister birthday and now had the time to buy her a proper gift if he hurried but he also had a reason to cancel on gina now how was he going to get ginny out of the house for two hours there was another rapping at the window the owl that usually delivered him the daily prophet was fluttering just outside he once again opened the window and untied the newspaper he turned to give the owl the usual knuts when it swooped away hey you re forgetting your payment ron yelled after it the owl did not pay him any heed rather confused he unrolled the newspaper he was even more confused when a letter slipped off the front page and onto the ground he kneeled over and picked it up he tore the envelope open and his eyes met with a tiny neat scrawl that could only ever belong to hermione seeing her writing on a letter addressed to him was enough for him to sink into the chair behind him dear ron i just thought i ought to write to you because i had clearly stated i would how have you been i know it might seem like a silly question to ask because i only haventseen you for two days how are harry luna and the rest of your family if i remember correctly today is ginny birthday tell her i wish her a happy birthday i just had a rather wonderful idea how would you like it if you and i had lunch in diagon alley today my treat i off at twelve i sorry to say seamus probably wontbe joining us as he got an extremely important business meeting with some wizard about franchising his store well get back to me about the lunch date love hermione p s you need not worry about paying for your newspaper today it on the house ron re read the letter several times before hardly daring to believe it was true he would be able to spend an entire hour possibly more with hermione without the bother of seamus being around she could even help him pick out a darn good gift for ginny he wasted no time in writing his reply dear hermione i all right as always the whole lot is jolly good as usual you re absolutely right about ginny birthday being today i ve forgotten and still got to buy her a present am i not a lousy brother and on the issue of your offer to buy me lunch i decided to go for it i mean who could resist having a free lunch with you breathing down my back for not paying twelve and diagon alley are just dandy for me and it really is a shame that good old seamus cantjoin us ron p s you re just buying me everything today arentyou he had wrapped up the letter and headed back to an empty room where he kept his owl zeus he was a black owl with a snowy patch right where a human chin would be making it seem as if he had a beard ron shortly fed him an owl treat before sending him off he couldnthelp but feel lightened by hermione letter every single thing she said to him seemed special she was special someone like her would never go out with someone like him she deserved some good looking smart nice well rounded hard to hate kind of guy and that wasnthim well it definitely not seamus either ron thought making himself grin with and prospect of meeting hermione on his mind he couldnthelp but feel temporarily content after dressing particularly carefully ron flooed off to diagon alley he stepped out of a fireplace in the leaky cauldron and saw it filled with its usual crowd tom raised his glass as ron strolled past and as soon as he reached the cobbled street outside hermione swooped down on him wearing extra long robes you re late she said shortly yeah i was getting all pretty for you ron replied only half joking so where to well i was thinking about this great restaurant down by fortescue ice cream parlor hermione said immediately as if she d already thought this through before hand it called port key to paradise have you heard of it ron scrunched up his face in concentration oh for heaven sake ron you donthave to cause yourself to combust hermione said crossly and you donthave to be so prickly ron snapped he glared at hermione for a moment and she glared right back in union their faces cracked into amused smiles so how have you been for the past three years hermione asked leading him down the street alright ron answered bit over worked at times though why dontyou ever take a break hermione suggested making ron arch an eyebrow how do you know if i do or donttake a break ron inquired i the editor of a highly read newspaper i know about almost everything that you do seeing as you constantly get yourself into my headlines ron grinned so you think you know everything eh course i do hermione replied calmly i know that you ve slept with over half of the woman your age at the ministry of magic ron looked taken aback for only a second before returning to his usual state i have needs ron joked you are such a gigantic git hermione sighed well haventyou ever slept with seamus ron implored he d wanted to ask this subtly and had decided it would be easy to sneak into the conversation about now that is none of your business ron weasley hermione responded stiffly her face took on the impression of professor mcgonagall will you relax i was just joking i knew you d never answer anyway ron said rolling his eyes how would you have guessed that hermione shot at him well i know you hermione and i just know you would never tell ron explained hoping he didntseem too fond of her i dontthink you do hermione said with a hint of frostiness in her voice dontthink i what ron asked bewildered i dontthink you know me anymore hermione said and she turned her head to look at him it not my fault that i don t is it you re the one who never answered my letters ron said a hopeless feeling creeping up on him he hadntwanted this one day with hermione to be ruined by talk of how they had never been in contact dontyou think there was a reason for that hermione grumbled what is that reason ron asked wishing to get a straight answer here the restaurant hermione said loudly she neednthave as ron had been hanging onto her every word she had changed the subject so quickly that ron was mildly surprised the port key to paradise was just as fantastic a restaurant as hermione had promised a widely spread garden with bright wild flowers splashed the entrance to the restaurant once inside ron saw miniature fountains sprouting different colors of water it seemed each color that popped up at a certain time caused certain tingling notes to sound house elves were serving as waiters and ron spun around to face hermione shock apparent on his face hermione you still like this place even though they enslave house elves ron said incredulously they dontenslave house elves actually all the house elves under employment here are paid the average wage a wizard is paid hermione answered i ve made sure of it ron grinned ho mione you really can work miracles the biggest surprise came when hermione blushed upon receiving ron compliment lunch had been eaten in almost complete silence except for when one of them asked the other about the semantics of their lives hermione had been living with seamus for two years and had worked at the daily prophet since she d graduated from hogwarts what annoyed ron the most when he heard about how she had spent the last three years was how often seamus came up he was surprised that they werentengaged yet which reminded him oi i sure you haventheard that harry and luna are engaged ron said they are hermione eyes brightened considerably that wonderful i didntknow you d be so happy it almost as if you re the one that getting married ron teased of course i happy harry and luna are my friends well sort of hermione shrugged i suppose they hate me now for not keeping in touch not at all ron lied hermione raised her eyebrows okay well maybe harry a bit grumpy about it but luna perfectly fine ron said with a wave of his hand really well i wish i could see them again hermione sighed her eyes glazing over she seemed to have a hunger and ron wanted it to be fed how about you come to ginny birthday party tonight ron suggested hermione looked hesitant to accept the offer go on you ll be my guest ron mustered well alright hermione said if seamus doesntmind i ll definitely come good girl ron smiled then a frown fell across his face as a dawning comprehension occurred to him good grief i need to buy ginny a present ron said face whiter than chalk hermione rolled her eyes dear lord ron come on we had best head over to the jewellery store hermione said sensibly jewellery ron said blankly what would ginny want with that rubbish hermione gave him a look of pity before heading off to the jewellery store not checking to see if ron was following or not he was stood beside her outside the door of a very old looking store with the words rina row every witch number one choice for fine jewellery since 456 bc painted on the front glass hermione swept in and ron stood almost fearfully at the door before heading inside himself as soon as he entered he had to blink bright jewels shone out at him from everywhere this better be quick ron muttered oh dontworry it will be hermione sleekly i ve been in here plenty of times and i know just the perfect necklace ginny would adore ron followed hermione to where she was standing near a glass casket holding various pieces of jewellery this one hermione said pushing a well manicured finger up to the glass that necklace down there wouldntthat be perfect for her it was a silver necklace with clusters of garnets and rubies placed decoratively on a white gold chain it would ve been just an average necklace had it not been glistening so brightly something about it almost gave the impression that a fire was almost burning within the stone did you know that there are phoenix flames in each of the stones hermione said in a matter of fact tone will you try it on ron requested hemione looked up at him rather surprised me well i dontknow i suppose hermione murmured uncertainly a nearby witch seemed to have heard what they were mumbling about because she bustled over to them and pulled the necklace out from under the glass she took it off the case and held it out to hermione who took it reluctantly put it on hermione suggested sure ron said nodding he faced her back as she pulled her hair forwards ron could feel his ears redden as her robe drooped down a bit to reveal some skin he breathed in rather shakily and wrapped the necklace around her he almost wanted to reach out and caress her skin which he was positive would be soft instead he fought off the urge and fumbled with the clasp on the back of the necklace after he spent five minutes attempting to get the tiny hoop through the other thinger hermione sighed anytime this year ron hey it not like i help people put on necklaces everyday ron grumbled it took him approximately eight more tries before it held together on it own yes ron cried lifting a fist into the air in triumph oh dontget all smug it not like you won the quidditch world cup hermione said straightening the necklace so how does it look ron looked at her carefully the necklace really brought out the best in hermione it almost made her skin glow and it complimented her hair and eyes wonderfully he almost had a wistful feeling inside of him that made him want to buy the necklace for hermione instead then again if it looked as good on ginny as it did on hermione it would probably be the best gift of the lot i must say miss that necklace looks stunning on you commented the stout witch behind the counter and what do you think ron hermione asked seriously you heard the woman it looks stunning on you ron said shortly ripping his eyes from the necklace and hermione he hoped by now his ears werenttoo red i ll take it ron said nodding towards the sales witch perfect the witch beamed shall i wrap it up or does your girlfriend prefer to wear the necklace home if ron could ve looked at himself in the mirror at that moment he would ve seen a person with a magenta beet for the head with a rather pleased expression playing on their face hermione appeared to be almost the same she not my girlfriend ron answered more quickly than he meant to the witch raised her eyebrows sister then no she just just a friend ron clarified trying to be cool and collected as if he found the whole thing funny oooh i understand now j ust a friend huh the witch smirked i suppose that wontlast long if you re buying jewellery together listen could you just tell us how much the necklace costs hermione demanded coolly by now she had taken the necklace off and was handing it over to the witch and wrap it up it a birthday present she added eyes hugely narrowed ron was almost frightened of hermione bursting into professor mcgonagall the witch didntsay anything else other than sixteen galleons please the rest of the time they were in the shop it seemed hermione had scared her too maybe she met mcgonagall too ron thought to himself that d explain lots they left the shoppe in silence and continued to stroll down the street occasionally they stopped so hermione could check out things that had caught her interest ron enjoyed watching her face light up every time she found something she liked a book a quill some ancient scrolls he wanted so much to be part of her life that he pretended to be interested in all of it even the book about the history of mexican wizard debates do you know the time ron hermione asked out of the blue erm he checked his watch it about five ron reported what you re kidding hermione gasped nope i not ron said shrugging he didntget what the big deal was ron you were supposed to be keeping ginny out of the house about now remember when you told me over lunch hermione exclaimed frustrated she seemed surprised at his recklessness and quick loss of memory damn it ron muttered furiously i have to go hermione said smiling almost sadly yeah i know then you ll come to her birthday party ron suggested hopefully even bring seamus if you have to i guess it would be alright if we came hermione said as long as everyone else is fine with it err yeah yeah they ll find it peachy keen ron fibbed quickly well i have to get to the leaky cauldron and floo over to the burrow that where the party is by the way hermione nodded bye ron ron stood there for a minute knowing full well that if he was any later in getting to the burrow his mother would hit him over the head with a frying pan however hermione eyes were so captivating and he loved it when she smiled at him like that he hesitated once more before sprinting off to the leaky cauldron as fast as his legs could carry him author note i wanted to include the birthday party in this chapter but there was just wasnteven room i dontlike over lengthening my chapters anyways i know still not much of what i promised in the summary yet but it will come along with a teensy bit of drama as always i leave you with the words review review review disclaimer you donthave to sue me

wrong in the thank yous last time just goes to show how big of an idiot i can be anyways thanks for your review now on with the story as he had expected his mother had threatened to thump a scalding frying pan over his head when ron arrived at the burrow half an hour late there had been a huge line waiting to floo somewhere at the leaky cauldron and tom was in no position to let him jump the queue where were you anyways harry questioned sitting at the table and using his wand to blow up balloons the rest of the weasleys and luna were also caught up in birthday chores mrs weasley was baking layered cake and the smell was wafting welcomingly through the house fred and george who were supposed to be hanging up streamers were instead jinxing them to bind themselves like snakes around guests as they entered the house for the party bill was owling all of ginny friends to make sure they could come and charlie was busy helping luna tidy up the house percy was supervising i was in diagon alley ron said then lowered his voice and added buying ginny a last minute present harry gave him a disgusted look ron was glad he didntmention he was there with hermione he didntwant to imagine what harry expression would ve been then ron was sure harry had been very hurt that hermione hadntwritten to him all these years oh dontyou give me that you only remembered because luna reminded you ron scowled and it doesntmatter since my gift is going to be the best one this year that what you said about last year fruit cake harry teased ron blushed profusely hey that was one heck of a fruit cake he defended himself harry smirked whatever mate so where is ginny ron inquired neville had to ask her out on a date to get her out of the house harry laughed it was hilarious neville and my sister he didntdo it of his own will did he ron asked if you can consider fred and george holding their wands up to his back as he asked her free will then yeah harry replied calmly but between you and me i think he was rather pleased when she said yes ron decided to ignore that bit of the story he didntlike picturing his little sister with anybody maybe for a while in fifth year he d thought it kind of cool if she could snag harry but those dreams were smashed when harry began dating luna hey mum where dad ron asked mrs weasley face darkened considerably he at work she said with pursed lips ron nodded suddenly there a loud bang from the living room and every rushed in there one of the twins wands was lying on the ground flailing dangerously shooting sparks out of it tip fred was on the ground fighting off a rogue streamer attempting to strangle him for heaven sake will you two never grow up mrs weasley shouted taking off the spell with a quick swish of her wand the streamer immediately let go of fred and lay lifeless fred himself was left looking rather silly tied up in a streamer george was keeled over beside him rolling with laughter the sight of both of them there was enough to make everyone erupt into laughter excluding mrs weasley back to work now at around six ginny friends began arriving it seemed every student in ginny year at hogwarts was here she was quite the popular one they all crowded into the burrow which had been magically expanded to accomodate them all even some members of the wizarding media had attempted to sneak into the exclusive party of course they were instantly thrown out by bill and charlie who had taken on the role of bouncers today even mrs weasley seemed too happily caught up with family and friends to notice that certain streamers were attacking some guests hah look that one over there got colin creevey george said grinning gleefully no i pretty sure that dennis creevey harry said craning his neck to look around what does it matter who he is all that matters is that he putting up quite the battle fred commented wickedly oooh there it goes getting fleur bill not going to like that ron mind floated away from the conversation and circled around hermione he was wondering anxiously when she d arrive he still hadnttold anyone about the extra guest guests if you counted seamus somehow ron had a feeling no one would mind seamus as they would hermione but once harry and the rest saw her they couldntpossibly hold a grudge could they ron ron dear could you come over here for a bit mrs weasley called pleasantly but there was a hint of demanding in her voice he rose and gave them all confused stares they returned them but once he caught luna eye he realized that she wasnttelling him something without getting too hassled by ginny friends he managed to make his way over to his mother what up mum ron questioned looking around at the people standing there two middle aged wizards and a witch were standing around a younger prettier witch she flashed ron a dazzling smile and he felt his knees go slightly weak and his ears become redder i just wanted you to meet becky mrs weasley said smiling smugly becky this is my son ronald you two are about the same age then ron immediately understood his mother was trying to set him up with some pretty witch and luna had known about it possibly even helped he felt anger course through him but then a voice of reason piped up what so bad about a beautiful witch ello renold becky said with a heavy accent sounded french hi becky ron said trying not to meet her eyes he didntfancy people setting him up with other witches he could only be interested in one witch at a time and currently that witch was hermione becky an old friend of fleur s ron mrs weasley said obviously wanting them to continue their conversation she an auror with the ministry of magic in france and she was in town so i thought it appropriate to invite her thought it appropriate did you ron muttered through clenched teeth you are en auror ere becky asked eagerly no i an unspeakable my friend harry over there the auror ron said gesturing his neck back in the direction where harry was lounging arry potter beck gasped excitedly erm yeah ron said squirming he could feel her watching him and it felt uncomfortable vell an unspeakable iz jus as gud as un auror becky continued ron knew he would have to meet her eyes soon so he risked looking up pure blue delight her eyes were such a forget me not blue that ron couldnthelp but smile at her a bit she returned the favor oi you scarvy dogs ginny just arriving with neville fred yelled earning frowns from members of the crowd mrs weasley and percy the room fell silent and when ginny opened the door deafening cheers erupted chorused by surprise as soon as she entered a streamer came alive and attempted to pounce upon the birthday girl but bill quickly waved his wand so that all it did was roll up and bounce off neville head ginny looked taken aback for only a moment then went back to her usual self and squealed when she noticed a group of particularly close friends after many rounds of hugs with ex classmates she came round to the people who had toiled away at making this night perfect mum this is wonderful ginny cried throwing herself on her mother after she pulled away mrs weasley straightened her robes a bit i glad you like it ginny dear she smiled where dad ginny asked looking around at work mrs weasley said silently ginny face fell but she quickly recovered and you lot were great too ginny said hugging the rest of them in turn well this better be worth it because my ears are still ringing from all those fools screaming so loudly george muttered pulling on his ear ron ginny said hugging him ron wrapped his arms around her protectively i hope you didntget me fruit cake again ginny frowned untangling herself from his grasp no ron retorted face flushed so ron began shiftily neville was a gentleman wasnthe cause if he wasn t oh neville was perfectly nice ginny said i wonder where he is now and she drifted off into the crowd of people ron couldnthelp but be disappointed hermione hadntshown up yet perhaps she wasntcoming at all he noticed becky seemed to be warming up to harry out of the corner of his eye he also noticed luna was naive dazed expression she hadntnoticed becky flirting with her fianc ron decided to get some quiet time for a bit and headed off to the back yard it was completely empty and he sat hunched over a large rock he sighed heavily hermione had directly broke a promise and yet here he was still loving her she d broken his heart so many times each time he d written over the summer after seventh year and hadntreceived a reply was complete torture for him at first he d thought it was a huge misunderstanding and that death eaters were intercepting their letters and he d even gone so far as to make sure she was alright and hadntbeen abducted or anything once he d gone to the flat where he knew she was staying for the time being and actually slipped the letter in through the window he d watched in dismay as she looked at it and at once threw it in the fireplace he had been torn apart by heartbreak and hadntlet anyone see him for weeks and now here he was spending entire days with her and inviting her to parties as if they were okay he knew he should be angry hurt and furious but all he was was happy happy to see her becoming a part of his other wise meaningless life knut for your thoughts ron looked up ginny why arentyou in there with all your friends ron said running a hand through his hair because you re out here without anyone ginny responded i saw you coming out oh yeah ron mumbled care to tell me what bothering you ginny repeated ah it nothing ron murmured come on let get back to the festivities ginny stared at him in concern for a moment before agreeing to return to the party once ron was blocking you out about this emotions it was no use pressuring him to tell you it just distanced him more the party was bustling with party goers and everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves after a little encouragement from ron ginny left his side to go dance with some young wizard the music was interrupted as a loud buzz sounded throughout the room s alright only the doorbell folks charlie said and the people turned back to whatever they were doing charlie strode over to the door and opened it ron was stunned by who it was hermione stood there looking rather apprehensive she was wearing lovely robes of opal her hair was tied up into a loose bun and ron ran forward to greet her hey hermione looking good ron said heartily thanks ron hermione said stepping in and looking over his shoulder at someone charlie being as polite as he was didntcomment at all on her surprise turn up ron turned around and saw harry face it was steely and his gaze only lingered on hermione face for a mere second before returning to luna but luna could only keep her eyes solidly on hermione ron led hermione to where most of the weasleys and harry and luna were sitting hermione long time no see george commented but i see the time has done you good back for a couple of free piecces of cake then i dontblame you mum cake is the best now i just want it understood that i invited hermione here why harry asked sharply they all fell silent ron was unpleasantly reminded of their teen years where harry had been so grumpy that everyone had thought of him as a human time bomb harry luna said placing a soothing hand on his arm dontstart this why not donti have the right to now why after three years of ignoring us completely she come back harry snapped ron didntdare look at hermione harry please just dontoverreact just do it for the sake of my birthday okay ginny pleaded harry glared at hermione for a moment longer than looked away silenced mrs weasley buslted over just then it almost cake time she said excitedly and oh my goodness is that hermione granger standing in my living room once again what a pleasure mrs weasley reached over and gave hermione a tight hug ron felt eternally grateful to her for being so welcoming it good to see you too mrs weasley hermione sighed it good to see you all they all grinned and each in turn gave her a hug harry was the only one who avoided her and went upstairs it left hermione looking crestfallen hermione ignore him he just ron started i going to go talk to him hermione said cutting across him with that she also headed upstairs ron felt utterly annoyed the one day when he should have hermione to himself she was somewhere with harry comforting him ron slumped down on the couch it was unfair he couldnthelp but feel foreboding towards harry but then he scolded himself it really wasntharry fault per se i glad you brought her here luna said suddenly it ll do everyone a lot of good to see her again ron grinned at her he got up from where he was sitting and went to sit beside her you think so ron said everyone thinks so luna replied not everyone but i glad i have your okay ron sighed luna you know that i m still in love with hermione luna finished it obvious you are soul mates oh god luna ron said helplessly that a bunch of rubbish no it isn t luna said calmly it even says so in wonkydunt bible what oh never mind i dontwant to know ron said shaking his head they both fell silent one of the things ron liked most about his strange friend was that whenever a silence fell between them it wasntat all odd it was more peaceful ron wondered what she was thinking of so what did you think of becky ron questioned luna furrowed her eyebrows ron realized she had noticed becky flirting with harry she seemed deep in thought and after a while she spoke up she seemed nice i didntget much of a chance to talk to her luna explained ron arched an eyebrow at her calmness she took a liking to harry huh ron grinned luna shot him an unreadable look he didntknow why he had tried to provoke her into feeling jealous could it be because he himself was jealous to death of seamus why dontyou go check on harry and hermione luna piped up they ve been up there for a while now ron leapt up at the oppurtunity he crept up the crooked stairs in the burrow most of the landings were dark and empty of life the stairs gave moans of protest as he walked over them and when he finally reached a bedroom with the door slightly ajar he could hear the muffled voices of harry and hermiome talking harry voice didntsound so angry anymore ron stuck his head in the gap and watched them harry was sitting on the bed and hermione had plopped down beside him he was shocked to see they were both smiling so you re still living in london then harry asked well the editor of the daily prophet must stay at headquarters hermione grinned ron was dumbfounded by how fast she had calmed him they were talking as if they were still the same old harry and hermione from school before the uprise of voldemort his two best friends were once again able to be in each other company without one of them being upset relief washed over him he accidently stepped forward and the door creaked harry and hermione both spun their heads to face him how long have you been eavesdropping then hermione demanded dontworry i missed all the emotional stuff ron replied pushing the door open further and stepping inside i sure you would ve loved to see me cry harry mused no i believe i would have been frightened ron said alarmed well no need to shiver in your boots ron because no one cried hermione said ron glared at her for a moment before turning to harry who hastily said he needed to get downstairs after harry had shuffled out of the room hermione patted a spot on the bed beside her ron sat down beside her gingerly i didntthink you d show up ron said well i practically promised didnti it would ve been rude to not come hermione explained ron smiled thanks for inviting me hermione continued softly i glad to have things cleared up with harry how did you manage that anyways ron implored i have my ways hermione smiled knowingly where seamus ron said had to meet that wizard again hermione said and ron could sense resentment in her voice seamus is a busy bloke do you even get to spend time together ron asked in what he hoped was an innocent voice yes we do but sometimes she trailed off ron decided not to ask he didntneed any deatils of her relationship with seamus they were an odd couple two people you never suspected to get together but when they did it worked out for them shall we head down for some cake hermione suggested even though ron was perfectly happy being here alone with her he agreed downstairs the party was still raving and mrs weasley was just placing the large cake on the table fred was pulling ginny to the front of the table as the crowd gathered around them a slow but merry chant of happy birthday echoed through the house as ginny beamed at them all when the song had ended to ron great relief ginny blew out her candles all nineteen of them the clapping was thunderous as mrs weasley began cutting the slices to feed all the eager mouths ron decided to go in for the kill before the cake was all eaten the night wore on ron was elated to see everyone had warmed up to hermione and was treating like a member of the family again when it was way past midnight guests started to make their way out of the house in twos and threes when very few people were left ginny drew towards hermione how re you getting home tonight ginny questioned oh it odd because seamus said he d drop by the party and we d leave together hermione said frowning slightly i wonder what keeping him ron hoped that seamus would never come but sadly when only ten guests remained seamus showed up his face looked flushed and he looked rather harried hello all seamus said nodding at them happy birthday to you ginny hermione i sorry i so late do you want to get going now sure let me just get my purse hermione said looking around for her purse oh i must have left it upstairs i ll be right back seamus took in a deep breath and settled down where hermione had been just minutes before ron shifted in discomfort and moved away a bit for a second i thought she might ve caught me seamus breathed out caught you doing what ron asked testily seamus looked at ron as if sizing him up i planning to propose to hermione harry looked up at seamus but luna looked at ron that s wicked mate harry said ron left like a cold hand had reached into his stomach and was messing up his insides i afraid she wontsay yes seamus said i not sure she madly in love with me like i am with her what what w will i do if she says no i ve already told my parents i planning on asking her i i need to do something fabulous for her to say yes maybe something like get phoenixes and unicorns to dance all around her until she d say yes i need someone who knows her well to tell me what she d like you know someone someone like ron here seamus said now on an all out rant when he mentioned ron he paled no no i not your man seamus ron said incredulously yes yes you are i remember back in hogwarts everyone thought you and hermione were made for each other so you must know some of the things she d like to see when a man proposes to her seamus hiccuped ron looked at him nervously he didntremember hermione ever talking to him about how she d want a man to propose to her if she had he probably hadntbeen listening now he almost wished he had just so he could tell seamus the exact opposite of it please seamus begged ron had a feeling that perhaps seamus had had one too many butterbeers please help me i i love her by now everyone was staring intently at ron he wanted to tell them all to bugger off but something stopped him seamus loved hermione he and seamus felt the same way about her maybe if he couldnthave her he should actually help seamus who had a chance get her what was the point in bringing seamus down to his level of heartbreak alright settle down mate i ll help you get the girl ron said he could see luna arch an eyebrow out of he corner of his eye the sudden sound of footsteps on the stairs above them made them all look up hermione came down everyone was watching her closely at first she was moving at her usual rate but then she slowed and observed them watching her intently she immediately stiffened and looked back at them all suspiciously what she asked do i have something in my teeth author note da

review once again thank you all so much all of you are completely the best i hope you enjoy the following chapter as much as you did the last the following morning just as ron was sitting down to breakfas t an unfamiliar owl began pecking at his window oddly enough it wasnteven a daily prophet owl this particular owl was auburn in color and looked almost twice the size of any normal owl ron had seen curious he got up to let his feathered friend inside it swooped in and landed on his arm he flinched as it dug its talons gripped him rather hard he pursued to untie the letter and was surprised to meet an odd large cursive writing ron could you meet me in the leaky cauldron today around three it wonttake long i swear i just wanted to talk to you about last night seamus ron folded up the letter he was rather hesitant to meet seamus alone especially after the sudden outburst he d had last night the part that left ron the most perturbed was seamus begging for help on swooning hermione into getting engaged did he really want to help him ron knew that once hermione was married that she d be lost to him forever then agai n did he even have a chance with her where he stood now he sighed unnecessarily he didntneed to hold a grudge against seamus he didntneed to keep another man heart from hermione love he summoned up a parchment and some ink and grimly wrote back a reply seamus i ll be there ron he decided not to elaborate just in case he changed his mind about helping him folding the letter as quickly as possible he tied it in a rush to the owl leg just as the owl was flying off the perch of his windowsill ron whirled around and began stuffing porridge dangerously into his mouth before he could call the owl back at exactly three ron reached the door to the leaky cauldron and saw seamus already sitting their taking big gulps of his drink when he saw ron he immediately ushered him over ron made his way through the small pool of people and reached the table where seamus was sitting hello seamus ron said unnerved he eyed seamus and noticed he looked a lot less nervous today hi ron seamus said taking another swoop at his drink would you like anything ordered for you nah ron said with a wave of his hand so why did you call me here he wanted to get to the matter at hand after all how long was he supposed to sit here with hermione boyfriend well as i stated last night rather stupidly i might add i need your help mate seamus explained you know hermione she spent the day with you just yesterday i would ve asked harry but i know he been rather angry towards mione lately not so mad anymore ron replied so where is hermione today at home got a day off from the prophet seamus said casually where is home for you two ron inquired further this muggle flat but we still managed to get the place hooked up to the floo by the name spew or whatever that is seamus explained carelessly ron grinned typical hermione anyway i was thinking could you help me pick a ring seamus suggested ah i know jewellery is probably not your forte but she was telling me you guys went to a jewellery store to buy ginny present did you not how about going there seamus suggested err right but listen i cantguarantee she ll love whatever hell of a ring i help you choose for her ron clarified i know we were best mates in hogwarts but we ve been complete strangers to each other for the last three years yeah but i still need all the help i can get seamus said thoughtfully shall we get going then i ve finished my drink ron agreed thinking it better to be out and about with people around them then to be stuck in a pub all crammed in a corner together he didntlike the thought of being around seamus since when he was in love with his girlfriend the worst part was he didntfeel a bit guilty at having romantic thoughts about his old friend girl but he did feel guilty about not feeling guilty and every time he was around seamus that shame within him grew was he that scummy that he couldnteven have the grace to feel ashamed of himself for his absurd feelings uh ron do you know where you re going seamus asked unsteadily as he watched ron nearly plough into a bunch of graphorn on display outside the apothecary oh oops ron said feeling a twinge of pink reach his cheeks just this way this time he led seamus down a bit further to rina and row where crowds of witches were waiting outside all looking excitedly at a large banner in front of the store pronouncing some sale as soon as they noticed ron all of their attention turned towards him he frowned when he saw them all whisper darkly to each other he was bothered by this it reminded too much about how people used to whisper bad things about harry during their hogwarts years ron gave them a weary stare before going into the store the crowd parted for him and seamus can i look at some engagement rings seamus questioned a blonde witch who gave ron an interested stare before going over to another co worker of hers and whispering something in her ear seamus seemed oblivious to it all ron ignored them perhaps witch weekly had spread another rumor about him or it could be the quibbler either way ron found he could not care less the blonde witch returned carrying cases and cases of rings ron instantly set to work and sorted through all the various rings none of them seemed exceptional or spectacular enough to be worn on hermione finger for a day let alone the rest of her life even though seamus seemed to take a liking to few ron quickly made him realize the faults in them nah you dontwant that that diamond is cut a bit too sharply imagine having to wear that all the time and having it cut your finger ron said criticizing what he thought was the ugliest ring they had seen today he was shocked at seamus displeasure at having to let it go after about half an hour they gave up suit and decided to head back home as they trudged back to the leaky cauldron for a final drink ron noticed almost every single person in the crowd seemed to either be holding the daily prophet or ogling at him like he was some kind of escaped criminal from azkaban ron brushed off all their accusatory glares and lowered his eyes to the ground once he got inside the leaky cauldron the usual greetings he received were not uttered everyone just stared at him like he was filth becoming rather self conscious now he settled himself at the counter seamus took the chair to his left still unaware of all the eyes on the back of ron head ron dared to look behind him and saw almost every head in the house flick back to their proper tables frowning he turned back you know ron without you today i would ve bought that spiky ring seamus said i want to thank you for helping me out i hope we can do this another time also yeah sure whenever your free ron said looking into the depths of his drink at his own reflection he cocked his head to the side to muse himself ron what are the chances she ll say yes you think seamus questioned ron looked up and saw seamus studying him very closely it made him feel uncomfortable i sure she ll say yes no matter what the circumstances are although creating a perfect moment can be a real bonus ron said truthfully he noticed seamus still staring at him erm what are you looking at ron asked nervously after seamus had intently been watching him for about five minutes nothing it just hermione could ve just as easily been in love with you couldntshe seamus said thoughtfully ron didntlike where this conversation was going uh what do you mean hermione doesntlove me ron said trying to look calm yeah but at hogwarts if you could only have heard what people said about you two said you guys were going to be together forever seamus said seriously yeah well they didntknow what they were talking about ron said quickly times change people change i guess they do seamus continued you ve definitely changed i have ron said surprised uh huh you re not the cocky idiot you were in seventh year seamus said ron smiled i was a tad big headed wasnti ron grinned seamus nodded remember the time neville couldntfind a date for the ball that year and had to take moaning myrtle seamus said his voice cracking under laughter ron immediately fell into peels of it himself that was priceless ron said wiping tears of glee from his eyes those were good times suddenly he realized he was having a good time with hermione fianc to be and silenced himself well i better go now hermione ll be waiting i ve been telling her i ve been having some big business meeting while i ve been trying to get stuff ready for the night i ask her seamus said bye ron nodded and watched him floo out of the place ron followed suit without even finishing his drink by the looks of the way people were reacting to him today something was definitely wrong he had just reached his flat when there was a mad knocking at his door hoping it was an answer to the reason why everyone was acting to oddly ron promptly opened it in the doorway harry at his most angriest he was practically fuming ron looked from him to luna who was looked just as mad ron was a bit taken aback but before he could even speak harry was placing a hand on his chest and shunting ron to one side luna followed him without so much as glancing in ron direction harry faced a wall and suddenly beat his fist into it that was sure to leave a dent ron closed the door and started over to where harry was she sold us out harry breathed and his every word echoed through the room even though he said it in a barely audible tone luna slowly slid into a chair where the mess of ron breakfast still remained she seemed to be staring into the dregs of his porridge at a loss for what to say who sold us out ron asked quietly hermione harry said as though her name felt like acid in his mouth wha did you get the prophet this morning ron harry questioned suddenly spinning around ron was surprised steam wasntbillowing from his nostrils no ron said getting increasingly nervous no i didn t well then harry said you didntread this did you harry thrust the most recent issue of the daily prophet into ron arms he opened up the paper and blanched the front page was lined with scandalous headlines the first read harry potter and luna lovegood secret engagement why they are hiding the truth from society and an entire article about their engagement followed it the second was just as horrible weasley seniors living in a pigsty why their children arentsupporting them ron did not even dare to read the articles he looked up at harry and luna who were both staring at him hermione would never yet she did luna finished surprising ron even more who else would know about the fact that luna and i are engaged who else would ve known about the inside of the burrow harry said madly ron knew he had a point there but hermione wouldn t it was impossible why would she ever do this to him he was going to pay hell from everyone for this anger arose how dare she try to undermine them all was she just getting closer to ron to get a good story i i sorry ron said lamely there was a long silence that followed ron tried to calm his anger at hermione but just couldn t he started to bang his head up against the wall farther deepening harry dent ron stop it luna said no use hurting yourself i think your family going to do enough of that luna ron said weakly turning to her you dontpossibly believe hermione did this do you luna was wise she couldnthave believed this could she she had to know it was some kind of lie he needed her on his side this time he needed someone to be on his side dontyou go trying to get luna to feel sorry for you harry snapped before she could speak i didntwant to believe it ron but how who else could have done it luna said she sounded afraid herself but come on even for hermione this is a bit much maybe she d do almost anything to get a good story but she wouldntbecome a conniving vindictive horror ron mustered hopelessly that the problem with you ron you think hermione still the same old girl we knew at hogwarts still as loyal as ever but we have no clue what she been up to for the past three years who she hangs around the news business her business could ve changed her harry said softly ron could tell that harry hated having to put down one of his former best mates and the person he knew ron loved so much ron saw luna looking at the window there was an owl there carrying what could unmistakably be a howler ron snatched it up and opened it unleashing his mother thunderous voice ron weasley how dare you bring that girl into my house and reveal all of our most private secrets how were you foolish enough to let her print up articles on our private affairs you wait till i get my hands on you i will throttle you you best make your way to the burrow as soon as possible i will not be held responsible for any harm your brothers may inflict upon you at your arrival because you deserve it and frankly i do not care at all about your well being right now to think of all the shame you ve brought down upon us i never want to see hermione granger in my house again ron stood their feeling winded it was all sick a twisted game of hermione to get a juicy article he loathed her right now he had been so unbelievingly love with her but now she went and did this and left him feeling mixed up inside he was faintly aware of harry and luna leaving merely saying we ll see you later we suppose ron own words echoed through his head over and over times change people change apparently hermione had changed quite a bit he was a disgrace after all those years of being an unspeakable and learning not to reveal secrets he had still not been able to detect that he was haphazardly revealing all his secrets to hermione he still could not take in the fact that she had betrayed his trust it seemed so below her and yet no one else could ve known the information in his fury he grabbed some floo powder in his fist not noticing that most of it was leaking out of his fingers and onto the floor like sand he knew where he had to go so instead of flooing over to the burrow where he was sure everyone was expecting him he headed off to hermione flat author note i know this chapter might ve been boring for some because it not much ron and hermione love face to face but it interesting nonetheless love it hate it review it disclaimer i wish all these wonderful characters were mine but they aren t now if you ll excuse me i ll

enjoy this chapter as much as you did the last hermione flat was very neat and tidy and reflected what could only be hermione bookshelves lined the walls except for where a flare of seamus came into view with posters of puddlemere united the couches were mismatched but gave the room a cozy feel nonetheless as ron stepped out of the fireplace he noticed hermione sitting at a table in the corner writing intently his anger bubbled over at the sight of her she looked up rather dazed when she noticed him ron what are you how could you ron said angrily what are you talking about hermione asked she was pretending to be confused well she wasntgoing to fool him again dontgive me that rubbish i know what you wrote in the sunday prophet ron said his voice growing steadily louder the sunday prophet hermione said slowly pronouncing each syllable as if she didntquite understand what he was getting at yes the sunday prophet you know the daily prophet on sundays ron retorted i know very well what the sunday prophet is ron hermione stated what i dontknow is what you re getting all huffy about oh really are you trying to tell me you didntread your own newspaper ron spat thinking he d won the battle now hermione only looked further dumbstruck no i didntactually i wasntworking today or yesterday for that matter since you know perfectly well i was at ginny birthday party the room fell silent for a moment only broken by the sounds of ron harsh breathing who else would know this ron demanded throwing the prophet at her to see for herself there was nothing left to say she caught it in her grasp and as soon as her eyes met with the first page she gasped she looked up at him almost fearfully she took in a deep shaky breath and began rubbing her forehead ron she started slowly you dontbelieve i could have done this do you i dontknow ron mumbled weakly burying his face in his hands hermione hadnt been at the prophet for two days ron knew that seamus had just mentioned this morning that she was at home but how was it possible for someone else to find out this information it was almost like they read hermione mind ron heard hermione stand she walked briskly to her own fireplace and said daily prophet before disappearing ron stood up himself and decided to follow her perhaps he would get some answers from the source the daily prophet headquarters was even more hectic and busy than the ministry of magic notes were constantly flying through the air and witches and wizards were rushing off to sudden places for a big story the multitude of flashing lights were making ron have to blink the green dots in front of his eyes away they all seemed to be caught up in their own business desperately thriving to get a front page story when they all saw hermione however their attitudes changed completely and while they tried steered clear of her they also gave her gestures of welcome which she did not return today she strode confidently through the sea of cubicles with ron following feebly behind this was her turf after all after what seemed like forever to ron they had reached the last cubicle and started to pace down a beautiful corridor portraits of ex editors of the prophet were all lining the walls there were more of them than ron could count they each called out to hermione and gave ron rather suspicious looks the door to the editor office was much more glamorous than ron thought it would be it was a finely furnished wooden door with deep carvings on it at the top and foremost were some strange symbols and as the lines of symbols progressed they became more and more like everyday letters until finally evolution had molded them into the alphabet the symbols in the end spelled out editor in chief hermione pulled a small key out of the pockets of her robes and stuck it in the keyhole with a soft click the door swung open ron was fairly bewildered to find someone else already in there they had their back turned to ron and hermione although the latter seemed to know who she was i should have known hermione said smiling sadly you took it didntyou ron stared from hermione to the other woman in the room the woman had blonde hair and seemed oddly familiar to ron he heard her snort when she heard hermione voice you mean this the woman said holding out a key identical to hermione s ron eyes darted from the woman to hermione again that key is only for emergencies and as my assistant editor you know perfectly well the rules you have broken how dare you undermine me hermione breathed dangerously you know as well as i do that i could have you fired the woman laughed in a highly girlish way ron flinched it almost reminded him of umbridge hermione hermione hermione the woman tutted turning around when will you learn ron gasped the woman she was pansy pug faced parkinson ron said aghast she hadntchanged a bit except that perhaps she looked a bit older she was still the same slytherin that had always taunted him mercilessly in school weasel king pansy shot back how nice of you to be here i hope you liked the article i wrote about you and your idiotic muggle loving family you ron gaped you wrote the article how did you know just as foolish as the mudblood i see pansy smirked it was all lucky chance of course mudblood comes in late at night leaves pensieve in her office intelligent but under rated co worker breaks into office and checks it out finds the juicy goods prints story did you get that weasley or was that not slow enough for you for the first time ron noticed a pensieve in the middle of the room hermione thoughts were swirling about in a tornado of colour and vibrancy you bi ron hermione said sharply silencing him immediately parkinson you have broken the code of conduct here invading my privacy just to get a good story is it worth getting fired for you just dontget it do you and they said you were the brightest witch of our generation pah have you ever heard the saying the biggest fish gets that way by never being caught pansy asked apprehension seemed to be dawning on hermione face you cantfire me pansy said a mad gleam in her eyes i quit that not what i plan to put on your record book hermione said her own eyes gleaming you cantput anything in my record book any longer i ve already been offered a job as editor in chief for the daily gazette in scotland they saw the articles i printed and practically begged me to come work for them it over hermione simply put i win you lose pansy snarled and a grin spread across her face at the shocked look on hermione s do you know how it feels to be second best to you to a mudblood i shouldnthave to be assistant editor i should have been editor in chief and would have been had it not been for you i am the pureblood i am the one who has grown up around magic i am the one who should have gotten all the glory i am the one who is and always will be better than you pansy erupted ron promptly pulled his wand out of his robes and was aiming it at pansy but hermione held him back and breathed in it seemed to take all her energy to stay calm accio key hermione called out and the key pansy had been holding popped out of her hand and landed in hermione s get out hermione said quietly what pansy blanched i said get out hermione yelled at the top of her lungs making both ron and pansy jump get out of my office now hermione shouted ron took a few steps away from her obviously she was angrier than he was right now pansy looked like she was a cow that had just been stamped in the rear by a white hot poker she scurried out of the room and ron prayed that was the last time he would ever see her hermione foraged around her desk but ended up giving in to the velvety chair behind her ron was awestruck to see tears rolling down her cheeks his stomach clenched and he felt all the anger he had been feeling towards pansy dissolve leaving him concerned he flinched as the unfaltering love he d felt for her returned at full capacity so quickly it almost hurt he went around her desk and placed a hand on her shoulder hey hey dontcry he said softly she gone now it not that hermione muttered wiping her tears away impatiently everyone must hate me now more tears welled up in her eyes and ron could not help but notice how beautiful they looked right now they were like liquid chocolate and ron wanted to dive into them once they know the truth they wontbe mad anymore ron said soothingly he began rubbing her back she stood and hugged him he felt taken aback at first and gradually returned the hug she felt delicate in his arms and he held her gently he pulled back a bit to get a glimpse at her their eyes met and for a flickering second ron thought he saw her looking at him with something similar to love he shook his head he knew she didntfeel that way about him after they broke apart ron eyes drifted to the pensieve why d you put all the times we were together in the pensieve he questioned slanting his head i dontknow i suppose i just needed to clear my mind for a moment i ve been having lots to think about lately hermione said shakily ron nodded not quite understanding i guess you probably want to go home after this ron said quietly come on i ll take you back actually i was hoping we could go to the burrow hermione replied i want to clear the air ron agreed although he doubted if it was the best idea the weasleys were all sure to be waiting for him but if he brought along hermione he had half the right to think they would tear her apart before they left however hermione called upon another one of her fellow employees a short wizard who looked like he could still pass as a hogwarts seventh year came at once to hermione aid colin creevey you two know each other hermione said smiling ron colin our best photographer he specializes of course in pictures of harry potter ron turned his laugh into a cough before anyone could notice colin here the key to my office i want you to make sure no one goes in it and if pansy parkinson comes in here once more i want you to make sure she gets thrown out as soon as possible hermione said urgently will do hermione colin said leaning forwards a bit the camera he was holding seemed too heavy and big for him and ron was surprised he managed it everyday good see you tomorrow colin hermione said yep later and i suppose i ll see you around too ron colin said winking ron gave him a weak smile before flooing off with hermione pandemonium hit the burrow when ron arrived with hermione fred and george rose instantly and seemed to be deciding whom they wanted to hex first between the two ginny sounded like an angry cat when she gave a low hiss but other than that the rest of the weasleys only turned red and cursed under their breath harry luna and fleur were there also but none of them reacted at hermione arrival harry it seemed was giving ron and hermione the silent treatment listen i here to explain explain what george shouted well we all know what the sunday prophet wrote about us today ron said unnecessarily and we all know it was a load of dung if you know it was a load of dung then why did you bring her here ginny demanded here here fred supplied will you lot shut up and let me explain ron said growing frustrated ron let me do it hermione said moving out from behind ron i want to tell you all what really happened before you all shove yourselves down my throat hermione began calmly we know what really happened fred exclaimed you sold us out an instant roar of agreement met this hermione seemed to be fighting a losing battle wait wait luna called out perhaps we should listen ron could not have felt happier for having luna here i very much gree with luna fleur said speaking up ron loved them both fleur and luna before anyone could shoot them down though mr weasley piped up they re right let hermione have her say hermione smiled from their encouragement and chose to plough on with her story i haventbeen to work for about two days but i did go there late last night to let some thoughts loose in my pensieve but sadly my assistant editor broke into my office and gained access to it as soon as she saw all the recent events like the day i had lunch with ron ron looked away as a select few turned to look at him with arched eyebrows and ginny birthday party she realized she had gathered enough information to write an article even though most of it was fabrication she knew that as long as there was some truth in it she could easily publish it without me being there i relieved to assure you this particular person has left the prophet forever and i will most definitely be writing an article of apology to you all in our issue of the prophet for tomorrow i just wanted to let you know i deeply regretful of what happened and i apologize hermione had said this all in one breath and everyone seemed to be hanging onto her every word when she finished everyone looked like they felt guilty for ever thinking hermione had been the culprit in the first place ron was surprised with himself for thinking she could ve done something like that to them hermione adored his family and his friends she cared about them all and she cared about him he could appreciate that love even if it was just as a friend of course we accept your apology hermione mrs weasley said teary eyed i so sorry for blaming you dear i should ve known better soon everyone came to forgive her and apologize themselves who was the old bat that did this anyway the assistant editor who was it fred inquired well if you must know it was pansy parkinson hemione explained everyone wrinkled their noses at her name a troll if i ever saw one george said yes well i glad you ve all been so forgiving i should really get going now i afraid i terribly late to have dinner with seamus and he made a reservation and everything bye hermione said and instead of flooing she apparated ron stared solidly at the spot she d been standing in she was going to go have a charming little dinner with seamus he had been hoping to ask her out to dinner tonight as friends of course if it had not been for the fact that ron knew full well seamus didnthave an engagement ring yet he would ve thought he was going to propose ron wondered how long he could stall seamus in the engagement plans you re in a right old twist arentyou mate harry said waking ron out of his daze huh what ron said scratching his nose with hermione seamus proposing to her while you love her why dontyou tell her harry suggested what ron laughed are you crazy i canttell her she d say she didntlove me back for sure i have a feeling she d be pleased seamus isntright for her harry said simply you better stop their relationship before they get engaged because if you attempt to stop it while their engaged it only hurting all three of you and it wouldntbe very manly of you ron snorted and i suppose you know about manliness well i am the one that engaged harry said thoughtfully yeah well for you it was all peaches and cream it not like that with me and hermione ron sighed and she on a romantic getaway with him as we speak haventyou heard about your romantic getaway yet ginny said joining the conversation what ron asked mum told becky you re taking her out tonight to see the town ginny said what ron said appalled i not going oh yes you are ginny

just saying that because she was all over you ron grinned harry blushed nuh uh harry said yeah huh ron replied nuh uh yeah huh nuh uh yeah huh nuh uh yeah huh is it just me or is this getting boring

now and we just happen to bump into hermione and seamus and becky and i can join their table i sure they ll be at port key to paradise so that way i can give becky a lousy night and ruin hermione and

wreak author note i hope you all enjoyed this chapter i surprised with how many people could easily assume hermione to be so horrid although i sure most of you had a little inkling she was innocent

your wonderful reviews you compliment me all too much with your insightful and flattering reviews this is for you lindsey 31 thank you so much in about five minutes ron was looking ready to entertain the queen of england if he had to face washed clothes ironed he d also whitened his teeth with a nifty spell everyone was surprised by the mass transformation he d undertaken even mrs weasley was surprised by how tame her son could get his hair if he tried what most of them didntknow was that he wasntdoing this for becky it was all to impress hermione mrs weasley seemed so proud of him it was almost as if he d been chosen to be a prefect once again when he d headed downstairs for the first time she d looked like she was about to sprout tears at first ron felt rather self conscious about this did he look that ugly but he felt quickly reassured when she d given him a lengthy hug and frowned as he saw fred and george pretending to gag between her arms where are you taking her anyways ginny questioned eyeing her youngest brother with approval port key to paradise ron replied straightening his robes that splendid that restaurant is one of the best in britain becky very lucky ginny said with a slightly dreamy look in her eyes as if she were wishing someone would whisk her away there too ron tried to give a realistic smile but instead gave a smile that made him seem have sick port key to paradise you know i ve heard the chefs there sometimes add love potion to their recipes luna harry said firmly as if wishing she would stop what luna asked innocently it was in the wonkydunt bible harry gave her a weak smile before turning to ron so you best be going if you want to be on time ron knew he was speaking about his plan to invade seamus and hermione dinner date yes all too true bye you lot ron said in hurry he didntwant to miss the pair of them and then actually have to spend the night in becky company they gave him their farewells and wishes of good luck and his mother gave him a look that said he d better not be a disappointment for becky ron wasted no time using the floo network but quickly apparated to becky hotel some exclusive place near buckingham palace supposedly and well hidden from muggles ron popped in and was shocked to see muggles there for a whole frightful second he d feared they had noticed he apparated in but then he saw their vacant expressions as they were obviously teasing some men in an absurd outfits they were wearing tall furry black hats if that what you could call the silly hump shaped things on their heads a funny looking red coat and some trousers were also added to their wardrobe it must ve been a pain to have to wear that embarrassing outfit everyday and worse yet the men looked like they couldntmove as if the basilisk had petrified them ron might ve thought so if it was not for the fact that he d seen one of the men blink ron knew not to dawdle this was a great location for a wizarding hotel because the wizards quickly mixed in with the muggle tourists who always wore strange clothes from other countries so a few odd wizards were nothing ron made his way around the palace grounds to the gate with glistening bars he just had to figure out which one was a port key to the hotel he came to a neglected bar far on the left side and noticed a tiny scrawl written there if he had not been looking for some sign of a port key he wouldnthave noticed it it read nogard dnarg eht ron quickly drew a small mirror out of his pocket and held it up to the words it read the grand dragon ron placed his mirror back in his pocket he d found the port key bar most people would not carry a mirror in their pockets but ron wasntlike most he d learned over the years that a mirror came in handy for more than just applying make up ron grabbed the bar and felt a certain adrenaline rush as the swirls of color whirled around him soon he found himself at the the grand dragon inn and wizards and witches were scurrying every which way along with house elves ron wondered if they were paid becky was already waiting for him in the lobby and looked positively delighted to see him ren tis gud to see you once again becky said and flashed him a grin ron felt his ears go red perhaps he didntfeel about becky like he did about hermione but she was certainly beautiful enough to cause him to blush at her grins she could ve been a veela and since she was fleur friend that made the chances grow even higher yeah you too so i guess we should get going ron said itching to reach port key to paradise in time yes vould you like to floo becky suggested floo no way it ll take forever to uh to ron stammered knowing he had come very close to revealing his plan which he presumed becky would not like seeing the confused look on becky face he added flooing takes too long let apparate alvight becky said still shooting ron looks of bewilderment they reached port key to paradise in no time even though to ron it seemed all too long as they entered the restaurant which was busier than it had been the first time ron had been there he started to crane his neck for seamus and hermione becky cocked her head slightly and looked at him as if he were crazy uh i ve got a kink in my neck ron fibbed she did not seem to quite believe his answer sir may i get you a table a human waiter asked him ron looked at him and thought of how he could ask to be placed at seamus and hermione table without further confusing becky hey becky uh look ron said pointing somewhere over in the direction of a party of two people they were chatting normally and there was nothing fascinating about them erm renold vhat am i suppose to be looking at becky questioned but in spite of herself looked in the direction ron was pointing also uh ron mumbled looking around the closest thing was their waiter who was looking at ron rather expectantly and annoyed and there was another female waitress coming up carrying a large ice cream mountain ron pulled on the collar of his robe maybe this wasntthe brilliant idea he had planned renold becky said impatiently vhat iz going on in the split second that the waitress carrying the mounds of ice cream was passing by ron and becky ron foot somehow found it way in the path of the unknowing waitress and in two seconds it was a done deed becky was dripping from head to toe in ice cream sticky chocolate sauce was pouring in little drops off her usually beautiful blonde hair she looked shocked and angry but not at ron at the waitress ron had to admit he had been very clever in doing it so discreetly the waitress looked horrified at what she d done and wasnteven breathing her mouth was wide open and her eyes were popping out of their sockets becky opened her mouth to yell at her but only more ice cream came out after she d spit a good quantity out onto the floor she dared to look up at ron the waitress and the other waiter my robes becky wailed loudly what have you done to my robes becky i ll clear this all up you go to the girl bathroom to clean yourself up okay ron suggested becky looked highly affronted but trudged off to the bathroom grudgingly ron watched her knock into a tray full of crab cakes on the way evidently ice cream could blind you listen ron began urgently turning to the waiter can we please be seated with the finnigan party i afraid not sir they requested only a party of two the waiter responded oh really ron said well change it i ron weasley you know is that right well then mr weasley perhaps you d like to acknowledge the fact that here at port key to paradise we do not treat anybody differently because they are famous and nor do we condone threats the waiter replied coolly then prepare to shut yourselves down ron said dangerously you cannot shut us down the waiter snorted yes i can if i complain about what you ve done to me ron answered sir we ve done nothing to you the waiter said with a sigh oh really well what if i were to slip on this ice cream on the floor here firstly you ve got ice cream on the floor which isntvery hygienic and then you ve got me slipping on it and say i ve broken my ankle ron smirked placing a foot on the ice cream and sliding on it playfully a bit and all these people have witnessed it the waiter looked taken aback but but sir surely breaking your ankle is not worth he spluttered get me in with the finnigan party ron repeated this time in a whisper the waiter stared at him for a long moment then nodded becky joined them a while later and even though the best of the ice cream was gone she still looked a mess her hair had gone straggly and the dress robes were ruined beyond repair right just this way the waiter said weaving them through the tables when ron finally caught a glimpse of seamus and hermione he almost wished he hadn t they were holding hands and he had just whispered something in her ear that made her laugh softly it looked like they were just finishing off their appetizers so ron wasntthat far behind schedule ahem mr finnigan miss granger you have some guests the waiter said gesturing towards ron and becky both hermione and seamus looked so surprised at their arrival that they released each other hands immediately ron how er pleasant of you to join us hermione said shooting him a questioning glare yes well i thought the more the merrier eh ron said nudging becky sir what will you have the waiter asked whatever they re having is just fine ron said waving his hand renold becky whispered harshly i didntknow ve ver going to ave a duble date well we are ron explained you see in england its tradition it even says in ron paused to think of something that couldntpossibly exist in our wonkydunt bible wonkydunt bible becky asked curiously vhat iz dat very very important reading to us english ron finished what are you two talking about seamus questioned nothing just english traditions is all ron replied simply so ron this is your date hermione asked sharply and ron realized that ever since she d seen them hermione hadnttaken her eyes off becky uh yeah ron said carelessly so where are you from hermione wanted to know you ve got an accent france becky answered and it seemed she too had intently been watching hermione ah i see which school did you attend hermione shot beauxbatons the best magical school in the world becky shot back ron jaw dropped at her direct shot at hogwarts no way was beauxbatons ever going to surpass hogwarts you believe that even though hogwarts produces more students with better occupations all the ministry of magic in england has been schooled at hogwarts hermione clarified angrily i verk fer the ministry of magick en france i am un auror becky retorted now sounding angry also so you agree that the ministry of magic in france has been very discriminatory to beasts and is much more appreciative of creatures listed under beings hermione snarled it was most unlike her dontyou dare insult france becky exclaimed shooting up out of her seat all people in vicinity twisted around in their seats to get a good look at the scene she grabbed a glass of champagne and thrust it contents into hermione face hermione also rose to her feet oh that was very mature hermione shouted sarcasm dripping off her voice she snatched the glass of champagne seamus had been drinking from his hands and soon becky was once again dripping from head to toe except this time it was from champagne they both stood there glowering at each other and ron wondered what could have provoked such hate between the two women they had only just met after all seamus seemed to be thinking along the same lines because he spoke up ladies ladies please settle down everyone is staring seamus said calmly but for some reason instead of taking heed to what seamus said becky took a pie from a passing house elf and flung it at hermione she ducked it and seamus face came into full contact with lemon meringue ron felt like he was the luckiest man alive he had come tonight to launch his campaign of terror and had succeeded wonderfully without even doing a thing almost never in his wildest dreams did he think he d get the privilege of seeing seamus face splattered with pie the waiter from before hurried over to them ron was the only one who wasntan utter mess surprise surprise please leave my restaurant immediately he cried half heartedly the four of them soon found themselves being thrown out of their favorite restaurant and stood lamely in diagon alley that vas humiliating becky cried renold i am sorry but i do not vink this vill verk out ron watched her apparate and found that he did not feel one bit hurt actually he was relieved his mother may be upset but who cared he d succeeded in everything he d wanted to do tonight ron seamus said we re so sorry ron could see the concern in his face through the layers of cream thanks but it doesntmatter ron shrugged i didntlike her anyways soon a dreary silence washed over them only broken by the sudden mad laughter of hermione ron and seamus looked at her incredulously and arched their eyebrows that wasnthumiliating hermione said laughing it was bloody brilliant i haventhad that much fun in so long she ran over to the both of them and surprisingly enough ron was the one she hugged and gave a kiss on the cheek he felt so smug at that moment hermione d come to him he wondered what seamus was feeling sorry seamus hermione said looking at the shocked look on her boyfriend face but your covered in lemon meringue author note phew for a whole second i

thanks brooke monica i glad you think its funny thanks for the encouragement bethzc i happy to say i loved the last line too i happy you liked it i hope you enjoy this chappie i happy you all liked the last chappie it was fun to write because i myself have caused quite a lot of mischief just ask my mom as she gotten a large blow of it since i once put make up on her large mirror but we donttalk about that i was only five i ll have you know or maybe you should ask my dad who has had to go up and down an escalator for a large part of the day since i kept dropping money and credit cards off our apartment balcony of course i have never done it since partly because my dad threatened to take away my dollies this is where you all gasp and partly because we dontlive in an apartment anymore the list goes on but between you and me i admit i quite like being a trickster if you ve read this far into my notes well i surprised but good for you now to the story and beyond daily prophet puts rumors to rest editor hermione granger as early as last night i the prophet editor in chief hermione granger had sought out the writer of a recently published article claiming that harry potter luna lovegood and the weasleys are only to be critized for deceiving us all the writer per say was none other than pansy parkinson ex assistant editor who had infact obtained her information by manipulating all and invading a staff member privacy worst yet is that most of the information printed in the article was mostly false therefore the prophet turned not into a newspaper but a bunch of tabloids a reporter of ours was heard saying it is not my desire to have the most accomplished newspaper in the world turn into another quibbler i must take the time to say we have not anything against the quibbler but hope it is taken as a figure of speech i wish to inform you that even though the mr potter and miss lovegood are engaged they did not intend to hide it from us all they are however not needed to tell us seeing as most of us are not their family friends or have any connection to them as for the weasley story i believe it appropriate to say that anyone who has met the weasleys will know that they are perfectly happy living in the burrow which to most of them a childhood home we do not wish to reveal any of the weasleys financial status as it is not our business but i can comment that if they had indeed wished to buy their parents a new home they most certainly could ve afforded it i on behalf of everyone at the prophet apologize to anyone who felt offended or upset by the two articles mistakenly published we deeply regret our decision in hiring a witch as incompetent as miss parkinson who is now working at the daily gazette in scotland the daily prophet will most certainly not be missing her ron knew everyone would be pleased to see the article hermione had promised them publish so quickly he himself was mighty glad the whole ordeal was behind them no more worries about what would happen if he ever took hermione home for dinner weasley ron practically jumped out of his skin in shock dolferth croaker the head of the department of mysteries and ron boss was standing extremely close to his left ear and had just shouted in it ron ear was ringing in pain he had no idea why croaker did it but every time ron would be peacefully sitting in his office he would come in and shout in his damn ear to get his attention ron would ve gotten used to it if he werentso positive that it was impossible to i mean even if it happened to you everyday wouldntyou be terribly shocked if someone screeched in your ear did you want something sir ron said grumbling and trying to keep his voice polite at the same time he knew there was no point to ask after croaker shouting in his ear a million times and him asking did you want something sir all he ever got in response was just wanted to make sure you were on alert for goodness sakes what did he think ron was an auror well actually today i have a job for you weasley croaker replied causing ron to be even more shocked then when he d yelled in his ear he was still one of the youngest unspeakables and almost never had a task to think of all those rooms in the department of mysteries he d seen in fifth year and he d been to hardly any of them what is it sir ron questioned trying to keep the excitement in his voice to a minimum i want you to reorganize some vials ron could feel his heart drop in the destiny chamber particularly the soul mate area that oaf wayne hopkins knocked the shelf they re stored in to the ground while wrestling oh never mind just get the reorganizing done by tonight croaker finished and with a slightly severe look at ron left ron sighed one of his first tasks in a long while and what was it reorganizing could his life be any duller sometimes he regretted choosing the department of mysteries anyways maybe he should ve become an auror from the way harry made it sound it was quite something more action than here at least but what attracted him to become an unspeakable he would never know perhaps it was the night he d come here as a teenager being naturally curious some called it nosy he had had the urge to sneak around the place all night with its strange artifacts mysterious doors and hidden secrets it was as if all the answers to life had been held together in one place and ron wanted to know exactly what they were of course ron knew that night he couldnthave a look around because harry would ve gone berserk finally he had come here and for three years none of his questions had been answered he had reached the circular room and remembered a time when he and his friends had rampaged there the doors began to spin but ron knew which one he d have to go into each unspeakable was taught an ancient scripture and each doorknob had the name of its room written on it ron took a door to the right and found himself amongst the destiny chamber the room was entirely black except for a bunch of planets that roamed the sky in fifth year when ginny luna and himself had run in the wrong direction and ended up here it had seemed so ethereal and cool now it just seemed eerie ron knew that an aging centaur was kept in here to watch the movement of the planets to help predict the outcomes of people lives of course no one ever saw him ron guessed he must ve stayed in the shadows and the only person to see his face was croaker ron could feel himself shiver as he realized the centaur could probably see him now ron ducked as mars passed overhead and made his way over to a door that was almost invisible to the naked eye because it blended so well into the dark room as he opened it a stream of light sailed into the room giving it an even creepier feeling because it was as if the light didntreach past the door it was too scared and stopped right at the doorway he wasted no time in shutting the door behind him and finally reached the soul mate area he knew that whenever a new witch or wizard was born ministry officials always took an essence of their soul and kept it stored in this room to wait until the soul that was it other half to arrive once the second half arrived the two souls instantly mingled together to form a new sort of misty liquid a perfume if you will ron had no idea how you would take the essence of someone soul but he suspected that luna could lecture him on it he fleetingly remembered him telling her he and hermione were soul mates well there were soul mates so why not him and hermione wait whatever luna said about soul mates was rubbish she d never even been in this room before the soul mate area was full to the brim with vials of the soul essence they came in five colors gold which indicated soul mates that had gotten together and were happily off silver which indicated a soul other half had arrived and they two were intermingled bronze for the ones who still hadntfound their second half gray when a soul was either with the wrong person or alone yet without their soul mate and black those who had died without their soul mate at their side usually the vials were neatly stacked on the shelves but obviously hopkins had done a tremendous job on knocking them over since most of them were on the ground all five colors jumbled together one of the shelves had been knocked over too and ron tiredly went to pick it up well time to reorganize perhaps next i ll do a little laundry and dishes and while i at it become a housewife ron sighed loudly he was trying to make the situation funny but he had to face it it was just boring he picked up a silver vial with the name eddie carmichael written on it he placed it on the second shelf and started towards a black vial with the name victoria frobisher placed on it ron stared at it grimly poor girl died without ever getting hooked with her soul mate that could just as easily be you ron thought and cringed he was no nearer to meeting his soul mate than he had when he d been born ron tried to push that happy thought to the back of his mind and concentrate on the vials he picked up another black one this one said sirius black he let his finger trace the name he d always liked sirius thought he was a rather fun bloke it was almost a shock to see the vial of him here it was still a surprise to think that such an alive person had passed on died without love how could anyone say that about sirius so many of them had loved him and grieved at his funeral ron remembered it was the first time he d ever cried since he was five and fred and george turned his teddy bear into a spider but he guessed that sometimes life was unfair even to the good people to cheer himself up a bit he chose to pick up a golden vial this one said george weasley he smiled gently to himself he would definitely have to ask his brother about that it took ron most of his workday to sort though all the fallen vials finally all that was left were four gray ones he picked up the first of them and was shocked to see seamus finnigan on it seamus was with the wrong person now that was a thinker ron mind started to work fast if seamus wasntmeant to be with hermione than why was ron helping him propose to her ron quickly grabbed up another vial neville longbottom neville it was interesting but not the name he wanted to see right now at last the final two vials read out ron weasley and hermione granger he felt a surge of happiness burst through him maybe just maybe he and hermione were soul mates of course it could all be some big coincidence and they both could have different soul mates among the hundreds of other grays but one thing still remained the same hermione and seamus were most definitely not soul mates ron laughed to himself thinking that he would ve saved himself a lot of time if he had only taken heed to luna this was final then not that he had a problem with seamus but he just couldnthelp him get hermione if they were not meant to be he d done it well he hadntdone it but he d done something else that he could not say he was proud of he knew he had promised himself to abandon helping seamus he knew he had promised himself to tell hermione the truth he also knew that he shouldnthave helped seamus buy the final engagement ring for the big proposal ron couldnthave helped it if he tried it was a beautiful classy ring exactly what hermione would ve dreamed of a thin silver ring with a large diamond with little clusters of smaller diamonds around it he would ve loved to give it to her but now thanks to his big mouth he couldn t seamus had called an hour after he had gotten back from work and had practically begged ron to aid him in the ring search ron was very hesitant to agree but in the end decided they possibly couldntfind the perfect ring today could they after all they hadntbeen searching very long but there it was in rina and row s beautifully set on top of a velvet cushion he was appalled at himself for not noticing it before it was so perfect for her and he had clumsily told seamus so taking ron word for it seamus had bought it without a second thought and now here he was moping moping because hermione would end up with the perfect ring and he wasntthe one giving it to her now he would be worried worried every time they went out seamus could ask her whenever he wanted to and there was nothing ron could do to stop him he couldntconstantly watch them he d just have to die alone is all he pictured a young unspeakable sorting through the vials one day and finding a black one with the name ron weasley it was an all too vivid image so he quickly decided to drown it out at the leaky cauldron with a couple of drinks and good looking witches maybe gina would be there as well the leaky cauldron was dank and dodgy at night a replica of the hog head in london you were sure to pick up on good folks but also suspicious characters tonight it was extra busy and the magical community was mostly drunk or in the process of it harry and lee jordan had to drag ron out of the leaky cauldron with him kicking and screaming all the way we dontwant you to make a mistake by sleeping with some witch harry shouted angrily partially because ron had attempted to bite him dontyou understand i ve already made the biggest mistake of my life ron retorted giving a hard fight i let hermione go oh she got these pretty eyes you know they re all nice and brown like mud and i l l love her ron hiccuped and started to weep hard harry looked up at lee jordan seriously you go on harry said softly i ll make sure he gets home alright lee shot harry a doubtful look but only nodded and staggered back off into the pub i guess i ll have to tell my girlfriend your not giving her that autograph today lee mumbled absentmindedly ron harry sighed grabbing ron arm and pulling it over his own shoulder and limply dragging him along beside him you either have to tell hermione how you feel or get over her you cantjust drown out your feelings ron looked at him feebly why not what harry said staring at him blankly just because you can t ron kept staring at harry why not its not the way people function it not the way they get over things harry responded why not cause they know it isnthealthy why not it just isn t stop asking me so many questions harry growled growing frustrated and when did you get so philosophic anyway with all your why nots why not ron repeated wait have you just been repeating the same thing for the past few minutes because you dontknow what i talking about harry spat ron giggled and nodded ron harry exclaimed what is wrong with you these a days you ve become such a low life sleeping with all these witches drinking way too much and god knows what else what have you got to say for yourself your eyes light up when you re mad like green baubles your eyes look very pretty when your mad too ron said causing himself to go into a fit of giggles harry watched him and almost understood what hermione meant in seventh year when she said that he and ron were immature he would ve rolled his eyes at this moment if he hadntthought it would be pulling too much of a hermione ron looked up at harry and kept giggling in between fits of laughter he would utter the words pretty eyes or green jewels harry eyed him nervously we better get you home quick before you try to sleep with me author note phew done well school started and i not that far behind on updating i sorry if it seemed long to some i hope you liked this chapter it was more on ron work life there something i know i

woo i happy to see i didntfail you guys miserably or anything i hope i wontdo it now i glad you all enjoyed the vials and the ending with harry and ron i ve been feeling down lately so hearing from you all has cheered me up considerably the owl looked like it had been scraping at ron window for at least an hour and it gave him an indignant hoot as it swooped in angrily the owl landed on an armchair and ruffled its feathers and studied ron carefully he didntknow if an owl could narrow its eyes but this one seemed to be doing so no need to be mad at me ron grumbled i was in the shower the owl gave a loud screech that made goosebumps form all along his arm he jumped back a few paces and stared at a mirror in the front foyer of his flat moist beads of water were still gently dripping from his redhead he reached up and gave his hair a shake water splattered everywhere including the owl it gave another deafening screech that made ron knock over an umbrella jar it smashed into large chunky pieces and ron looked up once again at his reflection on the water splattered mirror his face had grown pale over the days and there were bags under his eyes it was most unlike him to look so old damned love ron had been constantly worrying about hermione getting engaged at any moment every time he d heard she and seamus had gone out his heart seemed to stop but for some odd reason seamus seemed in no hurry to propose he should have thought this was brilliant but somehow it only made things worse hermione getting engaged would settle the matter once and for all it would mean what ron had dreaded for a long time she would no longer be open for the taking in the case of that happening ron wouldnthave to stress anymore sure he would be heartbroken and deeply regretful of not getting her before but it would have to be better than it was now now ron was always in a fret and didntknow what to do half the time he wished to shout it out to the world that he loved and always would love hermione granger but at other times he just nagged himself to stay quiet and let them both get on with their lives he turned away from the mirror and stared at the broken shards of the umbrella jar it was almost like looking at his life broken apart messed up reparo the jumble of pieces flew back together and the umbrella jar stood before him good as new if only he could put his life back together that way the owl let out another loud screech and ron missed breaking the umbrella jar again by mere inches will you shut up he snapped i taking the letter alright the owl seemed to understand because it stuck out the leg with the letter attached to it but turned it head as if ron had upset it but getting mad ignoring this factor ron untied the letter and noticed it had a green seal from the daily prophet stamped on it deciding it was from hermione he ripped it open quickly dear mr weasley we at the daily prophet would like to have you invited to an interview at our headquarters at 3120 diagon alley london as you realize we recently mistakenly published a bogus article about you and your family and we have hoped you read our article of apology however we believe that a new article featuring an interview with you will replenish any wrongful impressions the public may have your reporter will be miss daphne greengrass and our editor in chief miss hermione granger will supervise the interview the photographer in question will be mister colin creevey if you wish to change any of the planned staff assisting you in your interview please notify us as soon as possible if you do not agree to participate in our interview please owl floo or apparate and cancel your interview which is currently set for five o clock on the dot today signed laura madley daily prophet client affairs specialist candidate for assistant editor ron wrapped the letter up and smiled for not apparent reason hermione will be there that was a good enough reason for him to show up and take the interview without goofing off he leaned against the wall and stared straight at her name at a time he d frowned every time he heard it but now just hearing a word like it made him feel like all the wind had been blown out of him the owl screeched once again making ron leaps backwards and knock over the umbrella jar just as ron was sitting down to lunch croaker walked into his office panicking ron saw him and immediately covered his ears with his hands weasley what are you doing croaker demanded nothing sir ron mumbled lowered his hands he had just realized how much he d probably resembled a dolt weasley croaker shouted leaning into ron ear the moment he d left it unguarded ron glared at him why did he always have to do that did you want something sir ron asked as usual trying not to wince just wanted to make sure to were on alert croaker started ron turned back to his lunch and began stuffing some chicken in his mouth and and ron said in a muffled voice through all the chicken this was the second time this week croaker actually had something to say to him close your mouth weasley croaker growled and you ve got a letter from who ron questioned suddenly worried the only other time someone sent him a letter at work was when ginny got hexed badly on the job he had had to go to st mungo and stay there overnight i dontruddy know from who weasley i not your secretary croaker shouted yes sir i know sir ron replied croaker grumbled under his breath and tossed ron the letter he waited until croaker was out of the room and he could no longer hear his footsteps stomping down the hall to tear the letter open the letter was from none other than hermione dear ron make sure you dontportray that we share a relationship outside anything professional i ll explain about it later to you love hermione ron couldntsay he understood but he decided he d have to go along with it anyways what did it matter when she wrote love hermione he flooed to the daily prophet headquarters about ten minutes late hermione daphne greengrass and colin were all standing there each of them looking rather impatient although colin looked more excited than upset as soon as ron stepped out of the fireplace colin began flashing pictures ron barely had time to blink when colin shot another picture then another then another colin you re wasting your film hermione scolded holding both arms on her hips uh right hermione colin said shooting her a shifty look as if he werentabout to cease taking frantic pictures of ron good afternoon daphne greengrass greeted coldly she had a slightly pinched look about her as if she had lived her whole life in a spur of winter her skin was pale practically gray her eyes looked more red than brown and her dark hair fell over her bony shoulders the only perturbing thing about her was her red lips as if they had been dyed by some scarlet substance same to you ron responded just as coolly welcome to the daily prophet headquarters hermione smiled looking at ron as if she had never met him hello miss erm granger is it ron asked trying to keep up the act yes hermione clarified unnecessarily she reached out her hand and ron took it and they began shaking hands ron stared at her face and kept grinning at her she was so darn cute when she tried act as if she didntknow him suddenly he found her closing the gap between them while still holding his hand he felt his ears go red and his face warm up let go of my hand you ve been holding onto it for at least two minutes hermione hissed even though she d managed to keep her mouth shut blushing even more ron released her hand and coughed quietly he noticed daphne staring at him with raised eyebrows and gave another uncomfortable cough he didnthave to worry about making the situation seem unsuspicious to both daphne and hermione because colin camera began clicking away creevey daphne said you re blinding us all with your silly camera colin looked crestfallen but managed to smile weakly daphne only sniffed in response shall we go to the interview room hermione suggested as they walked down the hall colin still had to skip to keep up with ron long strides have you seen harry lately colin said sounding a bit too eager i suppose i have to donti we both work at the ministry ron replied simply do d yeh think he d ever let me have a photography session with him colin asked hopefully i dontknow maybe ron yawned he had a feeling harry would rather die than have a photo session with anyone let alone colin does he ever mention me ever colin wanted to know why was it that colin voice was still high pitched and squeaky sometimes ron replied truthfully he remembered harry saying colin could really be a pain in the neck at times wow he really amazing isnthe colin sighed please creevey why dontyou just go lick the soles of potter shoes daphne sniffed colin fell silent and ron had to admit that he was grateful to daphne for shutting colin up even though it was rudely done here we are hermione said pushing open the door to a luxurious room with comfy blood red furniture paintings of the first generation of daily prophet staff were placed accordingly throughout the room ron noticed various drinks were placed on top of a finely furnished table he released a low whistle whoa you guys go all out for people you interview ron said blinking whisky hermione inquired please ron nodded hermione handed him a large glass of whisky and his eyes caught sight of some nuts cashews evidently the daily prophet really did their homework he noticed other very specific drinks around the table hermione gulped some gillywater and ron saw her knuckles go white as she gripped her armchair tightly colin started chugging down a butterbeer and tapping the table daphne sipped some red liquid from a tiny crystal glass oddly enough ron couldntpinpoint what the drink exactly was it was most uncharacteristic for him seeing as he d drunk every drink there was what have you got there ron questioned gesturing towards her glass blood daphne responded ron coughed up all the whisky in his mouth blood ron gasped causing colin to take a picture he stared at hermione for an explanation she only shook her head in a pitying way and continued to drink her gillywater i a vampire daphne simpered she turned her glass a bit causing the blood to create a mini whirlpool ron studied the glass carefully he almost felt sick looking at it is it human blood ron asked almost afraid of the answer he blanched for a second as colin shot another blinding picture daphne eyes glinted dangerously of course it human blood do you expect me to drink the blood of an animal vampires are not vulgar barbarians we only drink the blood of only the foulest living thing humans ron wasntsure whether to be offended or not hermione and colin seemed indifferent to daphne comment so he decided to follow their example he found himself curious to know as to how daphne obtained the blood after thinking it through he decided he d feel a lot safer if he didntknow well if we re done with the chit chat then i think we ought to start the interview daphne said placing the glass of blood on the table she dusted off her hands even though she didntneed to and grabbed a quick quill and parchment out of a red purse with ugly boil like things on it hermione also set down her drink and glanced between them thoughtfully colin camera started flashing away like mad he quickly ceased after receiving a deadly glare from daphne so weasley tell us about your job do you like it daphne questioned loudly as if she were insulting him somehow erm ron looked at hermione for support but she showed no signs of help i think it cool if that what you mean everyone at the ministry nice ron began nervously so are you saying you like your job daphne asked as if he were admitting to some filthy deed yeah ron responded slightly dumbfounded i ve heard from sources at the leaky cauldron that you often complain about your job you claim there not enough action involved thinking of taking up the auror business like your good friend potter daphne shot making ron feel as if he were on trial well come on everyone complains about their job i actually planning on being an unspeakable for all of the future for myself i can see ron answered trying to keep cool he was beginning to understand why hermione hadntwanted daphne to figure out she and him shared a friendship daphne was sure to use that to her benefit somehow she was like the next rita skeeter fine daphne said looking him up and down do you keep in touch with any of your old friends from hogwarts yeah i do ron replied to choose his words carefully was key really daphne said shooting a furtive look towards hermione hermione immediately tensed and looked at ron carefully you and our hermione were quite the pair best friends in your days werentyou daphne smirked i suppose we were ron said slowly i was at hogwarts myself at the time a slytherin daphne continued and i always heard the darnest rumors about you two well obviously they werenttrue ron muttered through clenched teeth daphne arched a skeptical eyebrow so do you have a girlfriend daphne asked lightly taking her glass off the table and lifting it to her lips after she lowered it ron noticed some of the blood remained on her bottom lip her tongue slipped out of her cherry cherub mouth and licked the blood ron found it strangely entrancing no i don t ron clarified quietly would you like one daphne added demandingly which guy wouldn t ron went on he found himself somehow unable to take his eyes off her lips how far would you go to get one daphne asked twirling a finger through her hair as far as it takes ron said in a voice unlike his it sounded mature and detached from his body could vampires possibly hypnotize their victims or maybe daphne was half veela because she was beginning to look mysteriously beautiful so far that you would actually steal your friend girlfriend daphne questioned ye daphne hermione yelped suddenly interrupting ron midway through him saying yes ron was grateful to her for saving his neck from saying something stupid he had a feeling daphne knew more about him then she let on you cannot accuse our guests of criminating acts especially when you haventshown any evidence beforehand to your editor in chief hermione explained sounding as if she had read up on a book about things you couldn t do at the daily prophet ron had suspected daphne to retort something back but instead she hung her head in shame he had not known her for long but he could guess that having her bow down to someone was not the usual but apparently she respected hermione enough to abide by her rules yes sorry mione daphne sighed just trying to get a good story never undermine your integrity for a good story hermione tutted as if she were daphne mother even though both ladies were fairly young colin started flashing more pictures of ron apparently now that the other two ladies were busy he felt free to take pictures of ron like crazy he tried hard not to look the camera lense in the eye since he was already sure he d need glasses from all the times he d had to blink away those annoying green dots colin hermione said scalding him with her cut through air voice will you stop that how many times do i have to tell you it a waste of film colin nodded glumly but kept his finger on the button ok weasley shall we get into some more questions daphne supplied the coldness in her voice had returned it seemed that she still didntrespect him ron found himself in awe at how much they all appreciated and respected hermione she was like the queen of the daily prophet argh he was disgusted by how smitten he was by her now how often do you and potter keep in touch colin flashed at least three pictures in the span of less than five minutes author note hi sorry if the chapter was short or something i wa nted to add something else in here but that ll have to wait till the next chappie where things start to get more serious but it ll be fun to write nonetheless and fun to read i hope i hope you all liked this chapter even though it
