 disclaimer ok i dontown harry potter or any characters or places from the book hope u enjoy my story hermione stood slightly shocked as she entered the hogwarts entrance hall it had been nearly 15 years since she had been anywhere near this place after the war she had left the order and her family and friends behind to forget the things that had happened not that she wanted to forget ron or harry or the wizarding world but she did want to forget a few two to be more precise that she thought she could never forgive she however could not forget either of them but she never regretted the reason why flashback it was the year after they had graduated from hogwarts and the end of the war the order were having a party at grimmuld place celebrating the freedom the wizard world now had from voldermort hermione apparated there with her fianc he was the handsome slytherin turned spy for the order blaise zabini hermione ron shouted drunkenly come dance with me and harry and she was pulled away by her two drunk best friends shortly after ten minutes she noticed ginny sitting alone on the couch ginny she asked what wrong ginny began to sob and said something so quiet hermione didnteven hear her what ginny you have to speak up i cant hear you hermione said loudly ginny looked at her best friend tears running down her face harry wants to go on a break he said we should experience our life more rather then settle down now she continued to sob hermione looked at her other drunken friend harry was laughing and dancing with molly weasley come on ginny just forget about him hermione said hugging her tightly let me get you something to drink the next time hermione saw ginny that night she was drunk and in bed with blaise she apparated out of grimmuld place tears streaming down her face leaving harry and the rest of the order in shock hermione had kept in contact with ron but shut everyone else out of her new life in america especially when she found out she was pregnant now fifteen years later she was here after ron had talked her into taking a teaching job at hogwarts she looked at her daughter she was fifteen and looked almost identical to hermione when she was that age except for hair her daughter hair had always been a constant reminder of blaise while hermione herself had bushy chestnut coloured hair her daughter had inherited her fathers dark loose curls mom are you sure you want to do this i mean we could just apparate back home no one would ever know her daughter said alex hermione smiled slightly you cantapparate in and out of hogwarts and yes i do want to do this i have to face my old life some time hermione granger a familiar voice said hermione turned around and saw her old potions professor professor snape she stepped forward this is my daughter alex hermione after everything we ve been through just call me servus he said embracing the younger teacher in a hug we ve missed you he whispered as he hugged her while they had been in the order hermione and professor snape had become close friends although hermione could never bring herself to call him anything other than professor snape dumbledore asked me to show you both to your rooms and i sure harry and ron are dying to see you he said as he picked up their bags flashback harry she wrote on the parchment i pregnant please donttell anyone not even ron i dontknow what to do i scared from hermione a couple of day later ron and harry had both apparated to new york to where hermione was staying the place only the two of them know about hermione opened the door and saw ron face harry she said i told you not to tell any one he didnttell me the red head boy answered before harry had a chance to i read the letter by mistake what are you going to do i i dontknow she answered choking slightly we want you to come back with us you can move in with me since harry moving out ron said taking his best friends hand hermione looked up and looked quickly at both of her two friends what why where is harry going she asked harry gave his red headed friend daggers i m i moving in with he began before trailing off with who hermione asked stepping back she already knew the answer he had forgiven ginny she never went back with them to london refusing to talk to harry ron visited her almost every month and was there when she gave birth to alex she was glad he was there knowing that ron would always keep her secret he became alex guardian just in case hermione had said and as far as she knew harry never told any one where she was or that she now had a daughter snape showed them to their rooms they were beautifully decorated hermione in red and gold with alex in dark purple purple she exclaimed when she saw her room how did they know well i always did have a knack for remembering the unimportant information a voice they both knew said from the doorway uncle ron alex screamed hugging him oh i think this time it was the important information hermione said as joined the two in a hug as they broke apart hermione saw ron family she knew a lot about them letting ron tell only them of her whereabouts and about her daughter ron his wife a muggle born witch was jessica and they had a son paul who was a year younger than alex hermione took an immediate liking to them jessica it seemed had grown up in the same area as hermione had but her parents sent her to hogwarts international the american sister school of hogwarts her and ron had met a few years after hermione had left and fell in love marrying soon after hermione jessica said hugging the witch how was the trip it was fine hermione replied as the two witches let go of each other how are things here ron hasntbeing driving you mad has he jessica laughed no but i think paul been driving him crazy asking about when you two were going to get here yea it so we could go the party paul said suddenly turning to alex you ll get to meet everyone my gran and my uncles and all your mum old friends what party hermione asked frowning turning to ron and jessica uh um well you see mum found out you were coming back from dumbledore i think and she said you deserved a party but i dumbledore no one knows about alex ron replied giving his son daggers and everyone will be there fred george your parents everyone form the order hermione continued quietly everyone um yea most people ron said looking at the ground alex came and stood next to her mother grabbing her hand mum you donthave to go you know i sure they d understand if we didntgo hermione smiled sometimes she wondered if alex was really her daughter no alex we should go i mean you only know uncle ron and aunt jess so maybe it time for you to meet the rest of your extended family she slowly jessica smiled great she said it starts at 8 00 in the great hall dontworry the term doesntstart until next week it just and some of the other teachers she looked at her watch the guest will be arriving in soon ron come on we have to finish setting up she looked around for her son but he had disappeared god when i catch paul se began as alex started to giggle as they watch them walk down the hallway hermione stood outside the great hall it was 7 45pm she was always early she looked down at the green silk camisole and black pants that alex had picked for her to wear maybe im a little over dressed she thought turning to head back to changed hermione she heard two loud voices shout she turned back towards the entrance and saw her favourite set of weasley s identical twin brothers fred and george fred george she smiled as they both hugged her at the same time as they let go she saw that alex had also entered the hall boy there is some one i want you to meet she very very special so that means you can not play any jokes on her hermione said but that doesntmean i canthelp them play jokes on other people alex said with a mischievous grin on her face right mum fred eyes widened while george smiled wow you exactly like your mother george began but she never wanted to help us pull any pranks this could be fun they both hugged the younger girl before george hugged hermione again ron told me he whispered into her ear i never told anyone else though ti happened by mistake a couple of years ago hermione just hugged him tighter thank you she whispered back the four of them entered the hall together with hermione being engulfed in hugs and questions about her daughter and where she was no one ever asked her why she left she knew they all understood but she did notice that harry was there alone harry she said her voice a little choked i sorry harry hugged her tightly dontworry about it you had a right to be mad at me i mean i think i would have been mad at you if you had forgiven blaise so easily he said choking a little too it was the first time some one had mentioned blaise that night at least to hermione and she was surprised with her self for feeling hurt that he had not shown up so um where ginny she asked surprising herself with the question harry looked at her shocked she um she didntknow she wanted to let you settle in first before she you know talked to you oh hermione said sounding a little disappointed what wrong with me she thought i dontcare that she not here are you sure a different voice asked maybe your ready to forgive her she here in the castle i mean harry said she teaches here too i mean if you wanted to see her i could take you to our room hermione just nodded oh my god what am i doing she thought as she followed harry into the entrance hall hermione a voice said quietly as the two made their way up the staircase hermione turned around and almost fainted even though it hurt for him not to be there she never expected for him to turn up mum alex said coming in to the hall fred and george said they d show me all the secret passages hermione looked up at blaise as he looked at alex then back at her she knew he knew suddenly she ran she didntknow where she was going she didntcare and she just didntwant to see blaise not now mum where are you going alex called after her as she made her way up the stairs i ll find her blaise muttered pushing past alex she glared at the man she had never seen him before but she knew who he was and she hated the fact that he could still hurt her mother a n i hope you like the story this is my first hp fan fic please r r and tell me if you like or if i should change some things or if you even want me to continue thanx disclaimer yep u already know that i dontown harry potter hey thanks for the great reviews again heres chapter 10 alex woke the nest morning to find an owl tapping at the window closest to her bed she wass surprised to find that the owl was holding a letter which appeared to be from her best friends she was surprised considering that georgie had never bothered to reply after the first letter alex had sent her asking for her help not that i need it know i ve screwed everything up she thought as she untied the letter and watched as the brown owl flew off she decide to get ready for her first class and read the letter during breakfast so she showered and changed into her hogwarts uniform and was leaving as the other girls were just waking up she sat alone at the gryffindor table and began to eat her breakfast when she remembered the letter she had shoved into the robe of her pocket she pulled it out and ripped it open hey alex georgie says sorry for not replying to your last letter but she said she wanted to talk to you about when you come here dontworry she hasnttold me what going on anyway dontworry about your mum just enjoy spending time with your dad i cantwait til you come back everyone misses you so much ok so it just me and georgie that miss you d but classes especially music has been so weird without you anyway i got to finish this now because i have heaps of homework that old laide gave us that i haventstarted yet missing you heaps from logan she read the boy messy writing and smiled to herself then she noticed the p s p s when you visit you have to make sure you introduce me to your new hot english girl friends this time she felt the smile on her face as she folded the letter and put it back in her pocket what you so happy about draco malfoy asked her as he sat across from her and picked up a piece of toast she looked at the boy and noticed how silver his eyes were nothing malfoy she replied and continued to eat her breakfast draco however didntgive up ha had watched her as she was reading the letter and he had guessed it was from this so called boyfriend she had in new york so granger tell me what do you miss from your old school he asked taking another bite from his toast alex looked at him well first of all malfoy its alex not granger and second of all why would you even care she asked him back i dontcare i just interested he paused if you want me to call you alex you have to call me draco only my friends call me malfoy friends alex asked sarcastically yeah those people your mother pays to hang around you he said calmly not understanding why anyone particularly riley would like or even want to kiss this girl they sat there in silence so are you going to answer my question he asked and alex looked at him which one he sighed clearly frustrated he knew she knew which question what do you miss from your old school he repeated oh that question she said faking surprise i guess i miss the location it was right in the idle of the city only the muggles couldntsee it and it was always busy and the classes i defiantly miss my old music class hogwarts doesntteach music then she got up and went to leave what about your friends draco asked urgently before she stepped away from the table draco you asked what i missed not who i missed she stated before heading to her history of magic class as riley and nicole entered the great hall great alex thought now i have to spend the morning with the guy who my mum is sleeping with riley barely heard a word professor walker had said during his history of magic class it wasntthat he had trouble concentrating it was the fact that alex was sitting directly in front of him to the left he had the perfect view of her but she still wasnttalking to him he didntunderstand what he had done wrong he never tried to kiss her again luckily he had stopped himself before he did but he didntget it no scratch that he didntget her he didntget why show as mad at him after he hadntdone anything maybe that was it he thought as he watched her twirl a curl around her finger maybe she wanted me to kiss her he shook his head she didn t she didntlike riley she already had one boyfriend he watched as she continued to twirl the curl around her finger she wasntlistening either and he could tell from the slightly dreamy look she had on her face that riley had come to known aver the last week before he realised the class was over he continued to watch her as she stood up and packed her books away before she hurried out of the classroom with his cousin as he was packing his bag he noticed a small light blue notebook lying under the desk alex had been sitting at picking it up he shoved it in his bag hoping that when he returned it to her he could apologise and they could be friends again later that night riley was in the library he hadntseen alex since their potions class but even then he hadnthad the chance to talk to her because she was so busy talking to her father and sam but by now he had forgotten that he had her blue book and as he emptied his bag on the table it fell to the floor revealing the neat handwriting written in bright pink ink he knew it was her s he had seen her writing in it when he met her in the owlry and he knew he shouldntof read it but he couldnthelp it it didntseem to be a diary just a notebook where she scribbled things which appeared to be for poems or music there always someone laughing from the corner of their cage but to fly amongst the mountains you must dance within the waves he continued to read cause what you see is crystal wall what you breath is silver air turning the page he found the most recent things she had written in ther dated from a couple of days ago maybe i just living out the same old stories in and out but you know that dontmake it easier it funny how the times that seem unbearable are the ones that you dontever want to end and when your childhood slips away you find you face a brand new day and you know it cantbe the same again hearing footsteps he quickly closed the book and shoved it back in his bag before opening his hogwarts a history alex had searched her entire dorm and common room for her blue notebook she didntfind it so she decided to check her classrooms from that day incase she had left it behind by mistake secretly she was devastated that she couldntfind the book with the fear that someone else might ve been reading it contents sure it wasnther diary she didntbelieve in keeping diaries but it was her writing her music of course she had never finished a single song that she had started but she had never let anyone read it not even georgie eventually not finding it alex decided to make her way to the library where she had briefly stopped after he last lesson before she got there though she heard two familiar voices one of which said her name quickly she stepped behind a statue of a hippogriff and a dog as sam and nicole actually stopped incredibly close to it they were so close alex could clearly hear their conversation so do you really think we d be able to break them up sam asked sam we donteven know if this logan guy her boyfriend she heard nicole voice reply i know but you know draco once he get an idea he wont stop until he finished it besides it is kind of obvious that she likes potter so maybe we should just let draco do his thing sam replied slightly muffled alex peered through the gap between the hippogriff wings and saw that she was tying her shoe up yeah but what if she doesntactually like him i dontwant to be responsible for the break up of her and her boyfriend nicole said as they started to leave alex waited until they had left before she stepped out from behind the statue and sat at the base of it boyfriend me logan she thought to herself once their words had sunk in fully she frowned as she tried to work out what was going on suddenly she realised what the three of them were trying to do great just what i need friends who are trying to help she rolled her eyes as she continued her way to the library riley was pretending to read his book as alex entered the library neither of them noticed each other at first alex began to look under the tables and armchairs in search for her book when she came to the table riley was reading at riley she said and he looked up yeah he asked her over the top of his book oh um nothing she said and began to walk off hey alex he called out i found this it thought it was yours he pulled the book out his bag and handed threw it to her she caught it and riley noticed the slightly horrified look on her face oh yeah thanks and with that riley watched her exit the library blaise and hermione had been in his office a meeting together for at least an hour now and hermione was frustrated from the lack of attention blaise was paying to it blaise we need all this sorted before we can take the students to fascino quas she stated looking up from the paper she was writing on he looked at her the trip is still two weeks away she sighed and continued to write as he just sat there not doing anything ok tomorrow i will go down to hogsmeade and drop the list of to fred and george she began i already dropped it off on saturday he interrupted her right then she looked at the man well i guess we could organise a meeting with the students again this friday to let them know all the details blaise nodded absentmindedly blaise what wrong she sighed nothing he said looking at her surprised she raised her eyebrows giving him a look that said tell me because i know something is up fine he began i was just thinking about alex alex hermione asked what did she spend all your money on the weekend blaise ignored the sarcasm in her voice and shook his head she what fifteen right he asked and hermione nodded so that means she you know interested in boys he trailed off not believing he was telling his ex fianc he didntwant boys near his daughter if they werentfriends whose logan he asked grinning slightly she replied logan i think that alex sex crazed boyfriend she watched as blaise paled she laughed blaise i kidding logan is well i guess logan is sort of like her brother she stopped as the colour came back into blaise face elizabeth georgie and logan mother was one of the few people i was actually friends with in new york she english but moved to america after her husband was killed by a group of death eaters she gave birth to georgie and logan the same day i had alex the three of became best friends and went to school together they were pretty much the only other family we had besides ron and jess oh was blaise reply hermione stood up well i think this is all we can do tonight i ll talk to dumbledore tomorrow about the portkey s she said as blaise stood aswell it funny isntit she said as she walked toward the door what is blaise asked confused how easy worrying about her comes she called over her shoulder and headed back to her own office out of the dungeons riley returned to the gryffindor common room at a late hour she was so late that nearly all of the students had gone to bed except for a few 7th years and a dark haired girl who was quietly writing in her blue notebook she looked up as riley entered the common room and watched as he looked at her before he made his way toward the boy dormitories riley she called out softly not wanting to disturb anyone he turned around and went and sat in the chair next to hers i sorry she said before he could say anything you do know what their trying to do dontyou he looked at her with his bright green eyes who he asked draco sam and nicole she began i heard them well i heard nicole and sam they were talking about trying to get us me and you she pointed to each of them together but you have a boyfriend riley said wishing he didn t why does everybody think that logan is not my boyfriend that just she shuddered you donthave a boyfriend he asked no i don t she stated they both sat there in silence well what do you want to do about draco and sam and nicole then alex finally asked him he shrugged i can talk to draco and tell him to drop it he said staring up okay alex said riley couldnthelp but notice the slight look of disappointment on her face as she too stood up good night riley she said as she made her way toward the girls dorm night alex he said as he watched her disappear up the stairs before he too disappeared into his own dorm hermione stepped into her dark office and lit the candles with a flick of her wand before sitting down at her desk this was when she noticed the letter which had not been on her desk last time she was in her it was a folded piece of black parchment and as she unfolded it she read the silver writing you better watch yourself your daughter too you filthy mudblood she dropped the parchment when she heard a knock on the door it was harry hermione he said i now it late but i had this great idea for the kids trip they sat on either side of the desk what that he asked seeing the piece of black parchment hermione who was quiet shaken by the letter burst into tears as harry picked it up and read it to himself right he said as he walked around the desk and hugged hermione i think we need to see dumbledore and with grabbing her hand he led hermione to dumbledore office professor dumbledore harry began as the headmaster entered his office with his pyjamas on i sorry to wake you but this letter it was in hermione office he put the black parchment on the headmaster desk and waited as the now very old headmaster read what it said it is quite alright that you woke me as i will not tolerate anything like this in hogwarts not now not ever he said and looked at hermione hermione dear do you know who could have sent this to you hermione shook her head no i found it in my office after i finished the meeting with blaise bout the trip right well harry i ask that you watch hermione and the people around her until we find out who sent his letter dumbledore said turning to the defence against the dark arts teacher what about alex hermione asked the mentioned her too dontworry we wont let anything happen to her and i sure once we let blaise know he will protect her like it was his own life harry said squeezing the witch hand tightly before dumbledore could speak harry right blaise will do anything he can to make sure neither you or alex will get hurt dumbledore added standing up and showing them out of his office but tonight i think it would b best if you did not stay by yourself maybe you could stay with her harry once they had left his office hermione looked at her old friend harry you donthave to stay with me i ll be fine she said hoping she sounded more confident and brave than she felt he shook his head no ginny would kill me if i left you alone they entered her room to find the same message form the black parchment written across the wall now and he room trashed hermione could fell harry anger from where he was standing hermione i think it would be best if you stayed in mine and ginny room i can sleep on the couch i sure ginny wontmind sharing a bed with you he said as calmly as he could hermione simply nodded and grabbed some of her things before she let harry take her back to the room he shared with his wife ginny he said as they entered the room i need to see dumbledore hermione needs to stay here tonight i ll be back shortly he kissed his wife on the cheek before she could say anything and left hermione what happened she asked hugging her as hermione burst into tears again and explained everything that happened to her sister like friend both of the witches were asleep on the bed before harry had returned before harry had gone to see dumbledore he had gone to get ron who he instructed to get blaise and meet him at hermione room as the headmaster entered hermione room he waited in the corridor for the two other men harry blaise began as he entered the corridor with the red headman what happened is she alright blaise she fine i ve left her with ginny he began as the headmaster exited her room i just thought you should know sinceit says something about alex too what he asked as he paled harry what going ron asked someone is threatening professor granger and her daughter mr weasley dumbledore said threatening why blaise asked who who it is and why they are doing it we do not know he aid looking at the potions teacher but we know that both alex and hermione may be in danger a n so that the new chapter ok so maybe most of it was boring but can anyone guess who wrote the note please rad and review and hopeful i ll write the next chapter before the weekend luv emgurl disclaimer still dontown harry potter hey thanks again for all the great reviews and i sorry about the grammar and spelling and stuff in the last chapter but i typed it at school and didnthave a disk or usb and the email system was down so i couldntsend it home so i decided just to upload it at the end of the lesson if i have time i ll go back and fix it hermione woke late the next morning not realising where she was once she worked out she was in harry and ginny room she remembered the note from the night before and what someone had done to her room then she remembered it was a tuesday and she had lessons to teach she quickly showered and dressed in her friend bathroom and as she entered the bedroom she found harry waiting in there harry she said sharply you could have woken me i ve already missed my first lesson hermione relax harry said giving her a small smile dumbledore said that after last night you could have today off oh she said softly has have you does alex know harry looked at her and shook his head blaise wasntsure if you wanted her to know he trailed off as hermione began to speak quickly no i don t i mean she would just worry does dumbledore know who did it she asked changing the subject harry shook his head again no we ve been trying to think of who it might have been but we dontknow who would want to do that to you hermione nodded unsure as how to reply to harry she didntknow who would do that to her now sure fifteen years ago she would have immediately said it was malfoy or any slytherin but things were different now the last she had heard of malfoy was during the war when he had disappeared sure his son was friends with her daughter but hermione still knew nothing new about the man who used to terrorise her fifteen years ago and a slytherin she had fallen in love with a slytherin and many of them had either disappeared during the war or fought with the order fifteen years and a war changed a lot blaise had finished his first lesson of the day and didnthave another until after lunch he hadntbeen able to concentrate in teaching the students barely having any sleep from the night before with snape taking control throughout most of the lesson why dontyou just go and see her snape had told him and pushed him out of classroom before he could reply now blaise only option was to go see how she was he made his way toward her classroom before remembering dumbledore had told them it would have been better if she didnthave to worry about classes that day so instead he changed his direction and began to make his way toward the potter rooms as he made his way up the steps he heard a familiar voice call out to him he turned to see his daughter make her way quickly up the stairs behind him with nicole weasley following slowly behind alex blaise said softly they still hadnttold her and blaise wasntsure if hermione even wanted her to know how are you yeah i good she replied frowning slightly at he formalness of her fathers behaviour i was just wondering if you knew where mum was she wasntat breakfast this morning and we had professor brown for charms this morning is she ok she said the last part so fast that blaise could barely make out what she had actually said i sure she fine a deep voice said before blaise could reply blaise turned to see professor walker standing at the top of the stairs yeah she just had to go into hogsmeade to organise something for the trip next week blaise added hoping alex couldnttell when he was lying oh ok well if you see her could you tell her i just wanted to talk she replied before making her way back down the stairs with nicole blaise watched them until they had completely disappeared from his view when he turned he found professor walker still waiting for him at the top of the stairs professor walker is there anything i can do for you he asked not sure what the man wanted he simply hook his head please call me ben i just figured you were going to see hermione so i though i d go with you since i was heading that way aswell oh was all blaise could reply with he knew they ben walker and hermione were interested in each other he had seen them in hogsmeade but had cleverly tried to avoid them he just didntknow how he would feel being in the same room with both of them at the same time actually ben he began i was just going to see professor weasley he been having a bit of trouble with some of the furniture in his class rooms so he asked me if i knew of a potion to help him i was just going to have a look at it he muttered before walking off in the opposite direction of the other professor harry had left hermione alone in the room if you need anything i sure ginny will be back before lunch he had said she was startled when she heard the knock on the door she was sure that since it would have only been ginny she would have just entered the room unsure and still remembering the images of her room from the night before hermione opened the door only just enough to see who was standing on the outside it was a grinning ben walker she let out a gasp of relief and moved to open the door wider to let him in ben she began softly feeling a small amount of disappointment in her stomach hermione he interrupted her are you all right when ron told me this morning i felt so mad i wanted to come and see you but i had my lesson i sorry i couldntcome earlier hermione shook her head it alright she began but was cut off when he kissed her he pulled the witch closer holding her around the waist as she wrapped her arms around his neck they broke apart when ginny opened the door hermione oh sorry she said quickly closing the door again ben watched as hermione blushed and stepped back from him before she could speak he had kissed her on the cheek and gone off to his next lesson hermione ginny spoke as she re entered her room after watching the blonde man hurry off what was that she let out a laugh when she saw her friends bright ed face but hermione wasntlistening to her what was that she asked herself silently before realising ginny was still watching her um gin i think i going to go see dumbledore she said instead of replying to the red haired witch after blaise had sent he blonde professor on his way to see hermione he had every intention of actually going to see ron weasley like he had told him but instead blaise began to wonder eventually he found himself in the library in the exact spot he had first kissed hermione to be exact he sat in the closet armchair and remembered how things were back in their last year he remembered the way hermione used to smell when they would sit in the library the way their bodies fit together perfectly then he remembered how he had ruined everything that one stupid night he remembered the way hermione had looked at ben when he had seen them in hogsmeade blaise a soft voice said from behind him he turned his head around to see hermione standing there looking quite pale hermione he said and stood up how are you feeling hermione sat in the chair beside him and waited for him to sit back down again before she replied i guess i okay she said looking only at her hands when blaise didntreply she looked up to see him nodding he stoped when their eyes met and quickly looked away have you been to see dumbledore yet he asked this time it was his turn to look when she didntreply she didntmove or speak instead she only watched the man what he finally asked snapping away from her trance hermione muttered a simple nothing before standing up i guess i should go see dumbledore then see you later she said before exiting the library hermione waited in dumbledore office replaying what had happened with ben walker in her mind sure she liked him but when he kissed her it had shocked her and it didntmake her feel anything not the way she used to feel something when blaise kissed her even though it had been fifteen years since they had ever been that close hermione could still remember the way her stomach would do a little flip when he pulled her closer the way his lips would brush softly against her skin the way she felt every emotion when he held her she didntfeel any of this with ben she only felt safe in knowing that he would look after her but she had ron and now harry to look after her and alex now that she had come back sitting in dumbledore office hermione realised she was still fully in love with blaise and wanted to be with him hermione dumbledore said as he finally entered his office snapping her out of her thoughts hermione stood and smiled weakly at the headmaster i sorry professor i ve just realised that i have somewhere else to be she began dumbledore simply nodded with a look of understanding in his eyes hermione please come see me before nightfall at least she nodded before quickly running down the steps into the great hall hermione rushed into the great hall and tripped over feeling two arms grab her before she hit the ground she let out a gasp of relief and found that it was ben walker who had caught her careful beautiful he said grinning as he lifted her up we dontwant you to get hurt now do we he didntlet go of her waist and hermione looked blankly at him what he grinned do i have something on my face he removed one hand to touch his face but by now hermione wasntlooking at him she was looking behind him at the man who was standing at the bottom of the staircase the man she had been looking for it was the end of the day and blaise had not been back to any of his lessons he knew snape would understand so he didntworry about it after seeing hermione in the library he had taken to walking throughout the castle once again not looking for a place anywhere in particular to go to he ran into ginny weasley who although they were friends was a little bit off with him after seeing her he had decided to return to his room in the dungeons that was when he saw them together he was halfway through walking down the steps into the great hall and she had come out from dumbledore office where she had tripped and ben walker the gentleman that he was had been there to save her blaise felt a stab of both anger and sadness as he watched hermione being held by the other professor he knew he hadntbeen seen and he tried to quietly move down the stairs and pass through the great hall down in to the dungeons as if he was unnoticeable blaise a soft voice came as he tried to go unseen he didntlook up preferring to pretend he did not hear his name next he heard footsteps come toward him before they stopped this time he did look up to see that hermione was halfway across the great hall but had been stopped by the other professor when he had talked to her blaise didntstop to listen or even to wait until they had finished talking instead he continued on his way down to the dungeons and into his own room hermione had tried to talk to blaise but it was impossible with him ignoring her when she called out to him and stupid ben walker not letting go of her after watching blaise disappear into the dungeons she realised that ben was still talking to her so i was wondering if you wanted to go to the first quidditch game with me this week end i believe it between ravenclaw and slytherin he asked her hermione frowned and tried to step away from his hands which were on her waist i cantben i have things to organise for the trip she lied as he grabbed her hand he dropped her hand and looked at her coldly ok maybe another time then he replied before stalking off hermione watched him leave unsure as wether to follow him and say that she would go or just leave it she decided to leave it instead she began to make her way down into the dungeons she knew it was probably a bad idea considering they still didntknow who left the note yet but she needed to see blaise and she needed to see him now she quickly walked to the potions classroom knowing that blaise office and bedroom was near by she came to his door and went to knock but stopped herself when she heard tow voices coming from inside the room they were muffled so hermione could not hear what they were saying but she could recognise blaise voice immediately as the second voice belonged to a woman blaise had returned to his room to find he had been flooed by none other than his best friends wife lydia malfoy ah blaise finally i ve been flooing in and out all day but you never seemed to be here the voice from the blonde woman came from the fireplace i ve been busy he simply replied sitting in the chair opposite so that his view into the fireplace was not obstructed what can i do for you the voice from the fireplace began to talk well you see narcissa wants us to join her for christmas this year but draco kind of told her we were staying with you with the kids so now she wants to know if she could use the manor over christmas and draco had no choice but to tell her yes which means we have no where to stay with the kids for christmas she trailed off and you want to know if you can stay at my place blaise finished off for her and she nodded well lil i dontactually know if i going to stay at hogwarts this year but yes i guess you could stay at my place over christmas he said suddenly feeling very tired oh blaise thank you i swear one day i will kill draco for doing things like this but you would have to be there too i mean it wouldntbe right if we stayed there without you she looked at the man from the fireplace blaise what wrong nothing i fine he replied blaise you cantlie but if you dontwant to talk i ll leave it thanks lil oh can you tell draco i ll probably be around after halloween we can talk more about christmas then he said and watched as the blonde head disappeared hermione disappeared out of the dungeons and back into dumbledore office after hearing the voices in blaise room sure she hadntheard what they were talking abut but it was a woman voice she heard and she didntreally want to know who it belonged to ahh hermione back so soon dumbledore asked as he entered the waiting room to his office hermione simply stood and followed the headmaster into his main office choosing not to reply to his question well hermione dumbledore spoke as they both sat at his desk i think that until we can figure out who it is that is sending you theses notes yes notes two more turned up in your class room today causing professor brown to cast charms on both her classes you will need to stay in a room where we can watch you obviously our wards have been broken and that is how the intruder managed to get into your room in the first place so i think that it would be better if you shared a room with another teacher hermione stared at her teacher professor i cantshare a room with harry and ginny it isntfair on them dumbledore laughed and shook his head no i wouldntwant you to share a room with them either i am still yet to run this idea past the professor i have in mind but once i have i will let you know straight away now i believe it time for diner would you like to escort me to the great hall professor granger dumbledore asked standing up motioning for hermione to do the same a n ok there the next chapter once again i though it was a bit boring and hopefully next chapter i ll more of alex and her friends aswell as blaise and hermione read and review luv emgurl disclaimer yep still dontown harry or anything else but the plot hey thanks for the great reviews again and yes i do realise that it has become kind of obvious about who is sending the notes but i have never been very good at keeping secrets hope you enjoy the next chapter by friday hermione had been given a new room it was adjoining to professor snape s in the dungeons she had agreed with dumbledore to keep the location of the room a secret telling only harry and ginny and ron and jessica and as much as she didntwant to they told alex at first alex had been shocked but then angry as she promised her mother that she would not tell anyone of what was going on alex had of course wanted hermione to tell blaise where she was staying but hermione couldn t for some reason she just couldntface blaise at the moment and she didntknow why well actually she knew why but she was afraid that if she saw him or was alone with him then she would just blurt it out and scare him off until she got things sorted she was fine with being less than friends with blaise then afterwards he would have to deal with being only friends with him alex had kept her promise to her mother and had not told anyone what was happening to her family the only problem now was that she had also promised she wouldntwalk around the castle alone meaning she had to stay in gryffindor tower or with her friends all the time by saturday she was going crazy she sighed but continued to write in her blue book as nicole and draco played a game of exploding snap sam literally entered the common room with a bounce and sat with draco hey has anyone seen riley she asked brightly and when neither nicole nor draco replied alex looked up to find them staring at her what she asked you seen riley draco asked eyeing her carefully not wanting to make her made or uncomfortable well let see i ve been here in the common room with you and nikki for the whole afternoon do you think i ve seen riley she replied she was really getting sick of the three of them and riley had said he was going to talk to them oh yeah right he muttered before turning back to the card game and alex turned back to her writing alex couldntconcentrate on what she was writing and had written the same three words over at least ten times screw this she thought i ll go crazy if i stay here so without a word to the three playing the exploding card game alex stood and swiftly exited the gryffindor common room alex made her way to the astronomy tower and was disappointed to find it empty and as it was now getting quite cold at night she left almost straight away instead choosing to go and visit her father she wondered slowly through the corridors of hogwarts until she came to the main stair case although now that she was there she had no desire to venture into the cold dungeons even if it was to see her father instead alex continued to walk through the castle corridors soon she found herself near the defence against the dark arts classroom and was startled when a door opened oh alex i thought i could hear someone walking around ginny potter said as she looked out from the open door um yeah i just felt like going for a walk i d been in the tower all day so alex trailed off as riley came and stood behind his mother ginny weasley suddenly felt a wave of sympathy for the young girl do you want to come in she asked her we have hot chocolate knowing it would be extremely rude if alex ignored the invitation she followed the two redheads into the cosy room she sat in a big armchair and began to look at the pictures that had been placed all over the mantle place and coffee table a silver and black frame caught her attention from the three people moving inside of it she picked it up and looked closely at it she guessed riley would have been seven or eight and was trying very hard to get out of his parents reach ginny looked very much the same and was struggling to hold onto the small boy harry riley father was only grinning at his wife while tickling his son causing him to run away next she picked up a frame which held an older photo the picture it self wasntold enough to be in black and white but alex could tell it was more effective than if it had been printed in colour there were many people in this picture all of them teenagers they were sitting on the steps of hogwarts all of them laughing and joking with each other most of the people alex didntrecognise but she knew it had been students in the order on the higher steps sat ginny between her brother ron and harry while on the step below sat her parents alex couldnthelp but notice how happy they looked with hermione hand in his while he pushed stray hairs away from her face alex put the picture down suddenly mad with herself for thinking her parents could be the same once they met again she couldntforce people together here riley said as he handed her a mug before moving to the desk where his father was sitting alex had moved to get up but was stopped when ginny sat in the chair opposite her slowly alex took a sip from her mug and let the warm chocolate touch her tongue hows your mum she heard ginny ask her but alex simply shrugged in reply the truth was the last time she had seen her mother was with dumbledore and she hadntreally had the chance to talk to her alex looked down at her hands fidgeting with her watch you know you really shouldntbe walking around the castle by yourself alex looked up as harry spoke and sat next to his wife alex shrugged again and looked toward riley who was still seated at the desk she wasntsure if he was listening or not i can take care of myself she said just quietly enough for the two adults to hear maybe ginny replied taking her hand but i sure your mum wouldntwant you walking around by yourself no matter what the circumstances are i guess alex replied as the older woman let go of her hand she picked her warm mug up and quickly drank the remainder or the drink as she swallowed she looked at her watch i should probably go back it late she stated standing up both harry and ginny stood aswell your right it is late so that why riley will walk you back harry said grinning slightly alex waited by the door as riley hugged his parents good night i guess he doesnthate them as much as he says he does she thought to herself good night alex ginny said as riley opened the door and they both walked out into the corridor good night professor potter she called back as the door closed they walked in silence on their way back to the gryffindor tower i wonttell anyone riley said finally breaking the silence huh alex asked being broke from her thoughts tell anyone what about what happened to you mum he said quietly oh alex said biting her bottom lip thanks they continued to walk in silence until suddenly the candles began to flicker in and out that weird riley muttered to himself what alex asked stopping in the corridor what weird riley stopped too nothing well it just all the candles in the corridors are supposed to be enchanted to stay on until after the curfews which is still about an hour away he looked at his watch suddenly all the lights in the corridor flicked off leaving the two of them standing in a pitch black corridor riley he heard alex voice say panic clearly obvious in her voice he grabbed her hand hoping it would help to calm her down riley she said more urgently this time i donthave my wand i left in my room it alright he whispered as he reached into his pocket with his free hand lumos he said and the tip of his wand lit up it was so dark in the corridor the light from his wand only made enough lit for him to see the outline of alex who was now standing closer to him her hand still in his riley alex whispered what going on i don t he stopped as he heard footsteps coming from the direction they were heading before they stopped silently he began to pull her back towards his parents room they were closer to them than they were to the gryffindor tower as the footsteps behind them quickened riley pushed alex in front of himself go get my dad he said pushing the wand into her hand what about you she whispered i ll distract who ever it is just hurry he whispered back urgently as the footsteps stopped do you think they ll be all right ginny asked her husband as she changed into her pyjamas who harry asked as he pulled their quilt back alex and riley maybe one of us should have gone with them the worry clear in her voice gin they ll be fine he replied looking at his wife besides if what nicole been telling fred and george they ve probably stopped to snog each other by now harry ginny sighed as there was knock on their door what harry said as he walked toward the door we used to do it blaise and he stopped as he opened the door to reveal the young girl he had just sent off with his son alex he said seeing the panic on her face he grabbed his wand what happened were walking and then then something happened the candles went out riley made me come here he heard something he doesnthave his wand alex said breathlessly in one quick movement harry had left the room and was moving along the corridor to gryffindor tower alex went to follow but was stopped by ginny i think it would be best if you just left it to harry we dontwant you to get hurt she said taking the girls hand but instead of leading her back into the room she led alex up through some stairs where are we going alex asked urgently i taking you to dumbledore this is a short cut that the teachers use she said gently as she pushed back a tapestry and ushered alex through it it had taken ginny less than a minute to get alex to the headmasters office ron who was having a meeting with the dumbledore about his problem furniture was in there at the time and was shocked to see his little sister rushing in the office in her pyjamas with his god daughter alex granger who by the looks of it was close to tears ginerva dumbledore said as she interrupted their meeting what happened ginny explained everything that alex had told her dumbledore stood as she finished speaking ron would you please get hermione and blaise and bring them here then he turned to ginny ginny i ll send riley up aswell please keep them here until i return he left with his wand securely in his grasp riley stood completely still listening to see if the person was still following him he couldnthear anything but as he took a step forward away from the person he heard his follower take a step forward too taking a deep breath riley took another step forward this time to see a small light ahead of him dad he whispered the light stopped riley he heard his father ask into the darkness i here he quickly stepped forward noticing the person following him did not move this time harry stepped in front of his son stay behind me he muttered riley stayed in the spot behind his father as he stepped forward his wand raised acendio lightus he said the candles flickered on but not long enough for either of them to see who else was in the corridor as the lights went out riley heard the other person run riley go back to our room harry yelled back at him running after the other person halfway of riley going back to his parent room the lights came back on in the halfway he waited for them to flicker back off but this time they stayed on riley dumbledore said as he approached him your mother waiting for you in my office riley nodded and watched as the headmaster continued to walk briskly in the direction of where his father had just headed hermione was sitting at her desk in her new room it was a lot smaller than the room she had near her charms class room she sighed and looked at the pictures on her desk one was of alex the other was when she went to hogwarts with harry and ron suddenly there was a knock on the door hermione didnthave to walk far from her desk to the door and could already hear who the voices from outside her door belonged to ron i thought you said we were going to get hermione blaise said as she opened the door what going on hermione asked looking at the two men standing outside her room you need to come to dumbledore office now ron said looking at her i ll explain when we get there alex sat in a large purple armchair and watched her mother friend pace around the headmasters office she was still holding riley wand and was feeling guilty for leaving him by himself riley ginny exclaimed as alex looked up as the boy entered the office she stood but sat back down again as ginny almost suffocated him in a weasley hug before any of them could speak however ron entered the office with both hermione and blaise both fully aware of what was happening since ron couldntkeep anything secret for longer than five minutes hermione immediately headed for her daughter and hugged her tightly are you alright they didnthurt you did they which way did they go riley what were you doing out so late as alex heard so many questions and finally felt the release from her mother she knew that everything was her fault if she had of stayed in the common room then none of this would have happened i sorry she said and everyone in the room turned to look at her what for you haventdone anything wrong blaise said kneeling in front of his daughter if i hadntleft the tower then none of this would have happened she said in a small voice and looked at riley wand which she as still holding now professor potter might get hurt and it because of me alex blaise paused he didntwant to upset her even more harry and dumbledore they know what their doing this wasntyour fault he hugged his daughter who then crawled into his lap as if she was five not fifteen hermione picked the wand up that alex had now dropped and watched as she crawled into her fathers lap alex she said this isntyour wand that mine a polite voice said hermione looked up slightly startled as she remembered that ginny and her son and ron were also in the room she handed the boy his wand thanks he said stuffing it into his pocket riley did you see who it was ron asked him eagerly ron ginny snapped hermione however was more interest in riley answer than ginny yelling at her older brother but was slightly disappointed when riley finally shook his head it a he though he stated simply sitting down just as dumbledore and harry entered the office did you get him ron asked almost automatically dumbledore however did not reply and hermione felt blaise stiffen next to her the same why he would during the war when he knew there was danger near them well ron asked dumbly ron ginny hissed at him shut up dumbledore didntspeak until he sat behind his desk riley alex could you please wait outside while i talk to you parents he paused and watched as the two teenagers exited his office into his waiting room he put a piece of black parchment on the table hermione stared at recognising it to be the same that had been left in her room the person who was following your children unfortunately disappeared before either myself or harry were able to identify them hermione felt blaise stiffen again and unconsciously she put her hand on his knee blaise lent forward is he still in the castle he asked dumbledore simply nodded i believe that it would be best if the children do not return to their dorms tonight ron if you would take ginny and riley back to your room i would like you help along with harry to search the castle i ll help too professor blaise said no blaise i want you to watch hermione and alex until we know the castle is secure he replied and blaise nodded hermione who still had her hand on blaise knee gave out a sigh of relief in knowing that snape wasntgoing to be the only one watching her not that he wouldnthave been a good protector but knowing that blaise was going to protect her made her feel a lot safer dumbledore continued to talk but hermione was now too preoccupied with the way blaise had slipped his hand gently in hers she hadntrealised but the entire time she had been shaking although now she stopped when blaise squeezed it dumbledore escorted blaise hermione and alex back to the dungeons i think it would be best if you stayed in hermione room that way snape will be close aswell dumbledore told them as they walked past blaise door once inside the small room the three heard dumbledore put a locking spell on the outside blaise watched as alex scrambled into her mothers bed and fell asleep almost immediately he himself choose to sit in a small armchair and watched as hermione sat on the small couch hermione he whispered as not to wake his already sleeping daughter you should go to bed she simply shook her head in reply i not tired she whispered back they sat in silence for almost an hour before blaise finally began to speak careful to avoid her eyes he asked her the question that had been haunting for weeks now why were you going to leave me blaise what i she stopped when blaise cut her off i heard you i didntmean to it was an accident but i heard you tell ginny you were going to leave me i want to know why he said looking at her now hermione took a deep breath and looked over towards where their daughter was sleeping blaise we were young too young it wouldnthave worked out anyway she said in barely a whisper how do you know blaise asked her quietly hermione shook her head blaise i tried so many times to talk myself into not leaving you but i knew something would go wrong she looked away from him down at her hands and when that night that night with ginny happened it just made it easier for me to leave that way i could tell myself it wasntmy fault and it didnthurt so much hermione blaise said his voice cracking slightly as he moved on to the couch next to her i never meant to hurt you hermione looked up from her hands to find blaise sitting next to her his face looked so sad and hermione felt a stab of guilty for causing him the pain i know she whispered i sorry i left blaise looked at her unsure as to what she meant blaise she said moving closer to him i love you i always have i think i always will i love you too he whispered back as he pulled her closer and kissed her softly on the lips the soft kiss soon turn more passionate as both hermione and blaise realised just how much they had missed the feeling however movement from across the room caused them both to break apart each remembering their daughter was only sleeping a few metres away blaise wrapped his arm around her waist and pulled her closer to him where she rested her head against his shoulder soon both were asleep content with being in each other arms a n finally some action haha i really enjoyed writing this chapter so i hope you all enjoy reading it review and tell me what you think luv emgurl disclaimer still dontown anything you recognise hey thanks for all the great reviews i so happy you all liked that chapter anyway in reply the question one of you guys asked me i dontknow how long i ll be writing this story for i guess i ll know when it time for the end but at the moment i just having fun writing it enjoy neither alex nor riley returned to their common room or was seen by any of their friends until late sunday after noon of course since each were both in the same clothes from the previous day rumours began where they had spent the night together to the more outrageous ones where they had found the infamous three headed dog fluffy inside the castle they of course ignored most of the other students choosing to talk briefly with each other before they each disappeared into their separate dorms nicole weasley who had been watching the two since they entered was the only one he saw the small amount of fear enter her american friends eye it was a look that she had never seen in the girl alex she asked as she entered the girl dorm room jess and natalie were talking loudly across the room but nicole was still able to hear the soft reply yeah alex said coming out from the bathroom do you ah want to talk she asked her quietly so that the two other girls did not hear her about what alex asked her back knowing that she sounded fake um anything nicole replied quickly noticing that the two others were starting to listen she pulled alex back into the bathroom alex was looking in the mirror at the basin as nicole pulled the door shut she turned to look at her friend so nikki what is this important thing you want to talk about alex pretended giving her an innocent face look alex i know i haventexactly had a lot of close friends at least close girlfriends but i can tell when something is up so i dontcare if you dontwant to talk about because whether you like it or not i not going to let you leave the bathroom until you tell me what going on nicole said stepping back in front of the door alex looked down at her hands and nicole felt a sudden pang of guilt for forcing her to tell her i c canttell you alex whispered why not nicole asked gently stepping toward the girl i just cantalright alex replied her voice growing louder it nobody business except my own she tried to side step the red head to get to the door alex she said stepping g in front of her if it nobody else business then why does riley know donttell me he doesntbecause i can tell he does she said firmly alex shook her head i canttell anyone nicole frowned at the girl h he didnthurt you did he who alex asked frowning back at the girl riley nicole said he didnthurt you did he because if he did you need to tell someone nicole alex basically shouted he your cousin do you think he hurt me nicole simply shrugged some people are never what you expect she stated and alex realised she was serious no nicole riley did not hurt me he protected me from what i canttell you so will you please let me leave alex said firmly before stepping around the red head and entering the dorm room monday blaise entered the great hall a few steps behind hermione he gazed in awe as he watched her move towards the staff table and sit down he too sat but continued to watch the woman he was glad to have back in his life hermione looked up from her coffee and smiled at blaise who in return blushed slightly at being caught staring like a school boy flashback what hermione yelled crossly as she entered the living room in grimmuld place the portrait of sirius mother had yelled abusive words at her and while hermione now should have been used to it she found herself taking it out on the dark haired boy who she saw first nothing blaise said simply turning to leave how do we even know if you re with the order for all we know you could be some filthy deatheater that using us she spat at him not meaning any word she said blaise turned back around and hermione saw that both sadness and anger filled his indigo eyes believe what you want but i know what i believe and dumbledore knows what i believe he said simply taking a step toward the girl as if daring for her to say something else well i dontbelieve you she said simply daring the boy back you re a slytherin why the hell would you want to help us she knew that what she was saying wasnttrue but she couldnthelp it hermione he said taking another step forward forcing her back into a wall you know nothing about me nothing about my life nothing about my family dontpretend that you know who i am simply because i am part of the slytherin house hermione pushed him back and quickly stepped out of the room into back into the entrance hall where sirius mother started screaming at her again she took a deep breath before watching as blaise staled past her out of the family room and up the stairs into the room dumbledore had given him blaise wait she said and he stopped halfway up the stairs i sorry i guess i just used to judging people for what they appear to be like not for who they are blaise continued to walk up the stairs leaving hermione standing with the screaming portrait end of flashback wait what blaise asked listening to the end of the conversation he was supposedly having with hermione i was just saying that on thursday we need to go into hogsmeade to pick up the portkey and stuff from fred and georges she smiled but since you re not all that interested i ll just get ginny to come with me ok no i mean i ll come he quickly replied good she said standing up i thought we could have some to really catch up if you know what i mean she whispered in his ear before walking off wait where are you going blaise said standing up she turned around to my class i ll see you later she said before meeting ron at the entrance door where the two of them left together so hermione is there anything you want to tell me ron asked as he walked her to her classroom like what ron she answered hey you cantanswer my question with another you know exactly what i talking about he said as they walked past some second year ravenclaw students huh she said stopping hiding her smile from the redhead i ve got not clue ronnikins i talking about you and blaise he hissed at her blushing slightly at the use of his childhood nickname oh that she said as she pushed open her classroom door and the both entered ron watched as she sat at her desk and pulled her text books out of her bag waiting for her to continue on that it that all your going to say he asked when she didntreply hermione looked at h im pulling a stray hair behind her ear what do you want me to say ron she paused you and i both know i d be lying if i said i didnthave feelings for him i know he replied leaning against a desk in the front row but you re my best friend i just dontwant you to get hurt and leave again he went to leave as hermione stood ron she said and he turned back to face her i trust him but even if i didnti couldntleave not now that i ve come back i couldntdo that to alex just when she found her family she hugged the man besides i couldntleave my best friend again either she whispered and they broke apart and hermione watched as he exited to go to his own class and her students began to fill the classroom okay okay everyone settle down and take out your wands she said closing the door turning to the students the next few days went by slowly for alex apart from talking to riley she had exchanged few words with the other students and had not spoken to nicole since their little talk in the bathroom sunday afternoon thursday morning she was in the library when sam draco and nicole entered they immediately sat at the table she was sitting at by herself with sam and draco unaware of the tension that was surrounding alex at the time sam and draco were talking about their trip to fascino quas in between smothering each other with kisses while nicole was watching alex very closely finally when sam and draco moved to look for a book nicole spoke to her alex i sorry she said and alex looked at her i dontthink i the one you should be saying sorry to she said before turning back to her notes look i know what i said it wasntfair but it just came out before i could stop it i know riley isntlike that he got friggin weasley blood in him after all she paused and took a deep breath preparing for what she was about to say next you just you looked so scared and i just you re the first real friend i ve ever had alex and when i saw how scared you looked i though the worst thought the worst of what riley asked as he too joined them at the table um nothing nicole replied going bright red no really what he asked looking closely at the two girls nicole here was just telling me about a dream she had alex added in brightly trying to close the subject oh really what was it about he asked interested um a giant rabbit chasing her through a jungle shooting cockroaches at her she lied before standing up but now she going to show me her cool costume for the halloween ball she pulled the redhead girl out of the library with her once they were out in the library nicole stopped and looked at alex what alex asked her brightly where are we going she asked her quietly to the gryffindor tower she replied so me and you were ok nicole asked the sound of uncertainty in her voice alex nodded i cantreally blame you for saying what you did i mean i canttell you what going since i not really sure myself but if i was in your position i guess i would have thought the worst too nicole embraced her in a hug so why are we going to the tower exactly then she asked as they broke apart to do exactly what i told your cousin your going to show me your costume that will make all the boys ignore all the other girls in the room she said laughing as she skipped ahead of the open mouthed red head girl alex you know that not going to happen she replied as she caught up with her and gave the fat lady the password to hell it isn t she said laughing still as she climbed through the portrait hole i think i already know of one guy who will love you thursday evening blaise and hermione were sitting in the same caf that he had visited with his daughter they were eating in silence but a comfortable silence and blaise couldnthelp but keeping looking up to check that she was actually there having dreamed of this many nights blaise she said finally her eyes laughing slightly why do you keep looking at me i not going to run away huh blaise responded oh i was just thinking how nice you look not that you dontlook nice the rest of the time just tonight you look particularly nice beautiful infact he covered up oh really beautiful she asked taking a sip from her wine raising one eyebrow beautiful like always he said confidently taking her hand as she blushed blaise hermione fred weasley voice filled the air what a surprise the two twins stood at the table dumbledore said you d be in to get the stuff today he never said you d be on a date though did he george fred asking teasing them george who was standing slightly behind his brother simply shook his head and mouthed sorry to hermione who giggled and stood up well actually we were just coming to see you guy now she said as blaise said placing some money on the table but if your going to be here awhile i guess we could pick up the portkey first she grabbed blaise hand leaving the twins standing in the middle of the caf once outside hermione shivered before puling blaise close to her covering his mouth with hers she kissed him passionately wrapping her arms around his neck finally he responded and deepened the kiss wrapping his own arms around her waist pulling her closer to his body what was that for blaise whispered against her cheek as they finally broke apart well first of all fred is still watching us from the window she paused kissing him softly secondly do i need a reason he shook his head and kissed her again i think we should get those portkey now or else fred will never get to eat hermione whispered to him wrapping his arm around her waist as they headed away from the caf friday morning the gryffindor students woke with excitement but none more than alex who was looking forward to seeing her best friends in a few hours by the end of lunch al the students were waiting patiently in the great hall alex who was sitting with sam and nicole are you sure you dontwant to get changed she asked them for the tenth time i mean new york is cold but not as cold as here she finished looking at the two girls both were wearing jeans with thick jumpers scarves and while alex herself simply had on jeans a pink tee shirt and a red knee length coat with a thin black scarf besides she said pointedly were not even going to be outside today they re probably going to port key us into their hall or somewhere like that alex were fine sam replied while nicole rolled her eyes back finally hermione and harry entered the great hall with blaise and jessica following closely behind each were carrying what appeared to be the portkey the students were travelling by the students stopped talking ass blaise began to address them okay i glad to see that everyone is here he paused as you know we will be travelling by portkey s you will be divided into your year levels then again into two groups professor granger and myself will activate our portkey first taking the first years the second years will then follow and so on until only the seventh years are left where professor potter and professor weasley will accompany them alex groaned slightly at the thought of travelling by portkey what wrong riley asked her as they began to get in to their year levels nothing i just dontlike using portkey s she stated as her aunt jess began to give out the portkey s only minutes later alex and the rest of her year level were forming two groups each group had their own portkey and as she place her finger on the old boot she felt the familiar tug at the navel seconds later she was on the floor actually she was on top of some one who was on the floor hey riley said as alex helped him up you okay she nodded blushing slightly sorry about that no problem he replied welcome to fascino quas a short blonde woman called out to them a n ok there the chapter hopefully i ll have more very soon review luv emgurl disclaimer still dontown harry or any other characters from the book see i said i d have the next chapter up soon welcome to fascino quas the short blonde woman repeated as the rest of the gryffindor students appeared finally alex realised they were standing in the ball room of her old school something she had not noticed before from being too distracted by the person behind her i am professor dokoft the headmistress here she paused as both hermione and blaise made their way to the front where she was standing we are glad that you have joined us for the week the students began to talk amongst themselves as the four hogwarts teachers spoke with the headmistress that the headmaster alex heard draco ask she didntbother to reply to him though carefully looking around at the familiar room they were standing in she moved her way over to the window and looked out at the muggle building that was surrounding the school while the muggles couldntsee the building itself it was in the middle of the city and surrounded by much higher skyscrapers wow riley said and alex looked up unaware that he had followed her to the window i ve never seen so many buildings all together before yeah alex replied turning back to look out the window again it one thing i missed waking up to the lights of new york its beautiful at night and in the morning when georgie used to make me get up ok everyone settle down hermione voice rang through the ballroom and alex and riley returned to their small group of friends professor dokoft has just informed us that the students are still in lesson however rooms in each house have set aside for us with your luggage already being taken there she paused and watched as the blonde headmaster exited the room the first and second years will be staying in the rutilus house with professor weasley blaise continued the third and fourth years will be staying in the croceus house with professor granger and the fifth sixth and seventh years will be staying in the niveus house with professor potter and myself however we will not be able to enter the houses until after diner tonight once we have received the passwords until then you are free to either stay here or explore the castle however you are not to interrupt the classes that are taking place hermione finished off and most of the students began talking again suddenly chars appeared in the ballroom and most of the students began to sit down so draco said as he sat down this school is kind of crap draco shut up sam hissed at him looking at alex oh yeah right he paused so are you going to sit down he said pointedly to alex nicole and riley riley and nicole sat down but alex ignored him i going for a walk she said and began to walk toward the door where are you going riley called out to her standing up following her out of th ballroom to find some people she said stopping to let him catch up but your mum she said everyone was in class he said as they continued to walk riley it friday afternoon believe me when i tell you that my friends will not be in class she said giving him a small smile we just have to find them gee i wonder where they re going draco smirked as he watched riley and alex exit the ballroom shut up malfoy nicole said turning towards him i think we should just forget about the plan why it going to work he replied how do you know draco i mean they both already know about it riley told you they both know sam said letting of his hand maybe nicole right maybe we should just let them work things out themselves both girls waited for draco to exploding response fine he said simply but you cantstop me from giving them a little push can you what did you do sam asked as nicole turned to talk to her younger bothers and cousin paul nothing he paused i mean i canthelp it if riley costume accidentally got switched can i he smirked the four teachers were sitting at a small table that harry had conjured drinking coffee in the large ballroom watching the students most of them had chosen to stay in there rather than explore the castle harry your wrong italy are going to win the world cup this year england donthave a chance blaise said as he and harry continued on their quidditch conversation hermione sighed and drank her coffee as jess laughed at them it just like watching ron and paul argue she told hermione hermione smiled remembering the way harry and ron used to fight over quidditch something never change she replied hermione and jess continued talking sharing stories about ron until hermione heard her name in harry and blaise conversation careful to continue the conversation with jess she began to listen to the conversation the two men were having just dontdo anything stupid this time she heard harry say softly obviously he had forgiven blaise and blamed ginny equally for what had happened she doesntdeserve her heart to be broken again i know harry blaise said quietly you know if i could take back anything ti would be that night out of the corner of her eye hermione saw harry nod are you sure you know where your going riley asked alex as they turned to walk up yet another set of stairs riley i went to school here for four years it think i know where i going she said as they go to the top of the stairs he followed her as the came to a door and alex but her hand on the knob to open it maybe i should go back to the ballroom that way you can catch up with your friend riley stated before alex could open the door she let go of the silver handle and shook her head why you re my friend aswell besides if i didntwant you to come with me then i would have told you she said and wen tot open the door again besides do you know how to get back she smiled and pushed the door open as alex pulled riley inside he found he was standing in a room that looked similar to the gryffindor common room but there was no way near as much furniture it being replaced with a series of musical instruments and only three other students were in the room the boys and a girl none of which yet noticed the two hogwarts students alex took a moment to take in her three friends all of whom seemed to look that little bit different logan who was sitting at a desk with headphones seemed to look that little bit taller to alex with his blonde hair looking closer to brown he was scribbling quickly on a piece of paper the other boy was leaning against the couch with the girl leaning on his shoulder deep in conversation georgie who was wearing her dark purple school robes open was wearing her usual black jeans and bright red t shirt still looked the same to alex although her blonde ringlets were slightly shorter and there seem to be a sparkle in her eyes the boy charlie seemed taller with his brown hair looking longer and messier finally logan looked up from his paper noticing his friend and the redhead boy smiling he stood up which caused charlie and georgie to stop their conversation and look at what the boy was looking at georgie screamed and practically knocked alex over by jumping on her oh my god alex i missed you so much she squealed as the two girls hugged i ve missed you too she said so you and charlie huh she whispered in the blonde girls ear shut up she replied as they broke apart i was going to tell you georgie get off her logan said as he hugged the girl how are you logie i ve missed you too i good though u she asked using his nickname from when they were younger oh you know just getting grossed out by my sister and best friend he said laughing slightly although alex could tell he was being serious finally once all the hugs were over and finished with alex remembered riley who had stepped back when georgie jumped on alex this is riley she said grabbing his hand pulling him forward this is logan georgie and charlie she said pointing to each of them individually still holding his hand logan noticing that they were holding hands suddenly became the protective brother purposefully shaking his hand pulling him away from alex making him sit at the table arentyou harry potter son charlie asked joining them at the table as georgie and alex began talking on the floor yeah why riley asked getting defensive no reason he shrugged and riley felt logan looking at him alex has talked a lot about you and your sister he said pausing she really missed yo both logan grunted in reply and began writing again as riley and charlie both sat in awkward silence i dontthink logan likes me going out with charlie georgie whispered to alex on the floor charlie said he doesnttalk to him any more gee i wonder why alex replied pretending to thin for a moment maybe because he sister and his best friend are shagging each other alex georgie said hitting her on the shoulder i kidding alex said laughing so hows your little problem going georgie asked her quietly glancing at the three boys what problem alex asked innocently come off it alex you now what i talking about she said your right i do but nothing happened were just friends alex replied looking at riley really why were you holding hands then georgie asked her teasingly what when alex hissed confused as to what she was accusing her of before didntyou see logan he went all brotherly and pulled him away from you you should feel lucky you have logan to look out for you she explained with a hint of sarcasm whatever were just friends alex said standing up moving towards the instruments where kimmie and brain she asked moving away from the smirking georgie charlie shrugged i dunno they should be here soon though logan said we have practise oh alex replied i guess me and riley should leave then no stay practise hasntbeen very good since you left i mean georgie cantsing for crap compared to you right charlie logan asked and charlie nodded as georgie slapped them playfully on the back of the head hey she complained practise riley asked um yeah i used to be in a band here with these three and kimmie and brian you dontmind staying do ya alex asked sitting next to riley he shook his head as the door opened and two arguing voices filled the room they haventchanged logan whispered to her as they watched the black headed girl yell at the boy who was getting angrier by the second yup they still hate each other georgie giggled they continued to watch them for a couple more minutes neither of them noticing the other people finally when kimmie threw her bag on the couch logan coughed and they both looked at the table where they were sitting alex brain asked when did you get here about an hour ago she said standing up hugging both of them how are you fine kimmie answered and brian said good both gave each other daggers um this is riley alex said quickly before they began arguing again he my friend from hogwarts hey kimmie said smiling at him as brian simply gave him a nod riley nodded back in return as the three other teenagers stood up from the table alex is going to practise with us today logan said as he picked up a guitar charlie sat behind the set of drums as kimmie moved behind the piano and brian and georgie both picked up their own guitars are you sure you dontmind alex asked riley as he moved to watch them from the couch i mean we could just go back to the ballroom and hang with draco and nikki nah it ok i want to watch riley replied as she moved behind where the microphone stand was riley watched as kimmie began to press the keys on the piano while charlie began a soft beat on the drums soon all five instruments were playing and alex was singing into the microphone in the ballroom the gryffindor students were getting restless but none of them wanted to leave the ballroom soon harry stood up and announced that in half an hour they would be moving into the great hall to have dinner with the other students which seemed to relax the hogwarts student a bit as harry sat down he realised that he had not seen his son the entire after noon hey hermione you haventseen riley have you ginny will kill me if something happens to him harry muttered to the witch looking away from blaise she scanned the room unable to find neither the redhead boy nor her own daughter he probably with alex she said she probably went to find the twins the twins blaise questioned her yeah georgie and logan hermione said smiling they re inseparable when their together so she lucky her year were put in the niveus house although harry you might have a little trouble sometimes they like to act like fred george great harry said rolling his eyes and jess laughed after five songs alex sat down next to riley and watched as logan gave them a guitar solo looking down at her watch which she had adjusted earlier she saw that it was almost dinnertime riley i think we should go back to the ballroom she said and stood up we ll see you guys later she shouted at her friends as she pulled riley back towards the ball room i didntknow you could sing riley said as they neared the ballroom alex shrugged i play the piano too she said i bet if you asked dumbledore he d set some kind of program up for you at hogwarts he said seriously as they entered the great hall waving to her father who seemed to be watching the door she turned to riley why would i want to do that she asked him well you just seem to enjoy it and we donthave music at hogwarts so i figured you would miss it too he replied as the moved towards where draco sam nicole and some other guys from their year were i guess alex replied as she sat next to nicole and their conversation ended as nicole asked her where she had been all this time and alex went into detail about how she had seen her friends so you and granger were gone for a while draco smirked as riley sat next to him still watching alex get up to anything interesting draco leave him alone sam said as riley realised what he meant draco i ve already told you were just friends he said draco muttered something that riley could have sworn was for the moment anyway but chose to ignore him the gryffindor students all stood with their black hogwarts robes over their clothes out the front of fascino quas great hall waiting for professor dokoft to let them in you are to sit in the house that you have been assigned to hermione reminded them as the doors opened the fascino quas students all turned towards the door as the hogwarts students entered alex waved to kimmie and charlie who were sitting at the rutilus table while brian was sitting with a group of boys alex tried to ignore at the croceus she lead her friends to the final table where logan and georgie were sitting under a white a silver banner the niveus table as they sat she introduced draco sam and nicole to georgie and logan before any of them could continue a conversation professor dokoft spoke to the students we hope you hogwarts enjoy your stay as much as we enjoy having you here the blonde witch paused and smiled over the next week you will be experiencing the classes that fascino quas offers i believe many of them are similar to the ones that hogwarts offers young witches and wizards however here we also offer classes of the arts hopefully you will enjoy them thursday night the halloween ball will be held in the great ballroom i believe that the hogwarts teachers have organised a few treats fro you while some of our own drama students will be providing you with some entertainment at the beginning of the night she paused and glanced at the hogwarts teachers friday afternoon the hogwarts students will return to their school and during the first week back after christmas the rutilus house will join hogwarts for a week but now please enjoy the feast she sat and the food appeared on the table while the students began to talk hey alex riley said look at jess and natalie alex looked toward the two girls both were desperately trying to get a particular boy attention but this time it wasntriley it was logan alex looked at logan who wasntexactly ignoring the other two girls he was just too preoccupied in his own thoughts that and he was watching nicole weasley intently i think it her vela blood riley whispered as he noticed the way logan was gazing at his cousin it might be alex said grinning at him or he could think she hot she winked at riley before turning to join the conversation that georgie and draco were having about quidditch a n ok there the next chapter hope you like it read and review please luv emgurl disclaimer still dontown anything from the book hey ok to stop the confusion it is jess weasley which is ron wife in the story that is the professor weasley that went to fascino quas with them the next morning hermione woke to the sounds of new york as she climbed out of bed and dressed she sighed as she remembered her apartment and the things she still had to work out here once entering the croceus common room she found that many of the third and fourth years had already moved to the great hall for breakfast with the fascino quas students remembering that is was infact a saturday morning she slowly made her way down the building admiring the way the interior had been decorated i with both traditional and modern pieces final reaching the bottom floor hermione took her hand off the stainless steel railing and headed toward the equilevent of the hogwarts great hall let me get that blaise said as he stepped towards her coming out of a lower corridor how are you this morning he kissed her gently on the cheek as they entered the hall i fine blaise she said looking around for her daughter you haventseen alex have i seen her you ask not this morning but i defiantly did hear her all last night infact i believe harry had to go into their common room at least three times to tell them to go to bed he replied giving her a cheeky smile i dontthink she gets that from you though oh right hermione replied distractedly they sat down with jess and harry and the other teachers from fascino quas after about ten minutes the headmistress professor dokoft came to talk with them professor granger i believe professor dumbledore said that you also have some personal business to attend to concerning your apartment while you are here as she paused hermione simply nodded and felt blaise look at her if you like you may attend to it today while the students do not need a lot of supervision or i can find a time for you later in the week when one of my own teachers will be able to watch your students no today should be fine hermione replied finally looking towards blaise as the blonde woman walked off blaise could you come with me i mean harry and jess would be fine if the kids have any problems but i dontthink they will blaise nodded in agreement before asking what about alex im mean wouldntshe want to go with you nah she said laughing a little she packed everything in her room into boxes and tried to talk me into selling the place before we even got to england i sure she wontmind if i donttake her alex and logan were both sitting on the common room floor when riley and draco woke up but instead of them going to the great hall for breakfast they were greeted by georgie who had an assortment of different food hey is jess up yet draco asked as he took some toast from georgie and sat on the floor next to alex she shook her head and returned to her conversation with logan but was interrupted when she realised that he was not actually listening to her instead he was distracted by the redheaded weasley girl who had re entered the common room after going to check on her younger brothers sliding across the green carpet to where riley was sitting alex lay against the bottom of the couch and watched her brother like friend with interest so do you think they ll have anything planned for us today riley asked not seeing what alex was watching umm i doubt it they usually let the students do whatever on the weekends she replied looking away from logan why is there something in particular you wanted to do he shook his head finally catching on to what was distracting her you know maybe you re right maybe it isnther vela blood riley i always right she said smirking standing up it something all granger women must be good at he grabbed her leg playfully as she went to walk away wrestling her to the ground tickling her oh so you think your always right he asked as she tried to crawl away from his grip he nodded why do you have a problem with that she asked giggling i might he paused for a moment giving her the chance to get away as he reached out again she threw a cushion that she almost tripped on and hit him in the face hey he yelled faking hurt which caused the other students to turn and look at them i ll get you back for that oh yeah how will you do that mr potter she laughed as she stepped behind nicole as a cushion went flying past them the cushion hit sam who at that moment chose to exit the girl dormitory ow she exclaimed throwing the cushion back towards the boys hitting draco sam he yelled back oh sorry she replied not looking as innocent as she sounded this time alex threw another cushion back at riley hitting him straight in the stomach oh just wait he said picking the cushion up and chasing her around the room with it soon they were all in a full fledge pillow fight it just on the third floor hermione told blaise as they stopped in front of what looked like to be the oldest building they had past so far nodding he followed her up the stairs until they got to room c9 surprisingly the inside of the building was quite modern and blaise realised that muggles also lived in this building he watched with interest a woman who was smuggling a dog in her handbag as hermione searched her handbag for her keys ah here they are she said finally putting them in the lock turning them until it clicked she pushed the door open and revealed her home from the last fifteen years well this is it she said as she put her handbag on the kitchen counter watching blaise reaction in all hermione was proud of her apartment in a way it showed her personality with it many bookshelves covering the walls however on half of them were filled with books with he other half being occupied with photo frames taken from the last fifteen years many were of herself and her daughter as alex grew but there were the few odd photos of them with ron jess and paul and the occasional photo of alex with georgie and logan and her other school friends above the mantle piece was a plaster of alex hand with the words happy mothers day inscribed into it which she had received the first year alex had gone to kindergarten finally blaise reacted its very you he said looking at the photos of when his daughter was a small child while hermione had exposed alex to the muggle world she had always kept her magical culture with in the house so many of the pictures were moving moving in the lounge area blaise picked up the closet frame which showed his daughter and as hermione moved closer to him she saw that it was of alex just after she had lost her front tooth grinning widely with a gap at the front the six year old alex was giggling and holding her tooth up blaise smiled but hermione could still see the sadness in his eyes for not being able to be there blaise i sorry she whispered taking his hand tearing his attention away from the other photos he looked at hermione and frowned slightly for what he asked taking her hand for not letting you have the chance to see your daughter grow up she said avoiding his eyes hermione he said taking her in his arms you did what you thought was right if i have to blame anyone i have myself to blame he kissed her forehead lightly i have her in my life now so i can just look forward to watching her future snuggling close to him hermione suddenly remembered all the home made video ron had insisted he make of alex even though he had no clue as to how to use a video camera which left hermione making most of them blaise sit down i ll be back in a second she let g of him and headed toward her bedroom where she knew the boxes were since alex had put them in there before they had left curious to what she was doing blaise did not sit down and followed her to her bedroom instead watching from the door way as she ripped open a box that read me he spoke to her hermione what are you doing he asked as she pulled the box toward the door i showing you our daughters life she answered pushing the box into his arms how ha asked eyeing the black plastic tapes suspiciously these are videos there a muggle thing you watch them on t v you remember tv from muggle studies right she said quickly moving back into the lounge room ron made me make them i think i know why now she gave him a small smile and slipped on labelled alex 8 months in the vcr and switched on the tv pulling blaise on the couch with her they watched as the picture on the screen focus on a pregnant hermione fifteen years earlier i guess ron labelled this on i was actually 8 months pregnant he said as blaise leant forward to look at the screen better i ll just change it still fascinated by the way the pictures appeared on the screen blaise did nothing as hermione ejected the tape and ron voice stopped and ejecting a knew tape as they waited for the picture to appear on the screen hermione joined blaise again on the couch this one isntas old she said as the picture of alex appeared on the screen it seemed to be only a couple of years ago and was taped by hermione as ron was in the picture as well they both standing in the apartment they were in now standing in front of a door that had a plaque that read alex as ron knocked on the door hermione voice came from the tv a letter from fascino quas has just been sent here addressed to alex finally the door opened to reveal alex in yellow pyjamas what she asked sleepily uncle ron she then asked as she realised he was there without saying a word hermione handed her a thick envelope before following her into the room the camera then zoomed in on alex as she sat on the bed and read the letter finally after five minutes ron voice filled the picture well what does it say alex looked up to the camera her mother i got in she said slowly that fantastic hermione voice exclaimed as the camera went out of focus from hermione hugging her blaise guessed the screen went black before the tape began to rewind she didntwant to go hermione said as they listened to the whizzing noise coming from the vcr it took me ages to convince her i would be alright on my won while she was at school it wasntuntil she fund out georgie and logan were going there instead of salem that she finally agreed blaise watched her as she stood and removed the second tape from the vcr thank you he said as she put the third tape in for what she asked as she sat back down with him for this he replied motioning toward the tv entwining their hands together they spent the rest of the afternoon in the small apartment watching the homemade videos during the pillow fight logan had disappeared without anyone noticing leaving her hogwarts friends with the other fascino quas students she slowly began her search for him knowing that georgie had gone to their practise room to meet charlie she figured he wouldntbe anywhere near there so instead she thought of anywhere else he might have been and then she remembered the roof the top of the building that the school occupied had been turned into a courtyard like area for the students to go to when they need time out to relax or whatever but when she went here both she and logan went to the roof to think either by themselves or sometimes they would meet each other up there that what drew alex to the astronomy tower at first it reminded her of the time she spent with logan on the roof as she pulled open the door which led to the roof she was met by the crisp cool air which caused her to tighten the belt on her red coat as she entered the courtyard she drifted around the corner to where they used to sit and watch the lights of new york logan was sitting on the bench already his black notebook lying on the cement hey she said softly as she sat next to him hey he replied glancing at her as she sat they sat in silence each remembering the countless times they had sat here together georgie thinks i hate charlie now he finally said i know alex replied still watching the view in front of her you need tot ell her you don t yeah i know wait how did you know i donthate him he questioned her she turned to face him logie you ve know charlie for almost as long as you ve known me and i can tell that deep down you know he good enough for her but because she your sister you re doing the protective brother thing he nodded i know i just dontwant her to get hurt you really think charlie would hurt her alex questioned him this time he shook his head in reply he better not he won t but if he does i ll make it my personal business to come back and hurt him back myself so you dontneed to worry about it she said seriously which caused logan to laugh so you think you ll stay in england he asked changing the subject alex nodded i like it there i mean it different from here but different is good right plus i think my mum and dad still have a thing for each other oh he replied looking out at the city gain but you know the only bad bit is not being able to see you or anyone else that here everyday she smiled as he turned back to her i d miss everyone too if i moved to a foreign country he stopped as alex grinned what well i just figured that since you liked all my friends so much you d want to visit me there anyway she replied what draco and riley i can just see myself hanging out with them he rolled his eyes back hey riley not hat bad she said defending him besides i meant nicole she watched him blush slightly so you really like him then he said trying to change the subject donttry to change the subject you wanted me to introduce you to my hot friends now i have and you really like her she said poking him playfully in the side admit it logan or i ll tell georgie alright i like her she not like any girl i ve ever met before and i didntactually think she d be so he trailed off nice fantastic gorgeous alex suggested would i be right in saying she nothing like amelia she finished off referring to his previous long time girlfriend who broke his heart at the sound of her name logan eyes darkened slightly nothing like her he admitted i know but let me warn you mr protective brother i know that even though they arentclose riley would probably hurt you if you hurt her she added plus i might have to let him hurt you too at the mention of riley name again by alex logan grinned so you really like him then he asked using he question what no we re just friends alex replied avoiding his eyes looking out to the city it was hard for her to lie to logan lex he said turning her to face him i was kidding before riley seems like a good guy but you know me i the protective brother i have to hate anyone that shows interest in you or georgie like that i really have missed you she said hugging the boy as they both began to walk toward the door to re enter the building as they entered the building logan glanced at his watch realising he was meant to be somewhere else hey lex you ll be all right by yourself i late for something he asked her stopping g halfway down the corridor yup she replied i ll be fine she watched him walk off in the opposite direction it was dusk when hermione and blaise finally left her apartment finally as the street lamps came on they neared the school stoping blaise took the witch hand and turned her towards him hermione he began as she wrapped her arms around his neck you and alex you donthave to stay at the castle for christmas i mean if you want you could stay at the manor with me gently tracing hi collarbone with her fingers hermione leaned in and kissed him gently blaise that would be fantastic she whispered against his cheek you donthave to decide straight away i mean you didnteven give me the chance to tell you the malfoy will be there he said slowly i dontcare blaise just as long as we can spend it as a family she replied looking into his eyes giving him a smile he pulled her in close kissing her forehead lightly a n o k i think that maybe i in a bit of a writing rut everything just seems a bit boring to me if anyone has any ideas that they think might help me they would be greatly appreciated anyway please review luv emgurl disclaimer still dontown harry or anything from the books cos if i did it wouldntbe on the net a n hey everyone sorry i ve taken a while to update but i ve been so busy i ve had exams for one week then i had work experience the next where i had to get up at 6 and didntget home until almost 5 at night i was buggered anyway once again thanks for the reviews you guys all had some really good ideas sunday morning it rained and alex found herself waking up earlier than normal shivering she pulled her blanket off the bed and moved into the common room in search for her socks which she had lost the previous night but to her surprise she found logan and nicole both up talking quietly on a couch quietly alex moved tried to move back into the dorm they were staying in not wanting to disturb her two friends that was until she tripped over the end of blanket ow she said as she picked herself up from the floor um sorry i was just um looking for my socks she finished as both of them looking at her logan blushing slightly she stood there for about five seconds avoiding eye contact with logan in fear of getting the giggles i ll think i ll just go back to bed well actually alex logan was just telling me about your band how come you never mentioned it before nicole asked her oblivious to either of the other two behaviour realising that nicole wasntgoing to let her go back to bed alex sat on the couch across from where the other two were sitting i don t know i guess i didntfind it important she trailed off not important nicole exclaimed according to logan here music is your dream you dontjust give up on your dreams dreams can change she replied avoiding eye contact with logan again after five minutes a figure which alex recognised as riley came out of the boys dormitory sleepily wearing only his pyjama pants silently not noticing the three sitting in the common room he walked toward the bathroom morning alex called out almost him from his trance uh morning he replied sleepily before entering the bathroom a couple of minutes later riley emerged from the bathroom completely aware that the three where waiting for him to come and when he did he was greeted by laughter from his cousin riley nicole giggled as he sat next to alex are those the pyjamas that fred and george gave you last year for your birthday yeah why he replied confused looking down at his blue and green striped pyjama pants what wrong with them nothing unless you do this nicole flicked her wand toward them which had been sitting on the table at first nothing happened at least nothing alex or logan see until riley started to squirm in his seat and then frantically scratched at his knee remember when they invented ants pants nicole asked laughing slightly she flicked her wand again and slowly riley stopped squirming standing up he headed toward his room where you going logan called after him to burn these he called back as nicole flicked her wand toward him again whose fred and george logan asked nicole as alex watched silently their my uncles she replied placing her wand on the small coffee table in front of them and they purposely give you presents like that he continued yup nicole replied well not me usually just riley paul and my brothers it funny though cos they tell me claire and stef how to activate most of the charms on the new products that they dontknow about as their conversation continued alex silently and successfully got up from the couch with out either of them noticing seeing riley remerge once again this time from his dorm now fully dressed she quickly grabbed his wrist pulling him into the nearest room where they wouldntdisturb nicole and logan that room just happened to be the bathroom alex what are we doi he cut himself off grabbing the back on her pyjama top as her foot slipped against both the tiles and her blanket that was still wrapped around her gee thanks potter my hero alex grinned as she sat on the edge of the bath so why are we in here he asked yawning sitting across from the bath and leaning against the vanity cabinet well nicole and logan are talking alex simply replied moving so that she too was sitting on the bathroom tiles leaning against the bath yeah and he looked at her and i thought we should give them privacy she replied poking his leg with her foot so you thought you d hideout in the bathroom he asked poking her back well no i was going to sneak back to bed but you came out and well i couldntlet you interrupt them she replied grinning again this coming from the girl who got mad at draco malfoy for trying to play matchmaker for her he smirked hey i never said i was mad at him alex protested fiddling with the hem of her pyjama top i just asked you what you wanted to do about them oh right he replied you know i never got around to telling draco that we knew why not alex asked her eyes filled with curiosity she dropped the end of her pyjama top and moved forward slightly as if she was afraid she wouldnthear his answer i dontknow he shrugged if figured if we ignored them they might ve just dropped it oh right alex said smirking or were you afraid to confront the little blonde prat no i not scared of draco or anyone else for that matter he replied plus he not really a prat not when you get to know him you see that where you re wrong i pretty sure he really is a prat alex said back that because you dontknow him the real him riley said rolling his eyes what there to know alex interrupted sarcastically he thinks he better then everyone well obviously it not use me explaining it to you since all your going to do is interrupt me riley trailed off his tone ending the discussion fine alex replied sitting back against the bath how long have they been in the bathroom now georgie asked as she emerged from the girls dorms with nicole both now fully dressed um about an hour i think she replied and they re in there why georgie asked confused as she sat on the couch next to her brother nicole looked at logan and he looked at georgie shrugging why does alex do anything i bet it so she can finally snog him draco interrupted looking up from his game of chess with sam before georgie could reply draco cantyou just them alone their friends sam said as her king took out his queen friends my arse draco replied the five of them sat there in silence thinking about what draco had actually said you know draco might actually be right georgie finally said what logan asked shaking his head at his sister knowing that she was right well has anyone actually been in there to talk to them she asked looking at them all shake their heads okay i ll be right back she disappeared through the common room door minutes later she returned to the common room with a jug of water in one hand a glass in the other drink this she said handing both to draco what no why he asked taking neither the glass or the jug well you re the one who seems to think their doing god knows what in there so you re the one who going to find out she said simply filling the glass with water so what the water got to do with anything he asked slightly confused and dreading what he may or may not see well if you drink it all then you ll need to use the toilet meaning that the reason why you re going in there she said shoving the glass in his hand canti just go in there with out the water he said standing up not waiting for a reply headed straight toward the bathroom alex and riley were both still in the same positions her leaning against the bath him opposite her against the vanity cabinet neither were talking to each other alex mad that he kept trying to prove her wrong riley mad because she kept interrupting him arrgh this is so uncomfortable alex tough shifting her body so that she wasntsitting so straight back against the back they better have done more than bloody talk out there sighing she shifted back to her first position accidentally kicking riley in the foot what the hell was that for he asked it was an accident she replied icily as the bathroom door opened draco walked in pretending not to notice the two sitting on the tiles standing up alex pushed her way past draco and out into he common room if he up then they would have stopped talking now she thought stopping when she saw the four in the common room looking at the bathroom door quickly they all turned away when alex appeared georgie and sam seemed to be in a conversation about make up and logan appeared to be showing nicole what he was writing something alex noticed immediately as this was something he never did he didnteven let amelia read his notebook when he went out with her with out saying a word she made her way into her dorm what did i interrupt something draco sneered as riley stood up ignoring him he moved toward the door um hello are you even listening t me draco asked stepping in his way what riley asked staring at the blonde boy riley suddenly felt a flash of anger but without saying a word he pushed past him and disappeared through the common room door alex emerged from the girls dormitory wearing jeans and a bright blue t shirt for those who were wondering to find both logan glaring at draco with georgie sam and nicole avoiding the two of them what going on alex asked sitting on the couch between the other two hogwarts girls both of who just shrugged in reply hey do you guys still go to the practise room on sunday afternoon s she asked georgie drawing her attention away from the magazine she was absorbed in uh what yeah the blonde replied glancing at her watch actually i um have to go to the library first so i ll see you there in about half an hour she absentmindly wandered out of the common room leaving her brother with the four hogwarts students where d georgie go logan asked as he picked his notebook up off the table draco sitting opposite smirking at the other boy back the library apparently alex said raising her eyebrows at the boy where are you going the practise room i told brian i d help him with some new music later he too began to exit the common room logan wait alex called jumping up um i mean can you take nikki up there i um i have to go see my mum and dad and sam and draco wouldntbe that interested actually draco cut himself off when alex gave him the granger death stare um okay if she doesntmind sitting through me and brain go through music notes logan replied stopping near the door i sure she ll be fine alex smiled pulling the slightly shocked nicole out of seat and pushing her toward the door once she had watched them leave alex too made her way toward the door oy granger where are you going draco yelled after her turning around alex gave draco a smirk to rival the malfoy one i dontreally think that any of your business malfoy sam if you go to the eighth floor there a room with a silver door go there in about half an hour after riley exited the common room he just continued walking unsure of where he was going only aware that he was going up after fifteen minutes of walking riley found an unlocked door that led to the roof of fascino quas here he found a courtyard which gave him an almost perfect view of the city almost as perfect as the view the astronomy tower gave him it would be perfect if she was here riley thought arrgh why did i have to snap at her she right anyway draco is a prat but no i couldntlet her be right sighing he sat on a small bench between two trees which were obviously magically grown since there was no soil up here ten minutes went past as riley sat in what would have appeared to some one watching him as peaceful silence inside however it was not so peaceful as he continued to wrestle with his feelings toward the brunette you know generally when people sigh a lot it means they have a problem her voice came from behind him riley turned to see alex standing there grinning at him when her facial expression changed from a grin to a look of concern her brown eyes searching his own green ones riley what wrong she asked sitting on the bench nest to him honestly he asked honestly she repeated continuing to search his eyes well i have a problem he trailed out looking out to the city well that obvious alex stated all trace of sarcasm gone from her voice what is it well i like this girl she smart obnoxious gorgeous he trailed off again unsure as to whether to reveal his feelings for her to her so what the problem her voice sounding small i dontthink she likes me back riley said calmly avoiding her gaze have you asked her she asked finally riley looked at her and noticed a smile playing on her lips she knew um well you see he stopped moving closer to him she pulled a stray hair behind her ear and kissed him gently on the lips if you never asked then you ll never know she whispered into his ear playfully before standing up slightly in shock riley watched her walk toward the door back into the building are you coming she asked turning back toward him pulling the door open he stood and followed her quickly into the hallway walking side by side alex gently slipped her hand into his their fingers entwining as they made their way down the hallways a n ok there the next chapter yes i know i cantbelieve she made the first move haha i was actually going to wait until the dance until i got hem together but i couldnthelp my self also i know there is no hermione blaise stuff in this chapter and there probably wontbeing the next chapter either i want to wait until they get back to hogwarts until i continue with them read and review luv emgurl disclaimer still dontown anything from the books hey everyone thanks for all the great reviews i hope you enjoy this chapter the next couple of days went by quickly for the hogwarts students it became quite clear to all that alex and riley were an item and draco had taken to passing insulting comments about them only to be ignored by the two of them and glared at by logan and sam alex couldnthave been more happier her parents were back together she was with riley and her all her friends apart from draco were getting along brilliantly especially nicole and logan but she couldnthelp but notice that some one was always missing when they were all together and when they came back they would purposefully leave out where they had been for the last hour or so by thursday morning she had finally given up on getting the information from charlie who couldntlie to her instead taking to day dreaming about the halloween ball later that night the last lesson of the day had been cancelled so the students could prepare for the ball while the hogwarts teachers were put in charge of decorating the great ballroom ok so there the canary creams the blaise zoned out as he watched hermione check each box as harry read the list of things they had bought from fred and george out ok so professor dokoft said for us to be creative as possible hermione said snapping blaise out of his trance if you two bring these boxes up there me and jess will go set the tables up both men nodded and began to shrink the boxes and their contents as hermione and jess headed toward the ballroom once they had shrunk all the boxes they followed hermione and jess to the ballroom so blaise what going on between you two harry asked checking that hermione and jess were out of earshot nothing new since last time you asked harry blaise replied never taking his eyes of the brunette so saturday you spent the whole day together and nothing happened harry quizzed harry even if it did do you think i d tell you blaise asked in return so something happened harry said no nothing happened end of discussion blaise said as they entered the ballroom he smiled at hermione who he knew was watching him i asked her to spend christmas with me that it christmas harry asked do you think she ready for something like that i guess if she wasn t she would have said no blaise replied unshrink the boxes as harry began to unpack they then began to help jess and hermione decorate the hall with the bats cobwebs and other decorations which had been sent over from hogwarts back in the niveus common room the girls were nowhere to be seen although occasionally laughter and squealing was heard from the various dorm rooms riley was sitting with logan in the common room trying hard to concentrate on the game of chess they were playing while draco continuously smirked and sneered at them generally draco hated the holidays he never understood what the big fuss was about but he usually enjoyed halloween and this year would be no different with the only exception that he was the only one who was going to be in on the fun he finally gave up on sneering at the two boys and went into the dorm he was staying in opening his trunk he lifted out the pieces of the costume he was to switch with the one in riley trunk pulling his wand out he flicked it toward the costume and the pieces joined together to reveal a knights armour carefully he opened the trunk marked potter and pulled out the quidditch uniform ginny had bought from riley placing the armour into the trunk instead then with a flick of his wand the quidditch uniform burst into green flames and disappeared perfect draco breathed as he exited the dorm logan come on were going to be late georgie pulled her twin out the chair late for what i thought you were getting ready for the ball riley asked eyeing the girl who was still in her uniform um yeah but i just remembered we told our mum we d owl her georgie replied not making eye contact instead glaring at her twin who was still sitting at the table watching the chess pieces but you ll be back before the ball starts were meeting charlie and everyone in the practice room right riley continued well maybe why dontyou just meet us in the ballroom we ll tell charlie and kimmie and brain this time logan replied standing up letting georgie drag him away okay riley replied watching as the chess pieces began to battle on the board he check his watch there was still at least two hours until the ball started what your friends left you smirked draco who had re entered the common room what the hell is your problem riley exploded he had enough of draco attitude draco blinked at him i donthave a problem are you sure why cantyou just be some one who people want to hang around with instead of someone who everyone avoids even your girlfriends avoids you riley shouted well i sorry for being who i am and sam does not avoid me draco spat back you know i tried to defend you to alex when she said you were a prat but she was right it what you are riley began as draco cut him off and if alex said it must be right then draco voice was rising causing the students mainly boys that were still in the common room to look at them what now she your girlfriend your not allowed to have your own opinion anymore at least she talks to me you just sam for a quick snog riley shot back draco glared at him it was obvious to riley who had only seen him really angry once before when someone in slytherin said something about his family what going on nicole asked from the doorway of the girls dorm alex and sam were both standing behind her both boys realised they had become so loud the girls in the dorms had heard them aswell nothing riley muttered avoiding eye contact with any three of the girls he could still feel draco glaring at him draco sam quiet voice came as the blonde boy headed toward the common room door nothing sammie he replied giving the girl a reassuring smile i think i just need some air and with that he left the common room half an hour later alex slipped into the common room to find riley sitting alone staring at a wall hey she said sitting next to him are you okay he didntreply so she squeezed his hand riley draco your best friend just because he not my favourite person doesntmean you should be fighting with him she said slowly riley turned to look at her i know i dontknow what happened before i just had enough and i cracked you know how he is all rude and sarcastic i just couldnttake it anymore well i know when me and georgie used to fight which was a lot i always felt better after i apologised she gave him a reassuring look and riley knew it was the right thing to do yeah but i dontknow where he went he protested finding an excuse he your best friend you must have an idea alex pointed out riley nodded and stood up your right i just hope i right finally they had put up the last of the decorations hermione can i talk to you a minute harry asked as blaise and jess began to stack the chairs away they didntneed sure hermione replied what about you and blaise he said slowly hermione frowned what about us well dontyou think your rushing things a bit i mean are your ready to spend christmas wit him harry asked harry are you serious i love him i ve tried to deny that i dontfor the last fifteen years besides do i have to remind you how fast your forgave ginny hermione replied a hint of anger clear in her voice i know but what about alex how do you think she ll feel harry responded she finally getting the chance to spend christmas with her proper family i think she ll be happy hermione replied as blaise and jess headed toward them fine harry replied closing the conversation draco pulled his cloak around him tightly as the school came back into his view slowly he stepped inside it gate checking that no muggle was following him he quickly made his way into the building he entered the hall and began to make his way up the stairs a plastic muggle shopping bag hanging in his hand draco riley voice came from behind him draco stopped shit he thought as he turned to face his best friend potter he attempted to sneer back look draco i sorry i was the prat i should be used to by now riley spoke quickly draco had only just made put the words good he smirked the two boys made their way back to the common room together in silence until finally riley curiosity got the better of him um what in the bag he finally asked oh that well uh you see draco stopped well riley waited i kind of switched your costume to this really terrible one so i went and got you a better one and i bought sam something draco mumbled you went in to muggle new york riley asked surprised yeah i ve been here before my dad bought us here for a holiday once draco said glad his friend hadntactually realised what he had said oh right wait you switched my costume to what riley asked as they entered the common room so your defiantly sure i look alright nicole asked for the fifth time you look brilliant sam replied adjusting her bandanna are you sure nicole repeated standing in front of the mirror yes we re sure alex replied this time getting up from the bed the guys are going to love you nicole shook her head you know alex is right our new friend logan might have some competition sam smirked as nicole looked at her horrified logan doesntlike me like that we re just friends she said nervously alex snorted gee that not what he told me what nicole asked in awe he was talking about me alex nodded as sam laughed yeah and you say you dontlike him there was twenty minutes left until the ball started and both draco and riley were still waiting for the three girls to come out from the dorm i still cantbelieve you changed me costume riley said grumpily as he put the jacket on the table potter shut up unless you want to wear the armour draco drawled as he sat down with draco purchase he had the choice of wearing the knights armour or a tuxedo which was apparently the only thing draco could find at first he was going to go with the armour until he found out it was controlled by draco wand so instead he had to settle with the tux with draco insisting it was from some muggle spy movie 007 or something like that yeah but the outfit my mum bought me he trailed off as the girls door opened the three of them made their way down the steps standing up and turning to see what put riley into shock draco felt his mouth drop open sam usually straight hair was hanging loosely in curls pulled back with a red and white bandanna she wore a sixties styles red and white patterned dress which flared out at the sleeves with red suede boots that reached just above her knees with carefully applied make up and big gold hoop earrings she looked as if she just stepped out from the sixties a n i saw this out fit on beyonce in austin powers goldmember so it might 70 i cantremember though nicole looked stunning with her red hair pulled into a loose ponytail and the short green dress with soft fairy wings that fluttered every couple of seconds made her look like the perfect tinkerbell then there was alex she looked perfect her hair had been straightened slightly leaving a soft wave through it framing her face carefully with the front being pulled back by the thing gold crown riley took a deep breath as he fully took in her costume the white and gold dress the thin halo around her had her bare feet her natural barely there make up so james bond hey alex asked snapping him out his trance huh riley asked confused that who it was draco said tearing his eyes away from his girlfriend james bond draco shut up sam said pulling him away from alex and riley private moment but it as too late he already had their attention how do you know who james bond is nicole asked hi she had known of course from her grandfather but draco family supposedly hated anything muggle related i watch the movies draco replied as if it was the most obvious thing in the world right okay so what exactly is your costume alex interrupted as she looked at hs clothes i a muggle he said brightly proud with his outfit how original nicole stated um where georgie and lo everyone oh they said they d meet us at the ballroom we ve got five minutes riley replied looking at his watch we should probably head to the ballroom now he took alex hand in his and led her to the door with nicole following um yeah we ll be there in a minute draco replied pulling a wrapped box out of his pocket alex riley and nicole all entered the ballroom hoping to fin georgie logan charlie brian or kimmie none were in sight leaving riley and alex alone nicole went in search of her brothers while the other two found a table that would fit the five hogwarts students and the five fascino quas students you look really beautiful tonight riley told alex as they sat at the table thanks you dontlook too bad yourself she grinned at him as harry walked toward them well you two look good didntyour mother buy you a quidditch costume though he asked his green eyes sparkling mischievously over the two of them yeah it a long story though riley replied as he saw draco and sam enter the ballroom as they made their way over to the table they were sitting at harry left to talk to the other students you re here already riley asked giving draco a smirk what yeah sam replied her face slightly flushed draco arm wrapped securely around her waist where is everyone alex shrugged as nicole spoke well if it isntobvious to you all yet but i think they might be part of the entertainment tonight nicole said softly now that i think about our little nikki is probably right alex joked grinning at the redhead girl it just means she ll be dateless for awhile before nicole or anyone else had the chance to reply the lights in the hall dimmed and a figure clad in a long black cloak stood in the centre of the stage the person lifted down the hood from the cloak and revealed themselves to the two schools finally professor dokoft spoke i invite you all to celebrate this night together tomorrow the hogwarts students will depart so i think we should make this a night to remember she paused as few students clapped but first i would like to introduce the band that has finally found a name for themselves the practice room the blonde teacher exited the stage as five spotlights came on two at the front where two microphone stands stood two to the sides one on a keyboard the other on another microphone stand and finally one at the back on the set of drums alex could now recognise as charlies finally the came on stage both georgie and kimmie wearing matching pink cocktail dresses with matching fitted suit jackets the boys all had identical suits on but then to alex surprise logan and brian moved toward the two front microphones instead of georgie who moved to the microphone to the side okay as you all know this is our new band without lex brain spoke clearly into the microphone and alex could feel everyone look at her as he said her name and this isntour original or normal line up but this first song is all about alex and georgie just didntwant to sing it alex realised what was going on oh my god their so dead she whispered slightly at shock from the situation so we d like everyone to grab a partner and get on the dance floor he said as they picked up or sat down at their instruments alex looked at riley who had paled slightly at the word dance draco i sure your sam wouldntmind if you came and danced with me in fact she might find it funny to watch she pulled the blonde boy onto the dance floor with her as they began to play all about you by mcfly alex listened closely to brain and logan as they sang together it all about you it about you it all about you baby it all about you it all about you it about you it all about you uh alex draco said slowly mmm alex replied distractedly why didntyou get potter to dance with you he sounded nervous well he looked like he was going to throw up it didntseem fair i d rather embarrass you she replied jokingly uh right dontyou have any other guy friends though he continued draco look at the stage their all up there but when they come down their all going to die she paused as logan began the second part of the first verse never taking his eyes off nicole who was dancing with another gryffindor boy besides i think it time me and you became friends oh yeah they stopped and danced listening to the music so why are they going to die draco finally asked because this song is my favourite song and i once told georgie that it would be cool to play it at my wedding which is another reason why i got you to dance she stopped as the song finished you re a good dancer my mum taught me draco replied as he followed alex off the dance floor alex i wonttell riley tell him what she asked confused what you told georgie about that song we dontwant to freak him out just yet draco replied genuinely you re right how about we tell him that i think you re hotter than he is that might freak him out even more alex offered jokingly no seriously draco began but stopped when they reached the table whatever draco alex replied sitting down as her friends switched positions and georgie began to sing a kelly clarkson song a n ok i going to stop here so this chapter doesntget too long i might make this into to a two part chapter though also sorry if some parts seem a bit slow or werid or crap but sometimes i get so many ideas at once then its too hard to get hem all down then i forget htings etc plus my sister wouldntleave me aone while i was writing this which was really annoying please review and tell me what you think luv emgurl disclaimer still dontown anything from the books hey thanks for all the fantastic reviews hope you like this chapter also logan and brian only sang the first song then georgie sang the kelly clarkson song and hopefully i ll have a bit more hermione blaise stuff in the next couple of chapters an hour and a half later the halloween feast had been eaten and the best fascino quas acts the school had to offer had performed hermione and blaise were quietly talking to the other teachers as harry and jess danced together while many of the students were either dancing or chatting aswell from the corner of his eye blaise watched his daughter carefully well more to the point he watched riley carefully when he was close to alex he couldnthelp it sure alex wasnthis innocent little girl but she was still his innocent daughter and blaise would do anything to ensure that blaise stop staring hermione whispered into his ear her feather boa tickling his cheek what i wasntstaring blaise said turning back to the table to find that it was simply him and hermione still sitting there yes you were hermione smiled squeezing the red foam clown nose blaise was wearing she smart she wontdo anything stupid it not her i worried about blaise said and he went back to watching riley as hermione sighed logan just ask her to dance alex hissed into his ear as they watched nicole georgie and sam dance riley and draco were off getting them drinks and both kimmie and brian had disappeared leaving charlie logan and alex at the table he shook his head alex is right mate we all know your crazy about her charlie said with an evil grin you told everyone that i like her logan said turning to alex no she didn t you just did then charlie interrupted before alex could reply but it was kind of obvious though you haventlooked at anyone else all night that not true logan began yeah right even when you were on stage you couldnttake your eyes off her alex smirked just ask her to dance what if she says no logan began as charlie pushed him out of his seat she wont he answered yeah she likes you too alex added i dontknow logan began just go both alex and charlie said together alright logan said and with a deep breath he slowly walked toward the three girls that were dancing he finally going to ask her then brian asked as he returned to the table with kimmie alex looked at the two of them still in their stage costumes neither were looking at each other and alex couldnthelp but notice kimmie face was unusually pink i guess they ve just been fighting again she thought yup it took us awhile to get him out there charlie replied and alex turned back to watch logan as he finally reached the dance floor suddenly the music changed from dome dance song to switchfoots i dare you to move logan turned and looked back at the table as the three girls began to stop dancing and move toward him toward their table alex gave him a reassuring smile while charlie gave him a thumbs up slowly he turned around just as georgie and sam moved past him and came face to face with the redhead nicole he managed to say logan she grinned at him i um well would you like to dance with me he spluttered out she simply nodded and took his hand back at the table alex let out a gasp of relief as she watched her two friends dance slowly she turned back to the table to find that riley and draco had finally returned everybody else was deep in conversation except for riley who was watching her intently what she asked smiling softly at him while unconsciously touching her face nothing riley replied pulling her hand away from her cheek sending shivers down her spine as his thumb brushed against her skin i was just wondering if you would like to dance blaise watched as alex and riley danced until his attention was drawn back to hermione dressed in a moulin rouge like costume she danced with harry who seemed to be dressed as an umpire she looked happy and blaise watched her smile it was a smile he had not seen for many years it was a smile he knew he had helped to put there it was a smile he wanted to keep there finally the students began to drift out of the ballroom as the night drew to a close the next day alex and the other hogwarts students packed their belongs they had bought over and said their good byes to their new friends assembling in the ballroom which had now been cleared of the halloween decorations and tables from the night before the gryffindor students soon formed the same groups which they travelled in to the school as blaise and hermione handed out the portkey s soon they were back in the great hall at hogwarts a n yes i know that was short but it was kind of the ending to the last chapter and yes i know the ending tot his chapter was kind of crap but please review and tell me what you think anyway luv emgurl disclaimer still dontanything you recognise from the books a n well i glad you all like the last chapter i just wanted to put it in as an ending for

weather had turned cold suddenly and hermione room in the dungeons had been no exception in letting the coolness in not matter what charms she did or how much wood she put on the fire hermione could not manage to warm her small room up finally at 10 30pm shivering she crawled into her bed with a book pulling the covers right up hoping to keep the warmth around her when their was a knock on the door pulling her flannelette dressing gown around herself she padded toward the door in her slippers slowly opening the door hermione revealed blaise blaise what are you doing it late and cold hermione said shivering i just wanted to talk blaise stopped as he looked at her her lips almost blue from being so cold come on he said pulling her out of her room it too cold for you to stay here no blaise really i fine hermione began as he led her toward his own room no your not look at your lips are almost blue if i leave you in there you ll freeze to death he answered opening his own door they were greeted with the sound of wood cracking in the fire and hermione could already feel the warmth from the doorway fine hermione said as she followed him into the room and sat on the couch what was it that you wanted to talk about oh it was nothing important blaise stopped looking at the fire and turned to the brunette it doesntmatter so you come to my room at then thirty telling me you need to talk then you think i ll settle with it doesntmatter i think you know me too well to try that blaise hermione said shifting in her seat now tell me what it is ok but you cantget mad at me i ve been thinking are you sure we re doing the right thing he spoke quietly watching her waiting for her reaction what hermione whispered her voice cracking slightly flashback blaise waited for in the library it was dark and the only light came from the moon shining through the window he never had to wait for her before usually she was there before him her head buried in a book as she waited for him finally she came blaise stood as she entered she waked slowly her head down her brown curls covering her face finally when she reached him she looked up hermione blaise whispered her face streaked with tears what happened she shook her head and wiped her face with the back of her hand taking a seep breath she finally spoke this isntright blaise her voice cracked as the tears began to flow freely again what not right blaise asked stupidly he already knew the answer us it never going to work outside hogwarts you re a slytherin i a gryffindor she trailed off trying to sound convincing dontsay that blaise whispered as he watched hermione turn and walk toward the door hermione wait he called out following her she continued walking ignoring his calls eventually he followed her to the gryffindor tower just as she was bout to give the password to the fat lady he grabbed her arm and pulled her around so she would finally face him blaise let go her voice hoarse from the crying no he replied forcefully not until you listen to me she stared at him blankly her brown eyes lost in his blue one hermione granger i love you with all my heart and nothing no one is ever going to change that he paused and wiped the tears off her face gently i want to spend the rest of my life with you he waited for her to reply but when she didnthe leaned in and kissed her gently on the lips tell me that didntmean anything to you tell me that you didntfeel anything then i ll let you go she couldntdo it she couldntlie to him i sorry blaise she whispered as she hugged him tightly i love you that

really mean it when you said you wanted to spend the rest of your life with me she asked again looking into his blue eyes every single day he breathed as they kissed end of flashack blaise you once said you would spend the rest of your life with me hermione whispered standing up taking a step back hermione blaise began standing too she shook her head and swallowed as a large lump formed in her throat tears began to prickle her eyes if this isntwhat you wanted then i ll leave she took a step toward the door as she felt blaise handed on her arm this is what i want i ve wanted it since the first time i met you i just i just need to know if this is what you definitely want he spun her around his heart broke as he watched the tears flow down her face fantastic work blaise the voice in his head told him you just keep on hurting her dontyou gently he traced the tears with his fingertips until she grabbed his hand holding it tight over her heart she finally spoke blaise this is what i want i haventfelt like this my heart hasntbeaten like this for fifteen years you do this to me because i love you she pulled him closer i need you in my life blaise he pulled her close to him kissing her with all the passion he had bottled up for so many years hermione hummed softly to herself as she walked to her charms classroom images of blaise from the previous night filled her mind hermione a familiar voice called out hermione either ignored or did not appear to have heard ben walker as he called out to her hermione he called again this time grabbing her elbow startled hermione turned coming face to face with the blonde man ben she said slowly how are you good good he spoke quickly his eyes shooting around at the passing students glaring at them as if someone was going to catch him i was just wondering if you were staying here at christmas you know we could spend it together have our own little hogwart party oh ben she said softly i would like to but i actually spending the holidays with professor zabini and some friends oh right he said sounding a little angry he let go of her elbow i hope you have good time then and with that he disappeared down the corridor as hermione turned and continued her way toward her classroom draco lydia malfoy called as their fireplace filled with green smoke yeah what draco said entering the room carrying a small blonde girl on his back blaise he began as the dark haired man stepped out of the fireplace dontyou have classes i mean my son mustntbe learning too much if all the teachers are skipping out just to visit friends uncle blaise the girl cried jumping off her fathers back hugging blaise tightly hello chelsea where you sister blaise asked putting the girl down she looked remarkable like draco except her eyes were

began to explain but looked at his friend to see that he was joking look i have to be quick severus is watching the class at the moment he continued your definitely spending christmas at the zabini manor he waited for draco to answer yes he replied sitting on the couch my mother is still insisting on spending christmas here with all her friends why well i ve asked hermione and alex to spend it with me he said slowly you dontmind do you why would we mind lydia asked coming back into he room without chelsea draco already figured you would end up asking them they re your family blaise i just wanted to check he said watching as draco pulled his wife onto the lounge wrapping his arms around her waist you know i haventseen granger since before i left hogwarts it should be good he paused as blaise frowned when he referred to her as granger i mean hermione he quickly covered up how is she she fine she actually looking forward to spending christmas with you draco he gave him a smirk which is more than what i can say about alex she doesnteven know me draco protested oh she should come back on the train with draco then i can pick them up and you and hermione can go to the manor and have some time alone lydia said at the same time it your little draco she cantstand he said to draco before turning to lydia i ll ask hermione and then get back to you on it but i sure it would be fine but right now i should get going hogwarts dungeons he said stepping back into the green flames two weeks before christmas hermione and blaise walked hand in hand down the streets of hogsmeade they were christmas shopping so what exactly are we looking for hermione asked as blaise pulled her into yet another shop once we find it we ll know blaise replied looking at the things on the shelves but it for alex right hermione asked again picking up a book as blaise nodded he let go of her hand so he could move freely around the shop inspecting what they had to offer carefully finally he came to a glass cabinet inside it was various pieces of jewellery finally blaise found what he had been looking for blaise have you found anything yet hermione asked coming over carrying her own parcels he nodded before stepping to the side to show hermione what he had found that ugly brooch she asked do you really think she ll like that not the brooch blaise said the charm on that necklace he pointed to the next shelf up hermione looked at it carefully it was a simple charm three musical notes grouped together each with their own stone residing in the centre of the gold the first resembled and emerald the second an amethyst and the third a ruby blaise she ll love it but isntit a bit expensive hermione turned to see him watching her it doesntmatter how much it is she deserves it blaise said quietly hermione nodded and waited for him to pay the shop clerk and have the gift wrapped now i just have to find your present he grinned at her as they exited the shop a week before christmas alex sat in her history of magic classroom listening to professor walker drone on about the first war no body was really listening all were thinking about their christmas break alex however wasntactually looking forward to her holidays she had to spend them with draco malfoy after all sighing she turned to look out the window as nicole scribbled furiously on a piece of parchment finally the class ended you seemed a little distracted riley said as he waited for her to pack her books well it a bit hard to stay interested in something that boring alex replied as they left the classroom yeah riley answered taking her hand so um well every year we have this big new years party i was wondering if you would like to come gee i dontknow i might be busy spending quality time with draco she answered sarcastically hey i heard that draco voice came from behind but granger i actually going to the potters riley mum invited us and since your mum is best friends with her your probably going anyway oh yeah i forgot my mum would have told your parents he looked at alex as draco walked away still it better when you ask me i mean how would i feel when my mum tells me were going to a party at your house and you didnteven tell me about it she asked him as they began to walk up the stairs leading to the tower i guess you d be upset riley guessed wondering whether or not it was actually a rhetorical question well i think that if that what happened you wouldnthave been getting a new years kiss from me alex replied skipping ahead of him up the stairs oh really riley asked as he followed her and what about now he grabbed her wrist before she could skip ahead of him again she spun around and faced him well now mr potter i think you definitely will maybe even a few more she grinned as he leant toward her password the fat lady said from her place in the portrait fairy lights alex said giggling as she pulled away from riley before he could kiss her and climbed through the hole the portrait revealed first day of christmas holidays are you sure you ll be okay hermione asked alex as the students began to board the hogwarts express mum i ll be fine alex sighed looking longingly to where her friends were standing it just a train ride i know but still hermione began hermione blaise said putting his hand on her shoulder as she reached up to straighten alex clothes she ll be fine and when they get into london lydia will be there to bring them back to the manor alright alex just stay with draco when the train gets in you ve never been to london before i dontwant you to get lost hermione said finally letting alex go okay mum alex said as she watched her parents walk away god anyone would think it the first time i ve been on a train she muttered to herself moving closer to her friends what sam asked looking at her confused nothing alex replied just talking to myself and you think i the weird one draco smirked at riley hermione took a deep breath as she stepped into the fireplace at hogwarts she felt the warmth from the green flames but nothing could cover up her nervousness of going to the zabini manor zabini manor she finally said and the green flames swallowed her after minutes of spinning past the various fireplaces before her destination hermione finally stopped then proceeded to trip out of the fireplace she landed with a thud on the floor of the zabini family room finally what took you so long blaise asked as he helped her up nothing hermione murmured as she stood you didnthurt yourself when you fell did you she looked up at him his blue eyes looking deep with in her brown ones she shook her head suddenly she had lost all power to speak properly he lifted her chin up cupping her face is his left hand where draco hermione asked suddenly not sure as why she was spoiling the moment blaise stareda t her blankly for a moment before letting go of her he not here he left just before ou got here something about lil present blaise said taking a step back and scratching his head oh hermione replied gently moving slowly around the room on the mantle piece around the fireplace she had jest entered from were various photo s ones of blaise when he was a boy some from before that of his parents and grandparents when they were younger hermione also caught glimpse of one of her with blaise at hogwarts but it wasntthe photos she had turned to look at it was something she had studied the first time she was there the zabini family tapestry it was similar to the one from grimmuld place only this one traced the zabini bloodline not the black bloodline studying it closely she found that it was still the same as the last time she had looked at it the navy cloth the electric blue thread joining each name to the next the silver writing of the names she began to trace it with her fingers starting with blaise grandparents marius zabini carlotta zabini se followed the line to blaise mother and father jorge zabini gianina zabini a n i dontactually know his parent names i not even sure if they have even been mentioned in the book but in a story i read his dad name was jorge and it thought it suited him i just made up his mum and grandparents names though then down to blaise blaise zabini she stopped next to blaise name a small blue thread had been sewed but no name had been placed there she didntknow who had sewn it but hermione knew they had stopped when she left you need to add alex on here hermione said slowly surprising herself when she spoke blaise came and stood behind her placing his hand on hers still on the empty place on the tapestry i need to finish this one first blaise said softly alex leaned back against riley and looked out the window at the passing landscape they would be back in london soon but alex didntwant to leave nicole and sam had disappeared a while ago nicole in search of her brothers her mothers orders to check on them while sam went off in search for jess and natalie draco had fallen asleep or was at least pretending to be asleep leaving alex and riley pretty much alone in the compartment together i wish i could stay here all christmas alex said as riley wrapped his arms around her pulling her closer yeah riley replied they sat in a comfortable silence until the compartment door was slid open violently causing draco to jump or wake up in a state of shock bloody hell weasley what was that about he sneered as nicole gave them a guilty look and gently pushed the door closed as she stepped in sorry she said not looking like she actually meant it with a big smile on her face she sat down and the three of them stared at her waiting for her to tell them what was going on what up alex finally asked her huh oh nothing she replied putting a piece of parchment in her bag glancing quickly at riley and draco hey malfoy you want to come with me to find paul he owes me money and i want it back for the holidays riley said standing up nah i d rather just stay here draco replied bad luck you re coming he replied pulling the blonde boy out of the compartment spill alex began looking at nicole once riley had closed the door again spill what she replied still grinning spill on what making you grin like some weird clown alex said moving to the seat next to her friend it nothing she began looking at alex you really think i going to believe it nothing alex asked and waited for her to reply oh fine when i was leaving matt and bill compartment an owl was at the window so they let it in and it flew to me and dropped this at me she pulled out the parchment she had put in her bag earlier and handed it to alex infolding it alex found that it wasnta thick piece of parchment but smaller pieces wrapped in one large piece there from the ball nicole said as alex looked at the pictures they were muggle pictures meaning the people in them were not moving all were candid photos so no one was actually posing in any of them the first was of nicole and logan laughing while they were dancing the next was of georgie and alex sitting at the table talking then there was one of riley and nicole their ed hair making it obvious they were cousins finally the last was once again of logan and nicole only this time they were sitting at the table talking wow their really good nik alex said handing them back to the redhead yeah but that not it she said grinning as alex noticed the small card she had dropped on the floor on the front was a cartoon of a snowman being dressed by elves she opened it and read the familiar scrawl of logan writing dear nicole um georgie said she was sending some photos to you so i got her to put this in with it merry christmas hope you have great holidays i really enjoyed when you guys were here it kind of boring now that you re gone cantwait to see you and everyone when we visit from logan she handed the card back to her and gave her a sly grin would i be right in saying that like logan back she asked as nicole blushed but nodded giggling slightly it weird you know nicole began as alex frowned at her before you came i didnteven get along with my cousin now i actually have a fantastic best friend let alone just normal friends nikki you had friends before i came to hogwarts alex began yeah but they were just guys i couldntdo this with them she smiled at alex who smile back understanding what she meant so this is your room blaise said as hermione followed him into the guest room it was a simply d cor yet it was elegant just like the rest of the house the dark mahogany bed was covered in a cream and gold bedspread with matching pillows a matching dresser and bedside table sat beside the bed and along the opposite wall one wasll was just a window featuring the zabini gardens while the other three were a light cream colour matching the bedspread your putting me in the guest room hermione asked turning to blaise a sly grin across her face well yeah i though with alex staying aswell you d be more comfortable in here he said avoiding her gaze well you see blaise she pulled him closer to her i dontthink i really like this room wel you can change rooms with draco and lydia he said nervously as hermione wrapped her arms around his neck i could she paused but it would be less hassle if i stayed in your room blaise looked at her she smiled sweetly at him before pulling him out of the guest room and toward the main bedroom this room was larger and while the set up was similar it was decorated in a pale blue colour she sat on the bed as blaise watched her inspect his room from the doorway yep this room is much b etter she said looking at blaise her eyes almost laughing at him i guess i ll stay in the guest room then he said sly and began to walk down the hallway he stopped as he heard hermione get up off the bed she came into the hallway blaise i ll stay in your guest room she said seriously the laughter gone from her eyes now are you kidding blaise smiled at her pulling him close to her their lips met as blaise wrapped his arms around her waist pulling her even closer her hands running through his black curls jesus blaise draco malfoy voice came from the end of the hallway they broke apart i though you went shopping malfoy blaise responded never tearing his eyes away from hermione s i was but i got bored i figures i d come back and see granger but i can see you two were busy he sneered it hermione draco hermione replied finally breaking eye contact with blaise before making her way down the stairs blaise watched as she reached the bottom before she turned and smiled at him then headed toward where the kitchen was a n yes i know it longer than usual and most of you are probably thinking why did you leave it there but i wanted to make it a bit longer since i wasntgoing to be able to update it sooner but i didntwant to make it too long please review i ll look forward to reading them when i get back luv emgurl disclaimer i so do not own harry potter or any characters places from the book hey thanx for all the great reviews i really glad you liked the plot it took me ages to think of and i was nervous no one would review or if they did they would say it was crap thanx again from me this chapter i kind of got stuck so even though i dontreally have characters main pov i decided to change so that different parts were what one character was thinking etc tell me what you think blaise had been standing in the entrance hall for at least ten minutes now he turned around and looked into the mirror his black curls falling over his eyes what am i doing he asked himself i should just go back to the dungeons he sighed turning back towards the passages to his room it just near the library he heard harry voice say blaise turned back around and saw his good friend move toward the stairs a witch was following closely behind but slowly he recognised her it was the face he had seen so many times in his dreams his dreams where he stopped her from leaving when he stopped himself from getting drunk when he stopped himself for breaking her heart hermione blaise said so quietly it was almost a whisper he watched her freeze and never took his off her as she slowly turned around to face him she didntlook at him though keeping her eyes at her feet mum fred and george said they d show me all the secret passages a black haired girl said coming into the hall blaise watched hermione as she raised her eyes and looked at him he looked at the girl she was exactly like hermione around 15 but her hair was different it was black and had soft curls just like mine he thought oh my god she is mine he looked back at hermione meeting her eyes he watched as tears began to form he stepped forward and watched as she turn and ran up the stairs the girl began to follow blaise put a hand on her shoulder and she yelled something out to her mother i ll find her he murmured not looking at the girl he made his ways up the stairs trying to think of where she would have went flashback it was after midnight but blaise couldntsleep in fact since he had joined the order he had barely slept he had taken to wondering the school at nights he couldntstand sleeping in the slytherin dorm s not with draco and his friends continually talking about the death eaters and he who shall not be named suddenly he found himself in the school library for some reason he had never some here at night he found it too weird but tonight i guess it didntfeel strange it probably empty anyway he thought to himself as he opened the door hermione was in there but she didntsee him she hardly saw anyone behind her wall of books hermione he asked walking over to her desk hermione sat up suddenly knocking over a pile of books her eyes were red and puffy hermione what wrong he asked genuinely concerned she just continued to sob blaise didntknow what to do he had never been good with girls especially when they were crying my parents they they she sobbed before bursting into tears blaise just hugged her he understood hermione i so sorry he began as she sobbed into his chest she sobbed harder i i should go back to my dorm she choked out before her legs gave way blaise picked her up and lifted her over to the arm chairs in front of the fire wait i ll go get ginny he said she d know what to do he thought to himself no please dontleave me she said her eyes pleading with his he sat next to her and stared uncomfortably into the fire she began to cry harder as blaise put his hand around her shoulders surprisingly though he found he was not uncomfortable and glad that he was here to comfort her they fell asleep there together waking only when ginny came searching frantically for hermione hermione she said hugging her older friend dumbledore told us we ve been looking for you everywhere i so so sorry hermione hugged her friend back as blaise stood up and began to exit the library blaise she whispered her voice almost gone from crying so much the slytherin turned around yea he said turning around uh thank you for you know everything she said ignoring the stares from ginny uh anytime blaise replied turning around as harry and ron entered the library blaise and hermione spent nearly every night they and left of the seventh year together in library that where he fell in love with her the library blaise thought as he made his way along the corridor he got to the library and found that it was where hermione had come although there was already some one else with here some one else blaise knew a n ok i kinda got stuck so i decided to change to a new character then i decided to introduce the a new character so it from his point of view riley had been sitting in the library all night there was a party going on in the great hall but he hadntfelt like going i cantwait for the term to start he thought then can finally see my mates and get away from my bloody family riley sighed banging his head against the table he had never felt more bored in his life then suddenly a witch possibly one of his new professors coming running into the library riley sat up putting his glasses back on she didntnotice him though she was crying to hard his green eyes followed her as she went and sat on one of the armchairs near the window she was strangely familiar looking although riley knew had never meet her she had brown bushy hair was medium height and small she looked around the same age as his mother riley stood up and began to leave the library not wanting to disturb the witch but she looked up as his chair scraped the floor sorry he said turning to leave the woman sniffed and watched as the boy got up and left as riley left the library and pretty much ran into his mother riley i thought you were going to the party with your dad ginny weasley said to her son slightly frowning well yea it not like i dontsee them all enough the boy muttered ginny ignored her son hormones she thought rolling her eyes well what were you doing in the library riley looked at his mother blankly suddenly remembering what had just happened oh i was just you know reading when when this women came in crying i thought it would have been better if i you know left her alone ginny looked at her son disbelieving him uh ok if you see your dad tell him i in the library she said going into the library hermione pov hermione watched as the strange boy left the dorm she knew who he was ron told her that harry and ginny had a son a couple of months after she had alex but it wasntjust that he had harry eyes and while his hair was an ash red the trademark weasley red was still clearly visible by now she had stopped crying but she didntfeel like going back to the party she knew they d be looking for her she just hoped he wouldntremember where she went she was upset after a minute or two while hermione was calming herself down a small witch entered the library and hermione heart dropped lower she felt as if she was going to be sick ginny weasley looked at her in what appeared to be shock hermione stood up and went to leave hermione please stop ginny weasley begged suddenly hermione anger that she had fifteen years ago how could i ever have forgiven her she asked herself angrily what she spat at her former friend not stopping hermione please i just i just want to say i sorry ginny sobbed as she grabbed her older friends arm hermione pulled her arm away and glared at the other witch how dare you ask me for forgiveness after everything you did she began to say as the tears began to fall again i know i dontknow what happened you know how me and harry had been fighting and i i ginny began stopping when she saw the look in hermione eyes i dontwant your explanations i saw what happened hermione almost shouted neither witch saw blaise harry or alex enter the library ginny just stood there what do you want me to say she said quietly i dontwant you to say anything hermione screamed back at her i just want you to know how it feels to have your heart ripped out by the people you loved i had no on after voldermort killed my parents you knew that until i met blaise i had him everything was perfect until you you how would you feel if if it were you walking in on me and harry would you really want me to say sorry hermione asked her voice breaking now she looked at ginny who just stood there then suddenly she noticed her blaise and harry and her daughter standing there mum alex said stepping forward as hermione collapsed come on here i ll help you take her to your rooms blaise began to say no i think we ll manage alex said as hermione stood and began to pull her toward the door blaise stood there watching them as they left he went to follow them blaise harry said i think maybe you should just leave them for tonight anyway he hugged his wife but she pulled away ginny he began but he knew it was no use almost a week later it was only a few days left until the start of term and for some reason alex couldntwait for it to begin her mother had barely come out of her room not even to eat since the argument in the library alex was sick of the castle it wasntlike the castle at her school in new york plus she didnthave any friend here only paul but most of the time he was busy at his grandparents house or out of the castle with his mother she sighed as she stared out from the top of the astronomy tower she had found this place a couple of days ago and was surprised by the view it gave it helped her to think better flashback alex went to put the key in the door of the apartment she lived in with her mother hermione she heard her uncle ron voice say think about it please just think about it then she heard the faint almost silent yet familiar pop of a witch or wizard apparating she entered her home with no trace of her uncle ever being there hey mum i home she called out she stopped at the mirror and pulled her hair back off her face hermione hurried into her bedroom holding a letter ok weird alex thought to herself they had always had an agreement between each other tell them whatever was troubling them but now it seemed as if her mother was hiding something from her so what in the letter alex asked as she climbed on top of her mother bed uh what nothing hermione replied looking at her daughter ok alex said pulling at face at her mother it was the face she always gave into alright i give in hermione said sitting on the bed next to alex it a letter well duh alex said alex do you want me to tell you or not hermione looked at daughter ok ok sorry you dontreally sound like you mean it alright im sorry i promise i wont interrupt you again with any sarcastic comments hermione smiled only slightly it a letter from albus dumbledore he want me to teach at hogwarts next year as the charms professor he said if i accept then you can be transferred ther or you can stay at your school and visit during the holidays hermione waited fro her daughter reaction well she asked alex looked at her unsure what to say she shrugged wow she whispered yeah wow hermione agreed but i wontaccept it if you dontwant me to go i d rather stay here with you and never have to see any of them except for ron again she added silently alex turned around and looked at her mum while playing with her hair so if we go does that mean i ll get to meet everyone you grew up she asked oh no i didntthink she would want to go hermione thought desperately so does that mean you want to go hermione asked alex looked back at her mother only if you want to she replied but hermione had already seen the emotions in her face she knew how hard it was for alex to grow up with only her and ron as her family sure she thought of as ron wife as her aunt and paul as her cousin but she hardly got to see them hermione knew that even if she didntwant to go she had to for alex end of flashback alex sighed again if it wasntfor her then her mum wouldnthave been back stuck in this mess whats wrong a voice asked alex jumped slowly she turned around to see a boy the same age as her excuse me she asked well it just i ve only been here five minutes and you ve already sighed twice usually that means you have a problem the boy said his green eyes searching her face i riley by the way he held his hand out alex she replied not taking his hand i ve just been thinking about stuff she decided not tell him what had happened she didnteven know this boy besides it wasntanyone business but hers and her mums riley sat down on the stone floor next to alex this is here i come to get away from my family their so dumb they donteven think to look here he said staring out the window alex looked at him curiously noticing his hair was neither black nor red you think you families dumb she asked he looked at her his glasses a bit crooked it not that their dumb they just annoy me they wont ever leave me alone it always riley go help you grandma or riley i told your uncle you d help them out in the shop this week i never get time to myself he said slowly really it like the exact opposite in my family it just me and my mum and that it sometimes i find myself bored she said laughing a little she looked down at her watch it read 6 45 oh crap i have to go she said i told my mum i d help her with some stuff she stood up riley stood up too yeah me too i meant to go flying with my dad he rolled his eyes a little so maybe i ll see you up here again sometime we could talk more riley said as they walked down the stairs maybe alex replied she looked at her hands i guess i ll be seeing yo around school though if i dontsee you up here yeah riley said well bye and they both walked off in different directions a n ok so that the end of the second chapter i know no big cliffie but i too tired and be bothered going back and thinking of a different ending any ideas of what you would like to see happen in the next couple of chapters review again luv emgurl disclaimer still dontown anything from you recognise from the books a n yay i back okay so i would have updated earlier but who know you could get a cold when you go to the snow lol i haventbeen able to move or think properly for the last couple of days and i got back saturday anyway i have decided that i will not be using any hbp spoilers in my story because i am too lazy to change it and it just wontwork in my story lines also i really happy you all liked the last chapter at least those who reviewed did because i was just using it as a sort of filler until i could get some really good ideas any way some one mentioned at the start about hermione and snape friendship i was going to keep it in there but some one said they thought it was a bit weird which i had to agree with and after reading the hbp i am beginning to dislike him very much again so it will not be bought up again in any of my stories christmas eve during the day alex sat in the zabini lounge room with the zabini owl carefully she placed the two wrapped presents inside the box and sealed it with the magic spellotape her mother had bought her she then tied a thin envelope on the top and finally tied to the owl she had affectionately named zabi since none of the owls were actually named closing the window once zabi had disappeared from her view she turned to leave the lounge room in the hope she could get back to the room hr father had given her without being seen by uncle draco or aunty lydia or her parents for that matter lex can you move that chair please hermione came into the lounge with both blaise and draco behind her carrying an enormous tree she pushed the chair out of her way and moved toward the door oh blaise it beautiful hermione exclaimed as they put the tree up alex rolled her eyes at the cheerfulness in her mothers voice so far this had not been a good christmas break for her having to listen to her parents go gaga over each other like they were teenagers and then listening to draco jr complain and insult everything was not her idea of a enjoyable holiday at least she still had new years she moved closer to the door only to be stopped by two identical blonde girls the tree here the tree here they shouted jumping around the room chels maddy calm down it just a tree draco snr told them as his wife followed them into the room large boxes of decorations being levitated behind her their alright draco hermione said taking their hands in hers do you guys want to help us decorate the tree now both nodded enthusiastically blonde pigtails flying everywhere the news that they were decorating the tree would have usually excited alex but since this was not her normal christmas it alarmed her even more of being stuck in a room with two screaming girls finally she reached the door alex where are you going blaise voice came from somewhere near the tree behind her um well you see i was just going to go get draco you know make it a family thing she quickly covered up turning around to face her father that a good idea lex darling hermione replied before turning to the twins again now do you think this would be fun with cookies rolling her eyes alex silently left the lounge room and made her way up the grand staircase that led to all the bedrooms her parents was down the hall from hers and she had conveniently put a silencing charms on her room so that she couldnthear anything which may have later put her into therapy she was halfway up the stairs when she heard lydia call up to her alex when you come back down could you get drakey to bring down the boxes up there there a bit heavy so make sure he carries them now she had no choice but to actually go find the blonde boy that been annoying for the lat couple of days she guessed he was in his room since that was where had generally been hanging out when he wasntannoying her now she just had to figure out which room was his the one at the end of the hallway was her parents and hears was the second door down from their room at the other end of the hall was the room draco and lydia were staying in and the room next to that was the twins that left three doors she came to the first one and knocked against the white wood no one answered so she opened the door she found that her first guess was right this was draco room but he wasntin there only his clothes were strewn across the floor she gently closed the door and turned back into the hallway the door to the left of her room was slightly ajar a light shining through it catching her eyes draco she asked pushing the door open a bit further sticking her head into the room what she found surprised her slightly it was a room not much larger than any of the bedrooms but each was aligned with a bookcase with books almost falling off the shelves they were that full she knew her dad liked to read but this was ridiculous this was something alex though only her mother could be possible of what do you want granger draco asked bringing alex back into reality he was sitting in a small armchair beneath a table light a thick book lay open on his lap suddenly alex felt bad for interrupting him oh um well their decorating the christmas tree and maddy and chelsea want you to help them and your mum wants you to take some boxes downstairs she trailed off ass she entered the library looking at the books on the shelves okay draco replied closing his book standing up he slowly made his way toward the door but stopped when alex didntfollow him granger are you coming draco asked looking at her slightly annoyed huh what she was looking at a picture it wasntas old as the ones of her parents at school but it was still pretty old in the frame was her father and draco father draco they each looked like they were in their earlier twenties and neither men were smiling that was just before my dad came back to england draco said standing at the desk looking at the picture aswell uncle blaise found us me dad and mum when i was two alex looked at the picture carefully standing behind the two men was lydia holding a tiny draco draco why did your dad leave alex asked as he turned back toward the door he shrugged slightly i guess he was afraid he paused he was our age when he left he didntwant to follow the dark side and he said if he stayed his father would have forced him to so why did he come back alex asked understanding what draco meant before he explained his first answer i mean my mum she came back for me so that i could have a proper family even though it meant facing my dad again which i guess turned out pretty well draco looked at her carefully alex looked away but she could still feel his grey eyes studying her for any sign that she was going to use this information against him i guess it the same my mum said uncle blaise found them when they were on holiday in france he had been looking for someone else i guess that was your mum and he found us he convinced my dad it was alright to come back here that we d be better here then back in the us he said slowly explaining everything to himself as much as he was explaining it to alex do you wish he stayed in the us alex finally asked do you wish your mum stayed in new york with you he answered immediately without thinking about the question alex shook her head there your answer then draco replied besides i donteven remember living there we had moved here before i turned three oh alex replied finally following him out of the library together without any insulting comments or snide remarks they carried the boxes down the stairs and intot he lounge where chelsea and maddy wee running around screaming about the tree and their parents were magically putting the decorations on the tree hey draco protested as his father levitated a bauble onto a top branch it no fun when you do it like that and he grabbed one of his sisters and began to tickle her on the ground as the other one began to sulk hey maddy alex said picking up a star out of the box can you help me put this on the tree and she lifted the small girl onto her shoulders and pointed to a higher branch and she tried to put the decoration on okay time for bed draco snr said lifting the twins up in the air nooo maddy began to wail yeah we want to see santa daddy chelsea began to complain a n ok i was pretty sure that you say father christmas in england but here in good old aust we say what ever and santa fit here but santa will only come and leave present when little girls go to bed draco told them leading them toward the door you want to get presents right chelsea looked at maddy neither of them spoke until chelsea nodded yes we want presents daddy maddy finally said grabbing his hand and pulling him out the room hermione tried not to giggle i think i better go help him lydia said leaving blaise and hermione by the christmas tree together draco had disappeared straight after dinner and alex had left shortly after something about sending an owl to nicole hermione watched as blaise carefully placed another piece of wood in the fire before he returned to the couch she leaned against him taking in his smell of christmas cookies mixed with the pizza alex and draco idea of tea in his clothes soon as they sat in comfortable silence listening only to the cracking of the fire the hours passed and it reached eleven fifty five blaise i going to bed she said quietly pulling herself away from him knowing alex she will probably be up before the twins tomorrow hermione wait blaise pulled her back on the couch standing up himself he moved over to a cabinet next to the christmas tree and hermione watched intrigued as he rummaged around in the drawer the clock quietly chimed signalling that it was midnight hermione stood up again merry christmas blaise she said he turned around giving her a nervous grin merry christmas he took her back and made her sit on the couch oh come one blaise i tired we have to be up early cantwe just go to bed she pouted blaise knelt in front of her you can once i ve given you your christmas present he reached into his pocket hermione ron once gave this back to me but now i returning it to it rightful owner he took her hand and when she did not object he carefully took the ring out of his pocket i want you to wear it so that you have a reminder of how much i love you he slid it on to her left ring finger the finger that had worn this ring once before hermione stared at the ring for a second it had killed her giving this to ron to give back to blaise somehow returning it made it officially over blaise i think you can finish your tapestry soon she smiled but did not continue as their eyes met carefully he stood and took her hand before leading her up the stairs to the master bedroom surprisingly none of the children neither the twins or draco or alex in the zabini manor was awake before ten the next morning not even the twins carefully pulling her slippers on her bare feet alex excitedly climbed out of her bed preparing to wake up draco who was undoubtly asleep it was supposed to be her sweet revenge but she figured it wasntreally revenge anymore since they had gotten along pretty well the day before opening the her bedroom door she came face to face with a wide awake draco who was wearing bright red flannelette pyjamas you know red isntreally your colour alex remarked as she side stepped him and decided to wake her parents silently praying that they would both be fully clothed hey you never know just cos i dontwrite that stuff into the story okay i just weird but before she had even put her hand on the door knob the door opened and both teenagers came face to face with blaise good morning alex he said kissing her gently on the cheek merry christmas draco is mum awake alex asked as he began to make his way downstairs i believe i down here lex hermione voice came from the bottom of the staircase your father and i have been up for a while merry christmas professor granger draco called out leaning over the railing merry christmas ad draco it hermione came the reply alex too leant over the railing to see draco parents her mother and now her father all standing in the foyer below cups of coffee in their hands pyjamas still on it christmas and you didntthink to wake me alex asked her voice full of disgust we thought we d wait for the twins to wake up blaise replied his hand sliding around hermione waist they re still asleep draco asked evilly alex come on i never get to wake the twins up on christmas alex followed the boy into the room that was decorated pink to see two small blonde lumps in each of the beds draco jumped on on and began to tickle her while alex gently sat on the edge of the bed chelsea she said quietly and gently shook her shoulder chelsea time to wake up it christmas time with that the girl immediately opened her eyes just as maddy began to squeal from draco tickling merry christmas chels alex said as the girl adjusted to waking up alex picked her up and followed draco out of the room who was being dragged downstairs by maddy finally the twins had given out and unwrapped every last present that was under the christmas tree alex who had seen her mother engagement ring as soon as she got downstairs had loved the present from her father and was planning to wear it to the potter party the owls came shortly before they began to eat the traditional christmas meal that lydia had insisted on making first came hedwig the potter snowy white owl it carried a large lumpy package and two cards one which was dropped with the package at hermione feet the other which was dropped into draco snr hands the package contained three blue knitted jumpers which ginny had explained were from mrs weasley and they would be getting their presents from her and harry when they saw them inside each envelope was a christmas card and invitation to the potter party which surprised the malfoy a little since while they didntexactly hate each other anymore harry and draco werentexactly friends next came the familiar brown owl which was sent from logan and georgie it dropped a small package which contained both photos from the school trip and a charm bracelet which had enchanted charms on it the last owl a midnight black one flew to draco jnr which surprised him since sam had gone overseas for christmas it was from nicole and contained two cards one for himself and one for alex it explained that she hoped they were having a good christmas and she would see them soon finally between eating the turkey and the christmas pudding alex realised that she had actually enjoyed christmas even spending it with the malfoy s since this was her family her dad family which meant that it was her family too a n okay there the chapter i thought i d have it up sooner but being sick and with school starting again i didnthave the time and yes i know then ending is sort of crap again i guess i just find it hard to write good ending and i dontlike putting cliff hangers since they annoy me when i read stories please review hopefully i ll have a couple more chapters up during the week ends luv emgurl disclaimer dontown anything you recognise from the books a n okay so yes i did say i would update sooner but my flu actually got worse and my mum wouldntlet me out of bed or give me a pen and paper to write on 9cos she thought it was homework then when i finally got better which was on the tuesday i had heaps of school work to catch up on so i am sorry for not being able to update sooner and making everyone wait anyway here is the next chapter alex we re waiting her fathers voice came into her bedroom from what it sounded like blaise was at the bottom of the stairs she ignored him and turned back to the mirror for the hundredth time her normally curl hair hung dead straight flowing past her shoulder carefully she smoothed out the non existent creases in her purple dress the material swaying gently across her knees the pendant that her father had given her hung delicately around her neck applying a ruby pink lip gloss to her lips finishing off her natural look make up alex wrapped herself in her red coat picked up her bag that was sitting on the bed and finally made her way down the stairs finally draco jr exclaimed everyone ignored him okay blaise began as he walked toward the door let go he opened the door revealing two black cars waiting out the front hermione who was holding maddy hand followed him out to the door step with the rest of the malfoy close behind slightly confused alex stood in the doorway why dontwe just floo there she asked wouldntit be quicker you cantfloo there draco told her as if it was the most obvious thing in the world besides it not as if were in such a big rush to see riley are we he finished in a teasing voice she ignored him waiting for one of the adults to reply to her what draco means is that because there are still death eaters in azkaban it too risky for them to have floo set up in case one of them breaks out and goes after harry family lydia explained as draco followed his father to the second car alex just enjoy the trip hermione told her climbing into he car with blaise and maddy slowly she made her way to the first car climbing in sitting opposite to her mother and father a n i picture the cars to be like limo on the inside but i cantbe bothered describing it once everyone had their seatbelts on the car began to move out of the zabini estate and was soon travelling along the streets of muggle london after twenty minutes or so of listening to maddy sing songs about nonsense and her parents talking the cars pulled into what resembled the country side soon they pulled into a new estate and before finally stopping in front of a house stepping out of the car alex had the chance to take in the huge house it was just as big as the zabini manor but while her fathers house was in a red brick this was built with a white wash stone above the main entrance was a magnificent balcony which looked to open from a ballroom she followed her parents and maddy to the door as the malfoy got out of their car suddenly the nerves of seeing riley again set in hermione waited for the malfoy to join them on the door step before she knocked on the door once she did it was lung open by ginny weasley hermione she squealed as if she was sixteen again pulling he brunette into a tight hug come in harry she called their here harry appeared from a door to the left of the entrance his jet black hair sticking up slightly happy new year he called excitedly shaking blaise hand before kissing hermione and alex both on the cheek finally he turned to the malfoy s each of the twins now holding onto their parents tightly ginny hermione and blaise watched harry carefully draco lydia did you have a good christmas he asked them brightly holding his hand out to draco it appeared to be a form of peace offering hesitantly draco took it both men looked at each other understanding that the past was the past everyone upstairs ginny told hermione taking their coats before showing the group upstairs into the ballroom here they found the entire weasley family mr and mrs weasley were talking to some people hermione didntknow fred and george were playing with the younger weasley children charlie was talking to bill wife fleur while bill jess and ron were talking to ben walker other hogwart teachers were their aswell professor snape professor brown the substitute charms teacher professor bertie the herbolog teachers then there were the remaining order members no body seemed to notice the new group of guests who were being escorted by the hosts except for one person nicole weasley alex she squealed your finally here weasley give her some space draco sneered as nicole hugged her tightly shut up draco alex replied jokingly draco opened his mouth to reply but closed it again as the two girls walked off leaving him with the adults hermione watched as blaise and draco drifted off towards ron and bill while harry tried to get ginny to dance with him but after no luck he took lydia for a dance while maddy and chelsea began a game with fred and george and the other weasley kids so did you have a good christmas ginny asked her slyly handing her a glass of wine hermione looked at her so far the only people who knew about their engagement were alex and the malfoy s she glanced at blaise who was now talking to ben it was fantastic she replied grinning at ginny blaise asked me to marry him she heard ginny gasp before the red head grabbed her hand finally noticing the ring oh my god hermione you said yes to him that fantastic ginny squealed what fantastic and what did you say yes to ron asked from behind his sister looking confused blaise and hermione are getting married ginny said hermione looked at ron waiting for his response expecting it to be disappointment or anger she knew how he felt about blaise instead he face turned into a broad grin that great news i really happy for you mione he said referring to her hogwarts nickname really hermione asked unsure why really he replied hugging her tightly but if her hurts you again i swear he ll be sorry he kissed her on the top of the forehead breaking apart hermione saw that blaise who smiled at her was watching her her brown eyes locked on his blue ones she knew that he wouldnthurt her again wait you actually had a good christmas with malfoy nicole asked her for what seemed like the seventh time alex nodded but she hadntactually heard nicole question not properly anyway she was too busy searing the room for a set of emerald green eyes beneath that messy ash red hair she couldntfind him and the nerves in her stomach were replaced by a stab of disappointment that he wasntwaiting for her nicole continued talking to her but she couldntmake out any of the words draco soon joined them but before he had the chance to speak alex excused herself and pretended she need to use the bathroom standing in the hallway she realised she didntknow where the bathroom was but she wasntready to go back in and talk to her friends instead she decided to wander the floor she was on in hope of finding the bathroom of course slowly she came to hallway and she began to walk along it hoping to find the bathroom the pictures along the wall waved and grinned at her as she looked at them finally she came to a door which had the word bathroom across it silently she pushed the door opened and stepped inside putting her purse on the bench she turned the tap on and watched as the water flowed into he basin she turned the tap off picked her purse back up and walked back towards the door she collided with professor walker in the hallway miss granger he said i hope you had a good break alex nodded noticing the dark purple bags beneath his eyes and the tiredness that filled his voice i have she responded quietly yes very good it means you will be ready fro the new school term he spoke but he was distracted and it didntseem as if he was actually talking to her she watched as he entered the bathroom before she made her way back down the hallway toward the potter ballroom a door to her right suddenly swung opened and riley came out hurriedly not even noticing she was there quietly she followed him down the hall watching him scold himself for reasons unknown to her finally he stopped in the doorway of the ballroom alex stopped a few feet behind him watching as he scanned the room moments later a look of disappointment spread across his face excuse me alex said loudly enough for him to hear her but your blocking the door way he turned to face her she grinned at him and he wrapped his arms around her pulling her into a warm hug where have you been nicole demand as riley entered the ballroom alex slightly behind him their hands clasped together no where riley replied carelessly sitting a chair pulling alex onto his lap facing the fact that she probably wouldntget an answer nicole turned back to her conversation with draco who was eying the other two suspiciously so you really have been in your room all night alex asked him as he played with her hair seriously he said absentmindly i got bored so i decided to take my broom out and i lost track of time oh was all alex could say he continued to play with her hair his fingers every now and then grazing the back of her neck or shoulders did you have good christmas he asked her draco wasntto much of a git alex laughed softly and shook her head it was alright just alright maybe one last present will turn it into pretty good riley joked but alex knew he was being serious you didntneed to get me anything riley she said facing him his green eyes making her heart melt well i did he said shrugging but if you dontwant it i guess i can give it to some other girl alex pouted at him well if you do that i guess i could just give your present to draco then he cut her off covering her mouth with his follow me he whispered standing up heading toward the doorway slowly alex followed him grabbing his present which was inside her bag she followed him back down the hall way and into the room which she watched him come out from inside it was a typical teenage boy room clothes and books and other things were strewn across the floor but his bed was neatly mad and a gold box lay neatly on the edge of the red quilt silently she sat on his bed and handed him the gift wrapped in white paper merry christmas she said giving him a small smile he placed the gift she gave him on the bed and picked up the gold box handing it to her merry christmas he replied kissing her gently on the cheek she took the box and he picked up the gift she had given him they both waited for the other to begin to unwrap their own presents but when alex didn t riley slowly pulled the stick tape off the paper i wasntsure what to get you draco tried to help me pick it out she said nervously it great riley exclaimed examining the black and gold metal watch you got draco to help you he looked at her one of his eyebrows raised slightly alex shook her head no but i needed some one to blame if you didntlike she responded a smile playing on his lips she was glad he liked it it had taken her ages to find and she had actually given up and was looking in the quidditch shop for logan when it caught her eyes she being a quidditch hater even thought it was cute with its little snitch on the second hand which seemed perfect since that was riley position well i love it he said pushing his shirt sleeve up and wrapping the cool metal around his wrist your turn he said motioning toward the gold box on her lap carefully alex untied the gold ribbon and slipped it off the bow slowly she lifted up the lid to reveal a dark purple leather diary with a lock and a silver fountain pen laying on top of white tissue paper i wrote a message inside of it riley said nervously before alex had the chance to say anything she unlocked the journal and turned to the first page alex merry christmas love riley original alex said grinning at the redhead well um yeah i thought you could use it to write your music in that why every second page is music paper and my mum enchanted it so that the pages never run out he said quickly riley this is really great alex said re locking the book and placing it back inside the box i know you already had your bleu one but this one locks that way other people cantread it riley cheeks turned a violent shade of red as he accidentally let his secret out that he had read her book that a good idea she said softly crawling onto his lap wrapping her arms around his neck she kissed him slowly before gently pulling away he pulled her closer and kissed her again suddenly they were interrupted by a loud continuous beep what the hell riley shouted standing up letting alex fall to the floor ow she replied not really in any pain though she grabbed his wrist and puled her self up riley looking frantically around his room to find the beeping it the watch she said pressing the small button on the side of the face draco said he was going to set it to freak you out i didntthink he was serious the beeping finally stopped leaving alex and riley standing in the middle of his room silence surrounded them i could kill draco for interrupting that riley thought to himself angrily oh my god i could kiss draco right now what if my dad found out oh my god alex smiled sweetly at her boyfriend as the horror filled her of what might have happened if they hadntbeen interrupted riley put a hand on the back of her neck and leant down again only for alex to pull away this time um i think nikki might be looking for us she said quickly walking out of his room she was halfway down the hallway before riley had even processed what had happened five four three two one happy new years shouts of joy and laughter came from the potter party happy new year blaise whispered into hermione ear from behind he wrapped his arms securely around her waist together on the potters balcony they watched the fireworks from london fill the sky happy new year blaise she responded leaning back her head fining his shoulder a spray of gold and red stars filled the sky to be followed by a shower of silver and green ones she turned to face him their eyes locking on the others would you like to dance blaise asked smiling kindly at her hermione nodded her brown curls bouncing slowly around her face i d love to and together they danced alone on the balcony as the sky exploded with whizzing stars and new colours showered over them he watched them from the shadows of the balcony they thought they were alone but he watched them in silence hating every moment of it at that precise moment it took every ounce of his strength not to reach and curse blaise zabini for he had stolen something that was his something he loved something he probably wouldntget back her love now blaise was going to pay a n okay there the chapter i hope you enjoyed hermione creepy stalker is definitely back init now and even though some of you may know who it is you might be wrong he probably wontbe revealed for another few chapters though but i will definitely

at school for three weeks anyway here the new chapter enjoy p s you all need to remember my story began before hbp so it does not follow any spoilers meaning dumbledore is still in it alex nicole voice came from somewhere around her bed the sound of the red head walking around her bed waking her up alex the red head tried again pulling open the curtains of the brunette bed whaa at alex said yawning sitting up it saturday let me sleep what nicole asked looking a bit confused groans came from the various other beds of the sleeping girls charlie and kimmie are arriving today yeah so their not getting here until this after noon let me sleep alex pleaded lying back down covering her head with her pillow um alex it almost twelve thirty they ll be here in about an hour nicole trailed off seeing it still wasntgetting a response from alex what came the squeals alex recognised as natalie and jess what what going sam muffled voice came from the bed opposite alex s who died i guess i wontbe getting anymore sleep alex mumbled dragging her self out of her bed no one died why would you ask that any way sam just shrugged and climbed out of the bed and walked into the girl bathroom happy i up alex said grouchily to nicole as she rummaged through her trunk for some clean clothes very nicole replied bouncing cheerfully out of the room hermione put the books down on the table she had come to this library almost everyday when she was at hogwarts and the amount of books it contained never seemed to startle her she sighed as the light caught her engagement ring and instead of opening the books she had just placed on the table she sat on the hard wooden chair and just stared at the delicate stone set in the white gold on her finger she was happy now it was everything she wanted for fifteen years just to be with him and now now they were getting their second chance their opportunity to be together their happy ending professor granger a gentle voice came startling hermione who was still in her trance professor dumbledore she said standing quickly is there a problem no no everything fine he chuckled sitting down his blue eyes twinkling behind his half moon spectacles i am here simply to express my happiness for you and blaise hermione looked at her old headmaster unsure of how he had found out since they were yet to announce their engagement officially i think you need to blame the female half of the potter family for me finding out dumbledore smiled at her thank you professor hermione said smiling softly at him on another topic however blaise has assured me that you have organised everything for when out visitors from fascino quas arrive dumbledore looked at her a bit more seriously now although the twinkle was still as it is always present in his eyes yes they will be arriving here just before two hermione nodded class schedules and room requirements have already been organised for the students as have the eating arrangements for tonight very well then dumbledore said i must be getting off i was hoping to visit hogsmeade before they arrive please express my congratulations to blaise for me hermione nodded again see you this afternoon professor riley let the wind whip against his face it stung but still he flew higher circling the empty quidditch pitch finally he stopped and hovered just above the goal post for a moment watching the horizon in the distance he could see his uncles fred and george entering the castle grounds with his dad in the opposite direction he watched as his other team mates re entered the castle their red quidditch uniforms blowing around their feet the cool air whipped around him again making him shiver carefully he landed his broom and put his feet on the soft green grass of the quidditch pitch the sound of clapping came to his ears you re a very good flyer professor walker said as riley turned to face him just like your father i suppose um yeah riley replied uncertain as to why the professor was watching him fly now riley thr professor continued unaware of the boys discomfort i see you ve been having a little difficulty in your history assignments and i ve been thinking it would be best if i were able to tutor you on tuesday and thursday nights after classes that is until your grades pick up again um okay riley said as professor walker walked toward him i guess that would be fine excellent excellent walker mumbled more to him self then to riley well i must be off i was hopping to see professor brown in the greenhouses before lunch riley watched as the professor walked away talking to himself shrugging it off he walked the familiar path to the gryffindor change rooms hello blaise looked up from the conversation he was having with ron weasley to see hermione standing in front of them carrying at least five thick books hello he said back kissing her on the cheek taking three of the books having a good day so far yeah it been good dumbledore sends his congratulations she smiled at him ron where jess i wanted to show her some pictures i found ron shrugged i dunno she said something about cleaning out the old divination class room for the fascino quas students but it wouldnthave taken her this long okay thanks see you this afternoon she kissed blaise on the cheek again taking the books back before bounding down the hall in the direction of their old divination classroom blaise watched as she walked away from them he turned back to ron happy to restart the conversation again but found that ron had disappeared alex sat in the great hall a little bored fidgeting with the hem of her black hogwarts robes nicole was sitting besides her talking excitedly to her friend daniel and the other gryffindor fifth years looking u alex found draco and sam sitting a little down the table from them in what looked like a very private conversation she glanced around again hoping to find riley but the red heads she found belonged to the weasley s she sighed and continued to fidget with her hem she glanced at her watch again it was 1 25 the students in the rutilus house would be arriving soon meaning she was getting to spend the week with charlie and kimmie she was excited about it but there was just something that didntmake her hyped up not like she felt when she was about to see logan and georgie again suddenly the doors to the great hall opened and professor dumbledore casually strode in followed by her mother harry and fred and george weasley the chatter in the great hall died down as dumbledore stood at the front smiling at hem good afternoon he said slowly as the weasley twins and hermione and harry sat at the table next to blaise ginny and ron t day our guests from fascino quas will be arriving for the first time i trust that you will most certainly be on your best behaviour at this alex felt someone sit beside her she looked up and found riley watching the teachers with a look of confusion across his face she turned back to the staff table to find her parents standing once again heading towards the great hall dumbledore had sat down and the student voices filled the hall again hey alex said to riley who was still watching the teachers table hello oh uh hey he smiled at her but still continued to watch the teachers what up she asked nothing he answered as the food for their lunch appeared on the table he grabbed a sandwich and turned toward draco and sam before alex could continue her questioning wow i still cantbelieve it a real castle kimmie said excitedly as they followed nicole back into the entrance hall finally finishing the out of hogwarts alex smiled at her yeah it gets a bit confusing sometimes she glanced at charlie who had been oddly quite since they had arrived so hows georgie alex asked him she watched as he paled slightly then turned away involving himself into a conversation with some of the other boys in his house did i miss something alex said turning to nicole and kimmie they had a fight kimmie whispered as the three girls glanced back at the blonde boy neither of them will talk about it georgie been pretty upset though alex nodded unsure as to why logan or even georgie for that amtter0 had not told her about what had happened she had defiantly kept georgie informed about what was going on with riley she even told her what had happened over christmas praying that she had enough sense not to tell logan things were changing and they were growing apart hermione sat next to jess and ginny at the staff table watching as the students ate the great feast that was being held in honour of the special guest she scanned the room the dark purple robes scattered throughout the black hogwarts ones suddenly she felt extremely tired finally her eyes came to rest on a group of students all weasley sitting at the gryffindor table she smiled dreamily as she remembered seeing the weasley sitting at the very same table back in her first year they had encouraged her to sit with them after she had been sorted shortly being joined by ron she glanced across at her best friend who was talking to harry presumably about quidditch he caught her eye and smiled back at her before turning back to harry he had changed sure every one changed over fifteen years but to hermione he was still the same old ron hermione ginny nudged her in the ribs ow she whimpered rubbing her side what ben he looking at you weird again ginny whispered careful not to make eye contact with the other teacher hermione looked down at the other end of the staff table where blaise was sitting wit the fascino quas teachers and she found ginny was right ben walker was watching her closely a little too closely she thought she shook her head and turned away but the rest of the night she couldnthelp but feel like someone was watching her once dinner was finished and most of the students and teachers had evacuated the great hall blaise stood and moved toward his fianc as he walked toward her she snapped her head up quickly before giving him a smile blaise couldnthelp but notice that it seemed relieved hey are you alright blaise asked as he sat in the seat that ginny had just evacuated i fine just a little tired i guess hermione said quietly blaise nodded i guess i have to take you to bed then he stood up and took her hand leading her out of the great hall no blaise i mean it i really am tired i want to go to bed to sleep hermione protested i know came blaise simple reply as they entered the dungeons soon they were walking past his room and he surprised hermione by not stopping since they had spent every night in there together since they had been back at hogwarts finally they came to hermione small room dumbledore still wanted her to stay in there next to snape just in case anything funny happened especially since only few people knew where she was living goodnight my dear love blaise said in a singsong voice as he helped hermione into bed good night blaise hermione whispered back she was asleep before blaise had even reached the door quietly he closed the door and made his way back down the cold dark corridor his thought still with the sleeping brunette wham blaise fell to the floor instantly as something hard hit the back of his head he was knocked unconscious as his face hit the cold stone floor from the force blaise woke the next morning with a searing pain in his head it was excruciating and the light coming from the windows were not helping either he didntremember there being windows in the dungeons he opened his eyes and tried to focus but instantly closed them again the light blinding him blaise hermione soft voice came from beside him but he still did not open his eyes mmm he answered blaise professor dumbledore repeated this time on instinct blaise opened his eyes this time focusing after a minute he was in the hospital wing hermione was sitting in a chair beside him while harry dumbledore and snape were standing at the end of his bed where is he he could hear alex voice from the waiting room what why am i in here blaise asked the pain in his head becoming worse blaise dumbledore began you were found unconscious not far from hermione room snape found you dad alex cried as she entered the room she flung her arms around her father neck alex please hermione said sternly alex let go of blaise and stood behind her mother what how he suddenly had trouble stringing a sentence together you were attacked presumably by the same person who tried to attack riley and alex harry said slowly do you remember anything blaise shook his head the last thing he remembered was saying goodnight to hermione he looked at the brunette who was slightly pale blaise if you remember anything anything at all you need to tell us dumbledore said i don t blaise said looking at the old man snape and dumbledore turned to leave the hospital wing professor hermione voice stopped them what going to happen with the students this guys already tried to attack two students it not safe for them hermione dumbledore looked at her then at harry harry and i have discussed it we will be doing everything we can to make sure no other attack occurs a n okay well yes i guess most of that was a but of nonsense but i needed to vent a the moment i have no idea what going to happen next but dontworry i will update soon i do have a few ideas anyway please review luv emgurl disclaimer still dontown anything you recognise hey thanks for the great reviews okay i am going to tell you this all now hermione stalker is not ron i just wanted to get that off my chest anyway hope you like this chapter alex sat in the cold astronomy tower it was dark and the stars were shining brightly behind the various clouds that filled the sky she watched as a small spot in the sky came closer growing as it did finally it was close enough for her to recognise it as logan and georgie owl she watched and waited as the owl flew into and around the astronomy tower before landing gracefully on the windowpane alex stood and made her way over to the owl untying the letter that was hanging from it left claw she watched as the owl flew away becoming a small dot in the distance sitting back down on the cold stone she unfolded the piece of parchment and she found logan familiar scrawl filled the piece of parchment hey lex thanks for the great christmas resents sorry i haventwritten sooner everything been a bit crazy lately uncle ben didntturn up for christmas again and mum going frantic saying he missing and stuff then everything with georgie and charlie who i suppose is already at hogwarts with kimmie by now has been driving me mental anyway how are you you need to write to me more i need contact with a normal person every now and then too we miss you love logan a tear actually fell as alex finished reading the letter this was not how everything was supposed to turn out her family was not supposed to be attacked her boyfriend wasntsupposed to ignore her attempts of talking to him and most of all her friends werentsupposed to keep secrets from her on tuesday they finally let blaise out of the hospital wing hermione however would not let him do a single thing i ve already talked to professor snape she told him he said you donthave to start teaching again until your completely healed i am completely healed blaise protested as hermione made him sit down in his room that why they let me out of the hospital wing he winced as a stabbing pain shot through his head no blaise our not completely healed they only let you out because you kept complaining she paused but no i have a class to teach please promise me you ll stay here and try to get some rest blaise nodded and watched as hermione closed the door and listened as she put several locking charms on his room he knew that they werentjust in case he tried to leave okay and to charm the water into ice al you need to do is swish your wand like this hermione paused as she demonstrated the swishingness a n new word haha then you say fons congelo she watched the fourth years as they looked on in awe as the water in her glass turned to ice i want each of you to try this charm by next lesson i want it perfected she said calmly as she sat down at her desk for a couple of minutes she watched her class try the charm amazingly the small group of fascino quas fourth years that ha joined this class for the week picked the spell up immediately smiling to her self she opened her drawer and took out a quill and some parchment ready to make notes for her next class fifth years illusional charms she wrote on the top of the paper before underlining it once but before she could continue writing apiece of parchment lying on top of her other quills and parchment in her open drawer caught her eye a black piece of parchment with a shaking hand hermione picked the paper up and found that it was simply addressed to her once again written in silver in ink she looked up to her class to find that they were still practising their charms mister weasley she said motioning to paul i need you to watch the class for my for a moment i give you permission to deduct house points while i am gone paul paled slightly as a group of slytherin looked at him evilly taking the black folded parchment hermione left the classroom and made her way towards the defence against dark arts classrooms she knocked on the door before realising that harry did not have a class at that time she opened the door finding harry sitting at his desk bent over a large piece of parchment he looked up as hermione entered the classroom pushing his glass back up the bridge of his nose hermione he said smiling before becoming confused dontyou have classes hermione nodded her hand still trembling she placed the black parchment on harry desk i found this in my desk her voice cracked harry looked down at the parchment then back at the witch i think we need to see dumbledore again what does it say harry asked her standing up moving toward his bookshelf he took a thick book of the shelf and placed it on the desk waiting of hermione response i dontknow i haventopened it hermione said slowly harry hands left the book and picked up the parchment he turned it over carefully studying it do you mind he asked hermione shook her head and watched as harry unfolded the back paper she watched as his eyes moved across the page his face expressionless your right we need to see dumbledore harry told her looking up from the paper he strode toward the door are you coming he turned to hermione who was still sitting at her desk riley sat in his potions class unaware of the girl who was watching him he was listening to professor snape which was rather odd since riley had difficulty listening in any of his lessons professor zabini was no where to be seen and he vaguely remembered alex telling him he was in the hospital wing the day before he forgot to ask her why he glanced at the brunette who had been watching him only minutes ago now she was talking to charlie who looked a bit odd in the dungeons with his bright purple fascino quas robes on especially against the lime green potion that was in alex and sam cauldron he glanced at the piece of parchment that was stuffed into his school robes it was an application form then he glanced back at alex suddenly he felt sick professor i not feeling too well riley said as snape walked past him inspecting their potions may i please be excused to go to the hospital wing snape nodded and as riley left the classroom he could feel alex eyes upon him he had to tell her soon harry i have to go back to my class hermione said as she followed him to dumbledore office she had suddenly remembered she had left paul in charge chocolate snails harry said to the gargoyle before turning to hermione i think this is more important besides i pretty sure ginny would have walked past there by now and saved him how do i know that if you wont even tell me what it says hermione protested as she followed harry up the steps dumbledore was sitting at his desk and harry and hermione entered his office harry hermione what do i have the pleasure of company this time he said looking up from his papers harry simply handed him the black parchment no one spoke as he read the letter i see dumbledore said his voice less cheerful now hermione where did you find this in my desk drawer in my classroom hermione sad sitting down sir what does it say harry wouldntlet me read it dumbledore looked at harry who looked away and handed the black parchment over the desk to hermione she took the paper and looked down at the now familiar silver scrawl next time he wontbe so lucky soon you and your filthy daughter will be mine hermione shivered she put the parchment back on dumbledore desk is blaise still in the hospital wing dumbledore asked her she shook her head slowly i took him to his room this morning she said in a small voice harry stood and looked at dumbledore who nodded toward him before leaving the office hermione stood too hermione where are you going dumbledore asked standing too i have a class hermione replied calmly but as soon as she stepped outside dumbledore office the tears began to fall harry strode quickly down into the dungeons and o blaise room he knocked on the door loudly before removing his wand and undoing the locking charms that were placed on the room finally as he was undoing the final one blaise opened the door bleary eyed obviously he had been asleep harry he asked harry entered the room without waiting for blaise to let him you need to com e with me he said quickly why what going on he asked rubbing his eyes where hermione she in dumbledore office harry said she was sent another letter c mon we need to get alex aswell silently blaise followed harry to the potions classroom to get his daughter he watched from the door way as harry spoke quickly with snape before moving toward alex soon the three of them were waling quickly back up the steps of the dungeons and towards dumbledore office when hermione finally go back to her classroom she had composed herself inside she found the students working quietly and jess weasley sitting at her desk hermione your back she said standing up a little piece of advice dontleave paul in charge of your class next time hermione nodded although not listening to what she was saying she smiled as best as she could back at the witch and waited for her to leave the class room before she collapsed in the chair behind her desk her students were too busy working to notice anything wrong with their teacher five minutes later ron and jess all returned to the classroom hermione sat helplessly and jess directed the students out of the classroom sending them back tot heir houses until lunch hermione ron said gently you need to come with us hermione ignored him and stared intently at the back of the room her eyes becoming glassy jess hugged her you should have told me you should have stayed with dumbledore she whispered as ron pulled his wife off her hermione still did not say anything she didntspeak when ron lifted her out of the chair she didntspeak when he carried her back into dumbledore office only then did she let out a whimper only when she was safely in blaise arms alex sat numbly in the headmaster office once again she knew why she was here it had happened again this guy had done something else to her family she knew when professor potter pulled her out of the classroom she knew when she saw her mother collapse in her father arms she felt sick she wasntsure why but as soon as ron had entered the room she crawled on to his lap like when she was five and he used to play peekaboo with her even though they had never been in any real danger alex had always felt safer when her uncle ron would visit them in america it never mattered whether or into he bought aunty jess or paul only that he came dumbledore finally spoke ot them all from this moment on wards i do not want blaise hermione or alex to be alone dumbledore told them all this means you are all to watch them even if means they never get any privacy it also means no late night visits to the astronomy tower he said pointedly to alex i have already arranged to have three connecting rooms set up one for harry and ginny one for blaise and hermione and one for alex the adults nodded but alex stayed still harry i want you to stick with blaise until we can find this person ron you with hermione he paused before turning back to alex alex i need you to stay with a teacher at all times it is very important that you do that for your safety i will be informing all of the teachers of the situation until then i would prefer it if you stayed in you rooms they are situated on the sixth floor harry is aware of where they are and what the password is alex sat in her new room most of her things had been bough in from her dorm silently she pulled a piece of parchment out of bag and took out her pink pen ignoring the silver pen that riley had given her she began to write dear logan everything fine here kimmie and charlie seem to be having a good time by the way could someone please tell me what is going on with him and georgie anyway like i said nothing that interesting has happened here i miss you too love from alex p s i think you should write to nicole she put her pen down and looked at the school owl sitting on the edge of her bed carefully she tied the parchment to its leg and opened the window allowing it to fly away a n okay there the chapter so a few questions arising here what going on with georgie and charlie what is riley keeping secret from alex why isntalex telling logan the truth and the big one who is the crazy stalker hopefully i ll be able to update soon please review luv emgurl disclaimer still dontown anything you recognise from the books hey thanks again to all my fantastic reviewers by the way i forgot to mention this in the last chapter but riley application form was completed and approved i d decided on that before i uploaded the chapter but i forgot to add it in if i have enough time i ll go back and change it hope you enjoy this chapter blaise slowly opened his eyes the next morning he wasntused to waking with light coming in from the windows into from living in the dungeons for most of the year and even when he was at his own home he had managed to work a blackout charm on his windows he closed his eyes again trying to block the light out and get back his lost sleep when the brunette beside him moved he breathed her scent in and traced her hand with the tips of his fingers that was across his chest she moved again pulling her hand away from blaise and underneath her chin sighing slightly blaise knew that the light was not going to leave so he wasntgoing to sleep carefully he climbed out of the bed and quietly he closed the door behind him and sat on the couch in the small sitting room that separated the three rooms footsteps and muffled whispers could be heard from harry and ginny room which blaise ignored he glanced at the door which opened to alex room it was slightly ajar panic rising in blaise chest he stood quickly grabbed the door handle and pushed the door open only to find alex asleep in her bed calming down blaise let out a sigh of relief he sat in the chair opposite the girls bed she looked so much like hermione yet the zabini blood was so obvious she stirred slightly but did not wake only turning in her sleep blaise carefully stood up and went back into the sitting room not wanting to wake her either good morning blaise ginny weasley voice came morning blaise said softly he looked up at the redhead who looked as tired as blaise felt where harry he went to see dumbledore and then i think he was going to the kitchens ginny replied sitting in an armchair i under strict instructions not to let any three of you leave until he gets back blaise nodded well i dontthink that going to be much of a problem they re both asleep still and i dontfeel like wandering around the castle by myself in the early hours of the morning how is hermione ginny asked him quietly blaise took a moment before he replied i think she in shock still he said glancing at their bedroom door she didnttalk much last night ginny nodded good morning alex blaise looked toward his daughter room to find her standing in the doorway she tried to give them a smile but couldnteven force on her face but before anyone could say anything else harry appeared with ron carrying a large tray of food nicole sat down across from riley who busy writing on a piece of parchment at the gryffindor table upon seeing her riley quickly stuffed the quill and parchment back into his robes and began to continue to eat his toast riley nicole said not even noticing the letter or his weird behaviour um i got to go nic he told her hurriedly standing up and exiting the great hall as draco and sam entered it where granger draco asked sitting down next to nicole she glanced at sam who looked back at her neither of the girls had seen alex since potions the day before both becoming extremely worried about her since the house elves had taken most of her stuff out of the dorms but before either of them could reply the doors opened again and alex entered with ginny potter over there sam said causally nicole watched as ginny potter led alex to the table before letting her sit with her friends then moving off to the staff table for a moment no one spoke and it gave nicole the chance to study her friend she had her head down so he brown curls were covering most of her face but it was her hands that distracted nicole mostly they were shaking not so much that it could clearly seen but only slightly the redhead glanced at draco and sam and once convinced they would not be distracted from their conversation into someone else she moved closer to alex who finally looked up at her alex are you okay nicole asked her just as the doors opened once again startled alex turned towards the doors and watched as ben walker stormed into the room followed by a group of fascino quas students and some hufflepuff fifth years nicole too watched professor walker he had a black eye and a bruise on his neck he stormed past most of the teachers on the staff table ginny watching him carefully choosing to sit alone at the end within five minutes he had left the great hall but nicole did not get alex response because charlie and kimmie sat across from them but it was only her that noticed that alex did not speak the entire breakfast not until ginny walked back over to the gryffindor table at the end of breakfast and alex followed her hurriedly out of the great hall harry ron blaise and hermione who was now awake sat in the small sitting room of their secret quarters they were waiting for dumbledore who wanted to ask them some more questions he had sent replacement teachers for all their lessons a temporary one for hermione classes and maybe not so temporary ones for harry and ron classes since they had to follow hermione and blaise everywhere since snape was still there no teacher was required for blaise classes finally dumbledore entered the room and the little conversation that had been going on between harry ron and blaise had stopped hermione was still yet to speak from the night before without saying a word dumbledore conjured a wooden desk hair and situated it in front of hermione then he sat down hermione my dear dumbledore said his voice quiet i need you to tell me if you know of anyone that would want to do this to you anyone at all hermione shook her head she was numb she didntknow of anyone who would want to do this to her then we need to make a list specifically of the people who know you and blaise are back together dumbledore said turning now to blaise professor the letters were sent before they got back together ron pointed out well it needs to be a list of all the people hermione has made contact with in the last few years harry said hardly anyone from hogwarts knows about alex dumbledore nodded taking a quill and piece of parchment out of his pocket ron you may be able to provide some assistance here especially since hermione is still in too much shock to talk yet alex sat at the back of her history of magic classroom staring at the letter she had received on the way there it was from georgie she had read it but hadntreally taken anything in a bit like the class she was in miss granger can you tell me when the trolls over ruled the goblins professor walker asked her turning away from the black bored no alex replied she put the piece of paper down aware that the entire class was watching her well almost the entire class riley who was sitting two seats across from her was bent over his desk only aware of the paper he was writing on and why not professor walker continued because i wasntlistening alex replied the sarcasm growing her voice the three fascino quas students who were in the class smirked at her as the other students turned back to the teacher waiting for his reply that five points from gryffindor miss granger please pay attention professor walker told her turning back toward the blackboard it zabini alex told him hotly since my parents are getting married he turned away from the black bored i believe they are not married yet so until then you shall remain miss granger alex glared at him as he turned back to the blackboard and the class finally looked away from her finally the class ended and alex waited as the students drifted out before she began to pack her book bag she waited at the front desk for professor walker as he cleaned the black board miss granger he sneered as he faced her what are you still doing here you need to take me back to the great hall for lunch alex said calmly well i think you will need to get another teacher to take you he said urgency filling his voice i have an appointment but alex protested as he disappeared out of the classroom swallowing alex walked into the corridor she let out a sigh of relief to find professor brown walking past who stoped when she found alex alone i must talk to professor dumbledore about professor walker everything was explained to us the safety of our students comes first she told her as they entered the great hall alex nodded but did not verbally respond she looked atthe piece of parchment that was crumpled up in her hand as she sat across from charlie this time she took it all in alex logan told me i had to tell you but you have to promise you wontdo anything please me and charlie broke up just after christmas he said we re better off as friends just dontdo anything without thinking about it georgie alex looked across the table at charlie who was talking to nicole so what do you think lex should nic learn drums or the guitar charlie said turning to look at her suddenly she couldnttake it anymore it was too much then without thinking she punched charlie in the face alex nicole cried as she watched the brunette run out of the great hall oh my gosh charlie are you okay dontworry i deserved it he said as one of the teachers hurried over and said a spell to stop the bleeding so where the hospital wing elizabeth montgomery the twins mother ron said slowly then there was hermione old boss at the newspaper mitch no mike hill i think that about it that what you said last time harry mumbled looking at the list it had at least twenty people on it dumbledore turned back to hermione who was leaning against blaise chest both had been silent pretty much the whole time is that everyone he asked her hermione nodded apart from ron and jess she said in a quiet voice well i think we can be excluded ron said quickly blaise you dontknow of anyone do you harry said suddenly ignoring ron comments no blaise replied flatly no it would be some one who knows hermione that why they are attacking blaise because they feel she is being taken away from them dumbledore said but how they got into the castle is unknown to me if only we still had the marauders map ron said thoughtfully what happened to it hermione asked suddenly riley had a little accident with his first wand harry said smiling slightly let just say ginny wontlet him have paper around any naked flames alex ran she didntknow where she was running and she knew she would probably get into trouble for not stying with a teacher but she didntcare about anything finally she collapsed in the library it was empty since the students were at lunch and she let the tears fall btu she didntknow why she was crying all she knew was that everything was falling apart around her alex jess weasley soft voice came finding her on the floor of the library her godmother wrapped her arms tightly around the sobbing teenager it going to be okay she told her stroking the back of her hair somehow jess managed to lift alex to her feet and with an arm wrapped around her she began to lead her out of the library riley the boy looked up from the floor which he had taken to staring at when he walked as his aunt voice called out to him suddenly he realised he near the linrar instead of the great hall where he was supposed to be going for lunch riley jess called him again and he finally turned around to see her holding alex up alex he said softly he moved toward them and wrapped his arms around her shoulders alex buried her head into his chest silently crying what happened he asked his aunt urgently she stressed riley and in shock still i need you to help me take her to your uncle ron she told him she can barely stand up riley yelled at her she not going anywhere fine jess snapped at him you need to go get your uncle ron then i cantleave her by herself i i dontknow where he is riley said confused i haventseen him all day riley he in the oh dontworry i ll go get him just take her back into the library and makes sure she doesnttry to leave jess told him riley nodded before lifting the girl up and carrying her back into the library he heard jess put a locking spell on the room he tried to lay alex down on an armchair but she clung to him so instead they sat alex face still against his chest everything going to be okay he whispered to her rubbing her back gently i ll make sure of it he added silently ron jess burst into the sitting room breathless jess ron said standing what happened it alex jess tried to explain what happened blaise cut in standing next to ron hermione paled not my baby no she whispered jess what happened ron asked again as harry moved next to hermione where alex she in the library i need you to come get her jess said impatiently before she was interrupted again so you left her alone blaise exploded moving toward the portrait hole blaise calm down ron said you need to stay here i ll go get her taking a deep breath blaise nodded and sat back down with harry and hermione you left her alone in the library ron asked his wife quietly as he followed her down the corridor ron do you think i d be that irresponsible jess snapped at him she emotionally drained riley with her i made sure no one could get in they came to the door and jess undid the spell riley looked away from the now sleeping alex as they entered thanks for waiting riley jess said as they made their way toward the two teenagers riley just nodded and let ron lift the sleeping alex off him she woke up riley she said her voice coarse from crying she pushed away from ron i here riley said soothingly squeezing her hand gently she climbed back into his arms i think you need to come with us ron sighed and he led his wife and the two teenagers out of the library and back to the rooms on the sixth corridor ben walker sat slumped in a chair on the opposite side of the room a hooded figure moved around it silently adding various ingredients to the smoking cauldron that stood in the middle he stopped and looked at the only thing in the room that wasnttrashed a single framed photo of her he gently stroked the glass over her hair with an old decayed finger he could almost taste the victory now his prize being her and her filthy daughter surely he could get rid of the daughter too though then there would be no reminders of that stupid man she loved then it would just be the two of them he liked that suddenly the form of ben walker stirred and the hooded man looked at the body irritably he threw a book at him knocking him unconscious once again smiling to himself the man turned back to the smoky substance in his cauldron yes he liked that plan he liked it a lot a n wow what an ending hope you all liked it please review luv emgurl disclaimer still dontown anything you recognise from the books hey once again many thanks go out to all my lovely reviewers and yes i do agree things are getting a bit complicated but i guess that just me i like things complicated because it means there can be different outcomes anyway i ve decided to move the story forward to a couple of days later which means charlie and kimmie have gone back to new york but anyway on with the story alex shifted slightly in her bed as not to wake the sleeping form beside her she couldntsleep even with riley with her she still felt like something was wrong carefully she pushed the covers off of her and climbed out of the bed pulling them back again over riley she walked past her open bedroom door spotting her father asleep on the couch and into the small bathroom that joined her room to her parents looking into the mirror on the wall alex smiled to herself slightly as she heard her mother wake blaise and told him to get into their bed no she heard blaise whisper blaise they re not going to do anything especially with us next door alex just needs him for support she heard her mother whisper back blaise please hermione voice said quietly and alex heard her father mumble something before hearing them climb into their own bed exiting the bathroom alex watch riley sleeping form for a moment his ash red hair was sticking up everywhere but he looked peaceful she was glad he was there it made her feel safe but she knew that it was interrupting his life even though he wouldntadmit it she knew he was constantly worrying about she saw the way he glanced at her during classes never letting her out of his sight guarding her from everyone else sure it had only been five days but it was affecting alex because she knew that it was bringing him down aswell sitting in a seat opposite the bed she wrapped his hogwarts robe that was lying on the floor around her breathing in his scent she shifted so that her legs were curled beneath her and a folded piece of parchment fell out picking it up alex thought that it was just spare notes he had taken in class until her own name caught h eye carefully she unfolded the parchment finding that there were two separate pieces of paper one was an application formed for world quidditch association it was neatly filled out in riley handwriting and a short note had been attached to the bottom part of it dear mr potter upon receiving your application form we are proud to say that it has been approved due to certain students leaving the school we currently have a small number of positions available in our fifth year class and after watching some of your previous games we wanted to give you the chance of starting at the wqa before the next school year while we are aware that your hogwarts school year does not finish for awhile we at wqa thought that this might help you to settle in before you begin your final schooling here eagerly awaiting your reply dave worhtington head of wqa her hands trembling slightly she knew where the wqa was and it was in the furthest possible place from here new zealand slowly she put the first piece of parchment down and began to read the second it was addressed to her and written in riley messier scrawl dear alex well i didntthink it would be this hard but i guess it would be harder if i was actually telling you this to your face anyway i wanted you to know first i leaving i got accepted into the world quidditch association in new zealand they want me to start as soon as possible it goes for three years it a great opportunity for me actually but i want us to keep in touch to stay friends that was were it stopped she wasntsure if that was he wanted to say or if he didntknow how to say everything else standing she dropped the piece of parchment letting it fall to the floor she shrugged his warm cloak off and quietly left the room feeling five again she carefully opened the now closed door of her mother room and climbed beneath blankets with her and blaise deep down she knew that it was the best thing for riley but it didntstop it from hurting hermione woke the next morning squashed in the middle of the bed it was a saturday morning and she wasntsupposed to feel squashed quite confused she watched blaise snore slightly before moving to face the intruder in her bed a small smile formed on her face when she found that it was alex she always looked peaceful when she slept and hermione remembered the countless times when she had woke finding alex in her bed in the mornings gently she tucked a stray curl behind her daughter ear as blaise shifted mione move over he whispered drowsily she turned to face him again wrapping her arm around his waist i thought you like being close to me blaise she whispered into his ear too early he mumbled back opening his eyes to look at her i told you not stay up watching her room all night hermione told him a smile playing on her lips suddenly blaise sat upright you let me come back to bed he almost screeched at her blaise relax hermione said quickly not wanting him to wake alex she not in there anyway blaise now fully awake looked at hermione properly finding that alex was indeed sleeping next to her and the reason why he had no room slowly he laid back down on the bed and hermione turned to face him again her elbow was on his pillow so her face was above his i told you she said gently twirling on his curls around her finger told me what blaise asked opening his eyes how easy the worrying comes she replied softly she laid back down her head resting on blaise pillow it just that blaise began i know hermione interrupted but she not stupid either blaise nodded before shifting so that he was facing her she so much like you he told her she like you too blaise hermione whispered back and it just not the hair either everyday for the last fifteen years i was reminded of you her smile is the same and that twinkling you have in your eye she got that too did i tell you that i glad you came back blaise said softly knock knock um hermione ginny poked her head through the opening between the door and the wall oh wit dontworry she mumbled closing the door behind her riley she in there ginny muffled voice came through to the bed room hermione looked at blaise her eye brows raised time to get up i think and she scrambled out of the bed should we wake alex up blaise asked as he slowly followed pulling her robe over her pyjamas hermione glanced at her sleeping daughter and shook her head before exiting into the small sitting room were the potter family were talking in hushed angry voices riley sat on the couch of the small sitting room he had woken up to find that alex was not asleep and after checking the bathroom and the sitting room he found his cloak and the pieces of parchment on the floor knowing that if she had run away this time it would be his fault so he went and woke his father up both ginny and harry immediately stumbled out of bed as soon as riley mentioned alex but as harry disappeared out of the portrait hall ginny went to wake hermione and blaise finding the sleeping teenage girl now they wanted to know what he had done to make her leave since for the last week almost she had clung to him at night riley looked up at his parents who were still in the pyjamas and sitting across from him he looked down to his hands at the piece of parchment he was grasping it was time for him to tell them i he began morning blaise said loudly as hermione dragged him into the sitting room all three potters ignored them riley ginny said sternly her eyes blazing he didntsay anything and looked down at the acceptance letter the wqa had sent him i applied last year he mumbled and passed the letter across to his parents he swallowed and stuffed the second one the letter addressed to alex into his pocket then he waited as his parents read the first letter riley ginny spoke again although her voice was softer why didntyou tell us because if you knew you wouldnthave let me he said turning a slight shade of pink riley this is ginny said softly before her husband interrupted her a wonderful opportunity harry said enthusiastically ginny smiled at her husband then at riley especially if it is something you want to do she said riley found himself nodding blaise picked up the letter once harry put it down and skimmed over it quickly well congratulations he said as he handed it to hermione when are you leaving it says as soon as possible that was when riley returned to reality i um decided not to go he said loudly as the adults began to talk to each other they all stopped talking and looked straight at him what ginny asked hoping she had heard incorrectly this was a once in a lifetime opportunity and he was just going to throw it away i said i not going riley said a little more confidently well i hope it not because of me alex soft voice came from blaise and hermione door way and everyone turned to look at her because i ve decided i not staying here i want to go back to fascino quas your not going hermione screeched alex sat between her two parents and across from the headmaster it was after lunch and hermione had yelled and cried but finally agreed to go with alex to see dumbledore blaise had been strangely quiet and tell me hermione why alex should not go dumbledore asked her his eyes twinkling because hermione paused unable to think of anything reasonable because her family is here she safe here actually blaise spoke for what seemed like the first time since alex announcement she might be safer in america at least until this whole thing goes away hermione glared at blaise blaise has a point dumbledore said as hermione glared him she d be away from the whole situation no hermione voice came out in barely a whisper and she shook her head mum i ll still see you with the trips and holidays alex told her soothingly and squeezed her hand please let me go finally hermione gave in and nodded well then dumbledore said i guess it would be best if you went back their immediately i ll organise a portkey for you and inform professor dokoft of the situation alex sat on her bed most of her things were already packed in the trunk the house elves had bought down from her dorm but there were still her school books that she had used over the lat couple of days to pack she got up and moved over to her desk picking up the stack of books as she did a stack of papers and another book fell to the floor sighing she placed the books in her hands into the open trunk and began to pick up the papers off the floor the journal riley had given her lay open on top of the paper a photo sticking out from the edge of it she picked it up and looked at the photo it was taken the first day back from the christmas break alex put the journal down and stuffed the photo into her jeans pocket and made her way into the sitting room where she found ginny reading a book um professor potter alex asked ginny looked up from her book and smiled at her alex you can call me ginny she told the girl oh um ginny i was wondering if you could take me to the gryffindor common room alex asked her sure she stood up let me just tell you re your parents so they dontfreak out cos you ve disappeared minutes later alex was walking along the corridors in the direction of the gryffindor common room with ginny finally they came to familiar portrait of the fat lady then alex realised she didntknow the password knowing that it changed each week um i dontknow the password she told ginny awkwardly it alright she ll let me in ginny replied and then alex watched as the teacher had a conversation with the lady in the portrait it ending with the fat lady letting them in i ll wait out here ginny told alex who nodded in reply suddenly alex felt like the awkward new kid again walking into the common room for the first time with many of the students staring at her she found nicole sam and draco sitting in a corner near a window none of them glanced up at her as she sat with them hey she said softly it was a bit awkward because she hadntreally spoke to anyone but riley for the last week hey sam said looking up from the parchment she had in her hand smiling at alex how are ya i okay she told them i was just um wondering riley not here draco cut her off looking up from his book i not looking for riley she told him i actually wanted to speak to nikki finally the red head looked up at the brunette i already know she said coldly i saw riley at lunch oh alex said quietly she looked down at her hands what going on draco said suddenly interested alex is leaving nicole told him coldly alex felt sam and draco look at her she kept her eyes on her hands why draco pushed nicole didntsay anything so alex finally looked at her friends because i have to she said quietly tears prickling her eyes she knew that nicole would be upset but she didntthink she would be angry at her excuse me nicole stood up and pushed past alex seat i need to go to the library nicole dontbe mad please alex called after her what did you expect me to be jumping with joy because things are going to be the same as they were before nicole yelled at her the entire common room went silent as everyone turned to face the two girls when alex didntsay anything nicole walked out of the common room and the students turned back to their own conversations dontworry alex sam told her she just scared because she thinks she going to lose her best friend she might lose me if i stay alex muttered what draco asked her even though he heard her the first time nothing she replied well i guess this is bye i leave tonight draco nodded as sam hugged her tightly i guess next time we ll see you will be at the end of the year he said as alex turned to hug him she nodded thanks she told him for what he asked for understanding she replied as he released her i ll write she told them and they nodded and they walked her to the portrait hole bye minutes later ginny had taken her back to her room and she was sitting on her bed staring at the open trunk finally as she accioed the last lot of books into her trunk and closed it she pulled her trunk into the sitting room and told her parents that she was ready a n okay so most of that was both boring but unexpected right please review and tell me what you thought hopefully next chapter will have a bit more action and will be posted soon please review luv emgurl disclaimer dontown anything you recognise from the books hey guys sorry for the long wait but schools been hell lately i ve had to pick my year 12 subjects and then i had three assignments due at the same time and a biology test it was painful but anyway thanks again to all my reviewers hope you like this chapter by the way half way of writing the first part of this chapter i decided that i should probably explain why alex is acting like this she taking the threats much more personal as if their all her fault because she made hermione go back to england sometimes i think to much incase all those people were wondering why i ve made a fictional character this way alex sat on the stone bench and watched the city lights as a gentle breeze twirled around her vaguely she heard the door t the courtyard open but didntturn to see who was coming up here hoping they would ignore her aswell it had been three weeks since she left hogwarts and while she had settled back into the american lifestyle she still felt out of it with her friends especially the twins and after seeing her parents during their trip with the ravenclaw students she was beginning to have doubts about whether or not this was the right decision lex a low gentle voice spoke to her making her jump slightly charlie she said awkwardly moving across the bench so he could sit it was the first time they had spoken to each other since she returned um you left this in the practice room he handed her the purple diary riley had given her alex took it and then watched as charlie turned back toward the door how your nose she asked in a feeble attempt to make up with him hoping she didntsound sarcastic it fine charlie replied turning back to face her a smile playing on his lips i know now never to get you mad again though well did i ever mention how sorry i was she asked i think you just did charlie answered finally sitting down next to her besides i didnttake it too personal oh alex replied turning back to face the city lights they sat in silence well is anyone ever going to tell me what happened between you and georgie or am i going to have to punch a few more people alex asked joking breaking the silence well when you find out be sure to inform me charlie answered seriously cos i still trying to work it all out huh alex answered you mean you dontwant to just be friends with her charlie shook his head i was just trying to explain to her that we used to talk more when we were friends then she took it the wrong way like georgie does and thought i was saying i didntwant to go out with her anymore oh alex replied slightly confused why didntyou explain that to her i did but you know georgie she only hears what she wants to hear sometimes charlie replied and alex nodded in agreement what about you are you ever login to tell the twins why you came back all of the sudden charlie asked her how do you know i haventalready told them alex replied not looking at him because i sure if you had you wouldntbe sitting up here alone all the time charlie pointed out i canttell them alex replied why not he asked because i just can t alex answered well whatever it is it changed you and i can already see that you cantdeal with it by yourself charlie replied you cantkeep pushing people away i not pushing anyone away alex exclaimed standing up she leant against the railing and looked down at the cars that were passing the unseen building really what about your parents you barely spoke to them when they were here charlie paused and he stood up too and what about riley and nicole they just wanted to help you alex but you wontlet anyone in their better off with out me charlie alex replied quietly how can they be better off without you when they were all prepare to do anything for you charlie kept pushing he questions you wouldntunderstand no one would understand alex answered as tears began to prick her eyes how do you know unless you tell some one charlie said putting an arm around her as the tears spilled over she pushed him away and sat back on the stone bench it none of your business charlie she said wiping the tears away it is when one of my friends is getting hurt answered quietly even if they are doing it to themselves a n he means emotionally hurting herself not physically hermione watched as her fifth year gryffindor and hufflepuff class continued with their charm assignments ron was sitting at a desk to the right of her marking his own classes papers even though he was no longer teaching them finally the bell went and the students began to pack their books assignment to be handed up nest lesson hermione told the class as the hufflepuffs began to exit the room ron who began to put away his quill and parchment looked up just as his niece was passing his desk nicole is your dad still in france he asked her the same time draco called out tot her ignoring draco she nodded to ron and quickly walked out of the classroom that was odd hermione said walking toward ron desk what was ron asked oblivious to what she was talking about nicole usually she talks quite a bit and she hasnteven waited for sam and draco hermione replied quietly motioning toward the last two gryffindor in the classroom oh yeah ron replied she been like it since alex left draco piped up hearing their conversation then when riley left it got worse oh hermione replied as the two teenagers left ron still didntsay anything um ron dontyou think that a problem hermione asked him as they too exited the classroom and headed toward the great hall what he asked nicole your niece is secluding herself from everyone hermione told him dontyou think we should tell bill or fleur no ron replied it just nicole she never really had any friends draco and sam just tried to talk to her and she ignored them hermione pointed out something would have to be

arentyou i haventdone anything wrong have i or said anything to upset you please write back i miss getting letters from you logan the red head scrunched the piece of parchment up and put it on the table quickly she grabbed a sandwich and stood up as she saw draco and sam enter the great hall as they sat across from her she left without saying a word nic draco called after her just leave her sam cut him off she ll come around eventually i just dontget why she being so weird draco told her think about it draco before alex came we didntreally talk to her did we sam asked him he opened his moth to speak we didntdraco you used t tease her about being a wesley and i was too busy with natalie and jess to even bother sam told him then when alex came we took the time to get to know her but she thinks that because their gone were just going to dump her again but we haven t draco pointed out we ve tried to talk to her i know sam said rolling her eyes i guess she just pushing us away because she less likely to fell hurt that way because she thinks we will leave her by herself oh draco answered well at least she still talking to logan his owl comes in almost everyday that doesntmean she answering them sam pointed out as lunch finished hermione look at this one ginny squealed holding the magazine out to her hermione took it and blaise tried to look at the picture over shoulder but ginny pulled it away again you cantsee it blaise ginny told him it bad luck hermione rolled her eyes at him but turned ginny come on we ll look at them in my room with a flick of wand the magazines were in hermione and blaise bedroom and ginny pulled the brunette in their leaving harry and blaise alone so harry said i thought you guys were planning simple wedding we are blaise replied turning back to his paper you shouldntlet ginny help then harry told him laughing slightly blaise raised his eyebrows at him but didntsay anything he flipped through his paper until he came to the sport section and found himself facing a group of teenage boys one of which had dark red hair and green eyes skimming the article blaise read that these were the wqa newest students and hopefully quidditch next superstars on closer examination of the picture blaise could clearly see that riley didntlook happy to be in the photograph have you heard from riley he asked harry folding the paper up yeah he owled us on the weekend harry looked up from his own paper said he hadntstarted his classes yet but the training was almost every night blaise nodded as a squeal came from the bedroom hermione this dress would look perfect on you ginny said for about the fifth time hermione took the magazine and looked at the picture ginny was right the dress was perfect especially on the size eight model that was walking around the page wearing the dress i already told you gin i just want some nice dress robes we dontwant anything over the top hermione said handing the magazine back to her she picked up one of her papers and continued to mark it come on mione ginny replied using the nickname she knew annoyed her cantyou just picture blaise face if you walk down the aisle in something like this no i can t hermione replied fine ginny sighed as she continued to flip through the magazine five minutes later she was finally bored of looking at the wedding magazines what does alex think about all this ginny asked putting the magazine down she fine about it all i guess hermione said looking up from her paper and she like it back in america ginny said quietly turning the page over ginny nodded in agreement and both women turned back to their papers magazines hermione ginny asked excitedly mmm came the reply i know you said you wanted a simple wedding but i think alex would look gorgeous in this dress a sigh came from the other side of the room well let me see then hermione finally said putting her quill down alex sat at the niveus table logan was sitting across from her scribbling in his black notebook while listening to his headphones georgie was talking loudly with a group of sixth year girls but alex could feel people watching her shivering slightly she quickly finished her meal and pushed her chair away from the table ignoring the three people across the hall who were watching her and georgie and logan who were now looking at her too alex slowly made her way toward the doors but before she reached the doors she was stopped by one of the three alex brian said brightly as he grabbed her wrist as she passed the croceus table where you going to the library alex replied hoping he would get the hint and leave her alone great i ve gotta pick some books up he replied and followed her out of the hall to the library he hummed slightly as they walked to the library ignoring the glares that alex kept sending his way what do you want brian alex finally asked him as the walked up the stairs i already told you i need to pick some books up lex brian told her although he was obviously lying come off it alex stopped i ve known you since i ve been coming here i would doubt you would even know where the library was that really hurts alex brain laughed clutching his chest you cut me real deep shut up this is because i wouldnttell charlie isntit god i wish everyone would just mind their own bloody business alex snapped charlie charlie oh charlie that nutter who is so obviously in love with georgie bless his soul he didnttell me to do anything i just need to go to the library and i thought you might like some company brain joked with her why what was he trying to get you to tell him you know bloody well what he wanted me to tell him the same thing you want me to tell you alex yelled as they came into the corridor alex calm down brian said seriously now we just want to help well you can t no body can help she was shaking now i just want you all to leave me alone she turned to walk away alex brian spoke again you dontmean that yes i do alex said angrily turning back to him i just wish you would all go away well we won t not until you tell us what wrong brian replied there isntanything wrong alex lied so why dontyou just alex there is obviously something wrong a new quiet voice filled the corridor alex turned to look at kimmie and logan who were standing in the doorway of the corridor what if i said i fine then i fine alex snapped at her she felt sick why couldntthey just see that she didntwant them to know that it was better for them that way she dropped her bag as the bile began to rise in her throat and covering her hand with her mouth she ran to the nearest bathroom an owl tapped on the closet window that draco was sitting near in the gryffindor common room he opened the window and watched as it flew into the room neither he or sam recognized it forgetting about it he left the window open so it could leave and sat back down the owl finally landed on the shoulder of nicole weasley who was sitting on her bed alone in the girl dormitories startled by the owl she carefully untied the letter that was attached to its leg and watched as it flew back into the common room nicole look i dontknow why your not answering my brothers letters and at the moment quite frankly i dontcare there something wrong with alex and she wonttell us what happened i just wanted to know if you or any of your fiends know anything about it she wonttalk to any of us and i worried she might do something stupid please write back asap georgie re reading the letter nicole took a deep breath and finally let everything sink in draco she called running down the steps to the common room he looked up at the sound of his name and sam turned toward the red head hey he said slowly as she reached them nicole didntsay anything instead she thrust the letter into the blonde boy hands as he read the letter he paled slightly if it possible for a malfoy to pale that is riley knew didnthe and he was going to leave that why she gone nicole said calmly draco looked at her putting the piece together as sam read the letter i think we need to go see professor granger she said standing as she finished reading the letter nicole nodded but didntspeak she going to be okay nikki sam told her we knew something was up before she left but i was so angry with her nicole told them all i thought about was myself it doesntmatter sam told her hugging her what matters is that we go see her parents so they know nicole nodded and let them lead her out of the common room excuse me professor walker do you know where professor zabini is draco asked the teacher as they passed him in the corridor it was a known fact between al the students now that out of class time the potters professor granger and professor zabini all disappeared with the weasley every now and then no um i must be going appointment you see he said rather quickly walking off leaving the students alone they walked down the corridors for a further ten minutes until finally they came to ron and jess weasley who were entering the castle uncle ron nicole said feebly we um need to see professor granger why ron asked out of curiosity charms assignment draco said quickly i need help sam glared at him draco shut up she turned to ron and jess it about alex what about her jess suddenly interrupted um we d rather just tell professor granger sam told them nervously ron shook his head but when his wife looked at him he quickly changed his mind wait in the great hall i ll go get her for you ron told them and quickly disappeared up the stairs alex gagged over the toilet seat tears began to run down her face wiping her mouth she heard the bathroom door open and the footsteps stop out the front of her open cubicle alex pulled her knees up so her chin was resting on them and crossed her arms so logan couldntse her crying just leave me alone she said between sobs he ignored her and sat on the cold tiles next to her motioning for kimmie and brian to wait outside he put his arm around her it alright to be scared he told her as she let him hug her she buried her head into his shoulder i dontwant to be alex sobbed into his shoulder but i canthelp it i know logan whispered as the door opened again logan looked up at his worried sister georgie nodded to logan as she sat with them on the floor everything going to be okay georgie told her squeezing her hand softly a n okay that where i going to leave it yes i don know that what riley told her in the library but i couldntthink of anything else that would fit i hope you all like it please review luv emgurl disclaimer dontown anything you recognise from the books hey thanks for all the great reviews again blaise and hermione sat in the office of headmaster dokoft in fascino quas they had been there for at least half an hour and so far none of the teachers had managed to track down their daughter i told you this was a bad idea blaise she should ve stayed with us at hogwarts she would have been fine there hermione hissed to him as the headmaster left the office how do you know that blaise said back his tone harsh she was fine when we were here a few weeks ago he stood up and stopped at the window running a hand through his hair but if you hadntagreed with her hermione began so this is my fault blaise exploded and turned to face hermione it my fault i ended up in hospital it my fault she left hermione looked at him in shock neither of them had ever raised their voices to each other she looked away and didntsay anything hermione i sorry blaise said sitting back down he put his face in his hands i just worried about her she nodded in reply but didntspeak a soft knock came from the door and charlie entered the office alone charlie what are you doing here blaise asked slightly confused i um know where alex is he said slowly looking at them georgie told me to come get you blaise nodded toward the boy and he began to leave the office he waited for hermione to stand before following her without saying a word they followed the teenage boy down many corridors and up two flights of stairs until finally they came to a teenage boy and girl waiting at a door kimmie smiled weakly at them but neither her nor brian spoke as charlie opened the door to the roof blaise took hold of hermione hand squeezed it tightly hermione and blaise walked out into the dark courtyard finally finding their daughter sitting silently between the twins as they approached them georgie turned and stood allowing blaise and hermione to speak to alex logan however did not leave but not because alex told him to stay as she didntspeak but because he didntwant to leave the sun shone brightly the green practice pitch glimmered from the morning dew as riley stepped on to it with his team taking a breath he mounted his broom and followed his coaches instructions of flying twenty laps of the pitch and although he had one of the fastest brooms on the market due to the size of the pitch he knew it would take time he let his other teammates speed up ahead of him letting his own thoughts engulf his mind back in england it was still night and he couldnthelp but wonder if draco and sam and nicole were sitting in the gryffindor common room while the teacher were telling them to go to sleep his thoughts soon moved on to alex much like they did during most of lessons he was constantly wondering how she was doing back in america and while he had had the urge to write to her many times every time he picked up his quill the words wouldntcome sometimes he wondered if it was because he didntknow what to say or if he was scared she wouldntrespond so instead he left it oy potter one of his team mates dougie called out to him some of the guys were thinking about going into the city tomorrow you interested the boy asked as he flew alongside him dougie was in the same year as riley but had started at the wqa the year before coming from australia um maybe riley replied before speeding up getting lost in his thoughts again he was still lost in thoughts that he didnteven notice when a large brown owl began circling the pitch finally swooping toward him he noticed it just in time and quickly swerved his broom out of the way so he didnthit it coming to halt to watch the owl circle around him riley waited until the bird landed on his shoulder finally he realised that it was a hogwarts owl one of it fastest and it had a small piece of parchment tied to it leg he quickly untied and landed softly on the ground as the coach blew the whistle signalling the laps were over unfolding the note riley recognised draco untidy scrawl along the paper although he didntget he chance to read it when dougie and s few other guys landed along side of him who owled ya potter one of the guys said loudly to him next time tell them to send an owl that not on a war mission riley didntsay anything but picked up his broom and headed toward the change rooms once in the rooms he sat in front his locker and took the note from draco out again potter you need to tell us what going on with alex now we know you know so you need to tell us it urgent draco so it was your girlfriend the same guy from before nick said loudly as the other guys came into the room that why you wanted to read it in private no riley finally said i donthave a girlfriend then whose that red head in the picture in your locker dougie pointed out stupidly a red head hey gee you children would be ugly with bright orange hair nick joked that my cousin actually riley said hotly taking his training cloak off and opening his locker mistake number one and the brunette nick asked grabbing the picture off the door that s just nicole friend alex riley replied swallowing hard alex hey i wouldntmind a piece of that he passed the picture to one of the other guys who laughed wait donttell me potter the blonde guy with them he with you riley rolled his eyes but ignored the comment searching his locker for a piece of parchment and a quill finally as he found some dougie handed the picture back to him and saw what he was writing guys i dontknow what going on with alex i haventtalked to her since she decided to leave riley why did she leave dougie asked him interested although obviously unaware of who she was and what happened who riley asked hoping he sounded confused that girl alex dougie pushed you wrote that you hadnttalked to her since before she left why did she leave i dontknow riley answered honestly she never told me then why do your friends think you know dougie continued although riley wasntlistening anymore he grabbed the photo that dougie was still holding and stuffed in his locker before closing it and quickly exited it heading toward the owlry when he got there he took the note out he had written to draco and picked up the quill that was kept in the owlry ripping the top part of the parchment off he re wrote the letter dear alex i sorry i really am i never meant for things to turn out like this i hope your okay i miss you i miss talking to you please write back from riley after finding the closest wqa owl he tied the letter on to it leg and watched it fly off into the distance as soon as alex saw her parents a fresh wave of tears came hermione too cried as blaise hugged their daughter tightly who even had tears in eyes seeing his daughter in such a fragile state i sorry alex sobbed as blaise finally let her go and let hermione take over you have nothing to apologise about hermione told her kissing her head lightly as she took her in her arms she felt blaise hand on her arm she thinks it her fault logan told blaise quietly but that all she said she wontlet us help or tell us what going on blaise nodded but turned back to hermione and alex we should take her inside blaise said softly as hermione finally let her go the four moved silently back inside the building finding the four other teenagers still waiting near the door charlie was holding georgie who appeared to be crying aswell as kimmie and brian were sitting against the wall in silence they stood as logan who was in front came into the building followed by hermione and blaise who were each holding their daughters hand i think you kids should go to bed blaise told them quietly and they nodded but watched as they took alex back down to the head masters office this time logan left them alone dumbledore professor dokoft hermione blaise and alex were now all sitting in the office the adults were all waiting for an explanation of alex of why she told them she was handling it when clearly she wasn t i dontknow what happened alright alex told them hoping she sounded confident i fine you can go back to hogwarts alex please were just trying to help you dumbledore spoke up well i fine she told them hermione squeezed her hand alex you canttell us your fine your friends are obviously worried about why do you think were here blaise spoke calmly confused as to why she was acting this way well they should just stop trying to find out what wrong it my problem not their s alex told him this isntyour fault hermione spoke quietly for the first time since they had come back inside you dontneed to blame yourself alex didntsay anything instead choosing to look at her hands alex dear if you cantcope you just need to tell us the blonde headmaster spoke to her i dontwant to see one of my students fall to pieces because of the actions of someone she cantcontrol perhaps it would be best dumbledore began if i hadntof made you go back this wouldntof happened alex spoke quietly we wouldntbe in danger hermione grip tightened alex i didntjust go back because of you hermione told her besides there is no guarantee this wasntgoing to happen here dumbledore interrupted this isntyour fault alex she nodded as if hearing it for the first time and felt her father hand close around her other one now i know your parents both want you to come back to hogwarts tonight but i think it may be easier if you stay here dumbledore told her ignoring hermione glare but on one condition that each night you come and see professor dokoft and tell her if anything or anyone is stressing you out i think that it may also be a good idea to let your friends be aware of the situation professor dokoft interrupted dumbledore nodded in agreement if your still not dealing with things by the time your house visits hogwarts in three weeks then we have agreed that it would be best if you stayed at the castle alex nodded in agreement nicole sat restlessly in the armchair in the headmaster office ginny watched over them and she couldnthelp but get the feeling that she was being analysed as a niece turning her attention to her friends she tried to stifle a yawn only to find that sam had drifted off against draco shoulder but the boy was still staring intently at both the fireplace and the open window next to it waiting for a reply from either sunlight was slowly coming into the office indicating that it was finally morning in england yet the three teenagers hadnteven gone to bed yet although both ginny and harry had made many attempts at it finally the fireplace was filled green flames and dumbledore stepped back into hogwarts a look of slight amusement crossed his blue eyes as he found the three teenagers and ginny potter sitting waiting for him in his office well i suppose your waiting to hear about alex dumbledore said in a hushed tone seeing sam asleep nicole didntsay anything but looked at draco who was looking at the headmaster with a look of concern dumbledore did not continue and only sat at his desk and picked up a piece of paper well professor is she okay ginny finally broke the silence indeed she is hermione and blaise are staying there until this evening but at this stage alex will not be returning to hogwarts dumbledore told them nicole let out a breath of relief she didntknow she had been holding as sam moved in her sleep whacking draco in the ribs who in turn gasped in pain waking the girl up as for you three dumbledore continued standing up from his desk i expect you may be receiving an owl shortly from miss granger but now i want you to catch up on the sleep you have so kindly missed i will inform your teachers the two girls made their way toward the door and draco closed the open window oh and mr malfoy i believe mr potter has not replied to your owl try not bother him during the morning it when he has practice dumbledore said as the door closed harry potter walked briskly down the fourth floor corridor carefully avoiding any students wishing to talk to him following the flash of red hair in front of him it almost felt like the old days to him as he followed his wife into the great hall for lunch he was met with a smile as he sat next to her and picked up a sandwich but before either of them could talk to each other a loud noise at the entrance of the hall the one they had just walked through distracted them jumping to his feet harry ran to the doors as screaming students fled to the back of the room with his wand forward harry was met with an alarming sight a pale almost glowing ben walker was standing in the middle of the doorway a first year student in his grasp his wand out ron stood on the other side of the door way with snape and lavender brown as ginny joined harry while jess and some of the other teachers were moving students back an invisible shield seemed to be preventing any of the teachers moving closer to the man but before anything could be done and ear splitting scream from walker whose eyes were a pale blue almost white as he fell to the floor letting the go of the small first year and letting the shield down ron harry yelled as he moved forward grab mackenzie everybody else stay back with his wand still in the ready position and his eyes glued firmly on the professor who was lying face down on the stone harry kicked the wand away from the still body before kneeling next to him carefully he checked the mans pulse harry his name came faintly from the mans lips unsure of what to do harry turned the over so they were face to face keeping his wand aimed at the man harry he said again his eyes were back to normal now and the glowing had gone you have to stop him his voice was raspy and harry flinched as he grabbed his cloak who harry asked loudly as the teacher eye closed lavender harry yelled urgently looking up as ben grasp on his robes loosened wake him up the witch moved forward her wand out his breathing only faint harry he in a coma lavender said as a pale blue light came out from her wand take him to the hospital wing dumbledore voice now joined the teachers m muffled conversations harry to my office but he just attacked a student ron protested take mr mackenzie to the hospital wing too dumbledore told him before e striding out of the great hall harry stood and picked up the wand lying next to him on the floor before following dumbledore up to his office alex closed her hand around the silver doorknob she could hear muffled voices on the inside of the room taking a deep breath she pushed the door open and forced herself to enter the room the talking stopped suddenly as she entered she didntlook at any of them although she knew they were looking at her lex brian cheerful voice came from the other side of the room i was just showing charlie here the proper way to play the drums alex finally looked at them she knew what they were doing but she had already decided she wasntgoing to forget it your sitting on the couch with kimmie alex said pointedly well yeah but i was verbally telling him how to do it brian continued he sitting on the floor and is holding an apple alex replied and leant against the nearest wall that the beauty of it he has to im brian logan snapped and brian glared at him are your parents still here charlie attempted to change the topic alex shook her head gently they left awhile ago oh came a reply an owl dropped this off for you georgie said suddenly and handed her a piece of parchment alex looked at it but didntopen it instead stuffing it in her pocket taking a deep breath alex closed her eyes preparing herself i sorry for the way i acted she finally said opening her eyes back up it was immature and i was only thinking about myself but lex you donthave to explain logan cut in you all wanted to now so know your going to find out alex looked at him nobody spoke at hogwarts my mum began to get these weird letters and her room was trashed the letters were insulting her bloodline and threatened us then me and riley were attacked walking back to the gryffindor tower she paused for a moment trying to remember what happened next the letters were still getting sent to my mum even though she moved rooms and then one night when kimmie and charlie were at hogwarts my dad got attacked and ended up in the hospital wing that was when i snapped i guess i was moved out of the tower and i lost control i felt like i had nobody so i came back here where i though i would be safe what about riley kimmie questioned he would have done anything for you like give up any future he could have had in quidditch alex asked moving around the room that was part of the reason i had to come back he was going to give up his dreams just to help me i couldntlet him do anything he d regret nobody spoke look i dontwant you to look down at me or to give me any special treatment i only told you because dumbledore and dokoft said it might help me alex told them and walked toward the door alexandria granger dontyou dare leave this room georgie voice filled the room causing alex to face her she was standing in the middle of the room and had her hands on her hips not once would we look down on you because of this georgie told her considering you ve lasted this long you must either be a good liar or the determination of not letting something get in your way has come out and we both know the first thing isnttrue in fact i goddamn proud of you for not coming back earlier like i know i would ve so you can just sit your butt down on this couch and reply to riley like has asked you too what alex asked confused by the last bit you see what georgie means is that were proud of you for staying strong brian put in i heard that bit alex said but i haventgot any mail from riley georgie turned pink well the thing is it wasntaddressed georgie stuttered she opened your mail logan and charlie supplied the words at the same time finally alex realised what they were talking about and put her hand in her pocket the cool parchment slightly crumpled nicole moved in her bed as a tapping came from across the room waking suddenly she quickly jumped out her bed finding sam already at the window the owl zoomed in and flew slowly around the girl dormitory before landing on nicole shoulder is it from alex sam asked before she even had the chance to untie the letter i dontknow nicole murmured maybe we should wait for draco like he would have waited for us just open it sam replied sitting back down on her bed nicole sat next to her and carefully unsealed the envelope nikki i know i didntreply to your last letter but i was just wondering if you had heard anything riley it from riley nicole sighed and put the letter down and laid back on the bed sam didntsay anything and flopped down on the bed next to nicole nik she finally said yeah the red head replied well i was thinking what if we just wrote to logan i thought about that too but i dontknow he might think i just writing to him to get information about alex since i haventreplied to any of his other letters nicole responded sitting back up you really think he d think that sam said holding riley letter above her face besides you wouldntjust have to put your name on it i could even write it nicole thought about it for a minute she knew logan would probably understand but something inside of her told her she wasntquite ready to talk to him again after ignoring him for weeks if we donthear anything you can send one after dinner nicole finally old her before climbing back into her own bed leaving sam to reply to riley professor i think that it would be a good idea to keep hermione and blaise at fascino quas for a couple of days until we know who walker was talking about harry told dumbledore as he sat in his office it too late their already back in their rooms dumbledore told him shaking his head i had just left them when it started but this could be the person who is attacking hermione harry protested walker he said i had to stop him and who do you think him is harry dumbledore said ben walker gave no vital clues or information about who was controlling him but what i can tell you was that he was being controlled i should have seen it earlier but i didn t and now he might be lost i dontthink you are understanding the situation professor harry tried again if it this person is capable of controlling a fully qualified wizard then there no saying what he might be able to do to hermione he already attacked blaise once harry there not evidence that it is the same person hermione and blaise have had a hard enough time already there no need to alert them of the situation as yet just stay close to them dumbledore continued but harry protested again but nothing they are not to be told dumbledore told him making it final we cantlose her again harry shouted is that what you want for hermione to be gone harry please calm down neither hermione or blaise are going anywhere i have made sure of that now will you please go to the hospital wing and see if professor walker has woke yet perhaps you might be able to get some information off of him dumbledore dismissed him harry left the office in silence and dumbledore sighed looking down at the piece of parchment in front of him he knew that hermione and blaise were far from the end dear nicole well this isntexactly the type of letter you say hey how are you is it um i guess there only really two things i want to say that really matter at the moment first of all thank you for telling my parents it was definitely the right thing to do and i would have done it if i were you the second thing is i sorry for dragging you and the others back into the mess i wouldntexactly say i fine now but i getting there and you guys have helped me more than you ll know i want so desperately to tell you what going on but i scared you re going to get hurt because you re there so for that again i am sorry love always alex alex watched the owl from the window in the practice room as it became a tiny speck in the distance turning back to her friends she found that it was just her georgie and charlie left in the room sitting back down t the small desk alex picked up the silver pen that riley had given her and turned it over in her hand waiting for the words to come to her as the other two continued to do what ever it was they were doing the room was in complete silence alex just write down the first things that comes to mind georgie finally said to her looking up from her book i cantif my mind is blank alex responded come off it georgie told her it cantbe that hard to think of what you want to say to him it isntreally alex admitted then write already georgie told her something arentthat simple charlie interrupted not even looking up from his paper what georgie questioned him hotly sometimes what you really want to say or write in alex case never come out as easily as they form inside here charlie replied motioning to his head oh georgie responded meanwhile alex had finally put pen to paper riley sometimes things dontever work out the way we planned and i know your sorry but your apology wontbe accepted by me because you dontreally have anything to be sorry about i made the decision to leave so technically i should be saying sorry to you i sorry there i said it well i guessing draco probably wrote to you causing you to write to me because georgie and everyone else all swear it wasntthem anyway i going to be okay which is a positive i sure you were lying anyway when you said you missed talking to me you have to admit i pretty sarcastic about everything but if you want me to i guess i could write every now and then if i not too busy alex georgie and charlie were still talking about the same thing as alex tied the letter to the other owl that was perched on the window finally once that owl had become a tiny speck she turned back to the now silent room to find only charlie you want me to walk you back to your dorm charlie asked her standing up you know what that would probably be great i bet i could even coax georgie back out to come talk to you alex smiled at him switching the light off and following him out of the practice room alex knew that she didntlie to nicole or riley she was going to be okay he watched them carefully form the corner of the room hidden beneath his stolen invisibility cloak they were asleep on the couch together and from behind one door he could hear the voices of t and ginny potter talking about dumbledore ignoring them he stepped forward slowly ensuring the cloak was still covering him completely carefully he pulled a pair of muggle twiser from his pocket along with an empty glass vial the potter door opened slightly and the invisible man froze but it was shut almost immediately no one leaving the room the man took a step toward the sleeping forms of blaise and hermione his breathing becoming louder and ragged carefully he took a few strands of blaise black curls quickly enclosing them inside the glass vial this time the potter door opene and ginny stormed out and though the secret portrait hole into he corridor providing the perfect escape turning in the opposite direction of the red head the man headed deep within the silent walls of the school where on the soft thump of his invisible footsteps could be heard a n okay so i know you guys had to wait a while for this but i got stuck half way through and then i had school and stuff so i am sorry any way good news sunday is my 17th birthday and as a present from me to you i will hopefully get the next chapter up late friday night or asap on sunday unfortunately i wontbe able to get up saturday because i having ppl over and it the afl grand final go swans anyway please review and tell me what you think luv emgurl disclaimer still dontown anything you recognise from the books harry watched as ben walker lay unmoving on the hospital wing bed it was the fifth day he had been there and the man had still not woken sighing he ran his hands through his jet black hair before removing his glasses harry you re here again lavender asked coming into the small room that was blocked off from the rest of the hospital putting his glasses back on harry nodded how long do you think until he wakes up he asked her as she performed a few spells it hard to tell she answered because we dontknow what spell was used exactly or how many were used it hard to pinpoint a recovery time harry nodded he had heard it all before every time he had come in here riley sat in his classroom watching the teacher at the front attempt to charm a pillow to make it follow you around incase you fall the key word there was attempt a piece of paper hit the back of his chair but riley just ignored staring straight ahead of him it wasntthat he didntwant to be friends with the guys in his class it was that he would just prefer if they left him alone another scrunched up piece of paper came flying toward him this time it hit him in the back of the neck got him some one said excitedly class attention back at the front please the teacher interrupted them rolling his eyes riley took out the folded piece of parchment he had been keeping in his pocket for the last couple of days now he was still yet to reply to it he didntreally know what to say all alex had said was that if he had wanted she would write not that she actually wanted to write to him sighing he refolded the piece of parchment and put it back in his pocket as the bell rang signalling the end of lesson riley dougie called jogging to keep up with the red head as he left the class riley stopped allowing him to catch up but continued walking once he had he began to whistle a tune he seemed to be making up smiling at the few girls that walked past them who in turn all giggled and began talking in whispers so do you like it here dougie talked his strong australian accent coming out smoothly it alright riley replied dougie nodded his blond highlighted hair dropping in front of his eyes what was it like back in england riley stopped and actually thought about this for a moment while dougie continued to walk not realising he had stopped um it was home riley shrugged as he caught up to the other boy you know you have your family and friends everything comfortable dougie nodded again you know you could have that here if you put the effort in i mean it up to you but if you need a mate well you know how to whistle to riley didntsay anything and watched as dougie spotted a short girl dana and headed toward her alex brian she replied in a hushed tone surprisingly enough they were actually in the library this time although she was unsure why brian was in there since he was just picking books up then putting them back down again nothing he replied flipping the book he was holding open k alex replied putting her books on the table he sat with her and for a few minutes they were both silent the door opened across the other side of the room and a group of girls walked in with kimmie they were laughing and talking and didntnotice alex and brian alex can we go yet brian whined closing the book alex nodded in reply can i just get one more book though brian nodded but rolled his eyes and waited as alex got up and moved toward the music section okay got it alex said returning picking up her bag what book was it brian asked grabbing his bag aswell oh just a piano book i want to put a few songs to some music but i cantremember a few things since i haventused the piano in awhile alex told him as they walked toward the door alex brian their names were said loudly as they passed kimmie and her group of friends what are you doing she frowned slightly at them just getting some books brian told her why else would be in a library it was just a question kimmie replied hotly before turning to alex how are you doing i okay alex replied uncomfortably as some of the other girls joined them well we just leaving brian told them and grabbed the back of alex arm pulling her away once they were in the corridor and began to head up the stairs away from the library brian finally spoke to her again i d just ignore kimmie when she around them he told her why alex asked because they all think their better than everyone else he muttered to himself mainly hasntshe always thought she was better than you though alex joked with him he looked at her and nodded his head vaguely i guess but i always figured she didntmean it brian told her honestly i dontknow maybe i thought she d get over it but then she just and gets all bitchy with them get over what alex asked confused nothing brian replied knowing he had probably said too much already look there logan alex looked up and found that were approaching the practise room with logan approaching it in the opposite direction heading toward them he smiled as he saw them and stopped out the front for the door as he reached it waiting for them logie just the person i wanted to see alex told him cheerfully taking the book out of bag i was wondering if you would be willing to help me oh i dontknow lex i might be a bit he stopped mid sentence as he opened the door oh god were brian words as the three of them couldnthelp but stare at the display that was in front of them charlie was lying on the couch with georgie on top of him kissing each other as if their lives depended on it their purple fascino quas robes were strewn across the floor and from the looks of it georgie top was planned to go there too upon logan brian and alex arrival charlie jumped up almost dropping georgie on the floor who attempted to pull her top back down and smooth her hair a bit neither of the two looked at the other three in one quick movement alex pulled brian out of the room and leant against the wall in the corridor both of them burst out lasting well at least they ve made up brian said between gasps of air who made up kimmie asked why are you guy sitting out here well let just say you wouldntwant to be in there right now especially if your name is charlie alex said and brian burst out laughing again kimmie looked at him strangely whatever i cantpractise tonight i ve got things to do okay alex replied and brian stopped laughing like what do your hair he called after her as she walked off that was a bit lame alex told him as silence filled the air surely all your comeback arentlike that brian just shrugged so do you think we should probably go in there and drag logan off charlie i think we should let him go for a few more minutes alex replied smiling slightly blaise hermione said loudly waving a hand in front of his face er yeah what he asked coming back into reality are you going to help me organise the last couple of trips hermione asked him for the seventh time since they had been back in their little sitting room or should i get ginny to help me no i ll help err which trip were we organising he asked sighing hermione put her quill down we were supposed to be planning the last hogwarts trip to fascino quas then the final trip here but it doesntlook like that will be happening she told him blaise looked at hermione she still looked as beautiful as she did when he first fell in love with her but she looked slightly tired and he wasntsure if it was because of the stress of planning the schools trips the mystery attacker or because she was now older or if it was a mixture of all three well we ve almost finished all the organising for the hufflepuff trip then we just need to get started on the end of year trip blaise told her looking down at his parchment it shouldnttake too long i promise it not how much time we have blaise it the amount of space we have i mean dumbledore thinks well be able to fit three hundred extra students into our already full dorms hermione said desperately dontworry we ll work it out blaise told her soothingly hermione nodded but didntreply and went back to writing on her parchment and blaise went back to staring at a picture on a nearby coffee table of his little girl and wondering how she was doing blaise hermione said again not looking up this time oh sorry blaise said quickly and began to write on his own piece of parchment smiling to himself as he thought that d they d all be a real family soon the cauldron stood bubbling in the middle an ancient unused bathroom a thick liquid bubbling inside of it soft footsteps could faintly be heard above the hissing and popping noises coming fro the cauldron as a dark figure moved around the old bathroom a small glass vial stood on the floor next to the cauldrons and a few back curls could faintly be seen the footsteps grew louder as the potion began to simmer and a fragile rasping voice echoed in the room not long now it said to it self we just need to wait for the girl to come back then that dear mudblood will be ours i cantbelieve he punched him alex laid on her back on her bed she had just returned from her daily chats with professor dokoft and was listening to georgie complain about logan reaction toward charlie you cantreally blame him alex said i mean he did walk in on his half naked sister and best friend lying on top of each other i was not half naked i was fully clothed georgie said throwing her stuffed childhood teddy at her you might aswell as been alex threw it back charlie hands were all over you i think i scarred for life now she pretended to shudder georgie grounded and flopped down on the bed beside alex put this way it could have been much worse if we walked in ten minutes later alex added georgie groaned louder and buried her face into the nearest pillow nicole stared at the blank piece of parchment that was in front of her that morning she had decided to write to logan but now that she was actually doing it she didntknow what to write leaning back against the armchair she was sitting in she sighed and threw her quill back on the table as the portrait hole swung open and draco and sam entered the common room her hand in his hey nik draco said as they sat across from her hey nicole replied softly glancing at the couple sam head was on draco shoulder and their hands were still linked carefully nicole folded her parchment up again and picked the quill up um i just remembered i said i d help paul with some charms homework nicole told them and disappeared out of the common room deciding that she was in no mood to watch draco and sam all afternoon riley sat on the grass beneath a large oak tree a large book was balanced on his knee with a piece of parchment on top of it a muggle pen similar to the one he had given alex in his hand he stared blankly at the only two words on the page not knowing how to continue on dear alex dear alex he mumbled to himself you know talking to yourself is the first sing of insanity an australian accent said to him but this time it was a girl what he asked looking up finding it was dougie friend dana dontworry it just a joke she told him plonking herself on the grass beside him right riley said turning back to his letter he tapped the pen against the parchment making a few black ink dots on the paper but no words would form who are you writing to dana asked him how do you now i writing a letter riley asked moving his hand over the writing that was already on the parchment i saw the word dear as i sat down plus you ve been pulling that same piece of paper out of your pocket for the last couple of days now she told him oh uh my friend alex he told her i dontreally know what to say though that a problem then dana said waving to dougie who was heading toward them riley nodded but didntsay anything as dougie sat down and dana began to plait her blonde hair what up dougie asked nothing riley replied and put the pen in his pocket riley writing to his friend alex but he doesntknow what to say to her dana said absentmindly wrapping a hair tie around her blonde plait i thought you werenttalking to alex dougie said i never said that riley said confused about the whole situation oh no wait you said she left dougie corrected himself if your talking to her then how come you cantwrite the letter dana said suddenly i i dontknow what to sat to her riley said immediately why dana asked because i confused about how i feel about her riley replied again unsure why he was telling them everything well i sure if you tell her the truth it will be alright dana said getting up she grabbed dougie hand and helped him before brushing the grass off her pants see you later riley she said softly walking back toward the school building the dark figure stopped in front of the old cracked mirror using his sleeve he wiped away some of the dirt and grim that had built up on it finally he let his hood slide back the reflection of the mans round moon shaped face could just be seen through the darkness of the damp bathroom the thin purple scar curving from his ear to above his eye visible a battle scar that had been taken during the final battle a battle where he stood along side one of the greatest wizards of time and fought against one of the most powerful wizards of all time a scar that had been achieved by deflecting the wrong curse at the wrong time the interference that had saved her life but almost shattered his a scar that represented his passion and love for hermione granger all at once a scar that cost him his sanity a n okay okay i now that it was a bit short and most of it was a bit pointless but i did say i d put it up either today or sunday and i just wrote the first things that came to mind any hoo in that last part i left a few hints about who the stalker might be anyone have any new ideas now that we all know it not ben walker although that who i intended it to be in the first place okay now i confusing myself hopefully i ll have the next chapter up sometime during the week please review and i hope you liked this although most of it was pointless luv emgurl disclaimer dontown anything you recognize from the books a n thanks for all my great reviews any hoo i wontbe able to update for about two weeks cos i going on a holiday and wontbe back for ten days but hopefully you like this chapter alex sat on the end of her bed in her dorm the room was empty except for her as the other girls were at the meeting about the trip to hogwarts that was going to take place in a few days opening the purple journal alex laid it flat open turning to the second page willing the words to come out her a few minutes later the only thing on the paper was a large black ink spot sighing she closed the book and threw it against the wall when they were talking about she had been fine even excited about returning to hogwarts but now that it was happening alex was scared that everything would go haywire again quickly exiting her dorm and common room alex made her way towards the headmaster office stopping infront of a statue of two dueling wizards alex repeated the password and watched as they disappeared to reveal the waiting area for the office as alex stepped into the small room she heard the now familiar sound of the statues reappearing gently she knocked against the dark purple door and waited for professor dokoft to reply the door was opened in a matter of seconds alex dear what wrong the blonde witch said allowing her entry into the office alex sat on the black chair that faced the headmaster desk as she sat on the other side nothing wrong alex said confidently trying to make herself believe it then what do i owe this earlier visit to usually you dontcome in until after dinner the professor smiled placing her hands on the table i just wanted alex trailed off you know you can tell me professor dokoft paused why didntyou go to the meeting alex looked up at the teacher i cantgo back not yet she swallowed hard i need more time if i go back now then everything will fall to pieces again the blonde witch nodded i understand alex and i have already talked to professor dumbledore about your situation and he has agreed with me in that we dontthink now is the right time for you to go back to hogwarts yet perhaps you ll be ready for the end of year trip i men we cantleave you here by yourself can we alex nodded before breathing a sigh of relief what should i tell my mum and dad though alex asked suddenly i think you should tell them the truth professor dokoft told her or i could talk to them if you like no i can do it alex answered standing up the blonde witch returned to the papers that were on her desk as alex exited the office thanks professor anytime dear the professor responded carefully placing the letter from dumbledore about the recent attack in her waste bin logan sat in the small classroom listening to the teacher at the front drone to the house about what was expected of them as fascino quas students and the reputation they had to keep up at hogwarts he yawned and began to search the room for his sister and alex georgie was sitting across the other side of the room leaning against the wall he eyes were closed and her blonde curls were slightly covering her face he looked to the left and right to her but only found some first year boy who was actually taking notes and a girl who was picking her nails he continued to look around the room in search for alex but did not find her then finally the meeting finished in a flash georgie eyes were open and she was at the door logan followed with the other students and began to walk down the hallway toward his common room hey alex voice filled the corridor how boring was that meeting how would you know logan said slightly irritated you werenteven there i know alex said seriously but didntelaborate they continued walking this time going straight past their common room and up the stairs where georgie footsteps could be heard so where were you logan finally asked with professor dokoft alex paused logan i not going back not yet anyway oh was logan only reply as they finally reached the door which just closed behind georgie he opened the door and waited for alex to enter before he did the door clicked shut behind him brian was re tuning his guitar with headphones on while georgie and charlie were talking on the couch kimmie was nowhere to be seen and charlie winced as logan glanced at him so um did you still want me to help with that stuff logan said turning back to alex who had sat down at the table um no not at the moment i have to write to my parents first alex said vaguely looking down at the piece of parchment she had infront of her maybe later blaise lay in bed as hermione tossed and turned next to him it was a warm night and the small stuffy room just kept the air in plus with hermione not being able to keep still blaise had any wonder as to why he had thought he could sleep at all blaise hermione voice was soft as if she actually believe he might have been asleep mmm he mumbled i cantsleep she said sitting up pushing the bed sheet off of them i know blaise replied cantyou just pretend to sleep though blaise hermione whined alright alright blaise moaned and sat up aswell flicking the light beside his bed on why cantyou sleep i was thinking about the wedding hermione said as if it explained everything yeah so blaise muttered well i thought it would be nice if we had it in the garden of grimmuld place i ve talked to harry about it and he said the yard is quite beautiful now the plants have been properly maintained hermione told him i thought you wanted it in the great hall blaise asked her she frowned at him a few brown curls falling over her dark brown eyes i thought it would be more meaningful at grimmuld place since that was where we first became friends hermione began it also the place where you left me blaise spoke wishing he hadntsaid anything hermione eyes darkened but she didntsay anything but if that where you want it then we ll have it there blaise said quickly as hermione turned her back on him and laid back down on the bed no your right it would be much better if we just had it here her voice was muffled through her pillow hermione blaise said just turn the light off blaise hermione told him in the corner of the class room ron yawned as he watched hermione teach the seventh year some charm on how to make an apple tree sprout blue apples like any one would eat them he thought to himself miserably the novelty of following hermione around day and night had finally worn off and although ron would be the last person to admit it he actually missed teaching his classes just practice on your model trees hermione told the class before sitting at her own desk as ron looked on yawning again he turned back to the daily prophet he had on his desk unaware that hermione had stood up from her desk and was opening the closet window finally as the owl entered the classroom along with the loud outbursts from the students ron looked up again the small owl smoothly landed on hermione shoulder and she reached up to untie the note hermione don t ron shouted causing the classroom to go silent what wrong professor weasley hermione said slowly glancing at her students uh nothing just here let me take that owl out into the hall for you ron said carefully knowing that the students had no idea why he had been in their classes the last couple of weeks hermione sighed and carefully placed the owl on ron shoulder following him out of the classroom students back to your work she told them as the closed the door behind her ron what do you think your doing hermione said loudly he ignored her choosing to inspect the piece of parchment that was still tied to the owls leg unmarked tied with a blue leather strap the owl is a soft caramel color he mentally noted ron hermione stern voice broke him from his thoughts hermione what i trying to concentrate he told her angrily as he began to untie the letter off the owl since when have you hade the right to take my mail hermione said just as angrily ron looked at her as if the reason was obvious just since my best friend and her family is being targeted by some lunatic he hissed at her as she snatched the rolled up parchment away oh hermione replied her cheeks going slightly red sorry she handed the unopened parchment back to him hermione are you alright ron asked taking the parchment raising his eyebrows slightly i fine her voice squeaked now would you just open it and see who it from ron looked down at the piece of parchment and tapped it with his wand nothing happened carefully he undid the seal and unraveled the piece of parchment only to be greeted with his goddaughter curly scrawl it from alex he said reading the letter hermione frowned what does it say ron lowered the piece of parchment and looked at his best friend uh if i tell you you have to promise not to take it out on me what hermione asked confused grabbing the letter from ron hands her eyes quickly scanned the letter from her daughter mum dad well i guess now is a good time to tell you since if i dontturn up it might be worse anyway i ve decided not to come back to hogwarts yet i want to wait until the end of year trip with the rest of the school hopefully you ll understand love alex riley woke with a start and reached out for his glasses screams filled the boys dormitory and bodies jumping out of their beds moved across to the far side of the room riley too climbed out of his own bed and moved to the bed that was opposite his the bed where dougie slept the australian boy tossed and turned in his bed the sheets twisting around his legs like tentacles pulling him down a scream filled the air again and nick grabbed his arms preventing the boy from moving again somebody get professor morris he said urgently none o f the boys moved now he screamed riley took a step back away from the bed before turning and running out of the room finally racing their head door he began to bang loudly on the door professor morris he shouted when no reply came finally the door was flung open and the startled teacher looked at the boy what is it mr potter the teacher asked him it dougie something happened to him riley said breathlessly turning back toward the dorm the teacher quick on his heals when they arrived the lights were on in the room and most of the boys were still huddled around the australian bed dougie his eyes still closed was trying to break free from nick grasp when another scream escaped from his lips move the teacher told the boys and they all took a step back he touched the boy on the head carefully as another scream came douglas he said loudly sitting the boy up then in an instant he stopped moving and slumped against the teacher dougie nick said this time stepping toward the bed professor morris held his hand up signaling for the boy to stand back dougie he repeated laying the bay back against his pillow slowly the blonde boy eyes opened professor it was awful he whispered his voice raspy from the screaming what was awful what happened the teacher asked him the girl crying a man next to her dead he stopped taking a breathe she wouldntstop crying and calling for help then a man came and he just laughed at as she cried who was it who was the girl professor morris pushed the boy a n not literally it wa it was dougie began to sob now who the teacher prodded impatiently riley it was her he whispered it was alex at that moment riley felt the color drain from his face as every pair of eyes in the room turned to look at him who alex one of the boy asked him professor morris stood and riley ignored the boy mr furno take douglas to see madame hamilton he told nick before turning toward riley mr potter i think you need to come with me he said softly riley nodded and continued to ignore the stares of the other boys alex pushed a stray hair out of her face as she dipped her brush into the dark blue paint she was surprised as to how much she had actually missed her art classes while she was hogwarts although she was never really good at it she enjoyed letting her emotions out on paper especially since her writing was not allowing her to do that at the moment next to her georgie had painted a large pink heart in the middle of her page and was carefully painting gm 4 cl in black paint in the middle logan was glaring at her from her other side as the music played softly in the background alex turned back to her painting it hadntturned out like she had planned but nothing ever did when she was in art instead of a landscape view of the sun setting on the beach she had ended up painting something which resembled the hogwarts crest and she had no idea how she went from the first to second aah miss granger wonderful her teachers soft voice blended into the music perhaps you could take it to hogwarts with you tomorrow alex merely nodded before dipping her brush into the gold paint she carefully signed her name at the bottom of the picture lifting her brush off the easel alex frowned at the letters she had just placed there a granger then with a swish of her brush the name was extended a granger zabini satisfied with her work alex placed her brush down and watched the clock as it ticked toward the end of the lesson blaise how could she not come back hermione whined to him as they sat down at the great hall the letter had arrived yesterday and hermione was still complaining about it although it hadntreally come as a surprise to blaise she ll come back when she ready blaise said tiredly taking a bread roll fro the middle of the table as harryand ron finally sat down but she knew how much i wanted to see her hermione exclaimed hermione please blaise said rubbing his temple we need to give her time or else she might not come back at all what hermione said her voice rising harry and ron both stopped talking and turned to look at the couple what do you mean she might not come back i just meant that she might stay in the us once her school is finished blaise tried to explain you think she going to do something stupid dontyou hermione said tears welling up in her eyes no blaise began hermione pushed her chair away from the table and got up mione where you going ron said standing up too blaise didntmean that harry and blaise watched as ron followed her out past the students and down the corridor blaise slammed his fist against the table calm down harry muttered everything i do harry everything blaise said looking at the man she never satisfied everything my fault and she blaming me in every possible way she can blaise harry began what harry are you going to tell me that what life is like everyone gets blamed for other people bloody mistakes but if she keeps on acting like this then i dontknow what i ll do blaise growled back blaise harry tried again what blaise said finally breaking out of his little rant um well you see the thing is ginny said maybe it not all this that causing her to act like this maybe it a completely different reason harry said awkwardly maybe it hormonal oh oooh blaise said finally getting the picture no wait that cantbe right she blaise harry said again as much as i love her i dontwant to hear about that kind of stuff about my best female friend oh right blaise said vaguely getting lost in his own thoughts riley sat in the headmaster office dougie now awake although still quite pale sat in the chair nest to him professor morris was talking quite animatedly with the headmaster and your sure this as the girl in your dreams the headmaster pointed to the picture riley had retrieved from his locker dougie nodded slowly looking apologetic at riley and who is this girl the headmster looked at riley riley swallowed hard her named is alexandria granger she used to attend hogwarts but after some family problems she transferred back to fascino quas in the states riley said clearly i see th eheadmaster said what kind of family problems her mother is being stalked professor morris interrupted and when was the last time you spoke to alexandria the headmaster turned back to riley once a couple of weeks ago riley answered other wise it was before she left just before i came here the headmaster nodded and mr potter do you think it is wise if we contact albus dumbledore riley simply nodded but i dontthink you should tell her parents why not beca because the man dougie described sounded like her father blaise zabini riley responded you two may go back to your dorm the headmaster told the boys professor morris turned to talk to the headmaster as the two boys silently stood up sir dougie quiet voice interrupted the two teachers make sure dumbledore keeps her safe riley eyes began to sting as he quickened his pace heading in the direction of the dorms riley dougie said trying to catch up with him riley continued to walk and roughly opened the door nick and two other boys were waiting for them riley i sorry dougie said as he caught up with the boy as he stood not moving in the middle of the doorframe his glasses began to fog up and suddenly riley couldntsee anything ril nick voice was blocked out as riley head hit the cold hard floor dear alex well your mother wasnttoo happy with your last letter i just ask that if you re to do that again write to me first and i ll let her down lightly she misses you as do i and we were both looking forward to seeing you again this being said however i do understand how you might not be ready to come back just yet just dontstay away for too long and if you dontcome back at the end of the year i swear i might not be able to restrain your mother from flooing over there and dragging you back anyway how are things going i hope you ve been continuing your meeting with professor dokoft well i hope to see you soon say hello to the twins for me love always dad alex stuffed the letter back into her purple school robes as charlie and brian rushed past her come on lex charlie called to her logan said 2 30 alright i coming alex said following the two boys as they practically ran up the stairs she didntknow what they were so excited about logan and georgie were just going to hogwarts it wasntlike they were leaving forever finally she same to the practice room door and she opened it carefully the five people already in the room were almost silent but not because she just entered brian and kimmie each stood on separate sides of the room glaring at each other why logan hummed loudly to himself as georgie and charlie were whispering to each other pulling her purple school robes alex looked at her friends so when do you leave she asked soon logan told her are you sure you dontwant to come some one got to keep these three out of trouble alex joked avoiding eye contact with the boy tell nikki i miss her will you alex requested logan nodded and glanced at his watched come on georgie he spoke loudly we should go to the ballroom now georgie hugged charlie one last time before turning to hug alex see you all soon she said and bounced out of the room behind her brother hermione blaise said quietly what is it blaise hermione said impatiently as she tried to comb her hair i think we need to talk he spoke clearly about what she said and you better make it quick the students will be arriving soon the last time we you know did you use that charm blaise asked not getting anything out the way he had planned hermione turned to face him her face quite pale i cantremember i just hoping that i did she spoke softly blaise nodded i mean it would be nice wouldntit hermione sat down on the bed a baby not supposed to be nice blaise it supposed to be a magical experience i know from when i had alex i was so scared but then the first time i held her in my arms i knew she was perfect what are we going to do blaise asked slowly hermione was slightly startled by this question do you want a baby blaise she asked him avoiding his gaze i dontknow he said more loudly than he intended i thought that i lost that chance when i couldntfind you but then you came back with alex and yet sometimes for the smallest of moments i still feel like i missing out on something hermione squeezed his hand how about if tomorrow we go for a visit to the hospital wing a n okay i probably would have liked that a bit longer but what can i say everything falling into place nicely anyway like i said i wontbe able to update for about two weeks cos i going away but please please review luv emgurl disclaimer obviously i dontown harry potter or any one or thing relating ot the book thanx for the new reviews i glad you all liked my second chapter sorry about all the spelling and grammar mistakes i kind of rushed the end because i was tired and had school anyway here the next chapter hermione sighed she was sitting on one of the armchairs in her room pretending to read a book incase her daughter came looking for her she looked down at the page and noticed the writing was upside down she sighed again and turned the book around the right way she got up and put the book on her desk she was supposed to be helping set up the great hall for tomorrow when the students returned for the beginning of school but she told them she had a headache so they left her alone she walked over to the window and saw a familiar figure running around on the grass it was her daughter alex hermione watched her as she screamed and laughed as her companion chased her around on the grass suddenly the boy who she was with grabbed her and they both feel to the ground laughing as the boy turned around hermione found that it was the boy from the library harry and ginny son hermione smiled for the first time in days she was glad alex had made a friend she knew it had been hard for her to leave her best friend georgie and logan back in new york she continued to watch the two for a couple more minutes before she stepped back away from the window she sighed again she knew what was wrong she had been so surprised with herself for going off at ginny the other night especially in front of alex but hermione was mad at herself more than she was mad at ginny she knew she was ready to forgive her he heart had already told her that but she knew why she yelled at ginny it was because ginny had to got to her before blaise did in her heart hermione knew this was the truth apologise to her a soft voice said inside her brain as she looked in the mirror you were ready to forgive her before you even returned hermione shook her head and picked up the book once again from her desk and sat down she knew she wasntgoing to be able to concentrate and wasntpaying attention to anything when there was a knock on the door as she got up she began to feel dizzy shrugging it off she reached out for the handle and opened the door only to collapse into ginny weasley arms ginny took hermione straight to the hospital wing then she went to find ron ron she said breathlessly as she found him talking to his wife gin ron said looking away from his wife ron she began you need to come with me to the hospital wing why has harry hurt himself again he asked rolling his eyes at jessica jessica giggled but stopped when ginny looked at her no it hermione she collapsed she said quietly avoiding both their eyes ron didntsay anything ginny looked up and watched as he realised what she had said and suddenly he went pale ron jessica began putting her hand on his you go to the hospital wing i ll find alex she kissed him on the cheek she ll be alright she whispered into his ear before pushing him toward ginny jessica finally found alex she was outside sitting on the grass with her nephew riley hey aunt jess riley said standing up this is alex jessica looked at the boy i know riley her mother went to school with your father and uncle ron she replied he looked at alex slightly confused your harry potter son alex asked him yeah why he asked back before jessica interrupted them alex you need to come with me she said the girl looked at her aunt where to she asked jessica looked at the girl she didntknow what to say um to the hospital wing she said quietly before turning back to the castle something happened to mum she thought suddenly quickly following her aunt riley followed them too still unsure why it mattered who his parent were hermione lay in the bed in the hospital wing she had come to this place so many times when she was at school she was familiar with the place this time she knew why she was in here she had collapsed and this is where ginny had bought her ron was sitting in the chair next to her bed but she knew ginny was outside waiting to find out if she was okay the nurse came back into the room and hermione tried to sit up ron made her lay back down ron i fine she mumbled hermione if you were fine then you wouldntbe here he said looking at her suddenly alex got to the room mum she said hugging her are you ok what happened she asked pulling away from her ron got up and let alex sit in his chair the nurse came over to the bed before hermione had a chance to reply to her daughter ok well it looks like you ve been under some stress lately so far that seems to be the main cause of the collapse that and the fact you haventbeen eating proper meals the nurse said sternly looking at hermione you ll need to stay here overnight just incase it happens again hermione nodded as the n urse began to leave alex ron said if you dontwant to stay in your rooms by yourself your welcome to stay in paul room i could get the house elves to bring a cot up for him and you could sat in his bed alex shook her head no it ok i ll be fine by myself she said ok ron looked at hermione do you want us to go so you can rest hermione didntreply but when ron stood up and tried to usher alex out of the room she looked at him actually i was wondering if maybe i could talk to ginny she asked both of them looked at her please she asked as they both stood there ron nodded as alex followed him out to the hallway after a minute or two ginny came into the room she was looking down at her feet gin hermione began i just wanted to say thankyou for bringing me here ginny looked up at hermione who was sitting up in the bed now that ok she said she began to turn around to leave ginny hermione spoke again i also wanted to say that that i sorry ginny stopped but didntturn around hermione spoke again it was hard for me to come back but i did it for alex she needed to know who her family are you re apart of that family she felt a little more confident now ginny turned around she had tears in her eyes she still didntspeak you see the last couple of days i ve been thinking and i dontknow why i got mad you the other night i was ready to forgive you but then i saw blaise she trailed off hermione you donthave to forgive me ginny finally said holding back the tears hermione shook her head gin i want to forgive you see i know that if it wasntyou it would have been some other girl probably after we were married ginny looked at hermione confused hermione took a deep breath she had never told anyone what she was going to tell ginny ginny the night it happened i was going to leave blaise she stopped as ginny moved closer to her bed and sat at the foot of it why ginny asked her shocked a little you loved him sometimes love it isntenough we were nineteen gin and he said he wanted to marry me at first i thought it was right but then i noticed the look in his eyes he wasntready for marriage or to settle down and have children hermione began almost crying now ginny took her hand and hugged her i wasntgoing to leave you know hermione sobbed into her friends shoulder it was just the initial shock i never blamed you ginny pulled away and looked at her friend how could you not blame me she asked it like i said gin if it wasntyou it would have been some one else she said they hugged again unaware of the man who had slipped past the two teenagers in the waiting room and had listened to the whole conversation he left before either of the witches noticed him a n ok so that chapter 3 i know it was kind of unexpected of hermione to forgive ginny so soon but i was stuck for ideas read and review hope you enjoyed it luv emgurl disclaimer still dontown anything you recognise from the books hey sorry about not being able to update for over two weeks i know i said i d try and update after i got back but i had heaps of homework when school started back again because i didntdo cos i was writing the last chapter to give to you guys so anyway here the next chapter you ll have to excuse it if it a bit crappie but i a little stuck fro ideas alex woke the next morning with a splitting headache since all students from niveus had gone on the hogwarts trip it been arranged that alex was staying in the girls dorm in the croceus house checking her watch she found that it was 5 30 in the morning but with her headache she knew it was going to be impossible to go back to sleep silently she climbed out of her bed and headed toward the bathroom careful not to wake any of the other girls in the room she flicked the light switch on and shielded her eyes from the harsh light sighing and once adjusted to he new lights she turned the cold tap on and watched as the water began to run into the basin the lights were making her head pound even more so she wet the nearest face washer and held it to her face finally she showered and dressed and silently made her way through the girl dorm and into the common room which was empty apart from one of brian friends who was asleep bent over a desk sitting on an armchair alex watched him for a few minutes before he began to stir from being in such an uncomfortable position and voices could be heard from one of the dorms as a door opened and two male voices filled the room one she recognised as brian s alex swiftly exited the common room in an escape from anything causing he headache to grow worse eventually she found herself on the top floor the morning breeze whipping her school robes around her body she watched the many muggle cars as they d rove along the streets of new york and the bustling sidewalks which were already full at this early hour her stomach rumbling snapped her back into reality as she realised it would be best if she went and had breakfast now before there was too many students up slowly she made her way down to the bottom floor of the building realising that some one was following her she suddenly stopped half in fear half in hope that it was simply another student her hand began to shake and she had to grab hold of the railing on the side of the wall as her knees grew weak as she clearly saw a hooded figure disappear into the wall good morning beautiful charlie cheeky voice filled her ears and here i was thinking i d have to eat breakfast alo alex somebody help he yelled as her legs finally gave way and she collapsed into his arms nikki sam cheerful voice filled the girl dorm groans could be heard from the other beds in the room although both sam and nicole ignored them for different reasons however sam pulled the curtains back on the red head bed nicole weasley get up now she said trying to sound stern as nicole covered her head with the nearest pillow go away her muffled voice replied come on you have to get up you know you want to get up sam said trying to pry the pillow out of the girls hands no i don t i want to stay in bed nicole whined as the pillow was torn out of her hands why dontyou go annoy draco she sat up and looked at her friend who was fully dressed and beaming from ear to ear i had breakfast with him and there was no annoying done thankyou very much she paused and grinned cheekily at her friend besides you know i wouldntbe waking you up this early on a sunday if i didnthave something important to tell you she waited for nicole to ask her what it was but instead the girl just sat there trying to pull the covers around her shoulders well as you know they said the next fascino quas trip would be soon and we all figured they would have come yesterday but they didn t yeah so so dontinterrupt me sam joked well when me and draco were having breakfast a few first years in who we d never seen before where there so draco asked them who they were and they said they were fascino quas students which means they came last night what natalie voice came through the curtains on her bed before they were suddenly pulled back and she was standing on her bed which means that alex is now somewhere in the castle sam finally finished nicole nodded but didntget too excited well she was excited about seeing alex and georgie for that matter but she knew they would be with logan and they still hadnttalked except for when that thing happened to alex over there and technically it was georgie who had written to her can i go back to sleep now she asked sam who excited face turned to disappointment what no sam said a bit shocked as to why she wasntrushing around the room looking for some clothes other than her pyjamas like the two other girls that occupied the room i thought you d want to find alex straight away and draco had a theory about you disappearing with logan she tried to make her friend laugh but instead nicole just flopped back into her bed sam just stood there in the middle of the girls dorm with nicole pillow in her hands as jess and natalie were rummaging through their stuff nicole sam finally said to the girl who was burying her face into the mattress she tried to pull the cover over her head as sam sat on the edge nikki she said more gently this time is there something wrong the dorm was almost silent now as the two other girls went into the bathroom nicole shook her head into the mattress but didntsay anything i told draco to stop being a loser and made him promise not to tease you when logan around sam tried again besides i wouldntworry about that you have every right to snog him if you want a soft sob that nicole tried to muffle escaped into the room nicole sam said worried about why her friend was upset has something happened finally nicole sat up wiping her eyes she face her friend you donthave to worry about draco she said confidently and began to climb out her bed because i doubt logan will even talk to me let alone kiss me what why sam asked confused because i haventtalked to him since alex left and he probably thinks i a bitch nicole replied pulling some clothes out before heading toward the bathroom you said you were going to write to him sam stopped her we figured that who all those owl were coming from every week well they weren t nicole snapped they were from my mum jeez sorry we just figured they were from him sam answered anyway he wontthink you re a bitch who thinks nicole a bitch natalie asked coming out of the bathroom nicole just glared at the girl she seems to think logan thinks she is because she been ignoring his letters sam said i wasntignoring them nicole almost screeched not replying is the same thing as ignoring them sam tried to pint out so wait you nicole have this gorgeous guy who practically followed you around everywhere when we were in new york writing to you and you just ignored his letters and now you re scared he thinks you re a bitch natalie asked trying to work things out i yes nicole answered well i dontthink he thinks you re a bitch your too nice jess said coming into the room pulling her hair into a pony tail but the only way to find out is to talk to him but i dontknow what to say to him why do you think i never replied to any of the letters after i got over alex leaving nicole said wishing hey would all just drop it sam jess and natalie all looked at each other a knowing look on each of their faces well then you ll have to get him to talk to you first natalie said as if it were obvious nicole looked at them confused and how is that going to happen well he likes you right jess asked and you like him sam put in so with our help you just have to look irresistible when you see him jess continued which more than likely will be at breakfast when the normal people go down there natalie finished glancing at sam nicole looked back at them horrified are you going to give me a make over natalie laughed dontlook so scared but if you want to get to breakfast at the time when most people get there go have a shower it nine o clock now they all stared at her when nicole didntmove and she had no choice but to go into the bathroom riley woke in the infirmary unsure of where he was of why he was there the memories of the day before suddenly filled his head his head was throbbing slightly from where it hit the floor he tried to sit up when a small figure entered the room riley dana soft voice filled the room how are you my head it hurts he said dumbly lying back down after his attempts to sit didntreally work well you did hit the floor pretty hard dana replied riley didntknow whether or not to agree so decided on saying nothing nick said he d stop by later if you were awake dana said breaking the silence i not sure about dougie though riley simply nodded he told me everything she spoke quietly he thinks it his fault riley even though i ve already told him it isn t she waited for riley to respond he been really upset about it she said slowly tell him not to worry about it rile said bitterly it not his problem some psycho trying to hurt her and her family tell him just to forget it riley dana asked him after a minute of silence he looked up at her a genuine look of concern in her eyes alex she was your girlfriend wasntshe who told you that riley asked trying to sound surprised no one i kinda figured it out myself dana said taking his answer as a yes if you still love her then why did you break up she decided to go back to america when she found out i was accepted here riley paused but i wasntgoing to come and she thought it was because of her which i guess it was i wanted to be there to protect her then she left the nurse came into the room before either of them could say anything else well i might come back later with nick dana said brushing her blonde hair out her eyes as she stood up see you later riley yeah see you riley responded as the nurse began to check him over forty five minutes later three gryffindor fifth years push a red head girl into the great hall you look great sam told her for the seventh time since they left the dormitory it was true nicole did look good even thoguh the three girls had hardly done anythign to her since they didnthave enough wore a simple green peasant skirt that fell to just below her knees and a white tank top her red hair flowed to her shoulders in natural waves and she wore light make up which gave her a natural glow infact she looked so good that when she entered the gryffindor common room the fifth year boys that were waiting for natalie and jess went silent sam and draco began to leave the great hall where are you going she asked them quickly we ve already had breakfast draco pointed out so who am i going to sit with she asked you can sit with us tom one of the guys said grabbing her hand pulling her into the group of guys tom leave her alone jess said come one nicole you can sit with me and nat the three girls sat down away from the group of boys natalie and jess began to talk as nicole concentrated on her breakfast and only her breakfast she didnteven look up as her brother bill came tearing past with her cousin clair and stef right behind him finally she was snapped out her trance nicole natalie kind voice spoke to her you like you ve fallen in love with that piece of toast what nicole asked you can look up it not as if the whole world is watching you jess giggled although maybe the male population is nicole glanced down the table to see the guys from her year level still watching her she shuddered slightly and looked away only to find herself facing the doors to the great hall a group of fifth year students entered the room although they were clearly the fascino quas students as nicole immediately recognised georgie and logan that weird natalie said who was sitting on the same side of the table as nicole didntyou say it was alex house that was coming jess turned around to face the group and nicole quickly scanned through he rest of the students realising that alex was not with them maybe she with her parent s jess spoke nicole nodded but didntsay anything as georgie looked in her direction she smiled at nicole who smiled back but didntnot walk over to them instead choosing to follow the rest of her year and sit down at the hufflepuff table logan sat with his back to the gryffindor table nicole tom slid down the seat next to her how do you fancy coming to hogsmeade with me next weekend shove off tom natalie replied as he tried to put his arm around the red head just as logan turned around after georgie pointed toward them he stared blankly at her then turned back to his own table nicole heart sank well it looks like your plan didntwork she said shrugging tom off her and standing up thanks anyway nik jess called after her as she began to walk away from the table both girls glared at tom who was still sitting with them what he exclaimed nothing they both replied and exited the great hall aswell she leaving georgie told her brother by herself now would be the perfect time for you to talk to her logan looked at his sister of she wanted me to talk to her then she would have replied to my letters logan do you really believe that georgie asked yes logan replied and piked up his piece of toast georgie sighed and looked down at her own breakfast logan stubbornness had suddenly turned her off her food hermione and blaise left the hospital wing hand in hand hermione had a small smile on her face while blaise wore a huge grin ron and harry were following them closely behind but put enough distance between them so they could still have their privacy do you think she pregnant ron whispered to his friend harry shrugged we donteven know if that what they went in there for he pointed out yeah but if blaise said it wasnther you know and i mean jess acted like that when she was pregnant with paul ron protested well we ll just have to wait wontwe harry pointed out again they continued to follow blaise and hermione down the corridors passing the library you dontthink they re a bit old to have a baby do you ron asked suddenly ron i only 34 hermione voice joined their conversation i what sorry ron stuttered does that mean you are hermione glanced at blaise who looked back at her before she turned to her two best friends yes we are just donttell anyone we want to tell alex first ron and harry nodded both slightly surprised the four of them continued to walk down the corridors so who hasntbreakfast yet hermione asked suddenly erm we ve all had breakfast harry replied hermione grinned at him yeah i know but i ve suddenly had a craving for a croissant with peanut butter on it ron glanced at blaise who in turn glance at harry what if i just called dobby he suggested not wanting to go down to the great hall just as long as i get it hermione responded hello nicole nicole weasley stopped as her name was called out she looked up and found herself face to face with the four of them hello professor granger professor zabini professor potter uncle ron a n imagine if you actually had to say that i suppose you know by now that alex decided not to come back yet she said softly um no i didn t nicole replied hoping she didntlook too disappointed yes we have to wait a bit longer to see her dontwe blaise hermione continued nicole glanced at professor zabini who nodded well i was just going to he library nicole lied history of magic homework i have to finish okay dontwork too hard though it is the week end hermione told her before allowing her to leave as she walked away nicole heard her uncle tell hermione that was a bit rich coming from her sighing nicole continued to wander the corridors not wanting to go back to the gryffindor common room and see sam and draco or natalie and jess finally she found she had not choice but to go to the library knowing they probably wouldntlook for her there it was after lunch and draco and sam still hadntseen nicole maybe we should have stayed with her at breakfast sam told draco again and what if she with logan and your just stressing over nothing draco asked as they walked into the great hall just forget about it nicole knows how to handle herself he grabbed her hand and pulled her gently toward the great doors putting his free hand on the handle preparing to open it when it was flung open from someone on the other side almost hitting him in the face oi he shouted stepping back as the door swung to right where he was just standing watch what your doing he finished angrily georgie poked her head around the door oh sorry draco mikey can be a bit over excited sometimes she said motioning to a boy standing in front of her draco face softened slightly when he saw it was georgie that all right draco can get overly angry sometimes cantyou drakey sam replied the four of them stood in an awkward silence so um how come we haventbeen smothered by alex yet draco asked breaking the silence because alex didntcome on the trip logan answered as he and some other students re entered the building stopping with georgie and her friend mikey oh sam knew she sounded disappointed where nicole draco asked suddenly knowing she hadntbeen with natalie and jess when they had seen them talking to professor brown logan shrugged before walking away he wonttalk to her georgie told them he a stubborn moron but i bet if she looks the way she did today he might forgive her in about a week and a half you ll be back in america in a week and half sam responded as the other students began to wander off do you wanna come out side with us to catch up georgie glanced at their still entwined hands then at draco face before turning back to sam maybe later she told them i might go talk to logan oh sam replied see ya later georgie grinned at them before bouncing off in the direction logan went finally draco got sam out by the lake sitting underneath a large tree sam began to rip pieces of grass up i wonder why she didntcome back she finally spoke maybe she still needs more time draco responded i guess sam looked at the blonde boy i wonder if nicole knows draco didntreply but instead put his hands on hers causing her to stop shredding the grass has anyone every told you you worry about your friends way too much draco asked her you re the first she responded well you do he replied but i guess that what makes you so cute how much you care about them so i cute now sam asked yep draco said grinning at her logan wandered around the castle on his own it wasntthat eh wanted to be by himself he just couldntremember how to get back to the common room his year level was assigned to he felt like he d walked down this corridor about six times and it was frustrating him because it felt like he wasntin control even though he knew it was a different corridor every time he passed different classrooms each one displaying different magical things until finally he came to the library with the hope of finding a teacher that would able to direct him back to the hufflepuff common room entering the library he was slightly shocked at seeing one so big bookcases filled with ancient looking books mixed with new books filled the entire room empty desks and chairs were placed randomly between the bookshelves and small armchairs and couches were strategically placed around windows and unlit fireplaces finding no teacher at the desk logan turned to leave the room when a glimpse of bright red on the other side of the room knowing he would be getting a few glares from a few people if he didnttalk to her logan began to walk across the library toward nicole nic logan began but found she was asleep a book in her hand logan glanced at his watch it was only three thirty but he guessed she must have had a late night the book slid out her hand and dropped to the floor making a soft bang but she didntstir he watched her for a minute and he had to admit to himself that she looked adorable when she was asleep the library door banged opened and a group of rowdy slytherin entered the library not noticing logan or the sleeping nicole logan glared at them before he glanced back down at the red head who was now sitting up and wide awake although she was yet to notice logan who was standing behind the couch logan watched as she brushed her hair behind her ears before rubbing her eyes before searching for the book she had dropped minutes before just as logan was about to back away and exit the library nicole stood up and faced him both just looked at each other for a moment logan losing the ability to speak hi nicole finally broke the silence hey logan managed to say back silence filled the space between and nicole could fill the tension i um have to go she said quietly looking down at the book in her hands she began to walk around the couch and past logan hoping he would stop her he didntsay or do anything and as nicole reached the library door the only sound she could hear was the laughter coming from the slytherin s she put her hand on the door handle when his voice finally filled her ears um nicole she turned to face him would you be able to show me how to get back to the hufflepuff common room i dontknow where it is nicole responded before slipping out of the room and down the corridor in the direction of her own common room alex woke in the dark hospital like room fascino quas had for the students when they found themselves sick or if they had an accident with a charm or a potion it was very different from the hogwarts hospital wing for one thing it was only three rooms and was much more hospital like it took her a moment to adjust to the darkness and to realise where she was in a chair closet to her bed she could make out charlie his head resting against the bedside table snoring lightly at the end of her bed against the wall was a small couch being occupied by both kimmie and brian both asleep kimmie with her head resting against his shoulder ignoring her pounding headache alex decided to think about her friends in hogwarts hoping this would also help her to erase her memories from that morning eventually her thoughts turned to riley as she began to wonder how he was doing and how much she missed him silently a tear slid down her cheek and alex rolled over so that she was facing the wall although charlie was asleep sniffing alex wiped her eyes on the sheet alex kimmie voice asked into the darkness alex didntrespond hoping she would think she was asleep alex knew she had stuffed up and she didntwant anyone to give her advice on it pulling the sheet tighter around her alex began to feel her eyelids grow heavy and minutes alter she too was asleep her dreams being filled with a red head glasses wearing quidditch player the school is definitely closing a low male voice filled the classroom and that final professor dokoft voice responded yes the american minister of magic replied i will be informing dumbledore shortly tomorrow i expect you to have sent out the letters to the parents explaining the real reason for the hogwarts trips this year professor dokoft nodded and the short round man disappeared in a flash of green flames a n yes i know not much happened in this chapter and yes i do know it was mainly about logan and nicole but i have to admit they re my favourite two characters in this whole story so i dontcare but anyway moving on i know for a fact that their will definitely be more stalker action in the next few chapters but if any of you readers want to see something happen ideas would be appreciated please review and i ll try to update as soon as i can luv emgurl disclaimer dontown anything you recognize from the books a n hey sorry it been a while since my last up date but i ve been really busy with school and stuff then we had this year 12 graduation thing that everyone else had to go to and then we had my year level semi formal which was brilliant but anyway i finally managed to get this chapter out thanks to all my great reviewers again and i hope you all like it alex was finally allowed to leave the hospital wing but only after a very tired looking professor dokoft visited her and only after the school building had been thoroughly searched although alex tried to maintain the fact that she as probably just hallucinating from her head ache she had refused to think about riley pushing any thoughts of him that her mind from the previous night out instead trying to replace them with words or sentences which she could transform into a song ignoring the purple notebook and shiny silver pen alex grabbed her old blue book and pink pen before heading toward the courtyard on the roof of the building it was still up there with no breeze or harsh sunlight beating down on her alex sat on a long stone bench in the corner of courtyard balancing her notebook on her knee she waited for words anything really to come to her twisting the pen around in her hand alex was slightly shocked as the door to the courtyard open to reveal a disshelved looking professor dokoft who didntnotice alex in the corner alex watched as she moved across the balcony and rested her hands on the ledge staring out across the city even from where alex was the headmistress looked even more tired than she had that morning he blonde hair was slightly frizzy and she was slumped putting all her against the railing professor dokoft alex finally asked standing up and joining the headmistress at the balcony oh alex sorry i didntsee you up here how are you feeling dear she said i fine really alex told her um are you okay suddenly she felt funny about asking her teacher something that could be personal the blonde teacher tried to smile but it ended up strained and alex could easily tell that it didntreach her blue eyes i fine what are you doing up here by yourself she tried to change the topic oh i was just writing some stuff for when georgie and logan get back for the band alex mumbled trying to fit it all together professor dokoft didntsay anything finally reaching a decision she would know soon anyway her parents had already been sent the letter alex dear their not coming back not permantely anyway the school closing she paused waiting for alex outburst but their came none professor dumbledore and i have discussed it already and we ve decided to move the final trip forward to next week and will stay at hogwarts until the end of the year the students who wish to return to hogwarts will do so next year but those who wish to attend a school here will also be able to why alex finally asked not enough students want to come here professor dokoft replied simply an announcement will be made tonight at dinner where have you been charlie demanded as soon as alex walked through the door of the practice room what alex asked you said you were going to the toilet half an hour ago charlie replied you could have passed out again and no one would have known well i didntso you donthave to worry alex replied knowing that she had lied to them when she went to the courtyard charlie leave her alone kimmie looked up from her music book no i want to know where she went charlie demanded god you sound like you re her dad or something brian joked do you know what georgie will do to me if something happens to her charlie replied well he turned back to alex who had managed to get past him and join brian on the couch i was talking to professor dokoft alex shrugged no big deal it is a big deal charlie exclaimed next time tell me where you re going to be yeah okay dad alex replied sarcastically albus dumbledore entered his staffroom every single professor apart from ben walker who was still unconscious in the hospital wing was they re waiting for the announcement silence filled the room as dumbledore stood at the end of the large table in the middle of the room as you are all aware of he began we have been running a successful program this year with fascino quas school of magic arts in a week and a half professor hermione granger and blaise zabini were to make the final trip to new york with hufflepuff this however will not be taking place a few teachers looked at each other but neither hermione nor blaise moved already knowing what was coming the final trip where the two remaining houses at fascino quas will be joining us at the end of the week and the students will attend hogwarts until the end of the year where they will then have the choice of returning next year or attending a school in america dumbledore told them so the school in new york it closed a teacher at the back of the room asked the american ministry of magic have been observing the school intake for a few years one of the reasons why i began this program with professor dokoft they have finally decided that there is no reason of the school to continue to run with the small numbers of students enrolling each year choosing to close the school at the beginning of next year we however thought it would be best if the students began here almost immediately dumbledore finished dismissing any further questions hermione blaise may i please see you both in my office he motioned for them and they followed hermione blaise harry and ron followed dumbledore down the corridors and up the flight of stairs behind the gargoyle statue finally they came to his office with harry and ron sitting in the waiting room hermione and blaise sat infront of the desk while dumbledore moved to the opposite side now that the two of you have been put under more pressure with organizing where these students will be placed until the end of the year i understand if you wish to pass the job on to some of the other teachers dumbledore paused professor dokoft and i have agreed that at the moment alex looks ready to return but as we gave her a choice about coming back or staying at the school for the last trip we are unsure as to how she may react coming back without a choice especially when we are no closer to finding the attack which is why i think it would be best if we let the rest of the staff organize everything but it is up to you he looked at hermione and blaise who still had no reaction i think we can handle it all right professor hermione replied confidently blaise looked at her a look of uncertainty across his face are you sure i dontwant any extra placed on top of you especially with the baby dumbledore answered both looked at him slightly shocked how harry and ron said they wouldnttell anyone hermione spluttered ah but professor brown thought it was best that i knew besides with your radiating glow permanent smile and slightly odd appetite it would not have been long before i realised dumbledore answered but if you feel you can still organize everything in time then i will not pass the job on to the other staff what if harry and ron helped us blaise interrupted i sure they would love to do something other than sit and do nothing during our classes ah yes that would be an excellent solution for their boredom perhaps jessica and ginny may volunteer their time also dumbledore smiled at them professor when will the students be informed about this hermione asked i have organized a meeting with the fascino quas teachers just before lunch then when professor dokoft arrives their students will be informed and they will return to america to collect an belongings of theirs that are still at their school our students will be informed tonight at dinner dumbledore told them which means i must now leave as the teachers are waiting for me in the great hall hermione and blaise stood and followed him out of their office and into the waiting room what going on harry asked as dumbledore disappeared down the spiral staircase nothing hermione told him are you ready for what ron asked slowly your next class isntuntil this afternoon i know but blaise has just volunteered the two of you to help us readjust the castle and plan the feast for when the new students arrive hermione smiled sweetly at them before disappearing down the staircase harry and ron glared at blaise slightly who hastily followed his fianc e down the stairs later that day alex followed brian to the croceus table she looked up to find that professor dokoft was not sitting at the staff table and the teachers were watching the students nervously she glanced across the room to find that the empty table from the niveus house had been placed back between the other two houses and charlie winked at her cheekily from his position across the other side of the room although also looked surprised to see the empty table in the middle of the room gee georgie ate more than that when she went on that health kick brian joked to her ten minutes after the meal started alex stared t him and blinked a few time um what nothing he replied frowning slightly your food getting cold oh right alex looked down at her plate suddenly the mashed potato didntlook at that appealing um i not really hungry she pushed the plate toward the middle of the table and the boy alex had watched while he was asleep the pervious day immediately asked if he could have it alex nodded at him you alright brian asked quietly as alex sat their watching the other students eat yeah i fine alex lied thinking about the earlier conversation with professor dokoft i wonder where dokoft is brian looked up toward the staff table as if only noticing their headmaster wasntthere for the first time yeah he replied before turning back to his own food five minutes later alex was still watching the other students eat dreading the moment their headmaster would arrive and seeing the shocked faces on the other students until finally she decided she didntwant to be there hey brian i think i gonna go back to the common room i ll see you later alex told him standing up just as she was halfway across the room a clear voice that she recognized as one of the drama teachers spoke over the noise the students were making all students are to remain in the dining hall until professor dokoft has dismissed you she will be here shortly and with that alex was forced to return to her seat next to brian i wonder what that about brian said as she sat alex in turn just shrugged and picked up a glass of water with in fifteen minutes the doors to the dining room opened revealing their blonde headmaster behind her were the staff and students who were supposed to be at hogwarts all the students who were sitting stopped eating and stared at the niveus students as they filed into the room and sat at the empty table nobody spoke as their headmaster made her way to the front of the room as she turned to face the students the remaining food on the tables disappeared although hardly anyone noticed the aim of our school was to bring the arts together with our magic professor dokoft spoke clearly and looked at the students we have never restricted our students of much believing that your freedom brings out the best of you however one thing you may have noticed is that today we closed your owl services this is because i wanted you to hear the following together so you know the truth the students remained silent waiting for what was going to be said alex felt a slight lump forming in her throat fascino quas has been closed by the ministry due to the lack of incoming enrolments at this statement an eruption of noise filled the room alex looked at brian who was still and looked numb your parents have been informed professor dokoft continued and the student fell silent again and although the ministry agreed to keep the school open until the end of this year i have made the decision to close the school at the end of this week the letter rot your parents requested that you will be moved to hogwarts until the end of the school year with the move being made friday night and saturday morning tomorrow when your owl services begin again you should receive a slip form your parents indicating whether or not you shall be finishing your year off at hogwarts or not please return this slip to your house head classes over the next two days will be dismissed and all students will need to use this time to pack their belongings regardless of whether or not they will be moving to hogwarts any questions should be directed to your house heads professor dokoft finished you are dismissed none of the students moved instead watching as the small blonde teacher made her way down the middle of the hall and through the large doors and although she was unsure alex swear she had tears in her eyes the following afternoon i cantbelieve it closing kimmie said for about the seventh time that day the six of them alex kimmie brian logan charlie and georgie were in the practice room with the instructions from their music teacher to pack their instruments away so they cold be moved to hogwarts since all of them had received permission slips from their parents to attend for the rest of the year alex sat on the couch between brian and logan and just stared at the empty box on the table infront on the table infront of them so far none of them had been able to pack anything up yet do you think they ll still teach us music and stuff there charlie wondered aloud nobody replied and alex began to watch georgie from the corner of her eye she began to pack her guitar into it case roughly doing up the clasps she turned toward the amp and ripped the cords out of the sockets so did you guys see my mum and dad while you were there alex asked trying to change the topic georgie ignored her and began to roll the cords up we saw your mum but we didntget to talk to her logan replied as he got up off the couch he picked up dome of their old music notebooks they had accumulated over the last four years oh alex replied she got up as well and looked at her mike stand which house did you guys get put in charlie asked cheerfully when me and kimmie went we stayed with the ravenclaws weird bunch the poor first years were in that green house though had to be the worst the slytherins alex suggested yeah that it charlie replied wish we could have stayed in your house though would have partied every night i could just imagine professor potter allowing that alex answered and charlie laughed we were in the hufflepuff house georgie said flatly and he stopped laughing silence filled the room and finally brian asked the question the other four were anxious to find out from logan so how was nicole he aimed the question toward logan and not georgie i guess she was okay logan replied not looking up from the books he was stacking into the box and when you say okay you mean kimmie continued as she zipped up the cover around her keyboard i mean she looked like she was doing okay i didntreally get the chance to talk to her logan replied and georgie snorted what do you mean you didntget the chance to talk to her alex demanded finally forgetting about her microphone and stand and turned toward the boy yeah logan tell them all how you didntget the chance to talk to her georgie said sarcastically shut up logan glared at his sister what happened alex demanded if you made her cry logan i swear i will hurt you more than you hurt charlie everyone in the room was still watching the conversation between the two i didntmake her cry god i barely even spoke to her logan replied and turned back to his books well what happened in the library then georgie asked and everyone looked at him expectantly nothing happened in the library logan replied annoyed i just asked her how to get back to the hufflepuff common room and she said she didntknow this time alex snorted what logan looked at her nicole not knowing where the other houses are gee you re obviously dumber than you look logan alex replied she knows most of the secret passages in and out of the castle thanks to all her uncles well how was i supposed to know she was lying logan replied angrily well you could have tried to talk to her properly georgie replied what the point in talking to some one who doesntwant to talk back logan answered his voice rising indicating to the others that georgie had already said something about it to him if you donttry to talk to her then of course she not going to talk back georgie replied finally stopping what she was doing she stared straight at her brother brian kimmie and charlie all took a step back knowing too well what it was like to be caught in the middle of a fight between the two alex however stepped between the two i dontreally know why your getting so worked up georgie but i think you need to give logan a little slack she told the blonde girl who began to talk but alex cut her off and as for you saturday afternoon i expect to see you in a normal conversation with nicole logan began to say something no buts alex said and that final because all my friends are going to get along no matter how they may feel about each other late thursday night he watched as they lay sleeping each other arms they looked peaceful together but he knew he was about to change that for the right reasons as well with a flick of his wand a silencing spell was placed over blaise sleeping form before he was grabbed and pulled out of the bed by his hair all the while hermione stayed sleeping blaise tried to pull away but it was no use as with another flick of his wand his body became motionless soon he had the terrified form of blaise down in the old bathroom the hooded figure then pulled out a single hair from blaise head before chaining him to a pipe against the wall thank you for bringing her back to me blaise a voice came from within the cloak as the hair was pushed into a small flask then as he moved the flask to his lips his hood dropped and blaise watched as the twisted scarred face of neville longbottom was transformed into his own a n i know that not very long but at the moment it all i have because i ve got way too much school work hopefully i ll be able to update soon though oh and i have to say congratualtions to doodleflip who guessed right i wanted to tell you but i couldn t lol anyway please review love emgurl disclaimer still dontown anything you recognise form the books a n hey wow i guess i can appropriately say that the ending shocked a few people your reviews were quite interesting actually but i have one question if not neville who else i mean he was the most unexpected person that would be doing this anyway i ll quit rambling and get on with it hermione woke the next morning with blaise neville arm wrapped tightly around her waist she snuggled closer to him not allowing herself to get up and his grip became tighter then a loud knock came from the door hermione harry said entering the room he was fully dressed and had a pile of parchment in his hand we have a problem what hermione yawned she sat up in the bed and blaise mumbled something into his pillow obviously awake now cantit wait until i up harry no it cannot wait harry replied the students are arriving tonight and the dorms are still too small not to mention we donthave enough beds hermione climbed out of the bed and pulled her robe over her pyjamas before marching the deluded harry out of her bedroom first of all dumbledore is enlarging the rooms after the sorting tomorrow night hermione yawned again and secondly we have to wait for professor dokoft reply on how many students are coming before we can go into hogsmeade and buy the furniture she looked at ginny who was sitting on the couch reading a magazine the red head glanced at her and gave her a small grin we should get everything sorted now though harry replied that way everything wontbe rushed harry hermione said softly sighing slightly why dontyou work n the menu for the feast and take it down to the kitchens instead i ll get ron to sort out the furniture harry nodded and turned toward the table where papers were scattered everywhere i ll be back later he told the two women hermione sat on the couch next to ginny as he disappeared you know you d probably would be less stressed if you hadntgot harry to help ginny told her hermione shrugged and yawned again as blaise neville came stumbling out of the bedroom he ignored both of the women and sat at the table his head resting in his hands what the time gin hermione asked suddenly um almost eight thirty ginny replied so i guess ron will be here soon hermione nodded in reply before getting up and heading toward the bedroom where are you going blaise neville asked her i have to get ready hermione yawned again my first class is right after breakfast you know that blaise neville grunted in reply watching as the door closed behind her i taking it you two didntdo much sleeping last night blaise ginny joked with him blaise neville didntreply unaware that she was talking him blaise ginny asked slightly concerned usually he answered her even when she was joking he turned and looked at the red head blinking a few times what he finally asked her are you alright she frowned and put down the magazine i fine he replied they both sat there in silence the only noise coming from the shower behind hermione closed door so are you excited about seeing alex again ginny broke the silence yeah sure came his distant reply you know back at hogwarts i never thought i would be a parent what ginny asked slightly confused i mean blaise i know we didntreally talk much while we were at hogwarts but at grimmuald place you always wanted to be a dad blaise neville didntreply blocking her voice out without realizing he was ignoring her ginny moved into her own bedroom closing the door behind here with a bang as the door shut he pulled a small flask out of his robe and bought it to his lips alex stood on the roof of the school building for the last time she felt the cool breeze across her face as is whipped her uniform around her monday she would be back in the hogwarts robes she leant over the balcony watching the muggle cars speed past the building that they couldntsee staring out into the horizon alex sighed when finally a moving object came hurtling toward her it was nicole owl and it landed smoothly on alex shoulder carefully she untied the letter but before opening she glanced at the owl now perched on the balcony railing carefully she pulled her own piece of folded parchment out of her pocket and tied to the owl leg before she had the chance to change her mind watching as the owl became just a speck in the horizon alex sat on the stone bench and unfolded the letter hey alex wow i guess that means your coming back then i mean aaragh that came out so wrong i mean i glad you re coming back just i wish it was because you really wanted to we ve really missed you and we re getting you back so i guess i can kinda be happy about it right alex smiled to herself so um sam wants to know if you re all coming back as in brian and kimmie and everyone draco says hi as well well we cantwait to see you love nikki ripping the bottom part of the parchment off the letter alex pulled her pen out her pocket to my fellow gryffindors yes i am coming back and just so you know i do want to come back i realised that after they already left i think it was because i realized how much i missed you guys too yes nik you can be happy about it so sam brian and kimmie are returning with me to the strange land of hogwarts and hello to you to draco i ll see you all later love alex oh and by the way nicole logan says hi and he cantwait to get to hogwarts oh and i ve sent your owl off on an important topic secret mission that could save the world he will be back in a few days as alex reread the letter grinning at her own strangeness she skipped down the halls to the owlry the excitement finally coming to her friday afternoon sam was sitting in the empty gryffindor common room waiting for nicole to meet her their afternoon classes had been cancelled because the teachers were busy preparing the castle but nicole had disappeared and sam couldntbe bothered looking for her perfering to wait until she showed up in the common room draco had left her choosing to play quidditch with the other boys instead a large owl rapped at the window startling sam from her thoughts she climbed out of her seat and opened the window as the bird flew into the room it screeched loudly but did not land near sam as she had expected instead it flew toward the girl dorms instead of following sam sat back down leaving the window open as she was wondering who the owl was actually for a shrill scream came from the girl dormitory r an angry nicole weasley appeared on the staircase whose owl is that s he shouted no one answered and the nosey students retreated back into their rooms sam took a step back as the red face weasley cam down the stairs the owl behind her wh what wrong sam swallowed hard that owl just bit me nicole replied crossly the letter not even addressed not me but it still bit me if it isntaddressed to you then how come it flew into your dorm sam asked she carefully sat back down i dontknow nicole replied angrily trying to shrug the animal off i didntlet it in did i was when she saw the opened window behind sam you did maybe it alex reply sam suggested trying to move the blame away from herself wouldntshe have just used my owl nicole pointed out but she didnteven need to reply you did put that question from me in there which i still dontget why you couldntjut ask it sam muttered are you going to take to the letter off of it what and it bite me again yeah right nicole answered and sat down on the couch next to them the owl landed smoothly on the table before standing completely still in front of them sam moved forward and careful took the piece of parchment off the bird leg she tossed it toward nicole it got your name on it she smirked as the bird pecked softly at her finger before flying out of the open window brian and charlie watched as their luggage disappeared before their eyes just as kimmie managed to carry two large boxes of old music books into the room at once with georgie magically levitating an amp i wasntsure if you wanted these or not kimmie out he boxes down in front of the boys as georgie levitated the amp toward the supervising teachers brian picked up the first book it was a sketch book filled with pictures of them practicing along with the odd sentence or two on the edge of the a page the next book was filled with logan dodgy handwriting page after page filled with songs written about amelia his ex gf remember i mentioned her earlier but never continued on with her story cool charlie exclaimed he showed brian the book he was holding it was filled with clippings and pictures about the school going back to its beginnings wow georgie giggled as she joined them look at dokoft there she pointed toward a picture which appeared to have students in it i guessing the second box wasntour stuff brian said putting the book down but i think we should keep all of it georgie nodded in agreement i cantbelieve she had pink hair hey who that kimmie asked as brian turned the page over it was a whole school picture although none of the students were really recognizable an elderly man standing at the front of the group could clearly be seen he had a scowl across his face which seemed to darken the entire picture bilious alfonzo dumbledore charlie read the fine print hey maybe he related to dumbledore from hogwarts well duh charlie georgie replied professor potter lavender brown voice filled the hallway harry stopped walking and turned to face the other professor yes professor he asked i just thought you might like to know ben walker has woken up she told him and harry turned and began to walk toward the hospital wing harry lavender ran to catch up with him there a small problem what is it harry stopped in front of the hospital wing doors he been hit with a memory charm she told him he cantremember anything from the last ten years keeps asking for someone called elizabeth what harry asked shocked it was him wasntit does dumbledore know dumbledore in there examining him still he thinks it was the stalker lavender told him in a hushed tone as a student walked past he being moved to st mungos shortly with that harry entered the hospital wing finding dumbledore sitting next to the ben walker bed laughing hello ben walker said brightly as harry approached the bed ahh ben this is our defence against the dark arts teacher professor harry potter dumbledore said his eyes twinkle do you remember any stories about him harry who ben asked so is my sister here yet harry was slightly shocked not just at the state of ben walker but that he had no idea who he was although harry got sick of it most of the time ben walker should have known who he was the entire wizarding world knew who he was for god sake ben here been telling me how he grew up in new york dumbledore turned to harry the war wasntbig news there he said in a quieter voice he waiting for his sister elizabeth he continued louder this time you haventseen her have you who harry asked dumbfounded never mind she ll be here soon he smiled at ben who had taken to swirling a glass of water around in a circle hermione stood in the middle of the great hall most of the students from fascino quas were returning to hogwarts later that night and the next morning and they still had a lot of work to do the great hall either had to be enlarged so the four house tables could be extended so they were longer or it had to be enlarged so more tables could be added into the room either way the room had to be enlarged and at the moment hermione head was pounding and blaise was not helping at all just sitting there and doing nothing blaise hermione rubbed her temple and looked in his direction he didntmove ron was busy talking to one of the house elves and ginny and jess had gone into hogsmeade to order the furniture harry had disappeared earlier and no one had seen him since blaise hermione said more urgently trying to get his attention he still didntmove and seemed to be staring at the gryffindor banner dreamily blaise hermione shouted at him finally pulling him from his thoughts ron looked over toward them a frown on his face erm what blaise neville replied i need you to find a strong enough charm that will enlarge the room hermione sighed once ron finished talking to dobby take him to the library okay blaise neville answered hermione sighed again but moved across to the front of the hall the fascino quas students were to be sorted at lunch time the next day as part of the hogwarts tradition she knew it was going to take a while so she arranged chairs for the students to sit on while they waited jess ginny said to her sister in law suddenly do you think blaise has been acting a bit strange today when jess asked her as they exited the shop and headed toward hogwarts today before ginny replied vaguely they passed a new clothes shop in the front window was a set of emerald green dress robes jess turned to look in the direction she was looking in wow she said they would look gorgeous on you ginny smiled but shook her head i cantbuy robes like that and why no jess continued dontsay harry wouldntlike them his eyes would fall out if he saw you in that no i wouldnthave anywhere to wear them ginny smiled what about hermione and blaise wedding jess asked they haventeven set a date yet ginny said then snapped back into reality so blaise he seems okay to you yeah why do you ask jess said as they began walking again no reason it probably just the stress from everything ginny answered yeah jess replied so next week i bringing hermione here maybe she ll convince you those robes are perfect for you the next day hermione harry ron and blaise neville stood out the front of the main gates waiting for the carriages to arrive from hogsmeade after about ten minutes of waiting the first horseless although harry ron hermione and blaise neville could all see the thestrals came into view it was soon followed by another and another until finally about fifty horseless carriages went past them and into the hogwarts school grounds the last carriage stopped and the four teachers climbed aboard to find only professor dokoft and professor dumbledore aboard professors hermione aid as she sat across from them harry and ron either side of her blaise neville sat next to dumbledore did it take you long to get the students over ron asked the blonde headmaster not really most of them were anxious to get here she replied albus says you ve organised a big feast for the students hermione nodded it customary fro new students to be sorted so we thought a feast was in order oh professor dokoft smiled alex hasntbeen able to keep still since she arrived in hogsmeade this morning i think she been the most excited about coming back really hermione asked surprised as far as she knew alex still wasntready to come back yes when i saw her this morning she looked as if she had just been given a large bag of lemon drops dumbledore spoke suddenly causing the other passengers in the carriage to look at him oddly she looked happy he re worded everything he just said which is why i think ti would be a good idea if she stayed in the gryffindor dorms rather than your rooms hermione agreed with im she might be happier there precisely dumbledore continued but as harry is staying with you still i want ron to become head of gryffindor so he can keep an eye on her ron nodded as the carriage came to a stop dumbledore climbed out first before helping professor dokoft then hermione out of the carriage none of the students had left their carriages yet hermione smiled to herself slightly before heading toward the closest carriage and opened the door slowly a group of tired first years were inside all looking a bit of unsure of what they were supposed to be doing were ate h castel now hermione told them softly everyone meeting in the great hall she finished before she moved to the next carriage from the corner of her eyes she could see ron and harry doing the same thing but before she could open the door she was pulled into a tight hug alex hermione laughed as her daughter let go of her she kissed her lightly on the forehead i ve missed you so much she hugged her again alex just grinned at her i ve missed you too i sorry i didntcome back last week it okay hermione told her she looked up from her daughter to see logan georgie brian charlie and kimmie walking slowly up to them where dad alex asked excitedly but before hermione could reply alex had disappeared in the direction of her father everyone meeting out the front of the great hall hermione told the other teenagers before moving toward a group of third years who were not moving away from the carriage nicole weasley sat at the gryffindor table she had been waiting like the rest of the school for fifteen minutes now and the professors were still yet to return finally the doors to the great hall opened and dumbledore and dokoft stood in the middle of the entrance the four professors behind them with the students and staff do fascino quas behind them as they entered the great hall the students fell silent and as nicole scanned through the students searching for alex she didntnotice the small girl who slipped out of the crowed and slipped into the seat across from her finally the students sat in the seats at the front and nicole knew this was going to take awhile as dumbledore stood up to speak she turned toward draco who was sitting across from her to ask if he had seen alex only to be facing the girl a wide grin on her face miss me she asked nicole smiled of course not if anything we enjoyed not having you here draco interrupted only to receive a punch on the arm from alex and a glare from sam they fell silence as they began to listen to dumbledore today is a great day fro the wizarding world today we make history bringing the two schools together he paused then with a flick of his wand all of the students robes where changed the purple fascino quas ones turning black nicole glanced down at her robes they were still black but the hogwarts crest had now changed the four houses combined still staged the same but above that was a wand giving out purple sparks crossed over a paint brush that had painted two silver stars today we celebrate the new hogwarts the students and teachers all began to clap a few even whistling before jessica weasley stood before the students as part of the hogwarts tradition the students are sorted into their house by the founders hat so as i call your name out you will stand and the hat will be placed upon your head once it has called out the name of the house you belong to you are to sit with them once the feast has finished the prefects will direct you to the new common room she finally finished allero peter as the boy stood his chair disappeared and the hat was placed upon his head ravenclaw it shouted and the table beneath the blue banner erupted as the sorting continued nicole once again began to scan the students she caught charlie eye who was standing next to georgie and gave him a small wave he in turn nodded his head in the opposite direct nicole eyes followed along the line of students in the direction he nodded finally coming to brian kimmie and logan kimmie was smiling at something brian was whispering into her ear and logan was looking down finally just she was about to look away he looked up and smiled the sorting was finally over and the students were enjoying their feast surprisingly the entire band logan kimmie etc had all been put in gryffindor alex smiled as she watched her friends talking draco nudged her in the side so have you heard from riley lately he asked quietly no the smiled disappeared from alex face why just wondering draco replied oh by the way it the twins birthday next weekend i was meeting mum in hogsmeade and was going to take them to honeydukes you want to come sure alex forced a smile on to her face she hadntthought about riley since she sent him the letter with nicole owl hey nikki she interrupted her conversation with georgie has you owl come back yet not yet nicole frowned who d you send it to anyway oh no one important he ll probably be back today alex replied finally as the fest had ended and it was now nighttime hey will you guys be okay showing them to the common room alex asked nicole draco and sam i just wanna hang out with my mum for awhile they nodded in return and as they disappeared through the doors to the great hall alex bounced off toward where her parents were sitting with ron jessica harry and ginny hermione smiled as alex approached them then frowned as she realised she wasntwith her friends alex honey dontyou want to catch up with nicole hermione asked her i thought i d come see you guys first alex grinned plus i wasntsure if i supposed to be staying in the dorms or not well hermione began but blaise neville cut her off your mum pregnant alex looked shocked blaise hermione said i thought we were going to wait until we told her you re pregnant and you didnteven tell me ginny and jessica said at the same time you re what alex asked still in shock she sat between her parents and hermione squeezed her hand i pregnant which means you re getting a baby brother or sister hermione said gently only you re dad wasntsupposed to tell you like that harry and ron had moved their wives away allowing the three of them so does this mean you re getting married earlier than you planned alex asked she had been the only one who knew when they had they set the date for yes blaise neville said at the same time hermione said no hermione simple laughed we re still deciding but to answer your question from before your staying in the dorms uncle ron moving into a new room in there so he can watch you hermione told her i ll go get him if you want to go back now alex nodded and watched as her mother headed toward her uncle ron wow i going to be a sister alex said to blaise how come you never told me sooner she looked at her father ahh you see you re mother secret blaise neville spluttered oh alex said she looked into her father eyes they seemed different not the bright blue they had always been but a dull colour almost grey he took a swig of a flask from his pocket dad alex asked mmm he replied putting the flask away was mum really mad when i didntcome back alex asked him suddenly she looked him in the eye they were the bright blue again she was fine about it he told her oh alex replied she moved across the bench slightly away from him alex uncle ron s going up there now hermione came back over she hugged her tightly we can talk about everything tomorrow alex nodded and let go of her mother before she turned to hug her father he hugged her loosely before she ran out of the great hall to catch up with ron you two ready harry and ginny came over to them hermione nodded and grabbed blaise hand and the four of them headed toward their rooms alex was silent as she walked up to the gryffindor common room her auntie jessica and uncle ron following her she thought back to when her father hugged her and her stomach tightened something hadntbeen right it didntfeel the same then she thought back to his eyes how did they just change from grey to blue suddenly she felt sick again she stopped causing ron and jessica to walk into her alex are you okay ron asked alex shook her head before sprinting off in the opposite direction she had to get to her parents room get her mum and the baby away from him alex ron voice called

herself broke free from ron grasp and dated up the stairs alex jessica called after her following her up the stairs ron hurry up alexandria granger stop right now ron roared as he reached the tops of the stairs alex stopped she was half way down the corridor you dontbelieve me do you she turned around and faced her aunt and uncle well it just that s a big accusation to make jessica explained imagine how your dad would feel if i believe you ron cut his wife off which is why your not going into there no i have to i have to tell my mum alex tried to explain ron shook his head no if i take

began look i know how the polyjuice potion works ron cut her off again i ve actually used it before and this has actually happened at hogwarts before with a teacher it believable jess that why we have to action and if your wrong jessica asked then i wrong we re wrong ron motioned between himself and alex please can you take alex back to the common room then meet me in dumbledore office jessica finally nodded before turning on her heel and heading toward the gryffindor common room alex closely behind her ron sighed in frustration but turned and headed toward the headmasters office upon finding the gargoyle was already open he quickly made his way up the spiral staircase until finally he came to the waiting room the door to dumbledore office was too opened and the portraits of the previous headmasters and mistresses were all sitting awake whispering to each other ron walked toward dumbledore office where he found parchment strewn across the room suddenly all the colour drained from ron face as he recognised dumbledore lying unconscious across his desk beneath the parchment a glance to his left indicated that professor dokoft had also been attacked her slump form against the nearest wall with his wand raised ron ran out of the office and down the stairs tripping on the final step as his robes were caught beneath his feet as he pulled himself off the ground he found himself face to face with snape dumbledore been attacked he said breathlessly and snape emotionless face too drained of what colour it had get the students into the great hall snape yelled as he made his way up to the headmaster office i know who it is ron shouted after him and snape stopped halfway up the stairs who he asked as he came back down it blaise ron told him bluntly well it someone acting as blaise find harry snape told him urgently i ll get professor brown up here and lock the common rooms hurry riley had just come out of the change rooms when an owl landed on his shoulder he recognised the owl as being his uncle bill and wondered briefly why they were writing to him carefully he untied the small piece of parchment off the owl leg and watched as it flew away he unfolded it and was surprised to see alex neat scrawl on the parchment rather than his uncles riley hmmm well i guess this is just a letter to say i going back fascino quas has been closed by the ministry and the students are being transferred to england hope your training has been going well maybe soon we ll be reading about you in the daily prophet from alex a scream came from in front of him as riley finished reading the letter quickly looking up he watched as dougie doubled over his hands clutching his stomach riley ran up to him as the students began to crowd around watching him have convulsions he began to scream again what happened riley asked dana who was kneeling next to him we were just walking and then he grabbed his stomach and started screaming she answered on the verge of tears some body get help riley screamed at the crowding students dougie screamed again and all riley and dana could do was watch as he writhed in pain he gasped for air and then he stopped moving dougie riley aid doug he looked at the boys face that was covered in sweat dougie blinked and then closed his eyes before opening them again he looked directly at riley he got her he managed to say as he clutched his head and she hurting riley felt as if he was going to throw up alex had gone back to hogwarts and now she was in danger ron ran to the rooms where dumbledore had ordered the potters and hermione and blaise to stay he muttered the password allowing him entry into the sitting room ron ginny voice greeted him as he found his sister and hermione alone in the sitting room where harry ron asked tensely unsure of what to say to hermione him and blaise have gone down to the kitchen s ginny told him why hermione asked but before ron could reply he was out of the sitting room running down the corridors heading toward the kitchen he was almost there his wand raised as he came across dobby trying to carry harry up the stairs dobby ron cried what happened mister harry potter was hit by mister blaise dobby told him then mr blaise disappeared with mister harry potter shiny cloak dobby i need you to go get professor snape ron told him he leant the unconscious harry against eh wall before disappeared with a crack elf magic ron thought to himself as he knelt beside his unconscious friend harry ron said he prodded his friend in the head with his wand a n dontask his glasses were missing and his robes were torn slightly as if he had put up a struggle another loud crack indicated that dobby had returned mister snape is on his way he informed ron dobby ron said slowly harry was he hit with a curse oh no mister wheezley dobby said he was hit wit a large rock right here he pointed to the back of harry head which was bleeding steps down the corridor indicating someone was coming close to them ron prayed that it was snape where is he snape voice filled the corridor then he saw harry lying unconscious against the wall he got the invisibility cloak ron said watching for snape reactions take professor potter to the hospital wing he instructed dobby weasley some with me but he still in the castle ron protested with an invisibility cloak might i add snape replied as dobby disappeared with harry this intruder has already taken control of one of our teachers kidnapped blaise zabini attacked both the headmasters and our defence against the dark arts teacher i believe it is time we called in reinforcements and with that snape strode up the stairs before taking a turn and heading down toward the dungeons ron close behind him riley sprinted to the headmaster office he ran so fast he didntsee the door open causing him to crash to the ground as he hit his glasses came off and he heard the familiar sound of the glass cracking he felt the ground for his glasses a stinging graze along his elbow form the fall err sorry mister potter professor morris said as he picked up the boy glasses riley stopped searching the ground and attempted to get up he listened as with a flick of the professor wand his glasses were fixed and intact thanks riley said as he put his glasses back on erm dougie s there something wrong with him i dontknow if a teachers there yet the professor looked at him where is her he was on the lawn just outside the change rooms riley told him and where are you going he asked the boy not moving i was err going to see the headmaster riley said truthfully i need to get back to hogwarts and with that he sprinted away from the teacher and up the staircase until finally he reached the headmasters office vaguely aware that the teacher had followed him without waiting for his assistant to say so riley entered the professors office and upon finding it empty he moved straight toward the fireplace pot of floo powder above it he grabbed a handful and threw it into the fireplace before stepping into the warm green flames hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry he shouted as professor morris and the assistant entered the office both headed toward him but he was already gone snape paced his office who should he call he couldntgo to the ministry they wouldntbelieve him besides who would want to attack an innocent teacher and her family who would want to attack them snape thought to himself impatiently are we going to do something ron finally snapped or are we going to just sit here in your office all night when there some lunatic in the school ron like it or not this lunatic has been in the school since hermione came back snape sneered so you say alex discovered this that this person has been disguised as blaise by using the polyjuice potion ron nodded i know who can help he moved toward the fireplace and just as he was about to throw a handful of floo powder into it it was filled with the green flames and a boy tumbled out of it covered in soot and coughing loudly the boy looked at the startled snape and ron unaware that it was only the potions teacher fireplaces that were connected riley ron asked what are you doing here you re supposed to be in new zealand mister potter snape cut ron off can please tell me why you have just come out of my fireplace when your parents think you are in new zealand riley looked at them brushing the black soot of his clothes i here to help he declared help with what ron asked playing dumb riley frowned at his uncles i know what going on this boy my friend at wqa he had dreams he saw her crying then today he said he got her and he could feel her pain who snape asked knowing full well he was more than likely talking about alex alex riley looked down at his feet ron take riley to the gryffindor common room snape instructed him i ll be there in a moment ron nodded and took his nephew out of the dungeons throwing a handful of floo powder into the fireplace snape stuck his head into the flames malfoy manor he shouted and he came face to face with the malfoy lounge room a loud shriek was heard and snape watched as a young blonde girl ran out of the room he waited and as he predicted moments later lydia malfoy came into the room to insect what was going ton on oh severus i ll get draco she said as soon as she saw his head in the fireplace draco come into the room quickly what going on we need you at the castle snape told him blaise is gone snape pulled his head out of the fireplace and only seconds later draco malfoy was standing there what do you mean he gone draco asked as snape went to eave his office please draco we need to get a move on snape said as he hurried along the corridor his black cloak billowing behind him draco followed him although he continued to ask questions why does dumbledore need me if potter here because harry potter is in the hospital wing alongside professor dumbledore professor dokoft and professor walker snape snapped and this lunatic has polyjuiced blaise god i should have looked into it more when those ingredients went missing what draco stopped snape looked at him and for the second time he had known the boy he saw fear in his silver eyes things have gotten our of control but we need to protect hermione and her children snape told him i need your full support draco even in knowing that blaise might be dead what snape turned to find hermione and ginny standing on the staircase behind him hermione you should be in your rooms he said simply ignoring the fact she heard what he just said i tried to keep her there ginny said apologetically but she was worried about blaise him and harry have been gone a while harry is in the hospital wing snape told them and ginny face fell we dontknow where blaise is hermione fell to the floor her head in her hands she drew her knees close to her body gin draco began take her to lil she at home we will send alex and riley there shortly snape added in to which ginny looked confused at riley is in the castle he is with ron and to that ginny nodded and took hermione down to the dungeons to use snape fireplace no questions asked he watched from the corner of snape office as ginny stepped into the fireplace holding his crying hermione as the green flames disappeared he stepped out of the shadows and pulled the invisibility cloak off his body he glanced down at his hand and even in the dim light form the dungeons he could see that he was turning back into neville his skin was no longer the smooth olive skin of blaise zabini but rather the calloused white skin of neville longbottom he grabbed the flask out of his pocket to find that it was empty no problem he thought to himself as long as i ve got this i dontneed to be him anymore wrapping the silvery cloak around his body neville finally left the potions masters office heading for the gryffindor tower a small piece of parchment with the password he stole from dumbledore in his hand his wand in the other ron unlocked the portrait allowing entry for himself and riley into the common room he entered first finding jessica waiting for him near the entrance she with the other kids but i dontthink she told them she said quietly to ron riley ron looked toward the girl he always considered a niece she was sitting next to a boy he didntknow who had his arm around her she smiled weakly as one of the other students said something but quickly glanced toward where ron was standing his guess was whether or not to see if jessica was still there waiting riley stepped into the common room after his uncle he ignored his auntie and began to scan the room for alex there she was sitting with draco sam nicole and the students from fascino quas riley froze as he realised brian had his arm around her she looked up toward them but riley quickly turned around and faced his auntie i here on a break he told her the story he had agreed with ron to say just thought i d come visit everyone riley look at who i married to i know when someone is lying especially went that someone is part weasley jessica told him riley didntknow what to say what are you doing here a quiet voice suddenly asked riley turned back around to find alex standing in front of him i um you see riley began clearly dougie had made a mistake she was standing right in front of him obviously not in any pain riley here on a short break jessica interrupted he is supposed to be at the burrow but he decide to visit his parents for the night riley looked past alex and at nicole and draco and sam they were all silent watching them oh was alex reply have have you talked to dumbledore yet she turned to ron no um professor dumbledore is in the hospital wing ron said quietly although the other students in the house heard him the portrait door opened again and snape and draco stepped through dad what going draco jr stood up err nothing son draco looked at him i just here visiting uncle blaise a lot of people seem to be doing visiting alex muttered under her breath but riley heard her alex riley began to say miss granger snape began i need to speak with you outside alex nodded and followed the potions teacher ron draco and jessica out of the common room leaving riley there riley stood there the other students staring at him before nicole walked over and hugged him tightly how quidditch draco came over to him too good riley heard himself reply you know i ve kind of missed you stealing away my boyfriend so you can practise sam said hugging him now he follows me everywhere i do not draco replied you do actually nicole interrupted riley nodded as the three of them began to argue he was aware that the new hogwarts students i e logan georgie etc were watching him but he choose to ignore them riley are you ready ron came back into the common room nicole draco and sam stopped arguing where alex nicole asked she uh still talking to professor snape ron lied she ll be back later riley then followed ron out of the common room only to find the group outside waiting silent right let go draco said and he began to walk down the corridor what going on riley asked you re going back to new zealand mr potter snape answered him without looking at him and miss granger here is going some where safe no riley answered there will be no buts mr potter snape snarled you are not supposed ot be here you have no idea what is going on you will be more use to us if you are not here by now they were in the entrance hall riley stopped causing the entire group to stop no riley replied more urngently did you tell her what dougie saw he looked at alex who took a step back mr potter there is no need to bring your friend little dreams into this snape pushed he had you alex riley told her and you were hurting that why i here to stop it from happening alex looked at him she was terrified of him of his words mr potter snape snarled once again she will be safe where we are taking her so if you are finished i would like to continue the group began to walk again suddenly jessica was flung into the wall with a scream the men all spun around their wand raised but they couldntseen anyone ron moved quickly toward his wife and draco and snape were shielding alex riley could only watch then suddenly his entire body was searing with pain riley he heard alex scream as he fell to the floor he didntknow it but the girl went to move to him only to be stoped by draco no stay here he pushed her behind him neville smiled to himself as he watched the women and the boy fall to the ground a frown crossed his face however as he watched malfoy and snape hold the girl back that wasntpart of the plan he flick his wand relieving the boy of pain only for it to be transferred to ron as the red head stood his wand raised the curse hit him and he fell to the floor alongside his wife his wife spinning across the cold marble he glanced at the boy who was trying to stand and flicked the wand toward him watching him scream finally malfoy stepped away from the girl neville grinned evilly to himself he stopped all of his curses hoping snape would step forward he did but he pulled the girl with him neville decided that now he had to take real action he moved across so that he was on the same side of the entrance hall as snape he watched bored as snape moved toward to where malfoy was standing over the boy body he waited as the girl knelt beside him snape eye darting all over the hall searching for something he couldntsee tired of waiting neville flicked his wand making it sound as if someone was walking up the stairs malfoy stepped toward the stairs as snape let out a sigh of relief and moved toward ron and jessica giving neville his chance draco rubbed his temple what in the hell is going on a muffled scream filled the entrance hall and as draco spun around he saw alex granger disappear right in front of him a n well i know the ending was kind of abrupt but if i keep writing then i wonthave anything left for the next chapter so you all know what to do hopefully i ll be able to update by the weekend luv emgurl disclaimer dontown anything you recognise from the books hey sorry i couldntupdate sooner the christmas period is hectic even though i donthave school or a job my mum decided i w s to clean the house along with shopping i just watched my money disappear anyway i managed to finally get the next chapter written hope you like oh and by the way remember alex doesntknow who neville is so that why in this first part he is only addressed as the man alex struggled against the person who was pulling her out of the great hall she screamed in the hope that snape and draco would be bale to follow her but her kidnapper had already put a silencing spell on her she continued to struggle against his grasp trying to pull his arm from around her waist his grip only tightened and alex winced as he jabbed the tip of his wand into her stomach keep still or else i ll rid of you right here a harsh voice she had never heard before hissed at her alex tried to kick him in the shin and his grasp loosened slightly taking the opportunity alex pulled away from him successfully breaking free from his grasp as he winced in pain she had hit his knee and as she pulled away from the man harry invisibility cloak slid off a man she had never seen before glared at alex as she took a step back down the corridor she frantically searched her robes for her wand as he too took a step toward her looking for this he hissed and held up her wand alex didntsay anything choosing to step back again until she found herself against on of the dungeons walls you know you shouldntbe afraid of me the man said taking a step toward her your mother would have wanted us to meet dontyou dare talk about my mother alex tried to say he throat burning from the silencing spell or would you rather me talk about your father he asked as if he read her mind the coward who left his family in shame before going on to steal one of the most important people away from me by this time he was standing directly in front of alex and she was finally able to see his face in the dim light coming from the holders in the walls a long scar was across his thin face he looked at least twenty years older than her parents but alex had a feeling he was the same age his pale blue eyes bored into hers daring her to try and say something he flicked his wand toward her and alex felt her throat loosen and still she didntsay anything he put his hand on the wall next to her head you see alex your mother was very important to me she was there for me from the very first day at hogwarts he told her looking straight into her eyes and then she was taken away from me alex turned her face so she didnthave to look at him she knew she couldntescape she was too far into the dungeons and he had her wand but she wasntscared she wouldntallow herself to be scared of this animal that was trying to destroy her he roughly grabbed the back of her head causing her to squeal in pain as he dragged her back down the corridor he picked up the discarded invisibility cloak and then with a flick of his wand alex was put under a binding spell to stop her from struggling but now you and your father will pay he said as he pushed her in front of him freeing her legs from the spell so she could walk snape watched as draco ran down the hall following something that was unseen to them all all he knew was that now alex was gone all because he stepped away from her panic filled his chest as draco returned to the great hall his face pale if that possible we cantget through this maniac has out some type of shield over the corridors he said breathlessly a soft moan came from jessica weasley body draco we need to get them to the hospital wing snape told him sharply draco glared at him you take them i ll try to find a counter curse that works no you will help me snape responded we cantdo anything else cantdo anything else draco roared at his old professor you just saw what this guy can do and he got a student and a teacher and your saying we cantdo anything at the moment we need more help snape began we need to contact the ministry screw the ministry draco answered they canthelp us our best chance is going after this idiot right now draco please snape told him just help me get these three to the hospital wing then you can do whatever you want i not going to the hospital wing riley said throughout their argument neither of the men had noticed riley get up your right your going back to the manor draco told him as he riley leant against the wall his breathing was slow and he could barely support himself i dontthink it would be a good idea if i was sent there without alex when you said we were both going back there he said slowly taking a deep breath besides i fine i can help no snape told him you re a student and i will not be responsible for putting a student in danger the same way you ve put alex in danger riley said between breaths if you hadntof stepped away from her he wouldnthave got her and technically i am no longer a student here snape glared at him ron body moved next to jessica s riley you re going to the hospital wing draco told him suddenly he picked up ron wand off the floor and flicked it toward the red headed man levitating him slightly he began to move him up the stairs as snape did the same thing with jessica we ll get there quicker if you let me help you walk draco turned back to riley who was still leaning against the wall riley nodded in a simple reply and let draco support his weight as they made their way up the stairs hermione paced the family room at the malfoy manor as ginny and lydia watched on she hadntspoken to them since ginny had bought her there auntie mione maddy came into the room followed by chelsea where uncle blaise these simple words from the small blond girl caused hermione to breakdown lydia ushered her two daughters out of the room as tears slid down hermione face hermione ginny said soothingly as she hugged the women everything going to be fine hermione pulled away stop saying that if everything was going to be okay then i wouldntbe here would i i d be back at hogwarts with blaise and alex and we wouldnthave to worry about any of this crap she burst out ginny watched her shocked from her outburst when lydia re entered the room without the twins she next to hermione who was now sitting on the floor in front of the fireplace her knees pulled tightly to her chest draco going to find him she said softly as she wrapped an arm around her why hasnthe bought alex back yet then hermione asked through the tears as ginny sat on her other side i dontknow lydia replied honestly but he will keep her safe she paused blaise is like his brother i know he will protect both of them hermione nodded as she wiped the tears from her face before continuing to watch the fireplace in the hopes that the green flames may appear plus riley is more than likely with her ginny added and from what i ve seen my son is more than willing to do anything to make sure she doesntget hurt hermione nodded again it just snape said he would send them here almost two hours ago i know ginny said softly they finally got to the hospital wing and to their surprise nearly all of the teachers in there were sitting up awake oh hello ben walker shouted merrily as the entered the room riley harry said what going on snape looked around the hospital wing both harry and professor dokoft were awake along with ben walker but dumbledore was still out cold ron and jessica were placed on the empty beds as lavender came rushing in and riley collapsed in the nearest chair everybody coming into visit tonight ben said cheerfully as harry climbed out his bed dokoft just looked on waiting for snape to respond to harry question it was him wasntit harry asked without needing an explanation snape nodded where hermione and alex harry asked urgently i had ginny take hermione to the manor draco told him and alex professor dokoft asked finally catching on and realising who attacked them neither snape nor draco said anything and both looked down to the floor he got her dad riley finally spoke his voice breaking the silence in the room a gasp came from lavender and professor dokoft was immediately out of bed harry was already half way down the outside corridor harry no snape shouted at him you dontknow what he can do and you shouldntbe out of bed lavender tell him but harry didntlisten and soon disappeared from sight snape quickly followed him his black robes billowing behind him leaving draco to explain what happened to ron jessica and riley to lavender he watched as she tended to ron and jessica forgetting about riley who was still in the chair near the door he moved toward ben walker bed hello you re a teacher here right draco looked at the man oh no i just visiting waiting for my sister elizabeth ben replied as if it was the most obvious thing in the world he been hit with a memory curse draco lavender interrupted them cantremember anything before he turned seventeen we ve been trying to track down his sister but we cantfind her anywhere oh right draco said but turned back to the man know any curses harry moved swiftly down the staircase ignoring the throbbing pain against his head harry he heard snape call his name but he ignored that too and continued to make his way down the stairs finally he came the entrance hall and took in the damage of what had happened parts of one had collapsed where spells had missed their target and a statue had been smashed he watched as the wall began to repair itself not hearing snape foot steps as they stopped next to him at the foot of the stairs harry snape began but harry raised his hand and snape fell silent i know you think i should be in the hospital wing and the truth is i probably should harry told him but hermione is my best friend i have to protect her family or else i might just lose her forever snape nodded let me help he told him before he watched him disappear into the dungeons riley jumped as he felt the tip of a wand against his skin he opened his eyes and lifted his head against the wall to find professor dokoft kneeling in front of him her wand against his knee dolor aberro she said quietly before riley had the chance to speak suddenly all the pain that was infused in riley potter body had vanished the throbbing in his head was no longer there and the aching in his knees had vanished he looked at the blonde teacher who gave him a small smile what was that he asked quietly she shook her head in response in time it shall be revealed but until then you must go go where riley asked although he already knew to protect her she answered simply this time riley shook his head my dad will protect alex he can save them there is only so much your father can do now riley she told him the rest is up to those who really love alex and blaise riley didntsay anything as professor dokoft glanced quickly at the other teaches in the room you see harry loves hermione he says he has forgiven blaise for what happened all those years ago but deep down he hasn t and while he wants to love alex he only can as he sees as hermione daughters not for who she is she continued and it is his love for hermione that will allow him to help them but it will not save them what do i need to do riley asked professor dokoft smiled first you must get nicole and draco they will be able to help you find alex what about her dad riley asked we must get hermione back to the castle first she told him now when i distract the others you must go straight to the tower riley nodded and the blonde teacher stood and went to move away from him professor riley asked suddenly why nicole and draco you ll see she answered him with a smile and flicked her wand toward professor dumbledore riley didntstick around to see what happened to dumbledore once the spell hit him and as malfoy and professor brown rushed toward him he was out the hospital wing in seconds riley shortly found himself in front of the portrait of the fat lady password she asked him er riley looked at her blankly he didntknow how he could be so stupid and forget to ask what the password was i cantlet you without a password deary the portrait spoke to him again but all he could do was look at her blankly suddenly the portrait door swung open and riley had to jump back as two identical red heads jumped out of the gryffindor common room riley one of his cousins exclaimed as they saw him er hello claire stef he nodded toward his two cousins what ya doing here claire asked as stef kept glancing down the corridor i m um just visiting hey could you tell me the password so i can go see draco he asked them sure stef replied glancing again down the corridor he waited but neither of the girls spoke oh um what was it claire looked at stef erm oh yeah hippogriff she said clearly and the portrait swung open thanks he called after his younger cousins as they disappeared down the corridor he took a deep breathe before climbing through the portrait hall nobody noticed riley as he entered the common room given the fact that most students had already gone to bed as it was so late he quickly glanced around the room to find that neither draco or nicole or any of his other friends were in the common room sighing to himself he quickly headed toward his old dorm he carefully opened the door hoping not to wake any of the other students that would be asleep draco he whispered as he got to the blonde boys bed draco he said a little more loudly he did not move draco riley whispered a little more forceful as he shook the boys shoulders wake up he hissed draco slowly opened his eyes riley he yawned leave me alone need sleep he closed his eyes only to have riley shove him roughly you need to get up i need your help he hissed at him as one of the other boys moved in their sleep alright alright i awake draco said sitting up in his bed what do you want get dressed i ll tell you when we get into the common room riley told him and he went to leave the dorm he quickly glanced around the room making sure none of the other boys were awake when his eyes fell on his old bed the sleeping form of brian beneath the dark red covers and riley felt his stomach tighten once riley was back down in the common room he knew he needed to find a way to get into the girls dormitory without the stairs sending him back down he glanced around the common room not finding anything of use until just as draco was coming down the stairs he spotted a broom lying on a couch he quickly grabbed it and mounted it before heading toward the girls staircase nicole draco said suddenly and riley turned to the left a little too sharply causing the broom to fly him into a wall he d had worse injuries once he was on his feet again he looked to where draco had said his cousin name to find her asleep on logan shoulder in front of a fireplace that had not been lit nicole get up riley said louder than he intended to waking logan up aswell she quickly jumped away from him but glared at her cousin what going on logan asked riley needs help with something draco told him nothing riley answered at the same time he glared at draco right logan said suspiciously before he looked at nicole so um i gonna head up to bed he scratched his head um yeah me too goodnight nicole answered giving him a small smile before turning to head up her own staircase actually i need to talk to you riley spoke up as she put her foot on the first step about what nicole asked erm stuff riley answered looking at logan oh right well night then logan took the hint and left the other three to watch him go up the stairs finally the three were left alone nicole and draco stared blankly at riley waiting for them to tell him what was going on riley nicole finally broke the silence are you going to tell shh riley interrupted her and headed toward the portrait hole i dontwant anyone to hear us nicole looked at draco who just shrugged and began to follow him out of the common room sighing nicole grabbed her wand off the arm of the armchair before following the two boys into the corridor riley knew that by now lavender and draco senior would be looking for him in the castle so instead of stopping to explain things to them he headed straight down the corridor toward the great hall riley mate are you going to tell us what going on draco asked he was jogging to keep up with him while nicole was walking behind them riley stopped causing nicole who wasntwatching to run into him he could hear footsteps heading in their direction glancing along the corridor quickly he spotted a classroom he grabbed both nicole and draco and pulled them into the empty room and shut the door quickly riley sat against the door and out his head in his heands as the two people passed the classroom not even bothering to look riley why is my dad at hogwarts draco asked suddenly your dad riley asked trying to play dumb yeah my dad the guy your trying to avoid the one who just walked past here with professor brown draco responded well you see now that riley had the perfect opportunity to tell them he couldntfind the words riley nicole sat on the cold stone in front of him what happened riley looked at his cousin and he knew he couldntlie to her it alex i we need to save her and her dad a tear slid down his cheek from beneath his glasses nicole nodded and hugged him everything will be fine dumbledore will stop this guy riley shook his head dumbledore was attacked and he in the hospital wing professor dokoft she sent me to get you two and told me we had to save them nicole didntsay anything and riley felt her embrace loosen he looked over her shoulder to see draco looking at them as their eyes met draco seemed to spring into action and he pulled them both up on their feet his wand ready for action come one then draco told them before he marched out of the classroom and down the staircase into the great hall neville threw alex to the ground and he listened as he heard her bone crack against the cold stone lumos he hissed and the light form his wand allowed alex and her father to see each other blaise was livid when he saw his daughter and if he hadntbeen tied up he would have been ready to murder neville alex finally allowed herself to cry when she saw blaise and as neville turned his back to them she crawled over to his body where he was tied to a pipe along the wall blaise tried to speak to her but no words came out my silencing charms work excellent do you agree alexandria neville turned back around a large glass full of the thick bubbling potion in his hand see blaise i told you it wouldntbe so hard neville told him with a sneer now i just need one last thing for my plan to be perfect he moved toward the two of them and with a flick of his wand blaise was able to speak you really think this plan is going to work he spat at the man it has so far hasntit neville answered now i just need one more hair blaise moved his head out of neville reach but he got his handful of dark curls he went to take the first mouthful but stopped bring the cup away from his lips now blaise once i drink this i will take your binding spell off but you must promise that you wontescape not that you would be bale to anyway neville sneered before emptying the cup he dropped the glass and it smashed as it the cold stone neville body began to shake and it looked as if he were having a spasm as his body transformed he picked up the invisibility cloak which was lying in a silver puddle near the only door remember no trying to escape alex listened as the familiar voice filled the room a voice that was laced with evil then he was gone and the room was left in darkness a few seconds past and the few candles that were along the walls were lit and alex looked at her father i sorry he whispered to her as he tried to sit up against the wall not having enough energy to support his own weight alex said nothing instead she found herself in her fathers arms her warm tears soaking into his pyjama shirt harry pointed his wand down the corridor he could see the light from he other torches yet he was unable to reach them he glanced at snape who was frowning at the unseen force field severus harry spoke to his old potions teacher what if we use an unforgivable snape shook his head no harry this is very very ancient magic an unforgivable would not be strong enough what if we did it all together a new voice asked both teachers spun around to find nicole weasley draco malfoy jnr and riley potter standing there what are you doing here snape bellowed at them professor dokoft sent us to help riley finally spoke up you need to go back to gryffindor tower harry told them simply not looking at his son i dontcare who sent you suddenly professor dokoft was in the hallway with them her body was surrounded by a light glow they can help you she told harry and snape sternly their only students harry stepped toward the blonde women who didntflinch snape looked on slightly shocked by her sudden appearance i already know how this battle unfold harry she told him her voice was clam and unnerving you will not win if you do not have these three with you and with that she disappeared harry stared at the spot where professor dokoft was just standing then he looked at the students so about this unforgivable draco jnr asked looking at snape will it be strong enough if all five of us cast it at the same time neville slipped into snape office where he left the invisibility cloak he knew that just down the corridor teachers would be working to break his shield although he thought it was going to take them a while to break it down he grabbed a handful of floo powder and threw it into the fireplace and as the flames turned green he stepped into them and shouted malfoy manor he stepped out of the fireplace to see hermione ginny potter and who he guessed was draco malfoy wife sitting on the couch mum neville whispered a as the three women looked toward the fireplace alex hermione cried as she embraced her daughter in a hug a n well that was chapter 34 hope you all liked oh and in case you didntquite get it neville

usual to put the new chapter up but i ve been busy with this school and overloaded with homework anyway here is the next chapter enjoy blaise returned to his room it was apart from the furniture bare except for a photo on his bedside table he sat down on his bed and looked at the photo it was the day after they had graduated from hogwarts he was sitting on the couch at grimmuld place with hermione he looked at the phot as it moved she kissed him on the cheek as he slid his arms around her waist he couldntremember but he think ron took the picture and they both laughed at him i was going to leave blaise he heard hermione voice say suddenly he was struggling to hold back the tears he loved hermione and hated himself for fifteen years after the night with ginny he had tried looking for her but he never thought she had gone as far as new york blaise put the photo frame back on the table feeling the sudden urge to have a strong drink he stood up and grabbed his jacket it was the end of summer and had just began to get cooler outside he walked up into the great hall and began to make his way towards hogsmeade alex went back into the hospital wing to find her mother and ginny weasley sitting on the bed eating chocolate giggling like school girls hermione looked at her daughter with a look that said i forgave her alex smiled as she was properly introduced to the other woman gin this is alex my daughter hermione said as alex stuck out her hand out ginny didnttake her hand hugging her instead she beautiful ginny said she looks just like except for her hair hermione smiled but didntsay anything as alex sat down paul ron son came in looking for her hey he said are you feeling better he asked hermione she nodded and began to laugh um ok he said awkwardly we re going into hogsmeade for tea dad told me to come ask alex if she wanted to come with us he looked at his almost cousin alex looked at her mother you can go if you want she told her daughter alex smiled and got up she didntreally feel like hanging out with her mum tonight besides she had her best friend back alex didnttalk much as she went to hogsmeade with her aunt and uncle she barely ate or talked through the meal and every time ron or jessica asked her if she was ok she simply replied she was not hungry in actual truth she was too distracted by the thoughts in her mind to concentrate on what was in front of her uncle ron she finally said he looked up from his plate yeah he asked softly well i was just wondering why didntmy dad ever look for my mum she asked looking back down at her own plate jessica stood up and motioned for paul to follow her as she took him over to get more drinks ron put his fork down he did look for her he began as she looked back up only he never thought your mum would have moved to america he looked in france russia everywhere in europe he only came back with the hope that your mum had come back for my wedding when she didnthe realised that it was no use she wasntgoing to come back did he love her alex asked surprised at the question ron nodded i dontthink he ever stopped alex didntsay anything as jessica and paul returned to the table she didntspeak at all through the rest of the meal the next day all of the professors who had not stayed at hogwarts during the holidays had returned preparing for the students to arrive the castle was so busy that alex thought no one would notice if she disappeared in the dungeons it took alex a while to find the room she was looking for and wondered how some one could live in a place where it was so dark and cold she went to knock on the door but stopped she went to knock again as the door was opened there she stood facing her father blaise opened the door he was in a hurry dumbledore had wanted a meeting with him as he opened the door however he came face to face with his daughter um hi she said nervously biting her lip just like her mother used to he thought to himself he took a step back allowing her to enter his room she stepped in slowly looking around so uh alex is there something wrong he asked finally regaining his voice alex didntreply and picked up the only photo frame in the room off his bedside table she looked at the bottle of whiskey nest to where the photo frame was before picking up the ring off the table she read the inscription aloud hermione we are the special two love forever blaise she looked at the man who was supposed to be her father she still loves you you know she said surprising herself she watched him as he shook his head alex had wondered where she got her stubbornness from since her mother always gave in to her know she knew she does i know she does she wont admit it but i know i can tell she said standing up i i never meant to hurt her blaise said and alex turned around and smiled at him i know and i think she knows that too she said walking toward the door alex he said as she put her hand on the door knob i sorry i haventbeen around to you know be a good dad i only just find out about you when your mother came back i know that too it doesntmatter though it what mum though was best for all of us she said not turning around opening the door hopefully i can make it up to you he said as she shut the door behind her alex began to head back towards her room she had to pack her stuff tonight she would be moving into what ever house she was sorted into she was distracted by the paintings on the wall and ran into a very old man miss granger the man said his piercing blue eyes sparkled professor dumbledore i so sorry i wasntwatching where i was going she began going red in the face that quite alright many of us hardly see where our feet are taking us can i assume that yours took you down into the dungeons this morning he asked grinning slightly alex nodded she had always thought of albus dumbledore as a ruler but right now he seemed to feel like more of her grandfather i had to see professor zabini it was no big deal she said ah yes but i think your first conversation with your father is a big deal miss granger no matter what you were talking about he replied alex smiled at him please donttell my mum alex said she wasntsure why but she didntwant her to know she had spoken to her father if that what you want however miss granger i think your mother may want to know that he too still loves her dumbledore said but now i must be off i have some meetings to attend to hermione returned to her room just after lunch only to find that her daughter things had already been packed and the room empty she sighed just as there was a tap on her window she opened the window and recognised her good friend elizabeth owl from america the letter was addressed to alex and hermione guessed it was from liz twins georgie and logan she put the letter in her pocket and sighed again before exiting her room in search of her daughter she never found alex but rushed to dumbledore office realizing she was late for a meeting with him as she entered the office she found that it was empty so she sat and waited in his waiting room after a bout five minutes of waiting hermione heard footsteps travelling up the staircase to dumbledore office she stood up preparing herself to see the headmaster but instead found both the headmaster and blaise ahh professor granger sorry i am late dumbledore said as he entered the waiting room hermione looked at the headmaster then realizing he had addressed her spoke that fine professor i can wait until your finished she said dumbledore shook his head no i called you both here for the same meeting he motioned for the two professors to follow him into the office neither blaise nor hermione spoke and as they sat in dumbledore office hermione could feel blaise eyes on her she glanced side ways at him watching as he turned back to dumbledore both waited for dumbledore to address them the old wizard turned and sat in his chair facing the two well i believe you are both wondering what you are doing gin my office he began hermione nodded dumbledore took a deep breath and began to explain again well as you know fascino quas to bewitch the fates is quite a excellent school in the witchcraft and wizardry world i am sure that you hermione have been please with the education alex has received there hermione nodded as he continued this year hogwarts and fascino quas have decided to run an international program where at turn one house from each school will be visiting the other for a week to learn about the other i wish to put both of you in charge of the school trips when a hogwarts house is visiting the other school this means that each trip you will accompany the house along with the head of teachers the first visit will be made to fascino quas in the week of halloween the house that will go first if gryffindor which means that harry potter and jessica weasley will accompany you there he stopped and waited for either of the two react professor i dontthink i really the right teacher for this job blaise began before he was interrupted by dumbledore professor zabini if i didntthink you were the right teacher then i wouldnthave picked you in the first place he said professor granger do you have any complaints hermione shook her head no professor fascino quas is an excellent school with excellent teachers and students she said remembering georgie and logan i will be looking forward to these visits excellent dumbledore said now if you two dontmind i have another meeting with one of our new teachers he stood up and led them to the door as they entered the waiting room the new teacher stood ah professor walker you re here dumbledore said hermione looked at the man he was around her and blaise age and he had dirty blonde hair that was messy but still looked good he bright blue yes seemed to be smiling hermione was speechless meet some of your new colleagues professor zabini is our potions teacher along with professor snape and professor granger who is new also and is teaching charms the man nodded and shook both of their hands as dumbledore introduced them well i guess we should begin the meeting he said to dumbledore and followed back past hermione and blaise into his office once the door was shut they both began to make their way down the stairs back into the great hall hermione turned and began to head back toward her room in the hope that alex had finally gone back there hermione blaise said as he watched her turn she turned back around and looked at the man she noticed that while he had gotten older he still looked very much the same as he had the last time they had been alone together i sorry he mumbled looking back at her hermione nodded i sorry too she said but i didntcome back here for myself blaise i came back for alex because she has the right to know who her family are who her father is blaise nodded and hermione turned to leave again before stopping blaise i think it would be good if we were friends she said quietly for alex sake blaise nodded before turning to leave and hermione watched him as he made his way back toward the dungeons before leaving herself alex was sitting at the window of the astronomy tower it was open and there was a slight breeze coming through she sighed and watched as teachers came in and out of the castle she knew she should be heading back to her mothers room so they could spend some time together before she was only spending time with her friends that was if she made any she closed the window and made her way back to her mother room careful not to be noticed by anyone that needed help hey some one said angrily as alex walked into them oh sorry riley alex asked looking at who she had walked into who the hell else would be ha said nastily um ok alex thought to herself so are you excited about school starting back she asked him yeah i hell excited to get back to work he replied sarcastically before walking off alex walked slowly the rest of the way back to her mothers room suddenly she felt very anxious about the big feast tonight she knew was going to be sorted in a similar way they had sorted the students at her old school but there she had her best friend and there was only three houses with none of them being the home of dark magic alex her mother said she was down the hallway and was heading back into her room i have a letter for you i ve been looking of you every where oh sorry mum i guess i just wanted some time by myself she pushed all her worries out of her mind so who this letter from she asked georgie or logan i can never tell their writing apart she said handing the letter over as they entered their room alex sat onher mothers bed and ripped open the letter hey alex how are you do you like it there do you miss us yet everything here fine but it not the same without you i already missing you like crazy and i know logan is he just wont admit it alex smiled at this any way this letter is really about us wishing you good luck for tonight and tomorrow everyone will love you and if they donti know some charms that will make them love you it not going to be the same at school without you either i mean who is going to tease logan with me now anyway good luck good luck good luck with everything missing you heaps already luv georgie and logan she re read the letter again smiling before realizing her mother had been talking to her um yeah what she asked as her mother sighed i said we should probably be hading down to the great hall as the students will be arriving soon hermione said alex nodded and followed her mother back down to the great hall and watched as teachers gradually entered the hall until students filled the hall she sighed and watched as dumbledore began to speak and as the sorting of the first years began she tuned out and only paid attention to her thoughts a n so i had a little trouble writing and ending this chapter so if any of you have some ideas about where you d like this story to go please include them and review again luv emgurl disclaimer so you should all know by now that i do not own harry potter or anything from the books hey heres the new chapter thanx for all the reviews and i know i only just put the last chapter up yesterday but i was suddenly full of ideas so i wrote this chapter alex sat and watched as the first years were sorted into the various houses she knew what happened during the sorting it was a similar process which her old school fascino quas had used she sighed and looked up at the teacher desk regretting that she had agreed to be sorted her eyes travelled along the table until they stopped at her mother she watched her mother as she watched the sorting while talking to a teacher with dirty blonde hair on the left to her alex was surprised to find that her father was sitting was on her mothers right although he didntlook very happy as if he would rather be anywhere but sitting there he looked up at the girl and smiled as their eyes made eyes contact alex knew then she had a good father and smiled back at him eventually alex began to look at the different tables filled with students until her eyes stopped at the table beneath the red and gold banners the gryffindor table she thought she knew that was the house her mother had wanted her to be sorted into by now though alex had decided that she didntcare which house she was put into even if it was slytherin her father had been in there and he seemed alright right her eyes moved along the gryffindor table before they stopped at her almost cousin paul he was sitting next to a boy with brown hair and a girl with bright red hair who looked to be the same age as alex next to the girl were two younger boys all three of them had the same bright red hair as paul they must be weasley too she though smiling slightly her eyes continued to move across the gryffindor students who were watching the sorting until she came across riley he was sitting with three other boys one had blonde hair while the other two had dark brown hair they werentwatching the sorting instead they were talking to each other and laughing but not loud enough for any of the teachers to hear them suddenly the boy with the blonde hair looked at alex she did not look away as riley turned to look at her aswell before they both turned back to their other friend laughing and along with the first years we also have our new teachers first we have professor walker who will be teaching the history of magic alex turned back to the teacher table as dumbledore began to speak and watched as the mad with the dirty blonde hair next to her mother stood up and secondly we have another of our past students professor granger who will be teaching charms dumbledore paused as the students clapped slowly however along with professor granger comes her daughter from fascino quas and along with hogwarts tradition she must now be sorted into her house where she will continue her schooling in the fifth year granger alexandria ginny weasley said as alex made her way to the stool where the sorting hat was sitting she gave the girl an encouraging smile as she placed the house on top of black curls well what do we have here the daughter of a slytherin and a gryffindor interesting the hat said to her as she tried to look calm instead of nervous as the entire school watched her however you belong in only on those houses so it had better be alex held her breath while she waited for the hat to continue gryffindor the heat shouted as there came cheers from the red and gold table alex paul yelled out come sit with us she made her way over to the table and sat between paul and the girl with the red hair hey the girl said as paul began to talk with the boy next to him i nicole weasley or you can call me nikki i in fifth too she smiled but stopped talking as the headmaster began to talk alex didntlisten to him and was instead looking at the other people on the long table hermione smiled and clapped as the hat announced her daughter was a gryffindor she could feel blaise next to her clapping as well i thought you would have wanted her in slytherin hermione said still watching her daughter i wouldntwant that on anyone blaise said glancing at hermione besides she too much like you to not be in gryffindor the conversation ended when the feast began and hermione was distracted into a conversation with the handsome professor walker alex smiled as nicole talked to her she reminded her of georgie and alex knew that they would become good friends so these are my younger brothers nicole said pointing to the two boys next to her it matty and bill after our dad alex nodded her mother had told her about bill weasley and how he had fallen in love with fleur delacour during the war so are you guys the only other weasley here besides paul alex asked nicole shook her head as she took a sip of her pumpkin juice no there claire and stefanie their uncle charlie twins and riley potter she said pointing at two girls in the year below them and then at riley who was at the other end to the table we dontreally see him much though nicole said alex frowned why not because he thinks he better than the rest of the family just because his dad is harry potter and he acts like a stupid git all the time even more when he with his friends she said not noticing alex frown oh right alex responded before looking back down at her plate once the feast had ended nicole took alex back to the gryffindor common room our dorm is upstairs she began there me you sam jess and natalie they usually just hang out with themselves i dontgossip enough to hang out with them so she shrugged alex looked around as nicole spoke to her the common room was simple but still elegant with most of the furniture in red or gold she nodded as nicole finished speaking before the blonde haired boy alex recognised as riley friend told her to get out the way oh sorry alex said stepping to the side so that he could get past and alex noticed that riley was right behind him she gave him a small smile but he just ignored her next time walk around nicole told the boy god their so annoying i cantbelieve i related to riley sometimes alex was a bout to tell her that she had talked to him in the holidays but as she was about to speak she noticed the two of them laughing and looking at nicole so she decided against it so do you want to hang out or something cos i could introduce to everyone else if you want nicole asked her alex just shook her head no i a little tired actually i think i might just go to bed nicole nodded and took her up to the dorm where her trunks had already been bought up she slowly put on her pyjamas while nicole talked to her and climbed into bed night alex she heard nicole say night nic she said back smiling to her self she knew that it was going to be different here but at least she had a friend hermione ginny potter repeated hermione are you listening to me huh hermione looked at her friend what she asked seeing her friends grin i asked you what you thought of our new professor she said hermione shrugged he ok i guess ok ginny repeated you barely talked to anyone else during the feast even now your not paying attention to me you re too busy watching him she said the last part in a whisper so that the other teachers in the staff room did not hear her before hermione could reply harry had walked over to the two witches and grabbed his wife around the waist whispering something in her ear ginny giggled before blushing and pushing harry away no your mine i not letting go harry said jokingly harry just because were mar ginny began to say before getting cut off by harry kissing her hermione stood up at this and began to make her way over to where ron and blaise were talking i think they had a bit too much wine professor walker said blocking her path to the two men pointing at harry and ginny who were now trying to get out of the staff room unnoticed yeah probably hermione nodded spluttering her words out she looked down at her feet she could feel ron watching her laughing she just hoped blaise wasntwatching why do you care what blaise thinks she asked her self silently because your still love him a different voice said no i dont yea you do shut up suddenly hermione realised that professor walker was watching her as she struggled with her thoughts um i kind of tired and classes start tomorrow i guess i ll see you then she said smiling at the man before making her way toward the door hermione had been walking the castle hallways for ten minutes she had said that she was tired and wanted to prepare for her classes tomorrow but ti wasntthat she had to leave because she didntknow if she could face any of the people in there after realising something that she though had ended fifteen years ago i still love him she asked herself stopping at a window she watched the whomping willow as it thrashed around at nothing at least nothing hermione could see she shook her head and pushed all thoughts of blaise out her mind before finally heading back t her room hermione put her hand on the brass doorknob and went to turn it hermione she heard a familiar voice say a n ok that the chapter hope u enjoyed it and yes i sorry i left u with that ending but i haventdecided on who the person is going to be yet once again thanx for all my reviewers so far and review again tell me who u think the person will be luv emgurl disclaimer i still dontown harry potter or anything from the book a n ok so i get very bored on the weekends and then my mind begins to tick but i think all you readers out there like it when i update the story more often so i dontreally care thanks again for all my great reviews because i only continue to write because you all like to read it heres chapter 6 enjoy hermione put her hand on the brass doorknob and began to turn it while slightly pushing on the door hermione a familiar voice said she let go of the doorknob and turned around professor walker blaise she said facing the two men please call me ben he spoke again hermione looked at blaise and all her thoughts came back she looked away instead focusing on ben um so what can i do for you she said forcing a smile ben didntnotice the forcefulness although blaise did he noticed everything about her every little change she made oh i was just helping our new professor here find his way back to his room blaise said before ben could speak hermione looked at him and then back at ben oh well i should be getting to bed it late and there classes tomorrow she said before opening her door and closing it before either could reply alex sat up in her bed it was morning and she had been woken by the laughter from her roommates she pulled open her curtains and climbed out of bed to find that nicole was up and no longer in the room alex looked at the other girls where nicole she asked them a girl with straight blonde hair looked at her why would we know where the weasel is she asked alex back alex frowned i alex by the way a girl with brown hair smiled at her i sam this is jess and nat she said pointing at the girl with blonde hair first then at the girl with black hair dontmind jess she just mad cos potter isntpaying attention to her i think nicole gone to the owlry thanks alex said before going to have a shower once showered she pulled on her school uniform and then her black school robes over the top once pulling her hair into a loose ponytail she decided to make her way down to the great hall for breakfast maybe i ll see nic there she thought to herself if not i could sit with sam she seems nice alex made her way down to the great hall and was slightly relieved to find nicole already there sitting with a dark haired boy she remembered being introduced to last night is it david no maybe it was daniel yeah it was daniel she thought trying to remember his name she sat down next to her new friend and watched as the owls began to enter the great hall carrying letters or packages that were most likely forgotten school items that were left at home she looked up at the teacher table and saw her mum taking to ginny weasley they were laughing and kept looking at ginny husband harry hey alex nicole said alex turned back to her friend to find that the boy daniel had gone sorry i had left before you had woken up this morning but i had to send a letter to my parents that alright i mean it not like i dontknow my way around yet she said as two boys sat down across from them what class have you got first nicole asked her ignoring the two boys alex looked across the table to find herself staring at riley and his blonde headed friend neither of them spoke to the two girls she looked down at her piece of paper she had received when she entered the great hall um history of magic with that new professor she said yeah me too nicole said as she began to eat her breakfast alex bit into her piece of toast and watched as the three girls she had left in her dorm came and sat with riley and his friend jess put his arm around her waist and leaned on his shoulder alex couldnthelp but notice the look of uncomfort that was across riley face and the look of humour that filled his friends she looked back down at her plate so alex what school have you come from sam asked her alex looked up from her toast and noticed that nicole was now talking to some students she didntknow she looked at sam um it was only a small school fascino quas in new york alex said cool i have cousins who go there she said smiling but their only in their second year so you probably wouldnthave know them alex nodded and glanced back at the staff table she caught her father eyes and he gave her a wave before she turned back to her food well granger if your mothers here teaching where your father i assuming that you do have one the boy with the blonde hair asked her what the hell does it matter to you malfoy where her father is nicole said before alex had the chance to reply come one alex i finished here she stood up and alex followed her grateful that she didnthave to share her parent story with these people she barely knew hey nicole she said catching up with the red head mmm she said stopping letting alex catch her breath thanks for that she said it no problem especially when it comes to malfoy i just hope him and riley arentin our classes she said alex nodded she seems to be doing a lot of nodding and followed her friend to the history of magic classroom it was lunch and hermione had already taught two of her three classes for today as she sat down she noticed blaise sitting alone at the end of the table should i go sit with him she asked herself she shook her head as ben walker sat in the chair nest to her so hermione would i be right in guessing that your daughter gets her brains from you or would it be mr granger who gave them to her he asked what she asked barely listening pulling her gaze away from blaise alex she was in my class this morning she quite intelligent i was just asking if it came from you or mr granger he said again laughing a little well first of all there no mr granger but her father was just as smart as i was when we were in school she replied looking down at her lunch oh sorry i figured you were married he replied awkwardly they sat there in silence eating their lunch so which house are you teaching after lunch hermione finally asked him um i think it slytherin and hufflepuff third years it should be fun he said looking up at the witch hermione nodded yeah at least you wontbe running around changing their ears back to normal like i was this morning she said sarcastically ben walker laughed blaise sat on the end of the staff table in the great hall he had a book open but was not reading it instead he was watching hermione he couldnthelp it as hard as he tried to read his book he just couldntconcentrate on the words he watched her walk in and watched as ben walker sat next to her he watched her as she laughed at what the other man was saying and he watched her as she took a sip of her drink before she turned back to the conversation he was concentrating on watching her so much that he didntleave for his next class until he watched her stand up and push her chair in before she walked out the great hall suddenly he stood up realising he had to teach he was just grateful that he was co teaching with snape and blaise knew he would understand after lunch alex found that she had potions unfortunately for her nicole was not in this class although sam natalie jess riley and that blonde boy malfoy all were she was a bit nervous because this was her first class with her father and she wasntsure what he thought of her yet after five minutes of waiting an older professor alex recognised as her mother friend snape let them into the classroom she knew that he was co teaching potions with her father because he wouldntretire and dumbledore couldntforce him to retire because he himself wouldntretire either she followed the students in and sat at a desk and cauldron by herself before sam sat down next to her you dontmind if i sit with you she asked alex cheerfully because of her nerves alex could barely talk she shook her head and smiled at sam while we wait for professor zabini professor snape began i will do a role check to see who is here alex waited for her name and just as snape said it blaise walked in here she said watching her father he looked at her as he went and stood next to snape while he finished the role call hey alex why does professor zabini keep looking at us funny sam whispered to her alex shrugged suddenly thinking to herself what do i call him professor zabini i mean that good for in the classroom but what about when i not in class if i in the great hall or walking around and i see him do i call him blaise or dad what if he doesntwant me to call him do i want to call him dad before alex had a chance to answer the questions that had formed in her head sam had interrupted her ok alex do you want to chop the bats toe nails or the snakes eye she asked her um the toenails she replied as they began the potion alex was then so busy during the lesson that she didnthave a chance to think about anything but the potion she was working on with sam she decided that she liked sam and was glad she had become friends with her the end of the lesson came quickly although not nearly as quick enough for alex um miss granger may i please see you after class blaise asked her alex nodded hey i can wait for you if you want sam told her yeah that d be good i still dontreally know my way around the dungeons yet she said giving the girl a small smile she waited for all the other students to leave before she went up to the teacher desk where snape and her father were sitting professor snape excused himself and left alex alone with her father suddenly alex felt very nervous this was only the second time she had been in the room alone with her father but the first time she had wanted to speak to him so um alex do you like here at hogwarts blaise asked the young girl awkwardly yeah its good i kinda miss my old school though she answered truthfully blaise nodded and looked down at the paper on his desk so have you did your mum i was wondering if you would like to spend the day with me at hogsmeade next weekend he finally asked her alex knew her face looked a little surprise she had not been expecting him to ask her anything like this i thought i could take you shopping to buy you a present or something he mumbled seeing the surprised look on her face then she smiled i would love that mum was supposed tot take me last week but she uh didntget around to it blaise smiled well i think you friends are outside waiting for you so you better be off alex walked to ward the door and opened it i ll see you later professor um alex you can call me dad if you want he said alex knew sam had heard him she didntrealise that four other people had waited with her though leaving the door open she turned around to face blaise ok i ll see you later dad she said smiling before hugging her father who smiled alex left the classroom and four of the five people were staring at her the only one who wasntwas riley who already knew alex guessed that he hadnttold any of them and was slightly surprised riley watched alex as she talked to sam and nicole through dinner that was he watched her when jess wasntin his face he had never seen his cousin have a proper friend before and was actually glad alex had befriended her because every time nicole tried to leave the conversation alex would bring her back into it and they would start giggling at the end of the meal dumbledore told the students some thing about the houses visiting another school in america he wasntreally paying attention he was more involved in a game of noughts and crosses with his friend draco malfoy junior hey alex isntfascino quas your old school he heard sam ask alex he looked up watching alex as he waited for her to reply yeah it is wow this will be great i can introduce you to my friends georgie and logan alex replied is logan that hot guy who was kissing you in that photo near your bed natalie asked her joining the conversation he noticed alex blush and she nodded before answering a question nicole asked her that he didnthear hey potter malfoy said smirking at him i think i won riley looked back at his game and saw that he had lost by the way i think woodhams jess is trying to get your attention again riley looked at the blonde girl who was pouting at him and groaned come on i going back to the common room he said standing up and most of the students began to leave he glanced back at alex his cousin and sam they were still laughing and talking to one of his roommates so malfoy said to him as they began to walk back to the gryffindor common room you like granger or is it zabini he wondered what get real malfoy he replied without looking at his friend well it looks like you do i mean you couldnttake your eyes off her when we were in the great hall he said smirking at riley how do you think poor little jessica feels they stopped at the portrait of the fat lady firebolt he said and the portrait swung open he ignored his friend comments riley watched as his blonde friend climbed through the opening the portrait had just revealed hey malfoy i ve changed my mind i think i going to go for a walk he said he waited and then left when he heard his friend reply a muffled whatever eventually he made his way to the astronomy tower running his fingers through his hair he looked out the window and watched as the stars became visible you know usually when people sigh it means they have a problem he heard a familiar voice say alex sat down next to him and looked out at the window what up she asked him riley looked at her he had been a bit of an arse to her the last few days ignoring her and stuff just to look good in front of his friends and now she was talking to him again she looked at him and met his eyes and gave him a smile are you going to tell me she asked riley looked back at her there nothing to tell he said before turning to look back at the stars what did something happen with your girlfriend she asked seriously riley knew she was talking about jess she not my girlfriend he said automatically really alex said jokingly i dontthink that what she thinks in fact when i left the common room she was looking for you she not my bloody girlfriend he said angrily standing up i was just kidding alex said standing up aswell but obviously you canttake a joke she began to walk to ward the stairs alex wait i sorry it just she wont leave me alone it gets annoying and then malfoy says stuff and now your saying stuff he said quickly as she put her foot on the first step alex looked at him what ever riley she said before continuing to walk down the stairs arrgh why did i have to get mad at her he asked himself as he watched her walk down the stairs he quickly ran down the steps and grabbed her arm alex he said pulling her around so that she was facing him pulling away alex told him to get off no wait i sorry not just about before but about everything i mean i was a bastard to you and i sorry he said alex looked at him he still had hold of her arm ok riley i forgive you she said before trying to turn away from him he let go of her arm she began to walk down the stairs again when this time she felt riley grab her hand she turned around what do you want no her voice was cut off by riley lips but instead of kissing riley back she pulled away riley don t she whispered as her tried to kiss her again he let go of her hand and she quickly ran down the steps riley watched her not wanting to follow her or make it worse is logan that hot guy kissing you in that photo he remembered natalie voice asking alex at dinner great she has a boyfriend he thought to himself and now i ve just ruined any chance i had of being friedns with her angry with himself he slowly walked back to the common room firebolt he told the fat lady and the portrait swung open he climbed through and looked around the common room suddenly jess came up and hugged him tightly get off he said he could feel people watching them as he pushed the blonde girl away he sat with malfoy who was playing exploding snap with sam hey you haventseen alex have you she asked him slyly surprised at the question he shook his head and saw malfoy smirk at him suddenly the portrait swung open and they watch as alex climbed in and ran to her dorm she was crying riley watch as nicole followed her up there a n thanks again to all my fantastic reviewers i hope

nicole as she wiped the tears off her face i i i just want to be left alone the redhead looked at her friend and gave a small hug before helping her into bed if alex wasntgoing to tell her then she wasntgoing to try and force her alex waited until nicole had left the dorm before she climbed out of bed and opened her trunk she pulled out a notebook that had a blue cover she opened it and took out a pink pen before climbing back into her bed she wasntsure why she was crying it wasntlike riley had hurt or upset her she guessed it must have been shock she hadntexpected him to kiss her she hadnteven expected him to talk to her considering he had been doing a pretty good job at ignoring her the last two days she opened the notebook and began to write with the pink ink dear georgie she began hogwarts is great but i still miss you and logan i made friends with these girls nicole and sam they re heaps nice they remind me of you sort of oh and guess what but u probably know by now too were coming to fascino quas isntit great i ll get to spend halloween with you and then later on you ll get to come here plus you ll get to meet my dad who is really cool he going to take me shopping soon how great it that but any way she stopped writing as she heard the dorm door open and jess and natalie hushed voices filled the room they didntstay though and left as quickly as they entered alex continued to write there this boy and in the holidays i met him cos he was staying in the castle too and i thought we were friends but then when his friends came back he started to ignore me and stuff but then tonight before he tried to kiss me i didntlet him of course but i think i kind of like him but i dontknow what to do i miss you and logan so much it like i missing part of my family mum so busy with her classes and stuff and i guess it might be kind of weird until my dad and i get to know each other better first i guess you and logan were like my sister and brother and now suddenly i an only child write back soon luv always alex alex put her pen down and ripped the paper out the notebook before folding it up and addressing it i ll take it to the owlry before breakfast she thought to herself as she climbed underneath her blankets and laid down as she was falling off to sleep she heard sam enter and could feel her eyes as she pulled open the curtains to check on her pretending to sleep alex waited until she had hopped into her own bed before rolling over the next day hermione watched as the fifth year gryffindor and ravenclaws students took their seats in the classroom she smiled as she watched her daughter sit down with a girl with bright red hair she must be bill eldest she thought to herself she waited for the students to settle down before telling them to take out their wands she noticed that her daughter was unusually quiet and made a mental note to ask her about it later on ok in today lesson we will be learning a simple blocking charm she paused and looked at the students it can be used to block hexes that have been placed on your or simpler things such as wind or rain you will be practicing with these water guns where your partner will squirt you while you try to block it then you will be swapping and your partner will try to block the water she continued as she passed out the muggle water guns to perform the blocking charm repeat contego ego and flick your wand upwards she watched as the students began to perform the charm and walked around helping those students who needed it no mr potter flick the wand up she told him as malfoy was soaking him she moved on and found that her daughter had not received a drop of water on her well done alex why dontyou two girls swap now alex nodded as nicole passed her the water gun hermione sat down at her desk and watched the students perform the spell some were doing it correctly while some were just getting wet she smiled to herself fas the bell rang and they all picked dup their books ok i expect you to be able to clock any thing that comes your way by next lesson she said standing up a week went by and riley had managed to avoid her not that it had been that hard since no one saw them talking before school had started back but he knew that she was avoiding him too every night he walked to the astronomy tower in hope that she would be sitting be there she never was and each night riley felt a stab disappointment things got worse when jessica wouldntleave him alone he could fell alex watching him when they ate and jessica was swarming all over him but every time he turned to look at her she would turn away and suddenly be very interested in her food or become involved in a conversation with the people sitting around her he wanted to tell her he was sorry but he didntknow how then he realised alex had been sitting in the gryffindor common room day dreaming about nothing in particular when there was a slight tapping noise at the window she opened the window and an owl flew in she grabbed the letter of his leg hoping that georgie had finally replied to her letter she did send it almost a week ago now the letter wasntfrom georgie infact it didnteven say who it was from but alex could guess who had sent she re read the hurried writing meet me at the astronomy tower after lunch it had said it had to be riley no one else she knew went up there she sighed scrunching the paper up and sticking in her pocket she didntwant to go there but suddenly she had no control over her feet and she was making her way to the tower she walked slowly up the stairs and silently stepped into the room at the top of tower riley was standing near the window and didntnotice her she went and stood next to him to make her presence known what do you want riley she asked him quietly looking down at her hands she could feel him turning to look at her and she looked up i just wanted to say that i sorry again i want to be friends with you and i sorry he said slowly alex nodded and sat on the cold stone floor he sat down next to her so do you like it here he asked yeah it good a lot bigger than my old school and my friends arenthere but your cousin nicole she heaps nice she reminds me of my best friend back home she smiled at him yeah nicole cool but she never really had that many friends he replied could it be that her cousins a bit of a prick and doesntstand up for her when his best friends says things about her alex asked him sarcastically riley looked at her it could be it not really malfoy fault though i mean you werenthere in first year when nicole used to tease him too i mean it wouldntbe easy being the first malfoy ever who wasntaccepted into the slytherin house alex listened to riley as he told her the stories of her new friends school years before she arrived there hermione blaise called as he saw the witch walking down the corridor hermione he quickened his pace to catch up with her hermione he said gain as he reached her she looked startled oh blaise sorry i didnthear you that alright i just wanted to ask you something he stopped and looked at her she looked back at him for what seemed to be five minutes well she finally said well what he asked her back what did you want to ask me blaise she asked him slightly frustrated he couldnthelp but smile she always looked so cute when she was mad at him oh yeah well i was going to take alex into hogsmeade next weekend to show her around and i dontknow maybe buy her some birthday presents that i missed and i was just wondering if you would like to join us he said you know just for moral support i mean me and a teenager shopping advantage could be taken he said quickly hermione stared back at him oh blaise i wouldntyou prefer it was just the two of you so you could get to know her she asked besides i ve already got some marking to do so i guess i ll be kind of busy oh yeah that a good idea he said frowning i guess i ll be off then he could feel hermione watching him as he walked off why didntyou just tell him she asked herself as she began to head back toward the library she asked herself as she began to head back toward the library he probably still loves you too a different voice said but what if he doesn t the first voice asked what are you daft of course he still loves you he thoughts were interrupted as she walked into something causing her to drop her cooks oh sorry hermione she heard ben voice say wasntwatching where i was going she felt herself blush oh no my fault i wasntpaying attention she said while thinking to herself f since when do i blush when some one talks to me he helped her pick up her books ok so were even it was both our faults he smiled at her she felt herself blush again and just nodded she began to make her way back toward the library before she was stopped by the handsome professor again um hermione i was wondering if you would like to join me to hogsmeade next week end see i dontreally know my way around there yet and i wouldntmind if some body showed me around he asked falling into step with her she stopped at the library door um yeah sure i have a meeting to go to in the morning next week otherwise the rest of the day i am free great i ll just meet you in the great hall at lunch time then he asked her cheerfully she nodded yea lunch time would be fine she answered before entering the library and leaving him in the corridor riley was in the gryffindor sitting with malfoy and sam who were watching alex beat nicole at wizard chess while they werenthaving a lovers quarrel riley was actually enjoying himself for the first time that term he had the chance to relax hey riley why dontyou ask your girlfriend to come with us to hogsmeade next week end he heard malfoy whispered into his ear he heard sam giggle i not asking jess to go anywhere with me and she not my girlfriend he said looking away from the two girls playing chess i wasnttalking about bloody woodhams potter i was talking about your other girlfriend the one you ve been moping over all week but now suddenly your friends again he said smirking yeah i pretty sure he was talking about our beautiful new american friend sam put in riley looked at the two of them and watched their evil smirks alex is not my girlfriend i not interested in her like that we re just friends he said confidently they both just smirked at him what he asked and alex finally beat nicole in their game of chess ask her sam hissed at him so alex have you been to hogsmeade yet he asked her ignoring the smirks from malfoy alex looked at the three of them no not yet my dad is going to take me the first week end we can go you know for bonding riley nodded before turning to his cousin hey nic would you like to come with me to hogsmeade next week i don t think i could stand spending the whole day there with just these two he said pointing to his friends who were now snogging after losing interest in riley discomfort nicole was slightly surprised at the question and riley knew that it was because he had never been the nicest of people to her since they had been at hogwarts um ok she said slowly considering what it would be like for her cousin to be nice to her for once suddenly before either riley alex or nicole could continue or start a new conversation jess woodhams came and place herself on riley lap he saw alex eyes fill with laughter as she dragged his cousin up to the girl dormitories and tried to push the girl off his lap the following week went by as quick as the holidays had ended and on the friday night before the first hogsmeade week end ti was announced that all gryffindor students who wished to attend the first trip to fascino quas wee to attend a meeting in the great hall after breakfast on the saturday alex felt a bit disappointed that she had to go to a meeting it meant she had less time to spend with her father but at the same time she felt excited because this meant there was only a couple of weeks left til halloween and the trip blaise waited as the students from the other houses left the great hall and those gryffindor students who had missed breakfast entered and sat with their friends he saw alex sitting with harry potter son and draco malfoy son it never ceased to amuse him how the two boys were best friends when their parents could only barely stand each other finaly the meeting began and he watched professor dumbledore address the gryffindor house as you know in three weeks it will be halloween this is when your visit to fascino quas will take place but first we have sent letters to you parents asking them permission blaise heard the older man say there you will participate in the same classes as your year levels and on the night of halloween there will be a costume ball which means you will be required to waer a fancy dress costume if you wish to attend blaise saw his daughter smile and poke her friend nicole in the side before whispering something in her ear as your house heads professor potter and professor weasley will be accompanying you along with professor granger and professor zabini blaise looked across at hermione and jessica weasley who were watching the students and telling those off who were talking but i know many of you are wanting to leave for your hogsmeade weekend so i will now cut this meeting short dumbledore finally finished as many of the older students stood please enjoy yourselves blaise made his way over to the doors of the great hall and waited for alex as they left he couldnthelp but notice hermione make her way over to professor walker who was standing by the doors a n ok that was chapter 7 at the moment i kind of feeling sorry for blaise which is weird considering i writing the story anyway please review and i hope you enjoy luv emgurl disclaimer so i still dontown harry potter or anything related or from the book and to all my fantastic reviewers than you so much for all your comments ivek ind of been stuck for a couple of days for ideas but hopefully this chapter wont be too pointless any way i think there might be a bit of confusion so before the chapter starts 1 nicole weasley is bill and fleur daughter she has two younger brothers at hogwarts but they were only mentioned once 2 yes malfoy jr and sam are going out i decided this after i had introduced them but i cantreally be bother going back and fixing it up yet and 3 draco malfoy jr is in gryffindor because that where i put him i mean why not and decided that he will be riley best mate any way heres the chapter nicole walked slowly with her cousin and his two friends in an uncomfortable silence the entire way to hogsmeade in a short distance in front of her she could see her new and first real friend she had ever really had walking with her newly found father she watched riley curiously as he too watched the dark haired girl never once taking his eyes off of her not even when malfoy spoke to him nicole grinned to herself when the blonde boy and his girlfriend sam started to ask riley all sorts of questions knowing that he wasntlistening to a word they were saying so weasley do you agree that your cousin has a slightly unhealthy obsession with our new american friend malfoy asked the red head she looked at her cousin then at the other two who were wearing the same identical sly grins she knew riley wasntlistening he was too busy concentrating on watching the girl many metres in front of them she nodded slowly watching as their grins grew broader want to help us out then sam asked her checking to make sure riley still wasntlistening to them what do you have in mind nicole asked them alex walked along side her father in the cool air it was autumn and the weather was finally changing from being hot to the cool chilling air she pulled her black cloak tightly around her and listened to the rhythmical steps her father made as his feets hit the ground neither of them had spoke since they had left hogwarts and suddenly alex was feeling a bit uncomfortable i thought we could get some lunch first then maybe i could buy you a present blaise finally said glancing across at the young girl she looked back at him and nodded okay she replied before turning to look straight ahead as soon as hermione and ben had left the hogwarts ground they apparated into hogsmeade this meant they arrived before many of the students as they did not have to endure the long trip walking there hermione looked at her watch so do you want me to show you around first or do you want to grab some food how about we eat while you show me around he asked her before walking over to an outside food stall hermione followed him and watched as he ordered they paid for their food before heading back into the main part of the street so do you fancy seeing the shrieking shack first hermione asked and before he could reply she was pulling him off in the direction of the old haunted house blaise took his daughter to his favourite restaurant in hogsmeade it was simple and served about anything you asked for from homemade italian pizza to shop style fish and chips to eye of newt soup the sat in a booth and blaise watched as the young girl opened a menu blaise darling a tarty waitress drawled as she came over to their table who is this blaise looked at the waitress she had platinum blonde hair that had clearly been dyed one too many times from the look of her black regrowth he make up was heavy and blaise had always wondered if it were in fact some type of mask in all his years of coming to this restaurant this was the one thing one person who annoyed him kelly he began smiling sweetly at the waitress this is my beautiful daughter alex alex looked up as he said this and looked at the waitress and they way her father was smiling at her the waitress was oblivious to the way blaise was totally fake toward her although alex had realized before she even looked up from her menu your daughter the waitress kelly asked looking at blaise that what he said didnthe alex said rudely only the blonde ignored her you never told me you had a daughter blaise she said putting her hand on his shoulder really i didn t he asked i guess it could be because i dontreally like to share my whole life with people i barely know he pushed her hand away the blonde waitress stared at him not knowing what to say um ok blaise can i take your order that what your paid to do isntit alex asked coolly still mad at being ignored by this dumb blonde blaise looked at his daughter and spoke before the blonde waitress could reply um i ll have the burger and fries with a coke alex what would you like he watched as she studied the menu again i ll just have the same she said ok make that two please kelly blaise said smiling sweetly at the waitress as she left their table so i m guessing she defiantly not an ex girlfriend then alex asked her father huh blaise asked looking directly in the girl eyes i donthave a girlfriend alex sat across from her father in the booth in complete silence until their meal came out the blonde waitress kept coming over to see how their meal was going even before she brought the food out and alex was clearly pissed off about it this day was supposed to be about her getting to know blaise as her father yet they had barely spoke and kept getting interrupted by some dumb blonde witch are you looking forward to visiting your old school blaise asked her as they began to eat yeah i cantwait to see my old friends i really miss them she began but nicole si so funny she reminds of my best friend back home georgie only she has red hair and is a bit more shy she smiled at the thought of the different but similar girls blaise smiled so these costume balls they have do the teachers have to get in to it as much as the students he asked slowly hoping that alex would tell him that the teachers dontwear costumes however she only grinned wickedly ate him no they get into it more than the students do i remember in my first year my potions teacher went as a tree but he used a spell instead of a costume to change his look and he messed it up he had branches and leaves for hair for about three weeks after blaise laughed hey do they have a costume shop here alex asked her facing lighting up suddenly we could go look at costumes if you want to that is blaise wiped his mouth with his napkin as alex waited for him to reply sure there actually this really great place i cantremember what it called blaise said thoughtfully looking at his daughter it just past weasley wizards wheezees if it alright i just have to stop there to see fred and gorge quickly alex nodded and they quickly finished their burgers some how riley had managed to get from hogwarts to hogsmeade to his uncle shop with out even remembering how he had got there sure he remembered walking there but he didntreally remember the details of anything such things as what he had talked about on the way there or how long it had taken the four of them to actually walk there he picked up an orange box inside was a bright green toothbrush he smiled and remembered the year his uncle fred and george had given him this for christmas it looked like an ordinary tooth brush and smelt invitingly like mint but as soon as the tooth brush entered his mouth all he could taste was something that reminded him of pond scum he put the box back on the shelf as he heard the jingle from the door opening he looked up to see professor zabini and alex enter the shop he couldnthelp but notice the way she was smiling when her father spoke to her but before he had the chance to speak to either of them he was dragged out og the shop by draco malfoy jr what where are we going riley asked as he pulled his arm free once he was outside the shop no where we have to wait for sam and your cousin first malfoy began well why cantwe just wait inside he asked frowning at the blonde boy who in return just shrugged and sat on the sidewalk riley looked into the shop window and watched as nicole said something to their uncle fred who then turned to look out the window grinning at riley weird he thought to himself he turned his attention to alex and her father who were talking to his uncle george who was trying to offer them a canary cream nicole and sam joined the two boys on the street riley looked at them so he asked so what nicole asked him back smirking a little where are we going that caused us to suddenly leave this shop he asked looking at the two girls no where sam said sitting next to the blonde boy then why are we outside sitting on the side walk he asked feeling slightly frustrated oh i thought you need some air you were a bit red malfoy began to say riley realising his friends were going to make him stay here until they were ready to leave sat down next to his red haired cousin he knew they were up to something something really weird alex followed her father into he joke shop where they were greeted with blaise and oh and you bought alex and so on from the weasley twins she couldnthelp but notice how riley and malfoy immediately left the shop once they had entered she soon watched as nicole and sam left the shop without talking to her too busy whispering to each other she was concentrating on watching the four out the front that she almost accepted the canary cream when fred offered it to her for the second time luckily blaise stopped her and gave fred a dirty look who was just laughing alex blaise finally turned to her why dontyou go talk to your friends while i sort some things out with fred and george alex nodded and made her way outside so george it seems as if our little nikki was right fred said and he motioned toward the five teens just outside their shop window they watched as riley stood up immediately and smiled as alex went over to them right about what blaise asked turning to look at what they were watching george looked at him well it seems that our little nephew riley has a thing for your daughter he began and by the looks of it she has a thing for him fred finished off grinning at the slightly horrified look on blaise face who was watching alex talk to riley and nicole he could clearly see both alex and riley blush as they talked to watch other through the glass ahh parental worry sets in so quickly fred said as blaise turned back toward them you ve just got your little girl now i bet your scared your going to lose her some boy who isntgood enough for her what she only fifteen besides i not worried about her he trailed off hoping he sounded convincing sure sure you seem to forget hat you and hermione werentmuch older then them george pointed out yeah and looked what happened to us blaise pointed out back we didntexactly have the romantic story did we um yeah sorry blaise you never know hermione might still come around fred put in who clearly saw blaise hurt and discomfort at what his twin had said to him after fifteen years i dontthink so blaise replied bitterly anyway for this trip to fascino quas dumbledore asked for me to organise a few halloween tricks or something for their ball he asked me to give you this he handed george a letter dumbledore said if you dontunderstand his request contact him dontmake up your own blaise continued i guess i ll see you guys soon the twins grinned as the y ripped the letter open and blaise exited the shop hermione and ben walker were walking extremely close down the main street og hogsmeade being with him somehow made hermione to forget everything all her problems especially her problems with blaise until she saw blaise and their daughter walking down the street toward them ben she said quietly why dontwe have a drink she stated before pulling him into the three broomsticks she hoped neither blaise nor alex had seen them suddenly she didntknow why but she felt guilty it wasntas if she had done anything wrong what will you have my lady ben asked her in a posh voice hermione giggled ah just a butter beer she said before finding a table she sat and watched as ben talked with the other customers in the pub before he came back with their drinks so hermione please tell me why you made a beeline for the indoor as soon as we saw your daughter and blaise hwy is she here with a professor anyway he asked her hermione noticed they were sitting extremely close so close their knees were brushing against each other s she did not feel uncomfortable she shrugged before sipping her drink alex is with blaise because they re having a father daughter day out their first day out together actually i guess i pulled you in here because i didntwant to interrupt them she lied in the last pat and hoped she sounded convincing oh right ben said before leaning forward towards hermione he didntwant to press the topic she clearly did not want to talk about it at least with him anyway she put her hand on his and smiled i like it here though he said looking around briefly before smiling back at her alex saw her mum disappear into the three broomsticks with ben walker closely following behind too close alex thought she wasntsure if her father had noticed them but it appeared he was too bust looking into the shop windows as they passed them and alex decided not to ask incase he didntand she had to explain it to him soon they came to a brightly painted shop across its windows was written hidden identies a costume for everyone in white cursive writing before it changed to a different font in capital letters moments later it changed again to resemble something which looked like a child hand writing blaise took her into the shop and they began to look around so what kind of costume are you looking for blaise asked her looking at a gorilla costume alex shrugged i dontknow usually me and georgie go in matching outfits but this year i guess we ll have to be different she said as she picked up a clown costume after they had been looking around for at least ten minutes and not finding anything that either of them agreed on for each other a young lady with bright green curly hair came over and asked if they needed help blaise looked at the woman tonks he exclaimed we need some help alex here needs a costume for a halloween ball and i agreed to help her look for it alex as in your daughter alex the woman with green hair asked a bit shocked alex had stopped listening by know this woman was obviously one of her fathers friends until she heard the women make one simple remark she looks so much like hermione she said and suddenly alex gave her her full attention you know my mum she asked the women who her father called tonks she nodded we were in the order together anyway about this costume what were you looking for i not sure but my dad needs a costume too she added slyly looking at her father he began to protest before tonks interrupted him dontworry i have the perfect costume of reach of you she said excitedly i ll bring them into the dressing rooms ones still out the back it only just come in she was basically jumping up and down as she pushed the two toward the dressing rooms gee thanx alex just what i wanted a gorilla costume blaise said sarcastically as a handful of costumes was handed to him dontworry you ll thank me later she said as tonks bought her only one costume alex took it into the change room and quickly got changed once dressed again she looked in the mirror and was surprised at how great the costume was she had on a simple white and gold silk dress that reached just above her knees a pair of angel wings the proper kind made of feathers and a thin piece of gold rope for a halo a n think juliet costume from romeo and juliet but better she smiled as tonks and her father called her out she stepped out behind the curtain and heard the two of them gasp suddenly self conscious she looked at them what do you thin she asked before laughing at her father who was dressed as clown now i think i think he began it perfect tonks squealed cutting him off alex looked at her father and he nodded and smiled i like your costume too she added giggling again yeah it the only one i like he said so the clown and the angel tonks asked ushering them both into their own change rooms i ll just go get the boxes tonks how do you know i going to buy either of them blaise called out from his change room well first of darling blaise you looked ridiculous in all the costumes but you do need one and i dontknow how you could say no to your daughter after she looked like she just did tonks called back alex went back into he main part of the shop to find blaise paying for the wrapped costumes she looked at her watch and realised it was time she headed back to hogwarts blaise realised this too well tonk you should come visit us soon i sure dumbledore wontmind blaise said as he picked up the bags that held the boxes unfortunately now though we have to go back i sure hermione will be worrying about where i ve taken alex to all day the green haired woman nodded it was great meeting you alex i sure i ll see you some time soon she said as alex andblaise exited and alex waved back to her soon alex and blaise were back at the castle thank you so much for buying this for me alex motioned toward the bag as he walked back to the gryffindor common room he shrugged just think of it as one of the many christmas and birthday presents i am yet to make up for he trailed off as alex stopped walking you donthave o buy me stuff because you feel guilty for not being there i not made at you because you werentthere when i was growing up she said blaise looked at his daughter and she suddenly reminded him more of hermione than ever i mad at myself alex for not being there when you were growing up alex looked down at her feet before realising they had actually stopped in front of the portrait of the fat lady password she said to them blaise told her the password and the portrait swung open alex however did not enter i still have some growing up to do she began looking at her father he smiled i know and at least i ll be there for that i really glad you came with me today he said and alex nodded yeah it was fun she began to climb through the portrait hole and blaise began to turn to leave hey dad she said and blaise turned back to face her thanks she finished off before climbing through to her common room blaise walked back to his room with a broad smile on his face and didnteven notice when hermione and ben entered the castle together as he made his way back to his room in the dungeons a n ok there chapter 8 hope u liked it if anyone has any ideas at all about what they would like to see in the stories near chapters pls feel free to tell me when you review luv emgurl disclaimer still dontown harry potter or anything from the book hey thanks for all your reviews they were great here the next chapter hermione granger felt slightly giddy as ben walker walked her back to her room the night after the day they had spent in hogsmeade together they had almost run into blaise in the entrance hall but hermione noticed he was too involved in his own thought to notice them she no longer felt guilty about spending the day with ben so when they got to her room hermione automatically invited him in they each sat on the burgundy coloured couch that was in front of hermione fireplace they were close so close that ben moved his arm around her waist so that they could be more comfortable hermione sighed she hadntfelt so relaxed so content for a long time now and for some strange reason she found she felt like this when she was with ben she rested her head against his shoulder eventually they both fell asleep together in front of the unlit fireplace as alex woke sunday morning she could hear the laughter come from the other beds she figured it was just natalie and jess she pulled her bed curtains back and found that both the girls were no longer in the dorm and the laughter was coming from sam and nicole she decided to ignore their laughter and instead went and showered and dressed in jeans and a pink and blue jumper hey guys she said entering the dorm again i think i going to see my mum we haventreally talked in a while sure nicole said be sure to tell riley aswell she finished off before the two girls dissolved in a fit of giggles again alex frowned at them but ignored what they had said she quickly exited the gryffindor common making sure no one stopped her to talk and made her way towards her mother office and room in the castle she knocked on the wooden door and waited for her mother to open it once she did alex found her mother in the same clothes she had on yesterday although they were slightly creased alex darling her mother said stepping out into the hallway closing the door behind her she kissed her daughter on the cheek mum she began noticing that she had not welcomed her into the room instead they were standing out in the hall hermione smiled at her daughter is everything alright she asked her yeah every thing fine i just thought i d come see you and we could talk and stuff alex replied now hermione asked uh i cantright now she looked at her watch i have to go meet your uncle ron she lied oh ok i guess we could just talk and catch up later alex said noticing her mothers lie she walked off and noticed that her mother quickly entered her room again instead of going to meet her uncle ron riley entered the owlry looking for his father white owl headwig e was so intent on looking for it hat he didntnotice her but when he did he felt himself blush she looked beautiful to him sitting next to a large black owl bent over scribbling in a light blue notebook alex he asked her head jerked up and he had clearly startled her but her face relaxed into a smile when she realised who it was riley she said as she ripped the page out the notebook and folded it up before attaching it to the owls leg riley couldnthelp but notice that it was address to logan and small hearts where next to the name he felt a stab of jealousy what he didntnotice though was that it also said georgie and that the hearts were purely for decoration what are you doing here she asked him causing him to look away from the letter they watched as the black owl flew off before riley answered her oh my dad he asked me to send this letter for him he looked down at the parchment in his hand but i cantfind our owl so i guess he ll just have to come back when hedwig returned alex looked at her watch hey its time for lunch would yo like to join me she asked him in a posh tone he laughed at her why not it not like i have anything else to do they entered the great hall to find sam draco jr and nicole all sitting together something which both of them found odd since nicole had never really talked to either of them before alex had started there riley felt malfoy smirk at him as they entered and sat down hey have you noticed that they ve all been acting a bit weird alex whispered to him as they sat riley nodded but was stopped by sam talking to alex before he could reply he was still thinking about the letter alex had just sent to logan her boyfriend he thought suddenly he wasntvery hungry but he grabbed a sandwich before excusing himself from the great hall i just remembered i said i d meet my mum in the library he lied as he exited his friends knew he was lying for ginny potter was sitting at the staff table talking to jessica weasley but none of them knew why he was lying alex ate her sandwich quickly and left her three friends at the table and headed for the astronomy tower for some reason she knew that was where he went hermione entered the great hall just as lunch was finishing and found ginny leaving gin she said i need to talk are you busy surprised that hermione had chosen her although they were now friends again ginny simply nodded her head and let hermione lead her to the school library they sat in armchairs that were separate from the rest of the library and ginny stared at hermione gin she began i think i think i have a problem ginny nodded before realising what hermione had actually just said wait what you hermione granger have a problem she asked almost laughing hermione nodded looking slightly miserable well what is it ginny asked her finally i think i falling for ben walker she murmured quietly but loud enough for ginny to hear her ginny looked at her friend what about blaise she whispered after everything they had been through ginny and the rest of the world knew that blaise and hermione were made for each other even if they didntknow it well that the problem since i ve seen him around i dontknow what it is it could just be because i haventseen him in so long but i think i still love him she said slowly but yesterday yesterday i spent the entire day with ben and we fell asleep together and it was just do fantastic and if forgot everything but then i remember the way blaise made me feel and i get so confused ginny looked at hermione she had stopped laughing now and looked seriously at her friend gin i dontknow what to do hermione wailed a tear forming in her eye oh hermione she said hugging her friend everything will work out riley could hear someone walking slowly up the stairs for some reason the last person he had expected it to be was alex but it was her hey she smiled i thought you were going to see your mum god he loved it when she smiled she seemed even more beautiful than she already was to him are you going to reply or just sit here like a rock his brain asked him and he realised she was still standing there waiting for an answer yeah i uh couldntfind my mum he lied hoping he sounded convincing she just laughed a laugh that made him smile because it as so sweet and seemed to light up the room she has a boyfriend remember the voice in his head stated suddenly he frowned and alex stopped laughing what up she asked sitting down beside him riley just shrugged nothing he said as he put his head in his hands ok if i tell you my problem will you tell me yours she asked poking his arm he looked at her maybe my mum alex began lied to me this morning it was the first time she ever lied to me and i dontknow why maybe she planning something to surprise you he suggested what surprise me by spending the night with professor walker she said sarcastically what riley asked surprised at what he had just heard you know i really though my mum my mum was still in love with my dad the way he is still in love with her she said standing up as tears began to form in her eyes it wasntsupposed to be like this you know riley nodded as he watched the girl begin to break down he stood up we were meant to come back and i d meet my dad and then my mum she would realise how much she still loved him and we d just be a normal happy family she broke in to tears riley stepped closer to her and put his arms around her shoulders he had to hug her he didntknow what else to do sometimes things dontwork out as you plan them he whispered into her ear as he pulled her closer she rested her head against his shoulder and felt his arms tighten around her waist after a moment riley pulled away from her i sorry riley said looking into alex eyes he brushed the tears away that were still on her cheek for what alex whispered as she took a step closer to him riley took a step back and looked to the ground um i have to go he said not making eye contact with her he walked toward the door and left alex standing in the spot where he left her as he made his way down the stairs and back to the gryffindor common room riley he heard a voice call after him not now jess he said before walking into his dorm draco malfoy jr was sitting on his bed reading the letter his mother had sent him when riley entered the dorm he put down the picture of his parents and his two younger sisters and watched his friend as he paced the area next to his bed riley what wrong mate have a little fight with your girlfriend as much as draco liked his friend he enjoyed teasing him even more shut up malfoy she not my girlfriend he snapped draco smirked it was the same identical smirk that he had inherited from his father although it was softened from his mother ok no really what wrong he asked genuinely concerned this time riley looked at his friend trying ot figure out if he should tell him or if he did tell him it would lead to more teasing he decided to tell him he checked to make sure that only he and draco were in the room i guess i like alex he said please tell me something the world doesntknow already draco said sarcastically ok i ll shut up he said when riley looked at him well that it pretty much that and she has a boyfriend which is hwy i keep telling you she is not my girlfriend nothing is going on or will be gong on riley finished she told you she had a boyfriend draco asked getting up off his bed well no but she does i mean remember that night when she came in crying that was because i kissed her so she was upset because i kissed her because she has a boyfriend riley said unsure of what he was actually saying but hopefully he sounded convincing riley she might not have been crying form that girls their a bit weird when it comes to their feelings she might have been crying form some completely different reason draco said if she really has a boyfriend at her old school it could ruin our halloween plans he thought to himself riley didntreply as draco looked at his watch hey i gotta go i told sam i d help her with some homework and he left the boys dorms alex stayed in the astronomy tower for at least an hour after riley had left she didntunderstand what was going on she didntunderstand why had left like that when once they were here he had so willingly kissed her but you didntkiss him back she reminded herself you left just like he did she sighed why do i even care because you like him and you wanted to kiss him back a soft but familiar voice said in her head she shook her head slightly not true i do not like riley potter the first voice said you do you cantdeny it i know everything the second voice replied she sighed she could keep on denying it in her head but it was true she did like him she liked the way he put his head in his hands when he was frustrated and the tone he used when he was speaking to jess she like the way he smiled and the way he laughed but most of all she liked the way how she felt safe when she was around riley the only other people she had ever felt safe with was her mother and now her father but with riley it was a different kind of safe it felt more secure but dangerous at the same time she didntunderstand it blaise watched as the three gryffindor students rushed into the library and sat in the furthest corner so that no one could hear them he however could hear them as he was standing behind the bookshelf closet to the table and they had not noticed him as they sat he hadntmeant to eavesdrop on their conversation but when he heard his daughters name he couldnthelp it nicole does alex have a boyfriend draco malfoy jr asked her blaise held his breathe as he waited for the redhead to answer not that i know of she said blaise let out a gasp of relief and continued to look though the books what about that logan guy though the one that kissing her in the picture sam the brunette girl said questioningly she might have just forgot to mention it blaise listened again alex had seemed so innocent when he was with her and the fact that now she might have a boyfriend was unnerving blaise he watched as nicole nodded in agreement well then i guess we ll just have to break them up then draco stated as he went to get up shouldntwe find out if riley right though i mean logan might not be her boyfriend he is her best friends brother so we might have all just gotten the wrong message nicole said as she stood up aswell yeah she right i mean it kind of pointless breaking up two people who arenteven together sam said as draco nodded ok you two find out then he said and the three of them exited the library still not noticing the pale blaise who was imagining his daughter with a boy suddenly he felt sick to his stomach alex had returned to the gryffindor common and was sitting near the window pretending to read a book when riley came down from his dorm she watched him as he looked her but turned away as he went and sat in the chair opposite her alex he said brightly she looked over the top of the book but didntspeak luckily though nicole sam and malfoy entered and made their way over to where the two of them were sitting before he could speak again hey guys sam said what you doing riley didntspeak actually i was trying to read before this annoying git decided to come sit with me alex replied where did that come from she asked herself as riley looked at her the other three choose to ignore the tension between the two and sat down potter you wouldntmind moving next to granger so i could sit with my gorgeous girlfriend draco asked forcing riley to move oh dontbother you can both sit here i gong to bed alex offered before making her way up to her own dormitory leaving the four staring at her once in her room she scrambled into her pyjamas and then beneath her sheets before pulling the curtains across her bed she had no idea why she hadntstayed there and why she had snapped at riley but as she fell asleep she forgot everything a n ok kind of crappy ending but i couldntthink of anything else to write hoped you enjoy review again luv emgurl
