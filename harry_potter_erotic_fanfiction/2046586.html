 chapter ten lily was sitting in the common room at a large bay window watching the rain outside slowly begin to fall a developing storm on the way james enjoyed watching her in this simple elegance green eyes in a dreamy daze her mouth was not ranting about potions or rebuking him about pranks but unmoving her knees pulled up to her chest her long red hair in an unfinished braid in a tank top and pajama pants her casual beauty was overwhelming hi there lily flower he said walking up behind her she jumped obviously startled by his presence oh hey she said with a small smile now what is a beautiful girl like you doing inside on a day like this he said sarcastically then he looked out the window and chuckled she laughed and i done teaching you since you re going to ace this next exam i figured i d just take some time to myself you know just sit back and watch mother nature and father time work their wonder she said turning again to look wistfully out the window damn james thought she is so amazing lily can i say something sure well i just wanted to say uh thanks for helping me along with potions and stuff she then stood and ruffled his hair aw no problem james then she turned to leave but he caught her hand gently she turned back and their eyes locked they both knew that this was the first time she had used his first name without a swear word following it james huh he said with a raised eyebrow yeah it your name isntit she said innocently well i kinda thought i was doomed to be potter forever he stood and refused to let go of her hand look i figured since we were going to be studying for a while together maybe we could talk civilly and i guess i needed to start why are you making such a big deal out of this she said with a smile i dunno he said entwining his fingers with hers it jut sounds so much better coming from your lips he said looking intently down at her as she smiled up at him he tipped her chin with his thumb and pulled her closer hey dontget all mushy on me mr perfect quidditch player she said quietly but smiling putting a warning hand on his chest whoa she thought didntknow he was so rock solid never he said then winked and dropped her hand anyways i dontknow about you but i kinda tired she started walking towards the girls dorms when she turned around suddenly good luck on the exam tomorrow then she humbly turned away again sweet dreams lily flower he called after her she looked over her shoulder and smiled sweet dreams james only of you he said and she blushed before she disappeared behind the door james then turned and walked no floated back to the boys dorm his heart pounding madly the entire way she called me james he whispered to himself failing to wipe the goofy grin from his face so are you going to come down to surrey over the summer for that eagles concert lily asked she and nancy were in the common room laying on their backs with their heads hanging off the edge off the couches across from each other they had both made it through exams today and they were both relieved hell yeah said nancy wouldntmiss it for the world the eagles rock for muggle music anyway yes if i hadntintroduced you to the wonderful world of good ol muggle rock n roll you d still be listening to hex me vex me by the deadly doxies lily said hey they re good said nancy sitting up in protest yeah for a ten year old lily said with a giggle throwing a pillow across the room at her and you know that the eagles are better than that now this is undeniable no one is better than the eagles then she paused be fore she grinned at lily you know my favorite song right lily smiled before they both began singing in harmony suddenly the common room doors burst open causing lily to lose her seating and fall on the floor she looked up with hair in her face to see james in the doorway with a paper in his hands what going on james she asked as she pulled her hair away and tried to stand he marched across the room and up to her there was an urgency in his face that lily didntunderstand and the fear inside her rose is something the matter she asked as he took a few deep breaths to gain his composure from running i cannot believe it he said breathlessly what wrong james she asked in concern putting a hand on his arm her distress however was suddenly tossed to the wind when he picked her up by her waist and spun her around laughing loudly what the said nancy watching the both of them skeptically james what on earth is going on she said with a giggle in her voice the blush in her cheeks disappearing as he released her oh my lily flower i just passed my potions exam really oh my gosh she wrapped her arms around his neck and hugged him tightly pulling back just enough to see the excited sparkle in his eyes and the joyful smile on his face it amazed her how someone could change when they really wanted to and that smile wow nancy said obviously impressed it a big change isntit the voice of peter came up behind them along with remus and sirius lily suddenly pulled away embarrassed of her public show of affection to the one she hated the most or did she our little boy is all growing up and passing classes sirius said pretending to wipe a tear oh go fly off a cliff black nancy said venomously sirius looked intently at nancy with a charming smile and with deep voice said looking good nancy nancy in turn raised an eye brow and a middle finger and with that remus peter and sirius turned to leave come on mate we re going to pin malfoy and snape to a tree sirius said you go ahead fellas james said waving a hand at them have fun without me remus turned and raised an eyebrow huh james favorite thing to do was to pick on the two slimy slytherins that or spend time with lily for being such a wonderful effective and beautiful teacher i must insist on buying you a drink at hogsmeade he said to lily with his outstretched hand friendly smile and probing eyes lily was shocked she wasntsurprised by the offer but it was so flattering she looked behind james to see nancy with raised eyebrows mouth gaping if you insist she said reluctantly though she took his hand with a smile he began dragging her out of the common room and she waved to nancy leaving her and the three marauders in silenced shock yes i insist he said then they were gone and there was a long moment of silence nancy was the first to speak did did lily just agree to go out for a drink with james potter i believe she did nancy said remus solemnly i believe she did all three boys shook their heads as they headed for the quidditch pitch nancy suddenly ran past them i have to find jenny a n there you go kids that all for today i love hearing from you guys your reviews mean the world to me so be sure to let me know what you think and hopefully we ll get back to the grand finale wink huggles edit 5 11 2005 withdrew eagle lyrics to witchy woman due to new rules chapter thirty three hey there lily flower lily looked up with a smile at the sound of james melodious greeting as he bounded up to her loudly still wearing is quidditch uniform he looked around the corner of the bookshelf in the library and lily shhh ed him sternly james what are you doing here she whispered though she was so happy to see him she didntreally care arentyou supposed to be practicing with the team nah we just finished and i wanted to see

of our last year no way would i miss it well good i thought i was going to have to convince you to come but alas now i donthave to like you could try lily said daringly of course i could i d just have to tickle you into submission first james said raising his eye brows suggestively dontyou dare lily shrieked putting up her hands in defense of his hands but failing terribly he began tickling her sides her laughter filling the library he finally pulled her out of the chair wriggling and giggling then he suddenly ducked underneath the table she was sitting at as the librarian walked around the corner again with hands on her hips looking at lily crossly be quiet you re in the library she whispered fiercely sorry lily whispered the old lady disappeared around the corner again james then stood and laughed silently earning a smack from lily you get me in trouble like that she said shaking a finger in his face and you ll what he said quietly looking down at her intently with a smile and pulling her closer resting his hands on her hips lily felt her heart begin to pound heavily in her chest giving her the desire to pull away but then she thought of remus oh i have my ways of torture lily said in a giggle as she subtly ran her tongue over her lips yes you do james said in a chuckle squeezing her sides once more making her wiggle well i sure i smelly enough right now so i off to take a shower i ll see you around lily flower then he turned to leave james she said catching his hand and pulling him back wait he looked back at her curiously squeezing her hand come here she whispered with a smile and leaning closer to him gathering all the courage she had she gently placed a hand on his jaw stood on her tip toes and kissed him it was longer than she had intended giving into more desire and passion than she had planned but it thrilled her as he returned her kiss fervently so much that she didntwant it to end when she did finally pull away his hazel eyes were sparkling she had no voice because her heart was still pounding madly um well i just she stammered then she looked up at him with a shy smile good luck tomorrow james she said james couldnthelp the grin that grew on his face well i appreciate that lily i really do then he winked and ran out of the library breathe lily came a voice from behind her true she was having a hard time breathing but as she sat in her chair again she smiled at remus who came around the corner of bookshelf i very proud of you lily remus said good because that took a lot of guts i didntthink i had lily told him come on i ll buy you a drink for a job well done remus chuckled jenny was sitting alone in the library watching lily and remus walk out her pulse increased as lily suddenly looked back over her shoulder at her jenny gave a friendly smile and waved to her surprise lily smiled and waved before leaving the library deep in conversation with remus jenny went back to her book pretending to study and preparing for the n e w t s though no test could dampen her moods now she was well on her way to having her best friend back of course she had alice but she was too busy scheming to get frank to fall in love with her and jenny knew that she deserved the cold shoulder she was getting from lily she had completely explained to both jenny and alice exactly why she could not go out with james and then what a royal mess that turned out to be friendships breaking and jealous men even though jenny was grateful that her friendship was soon on the mend but there was only one jealous man and that was james the one that jenny had tried to interest was her best friend and he was in no way jealous she had failed jen speak of the devil she thought hey travis jenny said without looking up after he raced up and sat down next to her he looked at her peculiarly she then looked back at him and her breath caught in her throat his sandy hair was damp and dis shelved his face and arms glistening with sweat travis was still donned in his quidditch uniform which shaped his tan and toned body perfectly she looked into his crystal blue eyes and felt her heart melt if only she could belong to him how did you know it was me he asked quizzically i could smell you coming she giggled as he raised one massive arm and sniffed is it really that bad he said with a crooked smile making jenny laugh no travis i just know your voice we ve been best friends forever it seems then why did it take me forever to realize what an amazing person you are travis thought i know you re voice i know you she said simply travis smiled and scooted closer to her kissing her sweetly on the cheek that you do my friend you are the only who knows me with her heart beating furiously in her chest at such close proximity to him she pulled back and looked up at him curiously he was acting so strange like he didntcare if people saw him acting like a normal person instead of the facade of travis king that they all saw so tell me dear wife why is it that you claim to know me so well and yet i cannot say the same thing about you what are you talking about she asked you re my best friend you know everything about me i dontknow why you went out with potter he said pointedly james she asked with a funny smile travis that was so long ago why are you bringing that up because i just curious about that aspect of your life he said with a shrug of his shoulders he interested in who i date jenny wondered of course not just answer his stupid question well guys dontnormally ask out girls like me so when james asked me i was flattered and readily accepted jenny said and that would have been the total truth under different circumstances she thought what do you mean girls like me travis asked looking at her intently guys dontnormally ask out beautiful smart spunky girls like you that doesntsounds right to me jen travis said tucking a stray strand of her blond hair from her face behind her ear well jenny said in a shaky voice believe what you want but i not exactly a guy magnet travis i the kind of girl you can study with or play quidditch with not the girl you hold affectionately and snog in a dark corner jenny turned away from travis trying to swallow the tears in her eyes this was hitting way too close to home for her especially talking directly to him about how she felt about him too bad he too stupid to realize it that not totally true travis said yes it is travis jenny said with a forced smile alright that enough i refuse to let you talk about my wife like that travis said as he stood come on travis you know it true even you you are totally un charmed by me as you are my best friend and not my boy friend she said pointedly no worries jen all of that will soon be remedied travis said with a mischievous smile including that little part about me not being your boyfriend he didntsay what are you talking about jenny asked with a exasperated sigh well let just say i know a guy who would love to hold you affectionately and snog you senseless in a dark corner jenny suddenly dropped the book she was holding and looked up at him unbelievingly who she demanded no no dear wife all will soon be revealed i need to pull a few strings but i think i can make it work jenny stood and shaking her head with a smile picked up her book then she kissed travis on the cheek but lingered closely in his face as she looked up into his bright blue eyes thanks for caring so much travis she whispered with a smile now go take a shower you smell then she left the library with a giggle yup travis grinned i can definitely make it work then he turned and headed for the common room to the dorms where he would take a shower a very cold shower a n aw such cuteness gah i know ya ll hate travis but i think that jenny and travis make the cutest couple review please huggles all ps i think i ve become obsessed with all this fan fiction writing because over the past few days i ve gotten like 4 different story ideas some like one shot things which i will be posting on my one shot fic thread thing and a few others i might just start randomly so keep checking up on my name cause they re coming soon grin is very excited a n halleluiah chorus we re here grin enjoy chapter forty the grand finale lily pushed up the trophy room door with a slow creek to reveal james looking very melancholy sitting alone at table with a single candle he was examining his quidditch cup trophy quietly in the dark room and did not look up at the sound of the opening door hello james she said with a smile standing in the doorway he looked up at her in surprise but his solemn expression did not change hullo lily he said quietly and it pierced her heart the fact that she hadntheard lily flower in a while hurt and she wondered if he still felt the same for her or if her attempt to find him and confess her feelings were in vain do you mind if i stay in here for a while she asked and he shrugged she sighed as she turned to examine the trophies all along the wall it hard to believe that the school year almost over our educational careers are now ending she said wistfully not that you care of course i mean you re probably jumping for joy to get away from this place and never see it again lily laughed no not really james muttered placing his trophy back in its spot and sulkily walking from the room lily was puzzled but followed anyhow what you ve got to be kidding james potter was never happy in school but you dontlook very happy right now regardless lily said trying to catch up with hi and she could see the sadness on his face james are you okay you dontlook well she said in concern though he did not slow his pace i mean maybe you should go see madame pomfrey and no he said forcefully what the matter james lily begged almost running to keep up with him you re not your happy normal playful self lately you need to tell me what wrong when he didntstop or turn lily became frustrated she stormed past him putting her hands on her hips stopping him in his tracks as she stood before him looking up into his sad confused face why wontyou talk to me she asked softly her pleading eyes probing his to know what was bothering him so he opened his mouth to speak and lily felt a surge of hope within her as she saw a flicker of resolve in his beautiful hazel eyes but only before he turned away and closed his eyes because i can t was the easiest explanation then he brushed past her well why not lily said tears welling p in her eyes and she folded her arms across her chest because i love you he said whirling around to face her i love you lily i always have his voice was soft now as he slowly walked back to her after growing up with you seeing you every day practically for the past seven years how could i not in every class around every corner there you are this vision of beauty and perfection that close enough for me to touch close enough to befriend but too far away for me to love too unattainable and it breaks my heart to have it happen everyday but the thought of leaving here not being able to see you every day is a living hell i dontwant to have to go through just that thought takes all the excitement and happiness from my soul because the only time i ever happy is when i with you then he cupped her chin gently and smiled my lily flower i love you so much then lily smiled and james wiped away the tear that slid down her cheek and i dontcare about the prophesy that stupid ridiculous prophesy i d rather live a short life with you than a long life without you and you know i cantlive without you i love you too much no i decided a long time ago when a sassy little red head named lily evans reprimanded me in olivander all those years ago i knew that i would never let anything stop me from winning her heart not travis not any prophesy nothing would ever stop me from loving you lily now had tears streaming down her face but that didntstop the smile from appearing or the giggle that erupted as she threw her arms around his neck oh james she said through laughter and sniffles then she pulled back and looked into his confused yet hopeful face i love you too then james grinned yes he cheered loudly picking her up by the waist and lily squealed delightedly as he spun her around then placing her back on the ground he kissed her not of wanton passion or misplaced affection but a kiss of true love no more secrets no more restrictions everything revealed all love admitted with no fear of the future this kiss was one that was long awaited not only for both lily and james but practically everyone in the school be it the best friends or people who had placed bets long ago about how long it would take these two arguing fools to find themselves in each others arms when he finally pulled back he simply held her body to his relishing the closeness oh lily you have no idea how happy i am lily only giggled well i pretty pleased myself i hoped you would be james grinned well what do we do now lily asked pulling away how about you go to the ball with me he asked i d love to james she said placing a quick kiss on his lips he smiled as he watched her turn and primp her reflection in a large mirror down the corridor but something caught his eye well well well james said turning her to face him what this he fingered the necklace that hung from around her neck and she grinned she had hoped he would recognize it it was the silver and emerald necklace he had given her for christmas his mothers necklace this was a gift from a very good friend i ve worn it ever since lily said simply james could only smile almost tearfully as he held her face with both hands and kissed her again she fervently responded placing her arms around his neck she needed him to know how desperately she needed him in her life no matter how short it may be she let her fingers explore his dark messy tresses and after she twirled a finger around one lock of hair she playfully tugged on it before pulling away seriously lily you ve got me so stimulated right now if we didnthave to go to this ball i d carry you up to my bedroom right this second and james lily shrieked with a giggle ah what the hell we need a good snogging session right here and now he said and before lily could protest not that she wanted to james had pushed her up against the wall and placed a fierce kiss on her lips lily returned his kiss ardently holding him close before his mouth left hers and he trailed hot moist kisses down her neck ah such heaven was james potter kiss yes giving in was far better than fighting love but she knew that should she give in too much they might not make it back to the dance tonight james she muttered in an attempt to slow his kisses but instantly his demanding and fiery kiss was on her lips again silencing anything else she might have said lily did not doubt that james could make her understand the true meaning of utter bliss in his arms and with the feel of his hands up and down the side of her body part of her wanted to completely forget the dance and simply let him ravish her too bad you re responsible said an overpowering side of her mind james she said between his kisses trying to stop herself from accepting them james james mmmm lily lily lily he murmured against her lips before teasingly coaxing her mouth into another rousing sensual kiss lily pressed herself against him eagerly kissing him back wanting nothing more than to let him carry her up to his bedroom and james she finally said with a smile ripping herself from his arms oh no you don t get back here i not done yet he said a dark look in his eyes and a mischievous grin on his face she put a hand on his chest to stop him we re head boy and girl james we have to go to the dance then you shouldnttouch me like that love he said moving her hand aside and kissing her once more come on lily giggled taking his hand and pulling him towards the great hall i guess i ll just have to ravish you some other time he muttered making lily laugh remus was standing by the food table gulping down a glass of pumpkin juice nervously the ball was coming to a quick close only a few more songs remaining and he was torn you better end this night right lily had told him oh how he wanted to joselynn was the one girl he had secretly admired and adored for the past seven years and he wanted more than anything to kiss her mouth raw but it was that vicious mind set that kept him from her how could he kiss her lead her onto thinking there could be something more when he knew that there never could be even is she did accept for being a monster which he knew she wouldn t how could he jeopardize her safety by pursuing a relationship beyond friendship there you are remus turned quickly to see joselynn approaching hey he said with a forced smile if i didntknow any better i d say you were avoiding me she giggled never he gave a charming smile then took her hand kissing it quickly then he moved to sit on a chair but she tugged on his hand to stand beside her you ve got something on your face she said with a low chuckle then licking her thumb she smeared away whatever was on his face she is so cruel he thought she stood there smiling up into his eyes waiting for him to do something then she closed her eyes making his heart lurch oh hw he wanted to kiss her to taste her perfect mouth with his and he leaned in about to relent but seeing the shine of the moonlight through the open windows on the dance floor he sighed and turned away come on let dance he said in a reluctant whisper taking her hand and leading her to the dance floor before he pulled her into his arms he caught a look at her confused face and it only caused more guilt to swell in his heart he pulled her close enough so that he wouldnthave to look at her angelic face filled with confusion remus can i ask you something she said boldly pulling back to look up at him remus sighed of course why did you ask me to the ball she said locking eyes with him because because i like you joselynn he said nervously how do you like me as a friend or more remus shook his head with a weary smile and cupped her beautiful face with one hand much more josey he said in a rough voice so you like me and you ask me to be your date but you wontkiss me remus grinned sadly oh how he loved this girl she said exactly what she thought regardless of propriety or anyone feelings it really more complicated than that joselynn well explain it to me it not something easily explained i mean there just something you dontknow about me he said regretfully are you ever going to tell me she said in a hurt voice maybe someday i will when things change she nodded and looked away it not because i donttrust you josey because i do it just that i dontwant to scare you they had long since stopped dancing now they simply stood in the middle of the dance floor and he was looking down at her affectionately holding her face in his hands she looked at him in utter confusion all right she said finally with a firm nod trying to be strong through her tears i so sorry josey he whispered then kissing her lovingly on the forehead he walked out of the great gall leaving her alone oh no james lily exclaimed as they reentered the great hall hand in hand it five minutes till midnight this is the last song she suddenly felt his arms go around her waist and she smiled as he pulled her closer then we ll just have to make the best of it wontwe he said in a low voice with a wide grin then taking on of her hands in his own and placing the other one on his shoulder he began to sway the to the slow music after james spun her out once lily couldnthelp but smile mr potter you surprise me i never would have guessed you of all people would know how to dance miss evans my mother was a very wise woman james said gliding skillfully to the beat when i was young she taught me many things like how to behave how to be a gentleman even how to cook but she told me the easiest way to charm a lady is through dance then he slowly dipped her before bringing her back up into his arms and how many women have you charmed by way of dance mr potter a few he chuckled earning a soft smack and a gasp from lily but the only girl i want is right here in my arms he smiled down at her lovingly placing a kiss on her nose lily grinned and leaned her head on his massive chest closing her eyes and relishing the closeness they shared until the end of the song a n so

three broomsticks she stood to greet him with a hug and a kiss hello my dear lily flower he smiled mischievously taking his seat all right what all this about james she asked i need to get back to the office mr nichols doesntlike me being gone to long you know if i was in that man shoes i wouldntlet you out of my sight for very long either lily blushed but you re not now tell me what going on be patient two butter beers please he told the waitress and she walked away we may be legal age to drink lily but that will always remain my favorite drink i whole heartedly agree lily smiled and two butter beers were placed in front of them here to overage butter beer drinking james chuckled lifting his glass here here lily giggled clinking her glass with his after james took a long swig of his drink and let out a large breath he looked over at lily with total seriousness so you remember that article in the daily prophet about pulling all the aurors out of the field outrageous and completely unnecessary lily said firmly yeah i feel the same way but i already talked to fudge yesterday and he said he not going to budge on this one bloody idiot lily muttered indeed james smiled but he told me while i studying he ll have a job for me as his assistant well that was nice of him but was that your big news lily asked impatiently no just wait james smiled then he grew serious once more i was talking with remus the other day and he had just spoken to dumbledore about the situation lily nodded well it seems that more than one person disagree with the minister some are ministry members others not but dumbledore trying to get them all together some sort of secret meeting being held to discuss the protection of the wizarding world because the minister is refusing to do so how intriguing lily said who all is going to be there i not really sure but i do know that both sirius and remus were going plus those two ministry members arthur weasley and alastor moody are going to be there i mean they re not quitting they re jobs but apparently they also believe that the minister isntbeing sufficient enough and that moody guy i tell you what he has a mouth like no other swearing like a sailor with an attitude to boot maybe not a crack pot old fool after all lily snickered well i only met him the other day but i guess he all right james said dumbledore the one trying to get the whole thing organized and the marauders are going so i was hoping his voice trailed off you were hoping lily asked you wanna come with me lily grinned as his smile still acting like a shy school boy of course james i d love to completely agree with the cause whew james said in relief kissing her cheek and sitting back in his seat i was afraid you d be livid voldemort killed my parents james and now he after my life of all people i will be there of course just tell me when and where it planned for december 17th and this weasley guy has a giant house out in the middle of nowhere so they thought it was perfect when he offered it great we ll be there you know i hear that he some kind of muggle nut so you two will get along nicely i sure james chuckled oh ha ha lily smirked as she stood thanks for the drink darling but i ve got to be getting back to work she leaned over to kiss him quickly but he placed a hand on her neck holding her close for a much longer thorough kiss james lily giggled in his kiss not in public i dontcare if everyone in the world knows how much i love you lily flower james said sweetly placing one more kiss on her lips and she smiled at him besides if you d prefer we not do this in public we can get a room i say this calls for a good snogging session i ll come over tonight love i promise she said in parting you re cruel you know that he called after her in a pout yes i do know but you love me anyway she grinned at him over her shoulder then disappeared out into the town indeed james smiled to himself lily and james showed up almost late for the meeting at the burrow and were greeted by unfamiliar faces eventually they found not only remus and sirius but alice and frank all huddled in a corner it appeared that they were the youngest of all the people in attendance aside from the three red headed children that look under ten running around the house they all greeted and chatted on as dumbledore made his way to the front of the large room everyone grew silent as he cleared his throat welcome one and all dumbledore began thank you all for your interest and for coming tonight though i must also thank arthur for his willingness to be of service and opening his home to all of us tonight i see many familiar faces he nodded towards a group of older people and many of my pride and joy from hogwarts are here as well he winked at the younger crowd who smiled broadly whoever you may be you have come to answer the threat of lord voldemort many men cringed at the name and many women gasped dumbledore arthur hissed from the front row would you mind not saying his name oh do forgive me arthur i apologize dumbledore corrected himself the threat of the dark lord it ridiculous said the groggily voice of alastor moody fudge is so worried about protecting our world yet he takes out our one source of protection with no one to keep him at bay he ll go on a rampage killing anything and everything he wants lily said loudly in a firm voice he relentless and he doesntcare about anything but his goal of clearing out all dirt blood and taking over thank you for your input little girl said a grumpy voice from the back of the room but who invited the nursery there were a few light chuckles but lily was red faced and fuming before she could let out a slew of well chosen words for the impertinent man arthur weasley stood do hold your tongue sturgis especially when you dontknow what you re talking about arthur nodded towards lily and she beamed grinning gratefully come now arthur said the man named sturgis podmore who had a square jaw and looked no more than ten years older you know just as well as i do that this girl is fresh out of hogwarts what could she possibly know about you know who plenty more than you or i is certain sturgis the man in the back only snorted as arthur continued this little girl is lily evans and she has twice in her short life come face to face with you know who most recently a month go when her parents were murdered and she was kidnapped from her very home that her he asked in shock and others turned to look at lily in disbelief yes mr podmore it was i lily retorted she couldnttake it any longer inches mere seconds from death both times she took james hand in her own then and held it firmly you know who has confided in me his deepest darkest secrets for world domination thinking i would take it to my grave but instead i barely made it out by the skin of my teeth so as you can see i may be more dependable than you thought i i didntknow sturgis stammered well hopefully you ll learn not to make judgements according to age mr podmore indeed miss evans he smiled but i also learned not to upset a fiery little red head like yourself my head may be bitten off as a result everyone chuckled then and lily couldnthelp but smile indeed mr podmore forgive me miss evans and dumbledore i apologize please continue not a problem sturgis miss evans dumbledore said a twinkle in his eye as he smiled at lily yes we must proceed though i must stress to all of you the seriousness of this situation miss evans experience for example after most muggle killings or attacks most do not come out alive miss evans is very lucky to be alive though she should feel safe and welcome in such good company then james squeezed her hand and she smiled but it is also one of the very reasons for this meeting with less active aurors not only our world but the muggle world is at risk of attacks and will become threat to vol to you know who there have already been too much evidence to the muggles of our existence we re getting too close becoming exposed and discovered that a risk we simply cannot take and it not only the muggles we re worried about here arthur interjected because i am a pureblood going back generations but i am no where near becoming a follower of you know who i would never want any harm to come to anyone in our world or the muggles most of you know i quite fond of them and i study them there were light chuckles and lily was surprised she thought james had simply been teasing her but i feel at risk of an attack myself and if that something i can prevent by joining in ranks with all of you then i feel like that a necessity to protect my family in the least indeed thank you arthur dumbledore said that is the very cause of this meeting if the ministry refuses to offer us the protection we need and deserve then he leaves us no choice but to take it into our own hands it must stay secret not only from the public but also from the ministry are we all clear lily looked around in surprise as everyone in the room including both arthur and moody the ministry members nodded firmly lily nodded in solemn agreement very good now let continue oh lily alice sighed dreamily i never would have imagined i could be this happy i know what you mean lily grinned of course you ve got james but frank he so perfect i mean no one perfect but he s perfectly imperfect what on earth are you talking about lily giggled well i dontknow he not drop dead gorgeous and for that i glad he a little shy and less refined than i would have liked but lily when he holds me or looks in my eyes and tells me he loves me that just makes up for everything lily smiled yes james also had his flaws maybe he was too rowdy and also less than polished to say the least but she could hold nothing against him when she was in his arms oh lily you ll never believe it alice said lowering her voice just yesterday he brought up the m word what word is that menstrual make out no alice smiled then leaned over and whispered marriage lily gasped did he really yes he really did there suddenly tears of joy in alice and she tried to swallow them but the excitement overcame her oh lily i love him so much and i cantthink of anything that would make me happier oh alice lily smiled surprised at the tears that had suddenly stung in her eyes as she pulled her dear friend into a hug i so happy for you dontget happy just yet he only mentioned it then he blushed and changed the subject because hadntrealized what he d said oh but if he didntmean for you to hear about it yet maybe he has big plans for you i hope so and they both quietly squealed with delight and what all the ruckus about over here lily and alice turned to see frank walking towards them and lily stood to greet him with a hug oh nothing lily smiled just girl talk idle gossip secret here and there well i hate to pull alice away from her very bestest friend frank said in his best impersonation of a girly voice but i do have to get her home to her parents or they might think i up to no good well i ll let you take her now lily told him then leaned in to whisper but next time i see you two you better not have ant more secrets and there better be a big surprise that belongs on her left ring finger frank looked at lily in shock and lily almost laughed when his face turned red and it true james can vouch for me when i say sometimes being up to no good isntso bad then with a grin on her face she waved goodbye to them both as they walked to the large fireplace and floo ed home lily then scanned the room for james because it was indeed getting late and lily was tired after such a long meeting she finally spotted him standing by the wall talking to arthur and molly yes fudge used to be a wise old man arthur was saying but age has finally caught up with him lily smiled as she walked up to them they all laughed remembering the earlier comments about age in the meeting and her pulse sped as james wrapped his arm around her waist you of all people should know miss evans age holds no boundaries arthur said genially well maybe a few molly said poking her husband in the side suddenly two young red headed boys ran by bill charlie molly said sternly the two boys stopped instantly almost toppling all over each other what did i tell you about running through the house when we have company she reprimanded mum bill was chasing me with one of dad exploding contraptions i didntwant him to blow my arse off said the younger boy charlie molly almost shouted in embarrassment arthur pulled both his sons aside and quietly escorted them to their bedroom as they made their way however they gently shoved each other muttering things like tattle tail prat and git under their breaths great kids james chuckled i would love to have a few as rowdy as that they are a handful molly said shifting a red head on her hip especially when arthur keeps his muggle artifacts all over the house and sets such a bad example for them as you can see no ma am james argued those are the kind of kids i would love to have wild and crazy just like me and who is this lily inquired about the sleeping baby ah this blessed child in percy he not nearly as bad as those two were thank heavens when arthur returned from the boys bedroom lily smiled i wanted to thank you for what you said earlier mr weasley you donteven know me yet you stood up for me and i was very grateful i was about to let out a few words that i know my parents would not have approved of oh but sometimes they re necessary he smiled and please call me arthur if we re going to be together in this fight for our lives we must dismiss such formalities i arthur and this is my wife molly pleased to meet you both lily smiled and is this your husband molly asked referring to james james lily asked incredulously oh no ma am not yet anyway james interrupted and lily felt her heart melt as she gently squeezed her side very nice james arthur chuckled i must tell you molly lily said trying to change the subject i do love your house it so homey and original will all our meetings be held here well thank you dear molly blushed slightly i not sure about all of our meetings but you all are welcome over any time you wish i ve decided to have a chat with dumbledore and moody and we ll come up with the name and regular meeting times and places it should all be owled to you shortly arthur said to james very well james replied are you ready lily flower oh i couldntpossibly leave she grinned everything about this place makes me feel right at home because there is nothing homey about living with petunia she thought bitterly oh lily dear i ve just had the most wonderful idea molly started gushing suddenly you should come over tomorrow for tea and we can plan a little christmas gathering for our new little group here that sounds terrific lily said arthur can we please molly turned to her husband batting eye lashes beggingly well i dontsee why not molly dear he grinned down at her kissing her quickly oh lily you must come over tomorrow we can have this party ready in no time and just out of curiostiy arthur began your parents may they rest in peace they were muggles correct yes sir wonderful if you wouldntmind i d like to ask you a few questions for research purposes of course maybe tomorrow when you stop in of course oh lily dontlisten to him molly chuckled he been going on about this new found rubber duck for days lily smiled then bid them all farewell what a charming family lily thought then before she stepped into the fireplace to floo herself home she turned to james tell me james what exactly did you mean when arthur asked if you were my husband she asked him tenderly just what i meant lily flower he smiled and kissed her lovingly i not your husband as of yet that all lily smiled as she stepped into the fireplace that was just the answer she wanted to hear a n this calls for a party i ve

audibly though there was no one around to hear him he was admiring the little item that was glittering in his grip it made him excited and yet solemn as his mind was consumed of lily the thought of spending the rest of his life with her filled him with content happiness everything he wanted his future his life was symbolized in what he held in his hand the silver engagement ring one diamond and two little emeralds sparkling in the light yes he had bought the rig the perfect wedding ring for lily after frank and alice marriage became so real and so soon it brought to james attention how short life really was he wanted lily in his life part of it with him and she wasntyet not permanently that was something in james mind that needed to be remedied soon james sat up and reached for the small hand mirror on his coffee table he grinned as he looked once again at the ring in hand then turned once again to the mirror and very clearly said sirius after a few moments and one bright flash there were many different voices that could be heard but sirius smug smirk could be seen through the glass of the mirror you rang sirius said i did indeed james chuckled and right on time too guess who i ve got here with me sirius said then ducked from view and another familiar marauder appeared evening prongs what are you up to said the voice of remus lupin nothing much just waiting on lily to show up for dinner tonight you mean you re not going to paint the town with us james i offended he said sarcastically who us james asked remus suddenly disappeared and the last marauder came into view hey there james said peter pettigrew wormy james exclaimed long time no see buddy where ve you been well i moved out after an argument with my parents so i was out trying to find a job and a decent flat you know without rats and stuff james laughed but you re settled in now yup i met this guy and he well he gave me an offer i couldntrefuse peter said somewhat grimly well good for you james said i hope that means we ll get to see you more often yeah i ll be around he smiled great let me talk to sirius peter waved and then sirius appeared so what up prongs you re not going out with us tonight well unlike you three losers james said jokingly i have a girl and today is valentine day that requires soft music candle light dinner and romancing tonight i dontbelieve it he whipped came the voice of peter from the background you have no idea james muttered but i glad you all are there because i have something to show you really sirius said and all three faces crowded the mirror james laughed then held up the ring silence crickets man you really are whipped sirius said are you purposing remus asked tonight peter said incredulously james laughed again oh no not tonight she just coming over for dinner i only got the ring today so guys jamsie poo is getting married sirius shrieked as only sirius could then he remus and peter started dancing around guys james chuckled and you know what that means mates he said placing an arm around both his fellow marauders it calls for a bachelor party there was cheering on the other end of the mirror and james was laughing when there was a loud bang from the other room i ve got to go fellas i think lily here i ll talk to you later bye sirius james said to the mirror immediately the image of dancing and cheering marauders faded and all was silent james he grinned then lily appeared around the corner she was decked out in a long clingy black dress make up acutely applied and a silver chain with quaint diamond earrings james was speechless wow he breathed lily blushed and did a little turn at the request of his hand you look incredible why thank you you dontlook too bad yourself potter she said fixing the collar of his robes he cringed ugh please dontcall me that why not she grinned kissing him quickly i like your last name good he smiled i glad bu coming from you i just reminds me of the days when you used to hate me lily froze and looked up at him solemnly then she started laughing i dontthink it funny lily james chuckled but james it is to think i used to despitefully hate you with a passion oh yes thank you for reminding me such wonderful memories too james mumbled turning away lily stopped him by placing a hand on his cheek then smiling up at him and now i cantwait another day to be your wife so i can share the rest of my life with you james potter james grinned soon lily flower very soon then he leaned over o place a quick kiss on her lips but she wrapped her arms around his neck and held him there reveling in his kiss enjoying the warmth in his arms james kisses always made her day and she soon realized that it was something she didntwant to live without she pulled back and smiled up at him then sighed laying her head on his solid chest it amazing how far we ve come since then isntit james almost unbelievable he mumbled after a moment lily pulled back well come on mr potter we ve got reservations but james didntbudge nope i not done holding you yet mrs potter he said mmmm lily smiled then placed her cheek once again on his warm torso a few minutes later james squeezed her okay now we can go you ll never guess who i saw today at auror training class james said later that night after dinner underneath a blanket by the fireplace let me see alice and frank lily said with a smile how did you know said a dejected james i talked to alice the other day lily said she said she spotted you at the ministry on the first day of class well you wanna know something else james said they set a date for the wedding james slumped back into the couch you re no fun oh come on lily pulled him close again and kissed him quickly alice is my best friend we had lunch the other day and she was so excited she had to tell someone i just want to surprise you with something he pouted lily grinned and kissed his cheek i sure you ll find something she said then kissed his jaw and his neck soft and gently teasing guess who i saw in my classes lily said between kisses uh dumbledore james said though he was no longer paying attention he had closed his eyes and he was enjoying the feel of lily lips no silly she giggled jenny and travis really james said not really interested yup lily said pausing from her kisses and fingering the black tresses on the nape of his neck travis is looking into teaching defense of the dark arts back at school can you believe it and jenny is studying to be a healer or an assistant nurse you know of all the people on the quidditch team i thought travis would be the one to go professional guess his heart is still at hogwarts lily said returning the kisses to james neck gently they married yet nope i think they may be rooming together but they haventdone the dirty yet lily smiled jeez did all you females come up with some stupid oath to torture all the males on the planet of course we did lily grinned wickedly jenny alice and i swore to wait till marriage and that was just to make sure that our man would surely marry us because you see that all men think about lily then rose from her seat beside him and straddled his lad and us innocent virtuous women we re not so carnally minded the she placed a hot passionate kiss on his lips james responded fervently putting his hands on her hips and pulling her close mmm hmm like i believe that for two seconds james mumbled and she giggled so frank and alice set a date lily smiled yup july 1st then she returned to kissing his neck james cringed as she nipped at his neck playfully or at least that why she thought he cringed so far away lily paused that a short engagement only five months to plan a wedding james sighed five months what the problem james lily mumbled against his lips when are we going to set our date he almost whispered lily froze then pulled away what james smiled up at her amorously and took her hand in his i love you lily and i want to marry you oh my you re not purposing are you lily said almost breathless not yet he grinned that a surprise you wonttake away from me lily giggled but i just want you to know that and maybe you should keep it in mind he said almost apprehensively lily then leaned over and kissed him fondly ardently and reassuringly i love you too james then she laid her head on his chest and sighed contentedly listening to the steady sound of his heart beat so let me try to get an idea what your favorite season he asked while smoothing down her long red hair i like the fall she said without hesitation well that doesntgive me much time does it he chuckled and she smacked him playfully because it gorgeous outside with the changing of the leaves and it cold enough to snuggle with you and you ll keep me warm i d have to agree with that he said pulling her closer then she looked up at him and smiled it also when i realized that i was falling in love with you back at school and i want to remember that forever you re joking no i serious james she said and she was serious all that travis crap and all our horrid arguments was just me denying my feelings avoiding reality fighting fate james said exactly she smiled well i glad you finally gave in james said pulling her to him me too then she kissed him again a n hey guys kinda shorter i know i hope you guys could enjoy that a little too kissy maybe lol i dunno i didntreally like this chappie just one of those necessary things i gonna like the next few chapters better hopefully you will too grins fyi end coming soon i cantbelieve i ll be finished soon and if i really squeeze everything into really long chapters like you ll complain i think i might wrap it up around chapter fifty and i have no idea when i ll start posting daring destiny just thought i d give you guys a heads up review i live on those things so please keep me alive or i ll never post the last chapters and you ll never know what happens giggles chapter forty six so james is really okay with this travis asked hesitantly i mean the fact that you and i are spending all day shopping for a wedding doesntbother him in the least lily smiled up at travis his wispy blond hair and intense blue eyes she pondered for a moment what it was that had made him so attractive to her when she had decided to go out with him back at school well it was obvious he was perfect adorable popular athletic attentive blond hair blue eyes the whole package but that why she loved james so much he was not perfect he was different he had flaws he was always spontaneous and making mistakes but she loved it living in perfection would be entirely too dull for lily with james life would be an exciting adventure no worries travis lily confirmed i simply told him that you and i were going shopping for the wedding however she didnttell him about the fear in james eyes when she had told him or the i love you and the sweet kiss he left her with before they departed he should know that he has nothing to worry about travis said nonchalantly no offense lily but there just nothing there anymore he said waving his hands between them i know i agree lily smiled she marveled at how strange the heart really was she looked at travis and was eternally grateful that she had no romantic feelings whatsoever for travis anymore a caring and platonic friendship had replaced that long ago however she used to utterly despise james potter and at the moment she could suppress how anxious she was to become his wife strange indeed are the matters of the heart and besides you are just four little words away from becoming mrs lily potter travis said with a grin lily grinned at the sound lily potter but what about jenny she teased as they entered madame belle boutique is she any closer to becoming mrs king travis lowered his head and his face flushed well rather close actually really said a shocked lily yeah travis said shuffling his feet i hoping for it to be soon because we re getting kinda antsy he chuckled hot and bothered lily grinned knowingly something like that travis smiled can i help you with anything they both turned to see a beautiful dark haired witch standing behind a counter with large blue eyes and a kind smile i am madame belle what can i do for you yes we re here to pick up some flowers for a wedding lily said oh marvelous madame belle exclaimed you two are so adorable together have you set a date lily gasped her ears turning pink and her eyes widening oh but we re not the ones getting married travis explained quickly i the best wizard and she the witch of honor we re just here to pick up the longbottom flowers travis explained heat rising to his own cheeks oh excuse me she fussed i so sorry people just say the word wedding and i get all excited now let me go get janel she can help you pick out the perfect flowers for the wedding then she turned and was gone it appears that she has the same mind set as james said a flustered lily dontworry lily said travis patting her back reassuringly james will ask you any day now to be his and then you ll be lily potter for the rest of your life i hope so lily said with a weak smile in the wizarding world marriage was a very serious matter not only did you exchange vows and rings but there was also a ceremony that consisted of having the official marriage seal tattooed on the left shoulder of the bride and the right shoulder of the groom it was a painless spell but unbreakable wizard divorces were rare and very complicated but that was the farthest thing from james mind at the moment no way was anyone even fathoming the word with the vows that had just been exchanged the love that was emanating in the large dance hall the way alice and frank were eyeing each other it was almost sickening yes on this the 1st day of july alice was now mrs frank longbottom james was watching as the newly joined family taking pictures with the witch of honor and the best wizard lily and travis were standing side by side rather close actually posing for the photographer it too close james thought his lily standing in the arms of that travis king once one of his finest quidditch team mates now the cause of one of his biggest insecurities james told himself that lily loved him and that travis was just a thing of the past but still there they were standing in each other arms james was ashamed of the uncertainty that filled his heart with one more cold glare at travis james sighed james turned his back to the busy family and friends that were working with the photographer he rather grouchily marched over to the drink counter pouring himself a large glass of champagne after taking a long swig he glumly patted the large lump in his pocket and sighed again helplessly he had brought the ring just in case he felt the urge to pop the question but how could he even consider asking lily to marry him when he was so full of doubt lily the very essence of h is dreams the love of his life his lily he didntwant to turn around and see them standing happily together it only brought torturous thoughts to his mind letting his imagination run free not to mention that he had a growing hate and resentment towards one of his former friends as james took another long drink of the intoxicating liquid he wondered if lily would even notice he was gone should he decide to leave early it was becoming too much for him the thought of travis made him queasy sick and angry he didntwant to be in the same room as him breath the same air it was then that james realized what a dangerous thing liquor really was he was beginning to think of things like hot searing blades voo doo dolls and the giant squid back at hogwarts each scenario consisting of travis giving his last breath but james was now in control his clouded mind was now clear and he places the drink back on the table but he still didntwant to breath the same air as travis king hey james speak of the devil damnet james sighed and turned around there was travis the epitome of everything james despised travis james said in greeting he tried to force his voice to be friendly but it was colder than he had anticipated how have you been travis said patting him on the back making james stiffen james then picked up his glass once more downing the last little bit and turned to travis i ve been busy he responded you know working at the ministry auror training dating lily he said pointedly travis eyes fell yeah about that about what james dared lily he said james felt his chest tighten again what about her travis james said with a frustrated sigh look james i just want to make sure that there are no hard feelings between us about lily why would there be any hard feelings regarding lily travis james said sarcastically oh come on james i could be dead and buried the way you were glaring daggers at me travis chuckled but james was still serious he sighed i dontknow what to say travis i haventseen you in years and you used to be one of my good friends but i love lily and i i am shamed in hesitating when i say that i know lily loves me just seeing her with you makes me want to ring my neck james smiled maybe a little bit more he didntsay well travis continued to cease these tempting thoughts of me and to help you feel better i ll tell you something then he leaned in and whispered i thinking about running off with jenny james raised his eyebrows really well obviously it nothing official but i ve been thinking about popping the question sometime soon well congrats travis james said relief flooding his being that does make me feel better you should know by now that i have no romantic intentions towards lily you me lily jenny we re all great friends with quite a humourous past when you think about it james chuckled after a moment yup james had lily disgust before he had her love and poor jenny went through years of unrequited love until travis came out of his ignorance each had dated the other and ended up with the opposite person how odd and i dontknow what you re worried about anyway all lily talks about is you and how perfect you are and how in love she is anxiously waiting to become your bride james raised another eyebrow at travis you re joking nope travis smiled just dontlet it go to your head big guy perfect james thought so we re good no bad blood hehehe travis blood james thought but only for a moment james blinked and looked at travis who used to be a former threat and mental meal for the giant squid now nothing more than a good friend sure travis james shook his outstretched hand firmly now if you ll excuse me i think i going to have a little talk with lily good you go get her travis smiled encouragingly you donthave to tell me twice then james took off lily eyes scanned over the crowd searching for james here she was at a bloody wedding her best friend was getting married her ex was holding her for photographs why could nothing go as planned at the moment she just craved to be held in the arms of the man she loved and tell him just that that she loved him just being around a wedding made her want it for herself and james even more but how could she help him understand that finally she spotted him he was hard to miss actually that he was rather tall with raven dark hair and those intense hazel eyes she could pick out of any crowd she quickly made her way to him and tapped him on the shoulder there you are she said he turned and grinned at her a familiar twinkle of mischief in his eyes what are you up to she asked as his arms snaked around her waist nothing lily flower he said when lily raised an eyebrow at him in disbelief he chuckled well nothing life threatening i assure you then he kissed her lily closed her eyes and cupped his face with her hands pulling him closer she reveled in his kiss wanting nothing more than to lose herself in the euphoric rapture he engulfed her in there was nothing in the world but james and his kiss no sight no sound only the taste of his perfect mouth the sound of her own steady heartbeat and the feel of his loving arms around her she could stay there forever in that warm loving bliss james smiled as he pulled away kissing her nose gently and pulling her close to him lily sighed contentedly as she laid her head on his chest i cantwait for our own wedding james she whispered not even realizing she was saying it suddenly james pulled back well lets take care of that right now he muttered then he took her hand and began pulling her away excuse me lily asked incredulously not sure she heard him right james only grinned and continued to guide her through large crowd to the edge of the dance floor he opened the balcony doors inviting her out by bowing gracefully and lily apprehensively walked out what was going on she wondered james then led her to the edge with his arm around her waist lily looked over the marvelous forest the moon and the stars shimmering over a grand lake it beautiful lily said breathlessly perhaps james said though he was only looking at her but so are you lily face flushed and james chuckled after all these years i can still make you blush then he pulled her closer to his side hopefully we ll have many more lily flower many more years of love and laughter and a happily ever after right lily smiled at his sorry attempt for comparing muggle fairy tales exactly then he kissed her again quickly but so tenderly it melted her heart instantly then he pulled back and looked deeply into her eyes i love you lily i love you i love you more each and every day i dontknow how i go on without spending my day with you just talking to you going on dates it not enough for me i need you in my life every minute of every day to give me strength for the next day knowing that you will be there for me through everything to raise our children to love me despite all my imperfections i need you there to love me lily we ve been through so much together and apart but from now on i want to make sure that we are side by side through thick and thin good and bad sickness and health for rich or for poor forever and ever no matter what lily emerald green eyes were now pooling in tears i want that too she wanted to shout but she couldntswallow the lump in her throat lily then held her breath as james bent down on one knee and pulled out a black velvet box he opened it and lily gasped as he revealed the most perfect beautiful ring lily had ever seen then she looked into his hopeful hazel eyes and her chin quivered slightly when he said lily evans will you marry me lily felt her heart wrench in happiness the word finally flashing through her mind she began nodding emphatically and almost yelled yes then he stood grinning like a fool and slid the silverband onto her dainty ring finger lily admired it through her teary eyes before throwing her arms around his neck and laughing merrily as he spun her around when he finally put her down she kissed him and this time she had no intention of ever letting go woo hoo great job prongs finally lily and james pulled apart to see not only the three other marauders but also alice and frank the newly weds and travis and jenny all applauding in the doorway of the balcony so you finally got her prongs sirius grinned after almost eight years of coaxing and convincing you finally got your girl yup james said smiling down at lily i finally got my girl lily turned in his arms and stuck her hand out examining the ring in the moonlight she felt her hear melting at the sight and she felt so happy she thought she might die mrs lily potter she said smugly james chuckled mrs lily potter finally lily thought finally james muttered finally sirius said loudly two months later lily was letting out heavy breaths sweat dripping down her face as she ran through the familiar halls of hogwarts once more thinking this is not the way i wanted to come back it had been reported that three aurors in training had been kidnapped by none other than lord voldemort himself after extensive and desperate research lily found them being held on hogwarts grounds the three aurors in training frank alice and james so exactly how many times would she have to defy him the damned voldemort that just wouldntdie lily did her best to hide her fear as she rounded a corner but it was easily overcome with anger how dare he that damn voldemort had the nerve to steal away her fianc just to torture him to death and to force him into giving away vital ministry information about godric hollow or some crazy thing 5 weeks before her wedding he dares to try to kill her fianc 5 weeks before her bloody wedding not bloody likely the bastard he obviously didntknow who the bloody hell he was dealing with that right little lily marie and she was furious when this fiery little red head was upset you d better watch out it was only a week before the start of the term so lily thought at least dumbledore or filch would have been around somewhere but it was also a weekend all the crazy old nuts were probably drinking it up at hogsmeade so lily had no back up no help whatsoever she was running blindly into a trap but she didntcare she had waited her whole life for james no way was she giving up now shewas ready tofight for him just like he always fought for her lily suddenly stopped as she ran past a supposedly empty classroom but that where she heard the voices i know you know where it is young potter said a cold familiar voice that belonged to lord voldemort i told you a dozen times that i don t she heard james say as she leaned closer the door relief flooded her he was still alive the damn mininstry wouldntlet me have the job at godric hollow i was turned down rejected why cantyou understand that what you dontseem to understand young potter is that i need to know where that place is said voldemort in a slow shrill drawl so when i say i dontknow are you saying you want me to lie to you make up some crazy location is that it james said angrily smart mouth this one said a hostile and haughty voice that could only belong to bellatrix black oh i know bella voldemort chuckled maybe we could use his friends as leverage what do you say to that maybe that would ease his tongue a bit then lily swallowed hard i dontknow anything damnit james yelled what more do you want from me nothing came an evil cackle from bellatrix no leave them alone dont crucio lily covered her ears as frank let out a howl that pierced her to the soul she couldntlet this continue they were ruthless killers but she couldntlet anyone die on her watch how d you like that potter bellatrix laughed damn you devil woman james said in a wavering voice that broke lily heart aw wittle potter gonna cwy still refuse to speak voldemort inquired what more can i tell you except for i dontknow very well how about you mrs longbottom no lily whispered not alice she knew she had to do something but what all she had was her wand and her brains crucio alice was shrieking at the top of her lungs andjerking aroundon the floor when lily threw the door open the spell ceased immediately and bellatrix looked up evans she muttered ah lily marie what a pleasant surprise voldemort greeted her grinning wickedly lily get out of here james whimpered but lily didnthear any of them she only lifted her wand staring down the deadly red slits of eyes that belonged to lord voldemort then with her voice gradually growing louder finite tormetne engorgio she yelled immediately the spell was cast a large beam almost like a giant gust of wind sending both voldemort and bellatrix smashing through a window andmiles away lily james said taken aback in shock panting heavily lily marched to where alice lay tears gathering in her eyes alice are you all right dear lily alice said quietly not opening her eyes i so sorry alice lily whispered as she brought alice hand to her cheek might i inquire as to what happened to this room all four students regardless of how painful or rough it might have been turned to see the beloved headmaster albus dumbledore standing in the classroom doorway it was voldemort professor james barely breathed out impossible tom would never then over his half moon glasses his eyes drifted to alice and lily on the floor in tears come all of you to the hospital wing you look simply ragged dumbeldore said opening the door wider with frank and james leaning on each other for support lily lifted alice to her feet but as they walked out the door lily thought she heard dumbledore say tom riddle he wouldntdare lily hmm where the bloody hell did that spell come from lily giggled and snuggled closer to james all four of them were laying on beds in the hospital wing though frank and alice were completely out madame pompfrey had just returned from last minute medicine shopping for the year after giving all of them sleeping drafts they all picked beds to rest on lily and james just managed to pick the same bed come on it not like it hasnthappened before i learned it in my ancient charms class lily answered quietly i had no idea if it would really work but i couldntthink of anything else to do well you are just the cleverest little witch arentyou james chuckled i nothing special james lily said humbly just a muggle born witch with a mind and a wand and a mouth for magic james said with a smile you are so special lily blood has nothing to do with it that just the point you are so rare i ll bet you all the money i have in gringott that there no other muggle born witch or wizard that could have come off conquerer in that situation that you just saved us all from no average witchcouldhave donewhat you did becauseyou are no average witch lily oh james hush she said blushing again i just glad you re okay you are always there to save me i thought i would just return the favor well the roles were indeed reversed tonight lily flower he kissed her gently on the side of the head you were the hero this time and i so glad you were lily sat in the silence for a moment the sleeping draft beginning to cloud her head though one memory that stuck out in her mind kept her awake james hmm do you know what i thinking about of course i do i was always a pro at legimency james said sarcastically earning a playful smack from lily dontyou remember that one night after i discovered you and sirius with remus thenwe all slept here to recover ah yes james said smugly pulling her closer and you spent that one heavenly night in my arms indeed lily smiled sleepily but dontget any ideas now either she told him warily you mean i still have to wait another month yup damnit james grumbled stop swearing lily chided quietly yes mrs potter mmm mrs potter lily yawned i do like the sound of that she patted james

this not so average morning one single thought consumed her mind completely as she stretched yawned and opened her eyes i getting married today she whispered to herself a thrill of excitement traveled up her spine and all the way to her mouth causing a grin and a giggle she jumped out of bed and ran to the window throwing open the curtains it was a glorious morning the sun shimmering through the faded leaves of the late fall trees there was a peaceful content feeling that was settling over her heart as she thought about james her dear love sometimes like now lily wondered if it really was the right thing to do the right thing for james of course she loved him with all that she was and more and she knew that he loved her his undying devotion and faithfulness was a confirmation of his love but always and forever in the back of her mind was that damned prophesy shaking her head she turned and grinned towards the bedroom door she ran down the hall and burst into jenny room making her sit up in surprise lily she exclaimed rubbing her sleepy eyes what are you doing i am dancing around the house in my pajamas because today i am getting married then lily jumped onto her bed and the girls enjoyed a good excited shriek oh lily i cantbelieve you re finally marrying james jenny sighed lily laid her head on a pillow with a dreamy sigh i know it almost surreal jenny grinned that tables sure are turned arentthey lily looked up what do you mean remember back at school i had james and you had travis now its totally backwards and nancy alice is a humble housewife this is true lily agreed i never knew that alice would be the first of us to be married just thinking of the way she used to be or that it would be a man like frank she d marry jenny pointed out indeed but he brought out her better side the alice longbottom that we know and love and you re marrying the boy that you hated in school though he loved you all along yup lily grinned but what about you are you getting any closer to a pretty little ring on your own finger travis hinted as much to me jenny sighed wistfully and looked hopefully down at her hands he also hinted to me as well lily though he been acting uncharacteristically odd lately it ll be soon i sure lily said soothingly well what are we talking about me for this is your big day we need to be getting you ready indeed said a voice from the doorway they both turned to see alice both jumping from the bed they attempted to tackle her but she dodged them swiftly and effectively girls girls easy now i canthave you tackling me i actually have some new for you alice stammered as she greeted her friends with gentle hugs what wrong alice is everything all right jenny asked where frank lily said noticing a calm uneasiness in alice eyes oh frank is downstairs talking with james and travis alice said with a wink but this isntabout him lily froze is something wrong with you are you ill well not exactly alice said with a grin what do you mean by not exactly jenny said emphatically girls i pregnant after some ear piercing shrieks and tearful hugs they led alice to the bed and gathered together in quiet conversation when is it due how far along are you alice laughed well i due sometime in july because we re not quite sure when the conception date is she said with a face as red as a tomato after more giggles and squeals alice shook her head i know we re all excited but this is lily special day and i not going to steal the spotlight from her oh hush alice i just so excited that both of you are here i get to share my special day with my two best friends lily smiled tears gathering again in her eyes she pulled her two friends close for a warm affectionate hug oh enough of this alice said with a chuckle wiping her own eyes we ve got a wedding to prepare for let get going james couldnthelp the grin that tugged on his lips as he looked down at lily his arm was wrapped gently around her waist as they all posed for pictures his three faithful marauders were on his right and on the left of lily was alice and nancy petunia was supposed to be there also but she never showed go figure right some excuse about being pregnant made her feet hurt but the thing that james found so amusing was lily the back of her dress was low cut and was on the edge of revealing the tattooed marriage seal on her left shoulder a warm content feeling overwhelmed his heart as he realized that it was done after so many years of fighting and arguing persuading and coaxing flirting and romancing he finally had the woman he loved she was now his wife by his side forever and that thought made him happier than he ever thought he could be then lily looked up and flashed a dazzling smile in his direction his heart melted he felt his whole body ease from the wedding tension he smiled back at her and pulled her closer ah this is purely heaven he thought was it really right for me to feel this happy we need to leave james was her quiet whisper james couldnthelp but chuckle is that so he whispered back but it was quiet enough sirius was now listening intently trying to look uninterested yes james you re my husband now i want to get away from all these people to have some alone time with you she tried not to move her mouth much as the photographer was still taking pictures but james could still hear the low connotations of her voice you mean quality study time james said with a grin sirius then burst out laughing loudly and heartily as ever as if a young 17 year old boy back at school what so funny lily inquired of the two snickering men nothing lily flower james said kissing her sweetly on the forehead dontyou worry we ll get our quality alone time soon enough james looked around at all his friends and felt his heart swell with gratitude what an odd group they were the marauders lily and her friends each being separated by their family by death or abandonment and yet they were all here all healthy all more than happy they had survived conquered the trials of life and they were happy they were each others family okay we re done here said the photographer shaking james hand and walking away i ll have them owled out soon he said as he left the celebration james then saw remus face pale and stricken with fear james looked out the window knowing full well that there was no full moon outside but still wondering what could weaken him so you all right there moony james asked throwing an arm over his shoulder huh yeah fine just uh his voice trailed off as james turned to see what remus was staring so intently at there by the punch table was joselynn bonafede james um did you he stammered nervously you didntinvite her did you james smiled with a nod no i didn t well then what the bloody hell is she doing here he whispered lily invited her what remus looked like he was ready to scream but the fact that joselynn was within shouting distance kept him quiet she knew i was going to be here why did she do that because we had a deal remus they turned to see lily in all her wedded glory but she was angry her lips in a thin line and her brows furrowed her arms folded across her chest as she walked to james and remus lily you know i no remus you promised me all those years ago we had a deal i kept my promise and i told james that i loved him which was the best decision of my life i know you have reasons for fear and apprehension but are you telling me to go confess my undying love for her drag her off to get married so i can eat her on my honeymoon remus said in a whisper hey you can do whatever you want on your honeymoon just keep it to yourself mate james chuckled james this isnta laughing matter i trying to be serious remus said with an irritated sigh i thought we had a deal remus i keeping my part i marrying him for crying out loud what about you if i remember correctly our words were you give a little i ll give a little well i gave a little and i see no reason to put her in danger or break my heart further what do you want me tortured the rest of my life lily opened her mouth the shut it james could you excuse us for a minute james shrugged his shoulders sure just dontmake a move on my wife remus he joked then walked over to where sirius was standing with frank and alice okay remus you wanna talk let talk there nothing to talk about lily i keeping her safe and happy what more do you want from me he said what about your happiness remus she asked and he looked away i want you to be happy why are you denying yourself the happiness that comes with love you think i love her he said looking at joselynn painfully i think that you admire her and respect her and that two things that love is based on lily said tenderly she smart pretty caring and she obviously cares about you how would you know that remus said shaking his head you haventseen her since school that not true lily said and he looked up she in my advanced potions class at the college and we study together sometimes she a very nice girl remus but she always asks about you how you re doing what you ve been up to remus looked up hopefully but didntsay anything that why i invited her remus i wanted to give her a chance to see you to see if there could ever be anything there but it can t lily why cantyou see that he said in a hurt voice there can never be anything i am keeping her safe and happy that what i want but you re not happy lily pointed out remus sighed and shrugged i willing to give up my happiness to give her a long lived happy life but you re not giving her a choice what do you mean she cares for you remus lily said quietly i see it in her eyes whenever she talks about you and though she never said it to me before i think she wants a chance to see if things could work out with you two but you wontlet her even try lily i i dontwant to hurt her remus said that would break my heart i would learn to live with it if she left me after she found out what i really am but if i let her love me and i hurt her or worse i would never forgive myself it would be my fault entirely i d have the blame i couldntlive with that then we re back to the astronomy tower remus john lupin i told you i dontever want to hear you talk like that again and i mean it lily said restraining herself from slapping him soundly across the face now listen to me remus if there anything i ve learned from all my years with james it that love is never one sided it has to be two people willing to work willing to sacrifice i am so lucky to have the love that i share with james he is willing to sacrifice his safety and possibly his life he willing to work for our love that right you are lucky to have such a wonderful guy like james remus said bitterly only because i finally gave in i actually gave him a chance lily said pointedly you said so yourself you would eventually get over it if she left but you ll never know if joselynn is worth it if you donttry remus was just sat there looking at the floor lily sat back and waited for a reaction when he sighed and stood lily smiled where are you going she asked i going to step outside for a moment he said calmly remus she said in a warning voice but he offered a small smile dontworry i just want to sort out my thoughts i ll be right back fine lily smiled hopefully at him and then turned to go find james wandering over to the drinking table she wrapped her arm around james waist yeah you re just lucky lily was there to save you save me you re lucky lily came up when she did or i would have clawed your eyes out alice smiled you had made me so mad with all your royal ho ness remarks james sirius and frank all laughed but after it had died down sirius smiled softly at her but we re okay right i didntdo too much mental damage did i after all you did marry this nut he said pointing at frank hey frank said in defense no there no harm done you were one of the reasons i stopped being like that alice confessed what sirius said i thought it was frankie poo well after my little flying lesson with james you really set me straight you kinda opened my eyes so even though i acted unaffected by what you said it really bothered me i wanted to change that when lily started going out with travis so then i met frank and and the rest is history man we really do all have a lot of history together dontwe james said in awe yup sirius said with a smile holding a hand out to alice but we re all good friends now right alice stepped forward and gave him a quick hug of course the best sirius patted her back sincerely and pulled back to look at her but that made frank nervous all right lets keep the goo goo eyes in this direction he chuckled pulling alice back oh dontworry sweet heart alice said eyeing sirius playfully we may have a lot of history but you have nothing to worry about when it comes to sirius black then they all laughed lily looked up and gasped at what she saw remus had just walked up to joselynn she greeted him with an anxious hug and an excited smile his smile was genuine and lily knew she was right they were happy together why did remus have to have such a doubting heart not to mention the horrible curse that was his to bare alone at least lily had james lily smiled as remus led joselynn to the side of the room with chairs for a quiet conversation james caught her gaze and smiled too it about time huh he said quietly i just hope he doesntturn her away lily said it obvious that she cares about him he just needs to let her why does that sound so familiar james whispered in her ear lily smiled and closed her eyes enjoying his breath on her skin what were you saying about leaving sometime soon lily whispered back melting at his touch james then kissed her mouth quickly too quickly for her own liking then turned to his large group of guests may i have your attention please james said loudly his voice echoing through the dance hall and everyone grew silent i thank you all for coming to help celebrate this special day with lily and i but if we re to make our appointment in paris this evening then we need to bid you all farewell after everyone gave their hugs and congratulations alice and jenny then came forward hugging lily tight the marauders each shook james hand ending with remus hugging the both of them thank you lily he said as he hugged her what are friends for remus she smiled lily and james alone in paris for a whole week how ever will they occupy themselves sirius mumbled to peter and they chuckled quietly now if you will excuse us james said sweeping lily off her feet from behind her they disapparated after most people went back to chatting and snacking sirius didn t wait a minute who going to clean all this up at last james mumbled with a smile he left soft tender almost teasing kisses on lily lips as he pulled her closer to him he didntbother lighting the room his only thoughts were of his new wife they became lost in each others kiss instantly soon clothes were removed all pretenses gone and they were all but consumed with the love that they had for each other sweet kisses burning caresses overwhelming desire passed between them as they became one never again to be separated so how was it lily smiled and lifted her eyes to her husband he was standing behind her while she sat on the balcony sipping on a cup of pumpkin juice the next day james what do you think she chuckled taking his hand in her own well there were many things that i heard last night all the moaning and screaming but never really an evaluation of the entire experience lily laughed and pulled his face down to kiss him tenderly on the mouth it was amazing she assured him a little awkward for me considering that was my first time but amazing beautiful and wonderful nonetheless well i sure you ll find this hard to believe but it was my first time as well now that the biggest lie i ve ever heard james potter she said arrogantly you are far too experienced in physically pleasing a woman for that to have been your first time oh come now lily flower just because i am a suave charming rouge doesntmean i not a gentlemen really lily said disbelievingly with raised eyebrows really i cantbelieve you actually thought that of me lily he said offended well you did have quite the reputation back at school james lily pointed out well of course i didntsnog any girl that offered and i would never put out just because the opportunity presented itself i a man of substance lily i have morals values lily only laughed hey just because i dontlive by them all the time doesntmean i donthave them yes of course i sorry then james knelt before her and took her hands looking up into her eyes with a smile listen to me lily i want you to hear this so you can understand that i serious about you about us my mother taught me a long time ago to be a gentleman to always respect women i may talk big act big but on the inside i just this gentlemanly little boy waiting for my princess charming and this caused lily to smile i may have made out with a few girls in the past lily but i never crossed that line i was waiting for you i wanted to cross that line with you and only you i wanted you to understand how completely loyal i am to you i am so in love with you i can hardly see straight and that has nothing to do with the great sex lily commented but she was grinning with tears in her eyes that may be so james smiled but that doesntchange how much i love you after lily smiled at him for a few minutes she smirked you probably planned that whole thing didntyou what i offended lily that came straight from the heart of course it did lily said pulling him down beside her and i guess you wouldntfeel right unless i told you how much i love you and how you complete my life and that we indeed had great sex last night james nodded in approval yeah that just about sums it up he said as he pulled lily close to him that still doesntexplain your masterful skill of lovemaking she commented oh that just comes naturally baby james chuckled and lily heart melted at the sound of baby you ve won yourself a true sex god here is that so lily questioned are you prepared to prove that to me any place any time lily flower he said seductively leaning towards her all right then bring it on lily giggled standing and walking slowly back into the room oh you re asking for it now i ll have you screaming james is the god of sex in no time we ll see she said in a wicked grin a n we re not going to talk about why it took me so long to update and no need to rub it in i feel awful that you all had to wait so long but with school starting up again and work and wait i said we re not going to talk about it so you guys review i trying to get 1000 reviews before the end of the story so i serious when i say review and i ll try to post again someday thanks i love you guys chapter forty eight nine months later lily was laying on her bed beside james with a had resting on her large stomach she sat there in amazement admiring the little miracle that she bore and the amazing man at her side it awed her how her love for james the love that they shared could create the bundle of joy that she carried her heart swelled and burned with a new love a maternal protective feeling overwhelming her body it was the most amazing thing in the world to lily and she was humbled and honored and deliriously excited to share this experience with her husband the man she loved more than life she turned to lay on her side watching james as he slept one of her favorite past times she loved james and was inspired by his unconditional love for her his constant care for her and her unborn child was touching and she could never thank him enough even though they had been out of school for years and were now not only adults but almost parents james was still a child at heart still cracking jokes always bringing a smile to her face he was a man when required like when working at the ministry or whenever lily needed him but lily saw the real him just a happy and care free little boy just itching to run wild and free his dark hair was falling into his face accenting his skin lily sat there admiring his sheer beauty gently moving the stray strands of raven locks aside caressing his skin how did such a wonderful man learn to love her always persisting never giving up forever fighting for her love every time she pushed him away it only made him try harder how did she ever become so lucky she softly touched his face her heart swelling growing with more love than she had ever imagined then a smile grew on his face and though his eyes remained closed he began to speak how am i supposed to sleep with you pawing at me like that he said i just admiring lily smiled back innocently admiring is with your eyes not your hands luv james whispered back i sorry i just canthelp myself she teased you re too irresistible it was then that james opened his eyes and lily felt her heart melt his intense dream glazed eyes locked with her own she was drowning in their hazel depths when he finally smiled well then you re lucky i have more self control than you do or i d ravish you right here and now lily giggled as he leaned into her in case you ve failed to notice you already have ravished me and this was the final result she said patting her large stomach james only chuckled and kissed her gently on the forehead just try to get some sleep honey you have the baby to think of now what else do i think about she mumbled turning to her side then she felt james arm snake around her stomach and pull her closer lily smiled and snuggled back mmmm she thought heaven then oh my gosh uh james mmm hmm i think it time to go lily the doctor not here yet calm down lily face contorted into a painful grimace as she screamed i want you down here having this bloody baby so i can tell you to calm down damnit if this baby pops out without some sort of professional assistance i going to shhhh lily dontworry james said soothingly he ll be here soon everything will be all right lily was laying on a bed in a hospital room at st mungo preparing for labor and james was standing beside her trying to be as supportive as possible that not going to stop it from hurting she said a strained voice well take my hand and squeeze it if it makes you feel better james told her taking her hand then he realized his mistake damnit i cantfeel my hand did you know alice and frank are here too james said trying to make conversation and to take the attention from the grinding bones in his hand she having her baby as well well that makes me feel better lily breathed at least i not the only one here dealing with these bloody labor pains well they may not be labor pains but i dealing with some pretty bad pains myself he said teasingly oh do shut up james lily yelled you re the one that did this to me you deserve a little pain yourself james gave a half hearted laugh as the door opened and the doctor walked in about time he thought so sorry i late the doctor said how are you doing mrs potter well i having a baby lily tried to smile but another contraction took over i sure that your husband here will take care of you and you ll be fine the doctor patted james on the back and james smiled okay now let have this baby lily was

man she loved more than anything gently take the baby from her and hold it cradle it love it her baby their baby he is lily agreed quietly he looks just like his daddy too look at all the hair nah but he got your eyes lily flower james said with a soft smile staring down in awe at the little child bright green emerald eyes just like you some pretty little girl is going to be smitten with him just like i was when i first saw you and those sparkling orbs of yours kissing her softly on the lips he placed the baby boy back into his mothers arms hello my little one lily whispered as the baby cooed and smiled up at her have you decided on a name yet james quietly questioned you never have told me what names you like i have a good one in mind lily smirked not something silly and common like thomas or ethan something with character and power meaningful and life changing like charlie or dominic i like harry lily said looking up at him with knowing eyes harry james potter lily watched as james tired hazel eyes filled with tears and a smile spread across his lips he pulled her to his side and kissed her cheek i knew i married you for a reason pop honey i home lily greeted her husband

the mouth and longer than she had intended but she wanted to revel in her husbands kiss for one moment longer no you re my husband and i love you very much she said looking up at him intently then with a smile she turned back to the meal at hand but you re not a female thanks heavens and sometimes i just need a girl to talk to alice and i live in homes with too much testosterone and we need to

arms out to his son come here slick lookin baby daddy got a present for you baby harry was now almost 6 months old and he was the happiest little boy not only was he constantly crawling around babbling happily but he always recognized his parents and grinned toothlessly james stretched out his arms and harry instantly smiled up at his father and scooted across the floor there you are son

james that beautiful lily gasped looking over his shoulder wherever did you get it the same place i got your ring sweetheart i wanted to get something i could hand down to my son then he grinned up at her and kissed her sweetly on the mouth i also got your gift at the same jewelry shop lily smiled wryly james you didnthave to yeah you didnthave to marry me either but you did it anyway james chuckled making remus and sirius laugh as well james opened the box and lily eyes grew inside were emerald green earrings to match his mother necklace and lily engagement ring james they re gorgeous she exclaimed breathlessly taking the box from him and moving to the mirror over the fireplace to put them on i find it the only thing fitting for my gorgeous wife he said behind her as putting his hands on her hips and she gently placed the exquisite stones on her ears he watched her nose scrunch up in her adorable facial expressions and he was awed in her magnificent beauty her fiery red hair had grown longer if it was possible her green eyes shown like the emeralds she wore off setting her flaming locks and porcelain skin when she turned to him and smiled james couldnthelp but smile back he could die happy he had the most beautiful loving wife in the world and through that love together they had created a son the most amazing creature in james eyes life was defiantly good thanks you james she said wrapping her arms around his neck and your present will be given later on tonight really james said with a raised eyebrow suddenly intrigued do you mind said remus jokingly we are your guest after all you re supposed to be entertaining us not yourselves ah but look there moony sirius pointed out james specifically planted that little sprig of mistletoe over the fireplace because he knew when lily got her earrings she d want to put them on immediately and would naturally use the mirror lily looked up suspiciously and indeed there was a little twig of mistletoe and raised an eyebrow of her own at james see there a reason you re my best friend james nodded with a smile is that so lily teased and what am i chopped liver never james said suddenly growing serious you re my wife and i love you more than anything i love you then pulling her closer he kissed her the sweet intoxication she enveloped him in was euphoric he loved kissing lily it helped him understand the true meaning of love it renewed in him a conviction to love lily and to keep her happy it reminded him what exactly he was living for her and her love ahem sirius cleared his throat get a room i think later on tonight is going to come sooner remus laughed in a whisper james felt lily smile in his kiss as she pulled away happy christmas lily he said looking lovingly into her emerald orbs happy christmas james they rejoined their friends hand in hand sirius and remus were trying to teach little harry to walk james sat on his large comfy chair and lily sat on his lap where hestia sirius lily asked i saw you two last week in london i figured you two would be spending christmas together nah she spending christmas with her family in italy and i wanted to spend christmas here with my family he smiled so we decided we d spend the new years eve together she such a sweet heart we had a great time when she went with alice and i to diagon alley to go shopping lily commented and she has impeccable taste in clothes what about jenny james asked i thought you three were inseparable you alice and jenny you mean your girlfriend lily teased i was actually curious about your boyfriend but yeah what about my girlfriend james said as he poked her in the side unfortunately my dear friend jenny has moved to norway lily said wistfully norway james said incredulously why the hell would she move there it supposed to be bloody frigid up there well it just so happens that travis was accepted to be teacher at durmstrang lily smirked travis remus commented that impressive not only are they selective in the students they allow but they must also be very selective in those they allow to teach i always knew he was a smart guy lily said earning more poking from james yeah but eventually you knew that i would become the world most powerful auror and that they are grossly overpaid so you decided to go with me james said arrogantly while sirius chuckled and harry giggled and played with the ball on the end of his santa hat how your schooling going lily remus asked we go to separate campuses now so i dontget to see you as often i love it she smiled i learning so much in my charms classes i cantwait to actually start as a charms specialist for the ministry and speaking of school guess who i saw last week lily said with almost a smirk remus shrugged joselynn lily watched as his face

shouldntbe wondering you should be with her and she should know how you re doing remus stood and shook his head walking to the window to watch the snow fall in the darkness it obvious she interested in you and i know for a fact that you re crazy about her so why arentyou doing anything about it remus sighed if she knew anything about the real me lily she wouldntbe so interested he said quietly damnit remus lily said standing and yelling angrily at his back i sick and tired of you feeling sorry for yourself if she loves you then she wouldntcare about that but you ll never know because you wonteven give her the opportunity to love you that right better for her to be safe and happy rather than burdened and endangered by me he retorted spitefully if that how you really feel then you dontunderstand love remus lily said calming herself and taking a seat back on james lap i used to think like that and that what kept me from james from love because i didntunder stand that love is a two way thing it cantbe one sided and if i still felt like that i wouldnthave the amazing life i living now i wouldnthave the perfect husband and an amazing child james smirked and whispered to sirius she called me the perfect husband sirius chuckled i hate to say it moony but she right yeah remus why not give her a chance james said it obvious she can make you happy and you love her enough to keep her happy and safe why dontyou give her the chance to feel that way about you remus sighed and ran a hand through his long brown hair i i just fine fine lily i ll send her an owl will that make you happy yes thank you remus lily smiled you wontregret it we ll see about that remus said with a rueful smile as he took his seat on the floor once more i think little harry had it for one night sirius said cuddling a sleeping harry in his arms oh poor baby lily said as she stood he not used to having so many visitors you two must have worn him out she said smacking sirius playfully on the back of the head sirius chuckled as lily took the sleeping child from him and out of the room aw we were just playing werentwe moony yeah james jr probably gets as much rough housing from his dad remus added james jr now that cute did you make that up all by yourself james laughed only to be shushed from lily who was down the hall you have to admit james he looks exactly like you remus said yeah he does have my dashing good looks doesnthe rough face and messy hair yup that you sirius joked he got lily eyes though anyone could tell that from a mile away remus said i know it james sighed that little kid is going to be heart breaker that for sure remus smiled well he got great parents so so he ll definitely be a heart breaker sirius chuckled well james had great parents too and he didntbreak too many hearts remus said but then he stopped and laughed okay so maybe that not totally true but you did have great parents sirius nodded amen can you believe it been almost three years since my parents died james said in revered amazement really time sure does fly sirius said your parents were always great james remus said always happy and joking and thinking back on it now though we all thought it was disgusting then they were really in love with each other and i see that in you and lily too i happy for you thanks moony not to mention the house smells the same sirius said fresh bread oranges and vanilla it such a familiar homey house i could just live here i did live with you for a time james and i feel right at home here remus nodded in agreement well feel free to come over any time i

bad james said incredulously yeah the boys got a screw loose sirius said i serious pad if he wasnta member of the order i d be worried voldemort has persuasive power that everyone underestimates how

moved out in the field so i not seeing any action yet but it so close to home just last week one of our double agents was discovered and killed then his wife was tortured to death i attended the funeral service and it really not a happy thing to deal with it very real and it could he paused and corrected himself it will get very dangerous i just hope you re well protected sirius said and well hidden remus said solemnly we dontwant to be attending any funerals any time soon suddenly lily walked back into the room and stopped whos boys easy on the dramatics there so much tension in this room it knocked me in the face when i walked in she said taking her seat on james lap again no worries love we were just talking james told her ready for your present now lily said in a low voice hey wait a minute sirius said you didntget us anything no happy christmas for your tow best mates remus said with a fake pout oh yeah i almost forgot james and lily smiled at each other out on the back porch are two brand new nimbus 1700 waiting for you sirius and remus looked at each other and only laughed not only was the newest most expensive broom on the market but it was also the most high quality broom made so far it was the broom used by the professionals surely james hadntspent that much money on them no really what did you get us sirius said um i not joking james said they stopped laughing you re serious remus said in disbelief no actually he sirius but if you dontbelieve me about the brooms go see for yourself remus and sirius fumbled over each other as they raced for the back door throwing it open they were gone leaving lily and james alone that was a very nice thing you did for them james lily said quietly oh it the least i could do for them they ve been my best mates for years after all they ve done for me it really nothing i know it and i proud of you she kissed him quickly so what exactly did you get me again james smiled lily giggled and began trailing kisses down his neck you ll find out as soon as your friends leave hey who invited you kids anyway get on out of here you mangy teenagers scram scrounging animals i trying to get a present from my wife james yelled playfully lily only laughed and kissed james on the mouth sweetly then looking into his eyes she smiled i love you james i love you too lily flower then there was some excited screams in the

chapter fifty october 31st 1980 i just feel useless like you donttrust shut your mouth sirius that not the truth and you know it james said viciously i know james but damnit i just feel so useless sirius said grumpily slouching in his chair sirius we re doing this for your safety lily said gently i know but you shouldntbe worrying about my safety you should be worrying about your own especially now that you re here in godric hollow and voldemort is looking for you sirius erupted lily was suddenly angry if bellatrix ever found you you d be tortured to no end do you want us to live with that on our conscience if she killed you when you didnttell her our whereabouts or if you cracked i would never he yelled damn i feel like i being treated like a child with a stupid little secret sirius jamesbegan quietly if there was any risk of me dying wouldntyou do the same thing hell yes sirius said but i told you to marry lily and that just as bad as a death sentence lily gasped and narrowed her eyes at this comment you know the prophesy james you knew the risk involved when you married her and you did it anyway i doing the same thing willing to risk my life for the ones i love sirius it would be better it you left me as secret keeper that way i would die with my secret instead of slipping is that what this is a test of my loyalty he spat bitterly you know it not sirius james said we just dontwant you to die for our sake even though i risk it willingly yes i wish you didntmake such a big deal out of this sirius lily said we re just thinking about you and i just thinking about you three he said but you ll make the switch lily said hopefully yes he muttered i dontrespect your decision but i ll go along with it thank you sirius lily said hugging him this means a lot to us i know i just wish i could do something more for you he said sighing regretfully you ve done enough james said patting him on the shoulder i going to get harry i ll be right back lily said running up the stairs donttake too long love peter will be along shortly james called after her lily made her way into the baby room and smiled it was always such a calming and heartwarming scene she looked around the room from thecrib and the rocker to the little chest of drawers there in the crib was little harry peering mischievously over the edge of the crib when lily walked into the room he giggled and ducked underneath the blankets what are you up to little harry lily smiled down at her son and removed the blanket in harry drooling mouth she found his little pocket watch oh your father lily shook her head and took the watch away and harry began to whimper now now none of that son i ve got to preserve this watch if your father wants it to last lily said eyeing the watch how about some magic then pulling her wand out of her hair she grinned wickedly harry began to giggle again and watched his mother steadily see i knew you d like that now what was that conserving spell i learned the other day in class she paused thinking for a moment and harry watched with large green eyes as his mother raised her wand in a very smooth firm voice she said aeternus prohibeo a tiny white spell shot out of her wand and into the pocket watch it shook in lily hand for a moment then began ticking again shiny and pretty as ever it looked as good as new perfect lily said with a smile quite pleased with herself then she set the watch on the desk and picked up baby harry out of his crib placing a kiss on his head ready to go change our secret keeper harry smiled and cooed at his mother holding onto her neck affectionately i guess that a yes it was later that night that lily found herself pacing the bedroom floor the whole incident gave her a bad feeling in her stomach sirius was too devastated and peter too eager to accept this responsibility something just didntseem quite right in lily mind but lily mind wasntthe only thing still awake harry was also distressed about something he wouldntstop crying his wails could probably be heard down the street all the muggles in godric hollow would surely hate them by morning not to mention james was off again there had been a sighting of the dark lord voldemort not too far from the hollow after they had changed secret keepers and administered the fidelius charm james being an official auror and well respected member of the order of the phoenix was sent to search for details lily always worried when he was out chasing that mad monster of a man if he was even there at all and harry screaming wasnthelping to ease her mind any come on damnit it two o clock in the morning she yelled suddenly all her worries and stress exploding harry looked up at his mother in shock then cried harder oh i so sorry darling i didntmean to shout lily whispered she moved to a little rocking chair by the window staring out to the stars humming a little tune to her son trying to rock him to sleep shhh shhh dontcry you ll be all right and in her rhythmic rocking and humming lily suddenly lost all sense of time and place she didntnotice her eyes close slowly the words came out of her mouth as if they werenteven formed in her mind but they flowed from her lips quietly gently firmly harry james potter you fill my heart with joy and no matter what may happen you ll always be my little boy though you may live through perilous times you must be bold and brave and if you learn to live for love many lives you will save the greatest power i possess i pass it on to you so that you may live and you may love just as i love you then she sealed it with a kiss the unrecorded prophesy of lily evans potter asher eyes fluttered open she saw harry smiling up at her yes that was a sweet little lullaby wasntit she grinned her own words unknown to her she gave her son an eskimo kiss and his eyes began to close suddenly the bedroom door burst open there stood james sweating and breathless james what the matter lily said her tone worried he coming lily he said in a heaving breath he coming here now she slowly laid harry in his crib and moved towards her husband who lily asked not daring to believe voldemort lily gasped and her heart sank somehow he found godric hollow and he knew that we were here someone ratted us out james said bitterly his pun far from funny at the moment but peter would never sirius would never peter might if he was playing both sides james said regretfully running a hand through his hair nervously she watched helplessly as james picked up the mirror he shared with sirius and desperately yelled sirius almost instantly she heard sirius voice hey prongs what are you up to you ready to see my bike now it been waiting for you to come take a ride sirius voldemort is on his way here now james said quickly what the you mean peter yes i mean peter james shook his head slowly damnit that slimy little piece of pad i need to you take lily and harry and get them out of here lily heard sirius let out some muffled words before he said i ll be right over james put down the mirror and looked up at lily there was fear in her eyes and they were swimming in tears he walked up to her and took her by the shoulders looking into the depths of her emerald orbs trying to help her understand i knew we never should have trusted that slimy two timing bastard lily said suddenly vicious and hateful there no time for that now lily james said grabbing her by the shoulders to get her full attention somehow he knows about the prophesy and he decided it not neville he wants harry but why i dontunderstand lily whispered suddenly scared and fear taking over he wants to kill my son but he just an innocent little baby why i dontknow lily flower he said taking her into his arms quickly but you ve got to be strong right now you ve got to get him away from here lily he pulled back and looked at her you understand lily he coming here now so you need to take harry and leave lily nodded you cantapparate to hogwarts but it the safest place to go dumbledore knows what going on he ll understand sirius is coming he ll follow you to make sure you stay safe take harry and apparate to platform 9 and 3 4 then use my broom and fly to hogwarts as fast as you james you know i cantfly well without you lily stammered suddenly nervous and near hysterics and while carrying harry i cantgo fast james i you have to lily if you want to save harry life then you have to lily looked over at the baby happily teething on the pocket watch again she breathed in a deep breath determination filling her yes of course i ll go downstairs and stall you take harry and get out of here yes lily said but she didntmove she looked up at james fear and tears evident in her eyes james couldntleave her like this not when everything was so unsure he took her in his arms and kissed her lovingly but quickly then he pulled her into a hug not daring to believe what might shortly take place i love you lily flower he told her his own voice failing him dontever forget how much i love you i love you too james she said holding him closer for one more moment i love you so much then he suddenly pushed her away go get some clothes together lily ran to a chest of drawers and began throwing clothes into a bag as james moved to the crib and picked up his son his strong happy son harry james potter he held the baby close to his chest and harry tiny arms went naturally around his father neck i love you little harry james whispered not bothering to wipe the tears from his face how i love you my son suddenly there was a sound downstairs that made lily give a little scream the front door had been burst open he here james said firmly he lay harry gently back in his crib and covered him with a blanket lily get out of here then he ran from the room with wand in hand locking the door behind him ah cozy little house isntit wormtail said lord voldemort as he entered the potter house wormtail he looked back to see wormtail standing outside the front door shuddering in fear tears on his face ah boy you are such a coward he said with pity shaking his head at the young man get out of my house you monstrous bastard came a voice from the stairs they both turned to see the very angry face of james potter storming down the stairs you defile my house with your twisted wickedness andyou dare to threaten my family i swear you will not live to see the light of another day by my hand you will die james said in a blind rage pulling out his wand voldemort simply laughed ah james potter what am i to do with you how ever did you handle this reckless young man wormtail may you burn in hell you treacherous rat james hissed viciously james how could i peter began oh come now cantwe all just get along voldemort interrupted with a wicked smile that sent shivers down james spine because you re here to kill my son james whispered indeed i am voldemort nodded you re not killing anyone here tonight james said firmly oh but i am young potter voldemort said raising his wand slowly simply starting with you james did not know fear at that moment he only knew that peace would soon come avada kedavra a thin red light shot out of voldemort wand it hit james directly in the heart killing him instantly laying on the floor lay the dead body of james potter up the stairs now wormtail was voldemort quick order swiftly moving up towards and up the stairs the confused boy that stood in the doorway was peter pettigrew and he had tears streaming down his face as he looked at the lifeless body of her best friend please my lord isntthere any other way are you backing out wormtail just when you have proven yourself to me voldemort said never my lord he whimpered all right then up the stairs my boy the night is young he smiled wickedly as he blew down each bedroom door until he found the one that held what he wanted ah lily marie he nodded towards her solemnly come wormtail the task is at hand may you die a thousand deaths for your betrayal she spat at peter as she stood in front of the crib where harry lay now now must we result to name calling voldemort tsked her that what potter did and now he dead lily felt her heart stop for a moment at the thought hopelessness and a wave of tears overcame her sobs shaking her shoulders why must you resort to murder she cried please not my son leave harry alone take me i the one you wanted oh but you see now i dontneed you anymore lily marie now i need only kill my one threat your son so just hand him over and no harm will come to you voldemort said holding out a hand if you want him you ll have to go through me first lily said with venomous eyes see i hoped you wouldntsay that but let just get this done and over with lily watched with large eyes as he lifted his wand awaiting the blow of death avada kedavra lily petite body fell to the ground now lifeless and cold and peters whimpers could no longer be controlled lily i so sorry shut your mouth you damned boy voldemort shouted you should be proud you re among the few chosen to be by my side but my friends i was their secret keeper i betrayed them sobs overcame peter as he nearly collapsed to the floor realization finally sinking in oh what have i done he muttered get out of here wormtail you re no use to me right now i ll deal with you later the dark lord hissed peter still consumed with regret and misery disappeared from the room with a pop voldemort turned and stared devilishly at a little crib where a baby boy with messy black hair and emerald green eyes was peeking over his blanket with a smile now it is your turn to die little harry potter aeternus prohibeo latin for eternal preservation epilogue to follow epilogue remus lupin was sitting on the front porch of the potter house on that early morning of november 1st the sun had not yet risen but it soon would yet there would be no warmth never again 12 muggles dead sirius would have known better he would have been more cautious he should have known better than to expose the muggles to no he told himself firmly obviously sirius didntcare about anything anymore not muggles not peter nothing only serving voldemort the bastard it was a hard thing to swallow for remus that his best friend former best friend was a two timer a traitor a murderer he swallowed the emotion in his throat feeling a new surge of tears wishing they would disappear he refused to wipe the tears trailing down his cheeks it didntmatter nothing mattered anymore there was no more happiness only pain mystery and the forever unanswered question of why remus suddenly felt a hand on his shoulder and he closed his eyes he didntneed to see who it was he already knew the only person left that would dare set foot in the house after what had just happened why did this happen dumbledore he whispered staring unwaveringly at nothing why did my friends have to die why did sirius betray them why did voldemort kill them why i afraid i donthave all the answers remus said the wise old man taking a seat next to remus on the front steps but if there one thing i do know it that i dontthink that things are truly the way they appear what the hell is that supposed to mean remus shouted sirius was the secret keeper and he ratted them out to voldemort that bloody traitor sold them out to the devil himself and now my best friends are dead he was supposedly our friend dumbledore someone we could count on and trust but he kills james lily and peter remus voice broke as he spoke poor innocent peter he was probably defending james and sirius no doubt ripped him apart wiping angrily at the tears on his face he softened his voice now tell me dumbledore how could anything that clear be misunderstood the secrets of what truly happened here tonight go either to the grave or to azkaban neither place i d go willingly perhaps with time our questions will one day be answered dumbledore said remus sighed and nodded where harry with lily sister petunia lily sister was a muggle remus commented indeed dumbledore nodded remus nodded in agreement best place for him i d say for the time being anyway someday he ll come back to face he wizarding world but not today dumbledore said softly as he stood and prepared to leave dumbledore remus said and the headmaster paused where voldemort dumbledore slowly turned and looked at him solemnly do you hear all the noise in the streets remus all the rejoicing and cheering those are the people that believe lord voldemort has been defeated by harry potter who will go down in history as the boy who lived but you dontbelieve he gone for good what happened in that room remus i cannot say voldemort plan obviously backfired marking harry instead of killing him my best guess would be he is weakened near to death being nursed back to health by any remaining loyal death eaters but yes i believe some day he will return is someone watching over harry remus asked with concern i have two people currently on privet drive that will constantly be on the watch for harry potter and what about all this remus asked waving his hands around to mean the house what about lily and james belongings their house their money their money is in a gringotts safe to which my assistant hagrid has the key you may salvage what you wish of their belongings but the house will be demolished before sunrise i ll be here most of the night in the hollow helping the ministry cleaning erasing memories moving all the important things from the hollow to somewhere more secure within the ministry remus stood and shook dumbledore hand very well thank you dumbledore good night remus he began walking aimlessly through the house as dumbledore made his way down the street remus still found it hard to believe his two best friends had been murdered mere hours before in the very house he was walking in he occasionally picked up a picture or a treasured belonging that he would someday like to return to young harry james gryffindor sweater that remus had gotten him for christmas someday harry would fit it the invisibility cloak that had served as such a valuable commodity at school and as he made his way upstairs he found the pocket watch that james had given him even though the top room of the house was in complete shambles the pocket watch remained unmarred no scratches no dints just bight and shiny like the day it was bought remus stuck it in his pocket with every intention of someday returning it to james son harry potter with a loud sigh and a heavy heart remus threw a bag of belongings over his shoulder walked out of the house towards the sunrise he was alone lily and james were dead peter was dead sirius was in azkaban he was a lonely marauder walking back into the world

really don t chapter eight lily was sitting at the gryffindor table with nancy and jenny waiting for breakfast when the marauders walked by sirius remus and peter walked by without a word and nancy smirked at sirius backside then suddenly lily felt a tap on her left shoulder she turned to look but there was no one there good morning lily flower said a voice from the other side lily had a smirk on her face as she turned to face him hello potter she said so i was thinking better be careful there prongs sirius shouted as they waited for their leader to catch up james smiled then turned back to lily maybe after dinner you want to meet me in the library for some quality study time neither lily nor james noticed that all the people sitting at the gryffindor table suddenly fell totally silent nancy and jenny were looking at their friend in utter shock and the three marauders were staring at james with bugging eyes everyone unable to believe what they had heard sure why not lily said great see you then he said with a smile then turned to go sit at the end of the table walking right past his three friends who stood gawking at him then followed him wordlessly lily saw this and gave an amused smile before turning back to her friends only to find them staring at her with wide eyes what lily asked what was that all about since when have you and james potter ever had a civilized conversation jenny asked quality study time nancy asked oh it not as bad as it sounds we ve just reached an agreement lily said shrugging her shoulders yeah right nancy said with a sly grin then she suddenly started looking around the great hall where malfoy i need to ask him if hell has frozen over yet james sirius remus and peter were all gathered together at the gryffindor table finishing their dinner when lily marched up you about ready potter she asked looking directly at him sure i guess he said sighing dramatically all right then go grab your potions book and meet me in the west wing of the library there not going to be a lot of people in that area so we ll be alone and there wontbe any interruptions we ll have some quality study time she said with a smirkish grin quoting with her fingers then she turned on her heel and headed for the library um okay peter said with a confused look on his face mate if i didntknow any better i d assume that she was setting up a make out session sirius with a serious look on his face then i d better not keep her waiting james said rushing off as all four of them burst out into laughter so how about those wimbourne wasps james said sneaking up behind her honestly potter cantyou stay focused on one thing for more than a few seconds she said bitterly yes ma am he said smiling as he folded his arms across his chest leaning back in his chair dontget snippy potter let just get started one hour later wow it not a big deal potter you can learn all that in a potions class he asked incredulously when you pay attention yes wow he said again lily just laughed so when is our next potions exam well probably at the end of this month right before halloween ooooh that means you get to spend every nite this month studying potions with me arentyou excited his voice echoing in the empty library thrilled she said sarcastically now you get to sleep that helps the brain to remember things we ll go over more of this tomorrow yes ma am he said standing up and giving her a mock salute he walked around the bookshelves and lily silently laughed after a few moments james stuck his head around the corner good night my lily flower he said sweetly she looked up at him smiled and shrugged her shoulders g nite potter so how was your quality study time prongs said sirius the next morning at breakfast winking at his two other friends good said james with a smile we got a lot of studying done did you study every curve on her body sirius said trying to stifle a laugh while peter and remus snickered silently sorry boys i dontkiss and tell then he took a big bite of his eggs the other three stopped laughing no way sirius said you didn t remus said tell us about it then peter said now it was james turn to laugh my good friends padfoot moony and wormtail you must learn not to believe everything you hear even and especially if it from your old pal prongs he said with a wicked grin the three of them relaxed i just learned a bunch of stuff about potions i mean real stuff did you know that if you mix asphodel and wormwood make a really powerful sleeping potion cantsay that i did sirius said skeptically you know a lot of our pranks would have been a lot better had we known about these kinds of potions james said well i knew that but you only learn thing when you listen remus said knocking on sirius head ay lay off moony sirius said shoving him away you donthave to give us all a hard time just because you re the second in the bloody class okay gentlemen enough talk let go play some quidditch all right they all shouted in unison anything to get my mind off of lily james thought and over here we have a trophy for head master dippett said lily in an authoritative voice she and james were giving the first year gryffindor students a tour of the trophy room he received it when he was awarded 1st class in the order of merlin this is boring said one little girl yeah we want to play quidditch said a little boy do you now said james with a grin all right then as gryffindor head capitan i announce the first ever junior quidditch practice everyone run to your rooms grab your brooms and meet miss evans and i in the north courtyard all the children cheered and ran out the door potter lily said angrily smacking him on the arm we re supposed to be giving them a tour of the school lighten up lily flower he said defensively rubbing his arm with a smile they ve been through a bunch of boring classes all day they need a break lily shook her head and turned around sighing in frustration she suddenly felt him wrap his arms around her waist now that we re alone he whispered in her ear her heart leapt at being so close to him and her ear tingled from his soft breath but she easily brushed those feelings aside potter she said quickly pulled away she couldnthelp the rosy color that rose to her cheeks and the smile that she couldntwipe from her face come on lily you know you want to go out with me lily smirked never in a million years she said though a little voice in the back of her head told her differently well you cantblame a guy for trying james said with a goofy grin as he shrugged his shoulders how many times she asked he laughed and then quietly looked around as they walked towards the door to leave you want to know something lily flower he grabbed her hand to slow her pace and it sent a thrill through lily so she pulled it away what she asked someday he said wistfully someday i going to have a trophy in here oh really she asked for doing what he looked at her with a wide smile and took her hand again for winning the quidditch cup of course now come on i ve got to go teach these kids how to play quidditch then he pulled her out the door and down the hall she ran with him laughing until she yanked her hand away again she shook her head as she watched him run out to the courtyard and slowly followed however as she rubbed her ear she couldntdismiss the butterflies in her

the castle gryffindor being the loudest as they made their way to the common room james eyes were darting around constantly searching for the lovely flower but she was nowhere to be found where was lily a n okay there we go a nice long chapter anyone wanna take a venture as to where lily might be i want to know what you guys think snickers and no spoilers in the reviews please huggles disclaimer it called fan fiction for a reason i rest my case chapter nine lily was in fact sitting in the library aimlessly turning pages of the most recent edition of witch weekly there was small twinge of disappointment that james had forgotten about her and their study meeting but that was easily overcome by anger how he ever put social events and sporting events before his studies she would never understand why suddenly the library doors burst open sweat glistening on his forehead and still wearing his quidditch uniform james was breathing heavily in the doorway lily looked up in surprise hmmm she thought he blew off the victory party to come see me lily shook herself from her thoughts and gave a forced smile nice of you to show potter she said looking at the clock then turning back to her magazine better late than never lily i am so sorry he said solemnly walking slowly towards her i forgot that today was one of our study days with the game and all but i remembered when i couldntfind you anywhere i so sorry i late lily looked up at him and suddenly she couldntbe mad at him his excuse was acceptable even though she knew that he would be late anyway and he had apologized not to mention he looked so damn good in his quidditch uniform stop it lily she told herself can we still do the study time he asked solemnly she sighed sure come sit down potter she said pulling out the chair beside her and putting the magazine aside thanks lily you re the best he said then as he took his seat beside her he kissed her on top of the head lily cursed her pulse for increasing in speed as she said yeah i know now let get busy after only a week of these study sessions things were beginning to click in james mind he was starting to understand it potions he was looking at the things lily was pointing out in the book and telling him about then as he was looking over her shoulder he turned and looked at her she was so smart more so then he anyways smart witty and beautiful he was looking at lily taking in her presence once a girl admired from afar now a woman he admired openly she had grown and matured in grace and beauty and he adores her beyond all reason checking to make sure that she was caught up in teaching him he leaned closer closed his eyes and relished their closeness lily carried a scent about her that drove james wild it sent his pulse to the moon and his mind would spin that was the reason he always called her lily flower not only her delicate beauty but also the scent of her was more endearing as any flower he took an unnoticeable intake of breath from her hair and let his emotions settle the magic the power this girl had over him was incredible her eyes were such a deep green it was so easy to get lost in them her skin such a creamy porcelain color it made him ponder on its smoothness her beautiful berry colored lips it drove him to his knees lily evans made him proud of his self control because he often felt a physical resistance to take her in his arms and satisfy his curiosities of her kiss of its own accord james hand started twisting a strand of her thick red hair around his finger and he nearly fell out of his chair when she whirled around what are you doing she demanded nothing listening to you he said innocently dropping her hair she raised one eyebrow at him seriously tell me more about this polyjuice potion it will turn you into anything the drinker of the polyjuice potion she said skeptically can temporarily transform himself into the physical form of another so if i drank that stuff i could turn into nancy and then interrogate you to find out how you really feel about me he said as she started packing up her books lily smirked well yes you could but you d be wasting your time i ll tell you openly how i feel about you he stood grinning arrogantly yeah whatever you know you want to go out with me james said leaning in inches away from her face pfff she said backing away from him for such close proximity with james potter was indeed unnerving maybe in another dimension then she brushed past him with a smile hmmm you re making this very difficult lily i dontknow much about traveling through dimensions but if i can find a place where i can have the attentions of lily evans my life will be complete lily fought the blush that rose to her cheeks and tried to stifle a laugh oh quit sucking up potter she said then before she knew what had happened he had gathered her in his arms and pulled her close her heart was beating madly in her chest and she tried to pull away but when she looked up to his caring smile and warm eyes she didntwant to pull away anymore james was looking down at her with a smile his heart was racing and his admiration for lily was written openly on his face he watched as the fear on her face suddenly softened and he grew hopeful how about he said quietly you take two of these sleep on it and call me in the morning then he leaned in to kiss her ugh potter lily said peeling away from him at lightning speed i would never accept a kiss from you let alone two then she turned to leave but paused and smiled besides you re not my doctor oh come on it not like i have cooties or something he called after her good night potter she said with a laugh in her voice as she headed towards the library door sweet dreams lily flower he said before she left the room james just gathered his books and laughed at himself he felt kinda foolish but maybe he was a fool oh his nerve lily thought as she changed out of her robes lily was trying to be mad at james for attempting to kiss her but all she could so was smile why would he do that well besides the fact that he openly adored her but he knew she hated him well he might ve moved up a tad on the enemy list but he was nowhere near the kissing list still she just couldntforget the way her heart had leapt when he had pulled her to him the way she enjoyed being in his arms the way he had looked so deeply into her eyes lily shook her head as she curled up into bed forget it lily she told herself she sighed and closed her eyes with a smile on her face that she just couldnterase lily went to sleep happy a n posting another chapter quickly
